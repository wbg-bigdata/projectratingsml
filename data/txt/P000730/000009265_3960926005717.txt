PORLT ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. CREDIT 1676-ET
PROJECT COMPLETDON REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion report (PCR) for the Port Engineering
and Construction Project in Ethiopia, for which Credit 1676-ET in the amount of
US$5.5 million was approved on April 1, 1986.  The project was completed in
January 1991. The disbursements were extended a little further into 1991 because
of extension of the closing date till March 31, 1991.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the Africa r.egional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and
III) and the Borrower, (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in September 1990, and is based, inter alia,
on the supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ETHIOPIA
PORT ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1676-ET)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.        The project was designed to be of limited scope and to address
the most urgent problems in the Port of Assab following devastating drought
in 1985. This was the fLrst Bank group financed project in subsector. It
was aimed at providing a modest increase in the port capacity and in
carring out preparatory work for the major port expansion (now carried out
under the Transport Project).
2.        The Project was successfully carried out and it fulfilled its
objectives laid out at appraisal (para. 5). Although small in size, the
project encompassed a variety of component ranging from civil works and
procurment of equipment to studies and overseas training of local staff
(para.6).
Imlementation Esperience
3.        In the absence of an Apr-- .sal Report (para.10) no project
implementation schedule was origin.lly prepared. The construction of tug
berth and procurement of cargo handling equipment was carried out without
major difficulties. However, mainly due to lack of MTA experience in the
Bank group procurement procedures caused certain delays in the execution of
some project components.
4.        The project covered all the components as envisaged at
appraisal. It is relevant to note that during its implementation there was
close coordination and communication between the Government and IDA.
Ministry of Transport and Communications and MTA were fully committed to
successful implemantaiuoon of the project.
Results
S.        The quality of the civil works (tug berth construction) was very
good. It is estimated that with the tug berth additional capacity of about
200,000 tons (annually) was created in the port which had been badly
congested for years. Also, procurement of cargo handling and workshop
equipment will contribute to improve efficiency of the port operations.
6.        The studies carried out under the project were highly needed, in
particular the engineering studies for extension of Assab Port and cost
accounting and tariff study. The costs of the project components were
within the original estimates. Minor savings in the Credit funds (due to
higher value of SDR vis-a-vis US Dollar) were achleved; they were used for
procurement of needed additional vehicles (Part III, Annex 3).

Sustainabilit,
7.        The project was consistent with priorities set for the sector by
the Government and agreed by IDA. It was wvll justified and is likely to
maintain the level of anticipated benefits throughout its economic life.
Actually economic rate of return in the PCR is higher than estimated at
appraisal (para 15).
Findingst and Lessons Learned
8.        The success of the project was achieved mainly due to the full
coitment of the borrower i.e. of the agency (HTA) responsible for project
impl_emnation. Lack of familiarity with Bank's procedures on the part of
MTh created some delays in the processing of the project. A procurement
workshop in Ethiopia (carried out by IDA staff) was found to be useful.
Namely, following IDA initiative, the Government agreed and a procurement
workshop took place in November 1990.

A. BackKround
1.       Ethiopia has been relying on imports to sustain its rapidly
growing population. Increasing production for export is one of key
elements in the Government economic strategy. However, higher level of
economic activity expected particularly in agriculture will be impeded
unless there is an improvement in transport services. The transport
infrastructure with congested ports and shortages of trucks has been
inadequate to cope with the growing demand. The transport corridor Addis
Ababa - Assab, including the port of Assab, the backbone of the country's
transport system deserves priority as it is essential to Ethiopia's
economy, since efficiency of its operations has major impact on the cost of
imports and on the pricing of exports. In recent years, the corridor has
been handling over 0S of total Ethiopian's external trade.
2.       The inadequacy of the transport sector became evident during the
droughts in 1985 and 1987. The large increase in food imports put an
enormous strain to the country's transport capabilities, in particular on
the port of Assab and trucking industry. Ships laid at anchor for days
waiting to get into the port which has been operating at capacity around
the clock. In September 1990, well after the major flow of incoming aid
cargo is over, the port of Assab was still struggling with a backlog cargo
of about 200,000 tons. It should be noted, however, that the backlog was
created partly by insufficient capacity of the trucking industry which was
unable to increase off-take from the port.
3.       The Bank is pursuing a lending program in Ethiopia consisting of
investment projects which alleviate poverty and enhance long term growth
capabilities through human resource and physical infrastructure
development.  The transport sactor has been an important .mponent of this
program because of its central role in facilitating the economic activities
of the country.



4.       After the completion of the National Ports Stutdy in 1982 (funded
by the Governm2nt), the Bank Group has had continuous dialogue with
Ministry of Transport and Comunications (MTC) and Marine Transport
Authority (MTA) on possible Bank Group involvement in aessisting the "core"
development of Ethiopia's port subsector. Originally, the Bank Group
involvement was planned for Phase II (construction of Larths 13 and 14) of
the port development. However, in view of the Government's shortage of
foreign exchange to complete Phase I (tug berth) aftd particularly because
of the urgency of the need to quickly reduce the congestion ut Assab port,
the Government and the IDA agreed in 1985 to an urgent port project which
was named Port Engineering and Construction Credit.
B. Project Objectives and Description
5.       The project was designed to be of limited scope and to address
most urgent issues in the port of Assab -- country's principal deep water
port. As the first Bank Group financed project in the subsector, the
project was to improve the capacity of the port of Assab through the
construction of a new berth and procurement of equipment for the port, thus
increasing throughput capacity to handle the traffic. Thus, the project
provided modest increase in port capacity (annually about 200,000 tons over
total 1.4 million tons for dry cargo) without a major investment in marine
civil works. At the same time, it carried out the preparatory work and
detailed engineering for Phase II, involving a major port expansion which
is included under the Transport Project (1989). In addition, the project
addressed certain deficiencies in MTA staffing, training, cost accounting
and tariffs.
6.       The Port Engineering and Construction Project included the
following components:
(i)   site investigation and detailed engineering for the construction
of two berths including the necessary dredging and land
reclamation under the Phase II development of Assab port;
(ii)   studies to update the economic and the financial analysis for
the Phase II development;
(iii)   the construction of the tug berth to provide the needed berth
facilities for tugs and coastguard and thus liberate the
existing berth No. 8 for general cargo traffic;
(iv)   the procurement of urgently needed port handling equipment;
(v)   the procurement of port workshop equipment for the newly
constructed port equipment and crane workshops;
(vi)   a study of MTA's manpower development to identify development
and training needs of MTA staff (to be addressed under the
recently approved Transport Project;
(vii)   a cost accounting and tariff study to introduce cost accounting
systems to the MTA to be followed by introduction of a tariff
system that is cost related; and



- 3 
(viii)   priority training fur the MTA staff, particularly in port
accounting and finances, port planning and workshop technology.
C.  Proiect Design and Organization
7.       Due to the urgency caused by inflow of drought relief cargo (para.
2), the project was swiftly prepared and five months after appraisal
mission departure it was approved by the Bank's Board. The project was
designed to address only urgent matters in the port of Assab and in MTA and
to pave the way to a major project in the sector (Transport Project was
approved by the Bank in April 1989). Therefore, the project was intended
to be of a limited scope and size; only the President's Report was produced
(No. P-4218-ET of March 1986).
8.       The project was well prepared in spite of the urgency under which
it was put together. MTA, the sole .gency in charge of its implementation,
was well organized and staffed and provided full surpor! il. the project
preparation, design and in subsequent implementation. MTA was fully
,.ommitted to carry out the project in such a way as to make it a full
success.
D. Project Implementation
9.       MTA was responsible for the implementation of the Project.  It was
assisted by consultants for the procurement, supervision of civil works for
tug berth construction, and for the various studies carried out -- detailed
engineering for berth 13 and 14, economic and financial analysis, cost
accounting and manpower development of MTA.
10.      In absence of an Appraisal Report (para. 7), no project
implementation schedule was originally prepared. The President's Report
stated, however, that the project was expected to be completed by June 30,
1988. The project was mainly completed on schedule except construction of
the tug berth (completed in April 1989), procurement of a few vehicles and
training of MTA staff abroad (completed in January 1991). Due to some
delays in shipment of vehicles and computer equipment the Credit closing
date was extended until March 31, 1991.
11.      All the project components were successfully completed and within
the cost estimates including contingencies. Those information on
implementation of specific project components is given in Part III of the
Report. No major issues were encountered during the project
implementation.
E. Proiect Results
12.      The Project was successful and it achieved its objectives.  The
construction of 7 v tug berth 74 meter long with a quay depth of 4.5 m was
completed by e    iril 1989; it will be used for berthing tug boats and
small marine craits, thus releasing the existing berth No. 8 for general
cargo use. The quality of civil works was very good. It is estimated that
additional capacity of about 200,000 tons will be created in already badly
congested port. Procurement of cargo handling and workshop equipment was
highly needed to alleviate shortage of equipment in the port. It will



undoubtedly improve cargo handling and increase efficiency of the port
operations.
13.      Site investigation and detailed enginieering for berths 13 and 14
including tender documents were completed in December 1987 and October 1988
respectively. They paved the way for a major and highly needed port
project -- extension of the Assab port, which was included in the recently
approved Transport Project.
14.      All the three studies achieved their respective specific
objectives and there were no changes of objectives during implementation.
The three studies have significant impact on the resource allocation,
operation and development activities of MTA and beyond in several ways. In
particular, the existing manpower management and training policies of MTA
are expected to be affected by the recommendations of the manpower
development and training study; changes are expected in port tariff and
costing policies of MTA as a result of the adoption of the new cost
accounting and tariff systems in FY1990t91. It should be noted that the
tariff revision was not completed on time; some additional resources were
required and they provided by EIB (under separate arrangement). Training
of MTA staff abroad was carried out successfully and as planned; about 15
of RTA staff are participating in the training. The disbursements from the
credit were slower than projected at appraisal. Although in FY89 the
disbursements were catching up, the availability of some uncommitted fund
caused MTA to seek extension of the Closing date. The Credit Closing date
was extended three times, i.e. until March 31, 1991, i.e. cumulatively 21
months beyond original date.
F.  Economic Re- ,--a,1uation
15.      The Project, labeled at appraisal as an emergency one, was well
justified yielding an overall economic rate of return of 30Z which exceeds
the one at appraisal of 23Z. More about economic impact of the project is
in Part III (pages 13 - 14).
C. Proiect Sustainability
16.      Implementation of the Port Project was fully corsistent with MTA
and the Government priorities and objectives set for the port subsector.
Moreover, the Project was considered both by the Government and IDA to be
an urgent one. The latest drought in 1987 and transport difficulties which
emerged thereafter -- in the course of transport of additional cargo (food
relief aid) confirmed the necessity for assistance to the port of Assab.
The project was, however, of limited scope to address only part of the
needs.
17.      The outcome/results of Manpower Development Study and Cost
Accounting and Tariff Study could be maintained for a period of time until
they would require further updating or revision. The level of
technological progress, the pattern of trade and to some extent change in
Government policies may affect the future impact of these studies. If
these studies were not implemented fully or substantially, the risk that
may follow is great. Namely, it could result in possible HTA financial



- 3 -
losses, resource mismanagement and other inefficiencies that would
seriously threaten the competitive position of Ethiopian ports.
H. IDA Performance
18.      IDA has quickly reacted to urgent needs of the port subsector
(later followed in a more comprehensive way in the Transport Project) and
with MTC and MTA full support prepared the project in a rather short time;
it took only seven months between the Project Brief and Board presentation.
Since the project was IDA's first operations involving MTA, IDA staff
provided necessary assistance to MTA in explaining and guiding MTA staff in
order to ensure smooth implementation of the project. Due to staff
constraints, however, supervision missions were not always made on regular
basis, e.g. no formal supervision mission took place between November 1987
and January 1989. Nevertheless, when IDA staff made field visits to
Ethiopia under different transport mission assignments, direct cortact with
the project and the executing agency was maintained.
I. Borrower Performance
19.      MTA and MTC were fully cnmmitted to successful implementation of
the project. Adequate resources were assigned to the project executing and
even attention was given to all project items. MTA was actively involved
in assessing consultants work; formal comments made on consultants reports
were substantive and helpful in improving the consultant's output.
20.      With regard to procurement it was observed, however, that lack of
familiarity with details of the Bank guidelines caused some delays in the
project processing (e.g., procurement of cargo handling and workshop
equipment). This in turn caused the first extension of the Credit closing
date. It was considered that a procurement workshop in Ethiopia (not only
for MTA staff) assisted by IDA procurement specialists would be helpful in
eliminating this shortcoming. The workshop was successfully carried out in
November 1990. It should also be noted that. reevaluation of HTA assets
was not carried out on time since there was a change/delay in follow up
work on the cost accounting study. The borrower has been also late in
providing to IDA audited MTA accounts for PY's 88 and 89 due to
shortcomings of Audit Services Corporation (ASC).
J. IDA/Borrower Relationships
21.      The success of the project is also due to productive and smooth
relationships which existed continuously between HTC, MTA and IDA from the
project preparation throughout the end of the project implementation. It
is expected that this relationship will continue under the Transport
Project (1989).
K. Consulting Services
22.      A number of different contractors and consultants were engaged
during the project execution. Overall, their performance was good in some
cases very good. Major studies were carried out: (i) detailed engineering
of Assab port extension; (ii) MTA manpower development; and (iii) MTA cost



accounting -- all of them will have an important and long standing effect
on the port and HTA operations. With one exception (see Part III), there
were no disputes between the borrower and contractors/consultants.
L. Project Documentation and Data
23.      The PCR was prepared from data contained in the project files,
information provided by MTA and the Government in general during IDA
cupervision missions and from a brief paper on the project implementation
prepared by MTA.



PART I1: Main Findings and Lessons Learned
(prepared by Borrower)
A. Comments on Proiect Imolementation
1.       The factual information contained in Part III of this Report is
adequate and accurate. The analysis and statements contained in Part I
too, reflect what actually happened from the project preparation up to the
end of the implementation process.
B. Overall View
2.       The roles and responsibility of the firms, their study teams and
counterpart staff and departments responsible for each sub-project were
clearly defined in the terms of reference, supplementary information for
consultants and contract documents under which they had to operate, we
believe, that the consultants have clearly understood their respective
responsibilities before the commencement-of their studies without which the
success of the projects would have been hampered. In order to facilitate
the smooth functioning of the consultants and see to it that they are doing
their job in accordance with the terms of reference agreed upon, MTA
organized the following committees: (a) Policy Committee; (b) Executive
committee; and (c) Professional Counterpart Staff. The duties and
responsibilities of these Committees have been clearly stated in the
Project Organization document submitted to the Bank together with the
organizational structure set up for this purpose. Such an organization and
delegation of responsibilities benefited not only HTA but also the firms
involved for it facilitated easy access to correct information and to make
timely corrections of mistakes or misunderstandings that might arise in the
process of the studies. It is believed that this aspect of project
organization and concise nature of project design contributed most to the
success of these studies. The maximum care taken in the selection of
consultants and the good will and enthusiasm of most of the consultants
invited are also very wignificant.
3.       In order to make these studies meet their respective ends, each
project was separately initiated and its conceptual foundation was clearly
laid down in the basic documents prepared and submitted to the Bank for its
consideration. In the meantime, all the concerned parties discussed and
clearly understood the objective, scope and merit of each project so that
they can participate more effectively in the study process.
4.       The project concept can be estimated to be partly innovative and
it is strongly believed that the scope and scale of these projects are
relevant in the light oi their objectives. Their timing, too, are very
appropriate when viewed from the on going urgent drive to modernize the
Ethiopian Ports through rational allocation of highly meager resource3.
5.       With regard to project implementation, we believe that due to the
timely monitoring of the works done, as indicated abovo, there were no
critical variance between what is planned and actual project performances.
The project risks were correctly identified and realistically calibrated,
though not stated in the projects documents in financial terms. No actions



- 8 -
or decisions that affect the normal functioning at the implementation
process were taken either by the Bank or MTA.
C. IDA Performance
6.       With regard to the Bank performance, we could see no weakness from
the beginning up to the end of the project's implementation. Their helping
ideas and suggestions right from project identification through completion
of the project preparations were very impressive. The constructive
criticiom, if there were any, during the appraisal and supervision process
helped to improve the quality of the work at hand and contributed a great
deal to the success of these studies.
7.       The Bank's performance during the evaluation and implementation of
the Projects were exceptionally good as far as HTA is concerned. The
timely supervision and constructive advice given by the Bank's staff during
the implementation periods of each of the projects concerned has led to the
successful completion of the projects. Without. mutual understanding based
on the appreciation of the problems and ispiration of the borrower,
satisfactory results cannot be guaranteed. By upholding these rat'.onal
factors, we believe the Bank did play ant exemplary role during the
implementation of these projects and we trust that such a relation will
continue in its future similar operations.
S.       Close monitoring of the project performance and prompt and timely
reply to the inquiries of the beneficiary are the main lessons of
experJence that may be relevant to other Bank-financed projects.
D. Borrower Perspective of its Performance
9.       As far as NTA is concerned, we believe that its performance during
the evolution and implementation of the project was up to standard. In its
capacity as a borrower and beneficiary of the fund allocated to it MTA was
mare than anything concerned about the outcome of these studies. From our
past expe..ience, we learned that proper organization and close monitoring
of the works of the consultants right from the beginning to the end of
implementation of the project was very important. To this end, MTA paid
serious attention to the capability of the firms and qualification and
ability of the consultants, selected by adapting a rather strict criteria.
It made sure that the consultants got the correct information they
required by assigning able and experienced counterpart staff and by making
all relevant sources of information open to them. By doing this, HTA not
only closely worked with the consultants involved but also seriously
scrutinized their approaches wherever necessary with the objective to
arriving at fr,itful and realistic results.  This means that the
consultants were not left in the dark in their endeavor of analyzing the
existing system of operation, they were free to express their findings
whether negative or positive as far as it contributed towards the
resolution of existing problems. Our staff learned a great deal from the
consultants involved in working together during the study period.
10.      MTA strongly believes that such an approach together with the
Bank's cooperation helped the final outcome of our projects which turned
out to be a success. In this regards, our good and effective relationship



with the Bank during the evolution and implementation of the projects
deserve to be maintained.
11.      As indicated above, we have set up various levels of committees
and have assigned professional counterparts who worked closely with the
various consultants and experts. This, we think, has contributed to the
timely completion of the project.
E. Proiect Relationshin
12.      A good working relationship and mutual understanding existed
between HTA and the Bank at all stages of the project implementation
process. This in turn helped to facilLtate not only the timely start and
completion of the projects, but also the normal functioning of the
consultants involved and prompt resolution of procedural errors. MTA and
the Bank had similar good relatton with other relevant parties involved in
these projects.
P. Consulting Services
13.      The consultants involved played a major role each in their
respective areas of discipline in studying the existing system and
suggesting valuable ideas. Mantion must be made of the consultants
deployed by the following firms classified in terms of their seniority
rather than their performances
--Bertlin and Partners Consulting Engineers
Peat Marwick McLintock Management Consultants
RPT Economic Studies Group
Ocean Hackenzie Limited
MTA is indebted to these consultants for their highly valuable and
realistic approach to the problems of MTA.

Final project costs are USS 9.52 million or about 11.8Z higher
than originally estimated at appraisal. The modest cost increase in
foreign exchange is covered by higher US dollar equivalent of the credit
amount approved in SDR (5.0 million). The local costs funded by MTA are
about US$ 130,000 equivalent higher than originally estimated; however, HTA
being a financially sound authority had no difficulties to meet the minor
cost increase. The claims by Afcons has been settled amicably and the
final payment has increased the construction costs as anticipated.

Notes  The economic reevaluation of the major project components was done
in 1989 prices.



- 14 -
In economic reevaluation, it was taken that newly available berth
No. 8 (liberated by the constructed tug berth) will handle about 65
ships/year up to 2,500 dwt each. Reduced ship waiting time is expected (as
at the appraisal) to be the main benefit. Over 20-year economic life,
savings of five days per ship were assumed; benefits in ship queuing time
were modestly estimated at USS 2,500 per day (502 of $ 5,000 estimated ship
value time per day). Taking the final construction costs and the cost of
consultants' services the ERR is 30.8?
Economic rate of return for cargo and workshop equipment was
recalculated takings (i) 8-year economic life; (ii) about 302 of increase
in productivity in cargo handling in the port was assumed to be attributed
to the new equipment; (iii) modest savings (one-fifth of the equipment
affected) in equipment repair costs were also included. Overall return for
the project is about 302 as compared to the President's Report of 23?.

Comment: No financial rate of return was originally cal(.?lated for the
project. However, HTA financed performance during the project
implementation was very good and annual returns on its net fixed
assets in FY's 87, 88 and 89 were 42?, 412 and 362. That aexceeded
the minimum of 10? set in the Project Agreement.
