MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR AN URBAN RESTRUCTURING AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Zambia for SDR 21.3 million, the er 'valent of
US$33.0 million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, including 10 years of
grace, to help finance an urban restructuring and water supply project. About US$25 million of
the credit will be made available as grants to local governments and local communities.
NORAD will provide approximately $11.2 million toward project costs, for training and
technical assistance related to the water and sanitation rehabilitation component.
2.    Country/Sector Background. At Independence in 1964, Zambia was one of the most
prosperous countries in Africa. Since then, however, deteriorating copper prices combined with
inappropriate government policies and actions, have resulted in deteriorating economic
conditions, as evidenced by GDP growth which fell from 3.7 percent per annum in the early
1970s to an average of only 1.1 percent during the 1974-90 period. To address this decline, the
Govemment of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ), which came to office in 1991, has vigorously
pursued an ambitious national program of economic reform over the past four years under which
it has dismantled nearly all price and exchange rate controls, eliminated import and export
licensing, decontrolled interest rates, lowered and compressed tariff rates and brought inflation
down to manageable levels. Comprehensive programs of parastatal privatization and civil
service reform have been initiated. However, while reform efforts are proceeding in all sectors
of the Zambian economy, several common constraints impede these efforts: the accumulation,
over more than two decades, of extensive, inappropriate policies and regulations; deteriorating
capacity of existing investments to support economic activities; and limited human and financial
resources.
3.    The production and export of copper led to the expansion of the urban economy and
corresponding high levels of rural-urban migration during the 1960s and 1970s. Outmigration
has not occurred as the urban economy has declined since then, although urban growth rates,
now a function of natural growth, have slowed from 5.8 percent per annum between 1969 and
1990 to 3.7 percent per annum for the period between 1980 and 1990. The 1990 census recorded
42 percent of the total population, 3.27 million, as living in urban areas, which makes Zamnbia
the third most urbanized country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over 60 percent live along the line of
rail which connects Livingstone in the South with Ndola in the northern Copperbelt region. By
the year 2000, there will be more than five million Zambians living in urban areas.
4.    The development of urban infrastructure, however, has not reflected the profile of the
urban population but has stemmed from two assumptions, made by the then-planning authorities,
related to the copper-based economy. At the center was that the permanent urban dwellers
would be an economic elite that would both want and be able to pay for a high level of urban
infrastructure services. The corresponding assumption, that most of the Zambia population



2
would remain rural, meant that legal tenure and the provision of housing or amenities for a large
percentage of residents has not been a priority. The resulting urban infrastructural investments
have been costly and overly sophisticated, and ainmcd exclusively at serving the formal urban
sector. Currently, at least 60 percent of city dwellers occupy informal settlements in and around
the country's significant urban centers, with limited or no access to sources of potable water,
sanitary means of solid and human waste disposal, and basic health and educational services.
5.    Since 1989 local government capital investments have decreased by almost 80 percent in
real terms in the 12 municipalities for which data are available. Where investments have taken
place the focus has tended to be on building new infrastructure rather than on rehabilitation and
maintenance. The decline in water supply maintenance and investment since Independence has
been particularly severe, to the point where many urban water and sewerage systems are on the
verge of collapse. This decline in services has had an adverse impact on all sectors, including
investment in the private sector. However, the impact has been most severe for the urban poor,
which account for about 40 percent of the urban population. At the household level, one of the
most glaring outcomes of the decay in urban infrastructure is the prevalence of waterbome
diseases such as cholera, which has been recorded in 1 1 urban centers in recent years.
6.    GRZ!s primary policy initiative in the urban sector has focused on devolution of
responsibility and authority to local govemments. Through the 1991 Local Government Act
(LGA), GRZ substantially increased the administrative and financial autonomy of the country's
22 city and municipal governments. While the Ministry of Local Government and Housing
(MLGH) retains important, and possibly conflicting, regulatory functions under the LGA, the
main responsibility for planning and implementing urban development now rests with Zambia's
local governments. Central government transfers of domestic revenues to local governments
have virtually ceased, despite concurrent expenditures by local government on providing
infrastructure and services to central government.
7.    Policy, regulatory and institutional rationalization has also extended to Government's
approach to the water sector. In 1994, the Cabinet formally accepted a set of sector principles
related to the reorganization of the sector, which include, inter alia, separation of water resource
management from water supply and sanitation, devolution of authority to local authorities and
the private sector, full cost recovery in the long run, and increased GRZ priority and budget
spending to the sector. This statement of sectoral principles was followed in December 1994 by
the passing of a Cabinet Memorandum which clarified the organizational structure and
respective roles of the different public entities involved and, in particular, of the Ministry of
Energy and Water Development (MEWD) and of MLGH; the passing of this memorandum was
a condition for second tranche release under the Economic and Social Adjustnent Credit
(Cr.2577-ZA). The National Water and Sanitation Council within MEWD (NWASCO, formerly
the Project Coordination Unit) will monitor and regulate water supply and sanitation service
delivery and the organizations providing tbese services. MLGH is responsible for all executive
functions related to water supply and sanitation and for providing assistance to councils in their
water and sanitation delivery functions through the recently established Department of
Infrastructure and Support Services (DISS). GRZ also underscored support for a commercially
oriented approach to the provision of water services by agreeing to feasibility studies and pilot
programs for establishing commercially oriented water supply and sanitation utilities in the
Copperbelt and Northwestern Province to represent urban and rural conditions, with the former
to be supported under this project.

8.    Project Objectives. The objectives of the project are to: (i) provide immediate
solutions to the most scvere water and sewerage infrastructure deficiencies in nine key urban
areas; (ii) test out community-generated and managed water and sanitation demonstration
projects which meet articulated needs at an affordable price; (iii) strengthen urban councils'
capacities to support community-based initiatives in Lusaka and the participating Copperbelt
councils; and (iv) based on lessons learmed, initiate broader institutional and financial reforms
required for providing organizational incentives for investing in, operating and maintaining
infrastructure based on residents' perceived needs and willingness to pay. The project wiil use
water supply as an entry point for developing future investment programs, initially concentrating
on rehabilitation, in formal settlement areas and developing new and innovative institutional
options in peri-urban, unserviced areas. Both activities focus on a demand-based approach, and
as such, seek to break the persistent cycle of non-payment and inadequate service provision.
9.    Project Description. The project includes three components: (i) water supply and
sanitation system rehabilitation in nine city, municipal and district councils (US$28.3 million or
67 percent of project base cost); (ii) community-based water and sanitation demonstration
projects in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka and the Copperbelt (US$5.6 million or 13 percent of
project base cost); and (iii) sectoral and local government reform and capacity building (US$8.2
million or 20 percent of project base cost). The latter addresses water supply and sanitation
issues as well as overall municipal management. With respect to water supply and sanitation, the
component includes the study of water system management options, which will result in
proposals for commercially-oriented water supply and sanitation utilities (para 7), and water
sector policy studies designed to integrate urban water management with national and regional
strategies. With respect to municipal management, the component provides immediate local
government capacity strengthening with particular emphasis on financial management, and
strengthening of municipal planning, management and capital programming in the medium term.
10.   The local government reform and capacity building will be carried out ir. all 10 project
cities, municipalities and districts, including the Copperbelt councils of Ndola, Luanshya, Kitwe,
Kalulushi. Mufulira and Chingola and the councils of Lusaka, Kafue, Mazabuka, and
Livingstone in the south. Lusaka will not be included in the rehabilitation component of the
project due to significant investment committed by other donors. Only the Copperbelt councils
and Lusaka will initially participate in the demonstration component; expansion of this
component will be considered in the course of the mid-term review, based on lessons learned in
the initial subprojects. Together, the 10 councils proposed for participation in the project serve
more than 3.5 million people comprising more than 80 percent of Zambia's current urban
population. A summary of project costs and financing plan is provided in Schedule A.
Procurement arrangements and the disbursements schedule are summarized in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing steps and the status of Bank group operations in Zambia are
provided in Schedules C and D respectively. Staff appraisal report No. 13853-ZA and Map
IBRD No. 26587 are attached.
11.   Project Implementation. The design of the project ensures that project implementation
will be carried out at the level of government closest to the ultimate beneficiary. Accordingly,
local governments will be responsible for implementing the rehabilitation component and local
communities will be responsible for developing subprojects and implementing them in
collaboration with the councils. At the national level, DISS within MLGH will have overall
responsibility for managing the project and channeling project funds to local authorities. (In
addition, DISS will be responsible for implementation of the feeder roads component of the



4
ongoing IDA Transport Engineering and Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2515-ZA)). As it is
recognized that all the levels of agencies involved in project implementation require
strengthening in technical, financial and management capabilities, programs of training and
technical assistance have been included. Irn dddition, a small technical assistance allocation has
been included for short-term consultancy support in procurement, accounting and auditing
related to management of the project.
12.   Given  the fundamental requirement for building  management capacity within
participating councils and MLGH, adequate consultation must take place consistently throughout
the implementation period. A project launch workshop will be held within two months of
effectiveness, during which implementation plans will be discussed and reviewed. Structured
reviews will be periodically undertaken to formalize key decisions regarding infrastructure
design, planning, and policy and institutional reforms. A monitoring and evaluation system will
be developed as part of the irnplementat'on plan. About one year after effectiveness, a policy
seminar will be held at which agreements will be reached on key issues, including tariffs and
institutional structures, proposals for which will have been developed in the course of
implementing under the project the local government financial capacity strengthening technical
assistance and the management options study. The mid-termn review of the project will
incorporate distinct evaluation of councils' performance against established benchmarks and
detailed reviews of progress will be undertaken for each project council and for other councils
that may be included in future urban investment programs. On this basis, an action plan for a
broader package of assistance will be established leading to. in the third year of implementation,
initial preparation of appropriate new investments.
13.   Project Sustainability. Sustainability in the Zambian urban sector has historically been
hampered by central government subsidy policies that have undercut incentives for efficient
local government management and private investment, and propagated a culture of nonpayment.
A key factor in sustainability of rehabilitation investments will be the development and
implementation of user fees that reflect the costs of providing water services. Changes to the
user fee structure will be accompanied by consumer education campaigns which set out the
actual costs of service provision and the relationship of these costs to fees charged. In addition,
commercialization of water and sewerage operations will be encouraged; already, all of the
project cities are exploring opportunities for commercialization and this project will provide the
means for local governments to assess options and receive required technical assistance and
training to establish successful commercial operations. At the level of the community, previous
experience and the difficult economic conditions that are expected to prevail among the urban
poor during the project implementation period, indicate that sustainability of demonstration
project investments will derive mainly from community-based managernent of installed
improvements.  Creation of management capacity at the community level will require
coordination with NGOs and reorientation of local government structures and human resources
to a supportive, rather than prescriptive, role. Recovery of capital costs will, in most cases, be
achieved indirectly through rates.
14.   A final Lcy to achieving broader sustainability will be educational efforts with local
politicians and community leaders. The need to achieve sustainable operations is supported
within most of the local government civil service, but the concept of cost recovery is not well
established in political circles or at the community level. A significant element of technical
assistance and training to be provided under the project will address this core issue.

15.   Lessons Learned from  Previous IDA Involvement.  T!ic Bank's experience in
Zambia's urban and water sectors has 'Jeen limited, comprising one urban project from the mid-
1970s and one rural water supply project that inclided several smaller cities in the 1980s.
Neither project achieved significant sustainable rLsulls. due in part to: (i) the projects' reliance
oii weak institutions at central, municipal ard community levels: (ii) adoption of non-
participatory plarning processes, resulting in infrastructure and levels of service that did not
reflect residents' preferences; (iii) reliance on community groups for operation and maintenance
even though they had not been consulted during design and implementation; and (iv) confusion
over who was responsible for what, which in turn exacerbated low cost recovery. The project,
with its institution-building and consultative approach to the planning, design and maintenance
of iwater supply and sanitation, has been designed to avoid the mistakes of the past.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement and Links with Country Assistance Strategy. The
objective of the Bank's country assistance strategy (last discussed in conjunction with the
Economic and Social Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2577-ZA), March 1994) is to assist GRZ in its
efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Key elements of this
strategy are to (a) improve the enabling environment for private sector growth through
investments in infrastructure and human resources; (b) decentralize and restructure the delivery
of infrastructure and services to enhance efficiency and sustainability; and (c) rem ve subsidies
and encourage private sector participation in the provision of public services. T1ais project is
consistent with the country assistance strategy and will help to remove constraints to economic
growth and diversification by addressing issues of public service reform with particular emphasis
on devolution of responsibility to local levels, adoption of demand-based approaches to
infrastructure planning and implementation, creation of commercially-oriented water and
sanitation utilities, improvements to revenue-generation and cost recovery for municipal services
overall, and development of human resources.
17.   The range and complexity of problems facing urban areas clearly point to the need for
integrated and appropriate urban and water policy frameworks that will not only guide the
transition from subsidized infrastructure and devolution of service delivery from the central
government to local entities, but also address appropriate directions for the medium and longer
terrm. Given the fragmentation of efforts to date, IDA is well placed to assist GRZ in the
development of an integrated approach involving the establishment of an appropriate policy
framework, rehabilitation of essential urban services, and improvements in urban efficiency as
well as managerial and financial capacity. IDA's involvement in a range of related sectors
(roads, health services, education, poverty alleviation) will be key in playing this integrating
role. The project further builds upon and facilitates implementation of the overall policy
framework for water supply and sanitation, the development of which was supported by the
Economic and Social Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2577-ZA). By beginning to address the needs of
urban residents who currently fall outside the forrnal structure, the project will help to improve
the level and sustainability of services to the poor.
18.   Agreed Actions. Conditions of Credit effectiveness include staffing of key positions for
the DISS, completion of the Project Implementation Plan, completion of all conditions of
effectiveness related to the effectiveness of the NORAD Grant Agreement and signing of
subsidiary agreements between Government and at least two participating local councils. Before
any disbursements are made to a given local government, a subsidiary agreement will have to be
signed between the central and local government in question. Under this agreement, local
authorities will be required to agree, as part of the subsidiary legal agreement, that they will
protect dwellings and structures within community compounds and informal settlements from



6
demolition, unless this demolition is required to providc essential urban services or for reasons
of health and safety. Any such demolition would bc subjcct to prior review by IDA and would
be conducted in line with IDA resettlement policies. Councils must further be prepared to
revise/eliminate regulations that preclude legalizing the status of many communities.
19.   Poverty Category.  The project meets the criteria for the program  of targeted
interventions (PTI), as the demonstration projects and a portion of the study components are
specifically directed to helping the urban poor. These components comprise more than 25
percent of the IDA credit amount.
20.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been rated category B. Environmental
analyses during preparation concluded that the overall environmental impact of project
investments will be positive. The urgent measures being supported by the project are designed
to restore community access to clean water and adequate sanitation. Negative impacts, if any,
will be mitigated and managed during project design and implementation. Environmental
concerns are addressed in all three components of the project: first, while implementing the
remedial measures, as an essential component of design and construction contracts; second,
while implementing the demonstration component, through the consultative processes in which
peri-urban communities define their local environmental priorities; and third, as an integral part
of the process of participatory planning recommended under the capacity building component of
the project.
21.   Program Objective Categories. The project supports IDA's anti-poverty strategy by
financing the equitable provision of basic urban infrastructure, which in turn will improve the
urban environment and well being of households. The impact on the urban poor will manifest
itself in terms of access to potable water supply and improved sanitation. All civil works
interventions will be assessed in terms of their impact on the environment to ensure that
rehabilitation is environmentally sustainable.  The reform  of central/local govemment
relationships and the development of a rational intergovernmental fiscal framework will have a
beneficial effect on economic management in the form of reduced drain on central resources and
the enhanced contribution of local revenues for operations and maintenance.
22.   Participatory Approach. The project has been designed and developed with the
objective of maximizing the involvement of implementors and beneficiaries at all stages; in
addition, the project design recognizes the weak implementation and management capabilities of
the implementors and beneficiaries and therefore provides technical assistance and training
aimed at developing these capabilities. The initial rehabilitation component for water and
sanitation focuses on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure which is of an emergency nature.
All subsequent investment in water supply and sanitation will be based on mutual agreement and
understanding between water providers and water users as to the costs of different levels of
service; this will require an increased awareness of user preferences, which is being built into the
technical assistance and training that will begin in the early stages of the project. The concept of
the coinmunity based subprojects stemmed from discussions with potential users in several
communities in Zambia, and subprojects put forward for financing will have to be generated at
the community level, by members of the community who will have also committed to carry out
the implementation. As noted previously, while it is important to the success of the project to
ensure the involvement of beneficiaries in the design and implementation, it is essential that the
beneficiaries be fully capable of performing that implementation. For that reason, project
beneficiaries and implementors will participate in training and technical assistance aimed at



7
raisinLg technical, management and financial skills to the lcvcls required by the project. The
project has also recognized that electcd local government officials are kcy to thlc sustainable
success of the project. For this reason, their input and support has becii sought and received
during project design during regional workshops on the project.
23.    Project Benefits. With over 60 percent Of the courtry's urban population classified as
poor or very poor, one of the fundamental objectives of this project is to ensure that constraints
upon the majority population's participalion in the urban economy are removed. In the near
term, emphasis will be placed on addressing basic service deficiencies whiicih sap the
productivity of the poor through disease and inordinate labor investments in meeting basic needs.
In the medium term, the project will support broad improvements in urban management leading
to increased economic opportunities for the urban poor population. Primary among these
improvements will be regularization of tenure in informal settlements providing an asset base
from which low income households can invest with security. Promotion of community
participation in consultative processes will help to redress imbalances in resource allocation and
expedite mobilization of sustainable self-help solutions to constraints on productivity. The
project will seek to maximize coordination with other projects, such as the IDA-assisted Social
Recovery Project (Cr. 2273-ZA), and with NGOs that are supporting development of micro-
enterprises and other economic opportunities among the urban poor. Finally, construction
financed under the project will be designed to maximize labor intensity to the extent feasible.
24.    Risks. The key risk to successful project implementation is the limited capacity of local
govemments and communities to identify, plan, implement and sustain urban infrastructure
investments. In view of this, initial investments have been kept to .Lie minimum requirement.
With respect to policy, encouragement of local autonomy is essential, but the capacity to
establish sustainable growth cannot simply be legislated. Required reforns are both broad and
detailed, ranging from virtual creation of land markets to installation of functional budgeting
procedures. While the willingness of key actors to address these fundamental challenges is both
apparent and encouraging, both strengthening of capacity and a reorientation in approach are
required. The project tackles these issues directly through studies and training packages that
specifically address the appropriate skills ard institutional arrangements. including an enhanced
role for the private sector, for the provision of infrastructure and services. Given the complexity
of issues, annual reviews will be held in which key benchmarks will be reviewed and achievable
targets set for the coming year. This will ensure a focused but flexible approach to the reform
process.
25.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposedl credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the credit.
