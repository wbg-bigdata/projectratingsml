MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the State of Rio Grande do Sul for US$100.0 equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.  The loan would help finance
municipal investments in the State.
2.          Background   The rates of urban population growth and household
formation in Brazil were very high during the 19709 (4.4Z and 5.7Z respectively,
per annum).  Although this trend has peaked, over the 1986-95 period urban
households are still projected to increase by 3.71 per annum to a total of 32.7
million by 1995, or almost twice the 1980 total.   Rio Grande do Sul's own
urbanization trend was similar to that of Brazil as a whole (4.0? p.a. for
population and 5.71 p.a. for households during 1970-1980), and projection show
an annual rate of urban household formation of 4.01 over the 1986-95 period,
generating 0.7 million additional households by 1995, equivalent to nearlv a half
of today's total in the State.
3.          Meeting the growing demand for urban services will be the major
sector challenge for Brazil in the forthcoming decade. In common with the other
states in the south of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul has also seen increased
migr-stion from the poorer states of the Northeast, add to the State's internal
population growth. The dramatic increase in urban poverty caused by the
combination of rapid urban growth and the slowing down of the national economy
makes the task ahead very difficult. In 1985, the proportion of the total
population with incomes below the poverty line (defined as less than five minimum
salaries per family) in the metropolitan regicn of Porto Alegre, the capital of
Rio Grande do Sul, was 22.52 (up from 9.4Z in 1981), and deficits of basic urban
infrastructure and services, mainly affecting the urban poor, are high in Rio
Grande do Sul.   In 1985, 27.12 of urban households in the State had only
rudimentary sanitary facilities; more than one fifth burned, buried or discarded
their garbage in vacant lots or in drainage systems.   Hospital and other
hazardous wastes are not always separated from regular garbage. Even for water
supply, where the efforts of the public sector have been greatest, more than
179,000 households (11.9Z of the total) in 1984 had no piped water to their
dwellings and had to draw water from public standpipes, wells or rivers.
4.          Municipalities gained considerable responsibilities for planning and
administering urban development with the new Constitution, promulgated on October
5, 1988.  These responsibilities include provision of such services as basic
sanitation, water supply, primarv and secondary education and health care.
Municipalities may either operate -hese services themselves or delegate them to
a higher level of government (as was done for water and sewerage under the
National Sanitation Plan, or PLANASA). At the same time, municipalities have
been given greater financial resources to pay for these services, through direct



2
taxation and increased revenue sharlng. It has been estimated that the fiscal
arrangements provided for under the new Constitution will increase the revenues
of Rio Grsand do Sul': municipalities by between 301 and 402 in real terms, with
much of the gain being made in the next two years ae the reform takes effect.
Municipalities will rely on State sector agencies for guidance in carrying out
these responsibilities. The state development bank (BADISUL) will be in the
principal executing agency for the state government's program aimed at
introducing reform in urban development pollcy-the "Programa Integrado de
Melhoria Social (PDMES). BADESUL is a competent agency with previous experience
in the kind of work called for under the project, but nevertheless has undergone
some institutional reorganization and strengthening because of the importance
the State Government attaches to PDMES.  With the reduction of many Federal
poverty programs, aseistance to the poor in basic sanitation, housing and urban
transportation will increasingly be implemented by sub-national (State and
municipal) governments, making it posslble to introduce redistribution policies
and strategies at this level and reverse the tendency to subsidize higher income
groups noted in previous Bank studies.
5.          The main sector issues are tot (a) develop and implement a coherent,
sustainable program to improve overall urban sector policies through an
integrated approach with the municipality as the primary agent for local economic
and urban development; (b) continue to address sector constraints in basic
services affecting the urban poor including sanitation, low-income housing and
urban transportation; and (c) deal with serious environmental problems.  The
program to accomplish this shoulds (a) increase mobilization of local resources;
(b) improve the efficiency of resource allocation; (c) strengthen the
institutions dealing with rapid urbanization; (d) improve targeting of benefits
to low-income populations; and (e) contribute to reducing fiscal deficits.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement  The Bank's assistance strategy to
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth
and social development in a context of macro-economic stability, with an emphasis
on efficient resource allocation and administration in the public sector, and
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. The proposed
project is fully consistent with these longer-term development goals, in its
targeting  of  economically  efficient  investments  to  mainly  low-income
beneficiaries. Through its participation, the Bank would help to strengthen the
institutional capacities of the municipalities, and promote investment planning
on the basis of sound financial policy, at this critical point of their increased
responsibilities and resources. The Bank's previous experience in the sector,
in particular with the Medium Sized Cities Project (Ln 1720-BR), and on-going
projects, such as the Paran6 Market Towns Project (Loan 2343-BR) and the Santa
Catarina Project (Loan 2623-BR), has reinforced the importance of the Bank's
support in policy formulation, in project design and Implementation. This
approach was first consolidated in the Municipal Development Project in the State
of Parant (PEDU Ln 3100-BR) which was prepared jointly with this Project and
approved on June 22, 1989.
7.          Proiect Obiectives  The goal of this project is to increase the
general capacity of municipalities to effectively issume their increased
responsibilities under Brazil's new Constitution, thereby enabling them to
efficiently utilize the large concurrent increase in resources, and strengthen



3
administrative capabilities, after nearly twenty years of relative neglect. The
specific objectives are to: (a) increase institutional capacities to plan,
finance and execute cost effective projects and programs, through appropriate
policy reforms; (b) improve coordination of urban development, environmental
policy and investment decisions at the State and municipal levels; (c) target
project benefits to low-income populations; and (d) strengthen the State's newly
created Urban Development Fund (FUNDOPIMES) as a reliable source of financing.
The project objectives would be achieved through support of a state-wide progrem
in Rio Grande do Sul-"Programa Integrado de Melhoria Social" (PIMES).
8.          Project Description  The project consists nf two components:  Part
One - Institutional and Human Resource Development would comprise about 102 of
total costs, and would include technical assistance, training and equipment for:
(i) municipalities, the State Water Company (CORSAN), and autonomous water
companies (MWC's) to strengthen their financial management and overall
administration;   (ii) BADESUL and selected state sector agencies, to improve
their institutional capacity for project management and appraisal of participants
and sub-projects;  and  (iii)   state and municipal  training and technical
assistance agencies which provide assistance in the areas of municipal management
and urban development, and environmental control.  Part Two - Infrastructure
Investments would represent about 90? of total project costs, and would include
water supply and basic sanitation, street paving and lighting, drainage and
erosion control, solid and toxic waste management, community facilities (health
posts, day care centers and school building extensions), and other eligible sub-
projects including a pilot project for low income self-help house construction.
About 47X of the total project costs would be incurred for investments which
directly contribute to containing environmental damage resulting from
uncontrolled urban growth, and to minimizing further deterioration through better
planning and improved resource management.
9.          Eligible participants (those meeting agreed affordability criteria)
would have access to sub-loans for infrastructure investments, services and
equipment, from an urban development fund (FUNDOPIMES), managed by a special
Project Unit in the State Development Bank (BADESUL).   Eligible municipal
participants would be selected by BADESUL according to established limits on
revenues and debt-servicing capacity, and commitment to improve their finances
and administration.   Sub-project eligibility criteria,  including low cost
technical design standards and location in low-income areas, would be set out
in detail in an Operation Manual. Each participant would undergo a financial
and institutional analysis by BADkSUL, which would establish a credit limit and
also define the minimum content for an institutional development package to be
implemented by the participant. The principal element of this package would be
the participant's Financial Action Plan (PGAF), aimed at improving its financial
soundness by increasing revenues and reducing current expenditures.   The
appraisal of this PGAF by BADESUL would lead to an agreed program of technical
assistance and training, under Part I of this project, in order to meet the
established financial targets. All participants will be required to participate
in Part  I of the project.   Those participants  demonstrating to BADESUL
satisfactory financial and institutional capacity would be eligible for sub-
loans to finance investments under Part II.  Based upon experience under the
PRAM project, about 90X of the municipalities can be expected to participate
eventually in the program, althn"gh efforts will concentrate upon 252 of them



4
during the first 18 monbhs of the program.  Financing of Part I would include
a partial grant element for technical assistance and training; for Part II. grant
funding would be targeted exclusively for community facilities (day-care centers,
primary schools and health centers in low income communities, with partial grants
for specific sub-projects focused on environmental amelioration, such as water
pollution control, erosion control and toxic waste managemen;.  The a priori
requirement of demon'trated financial and managerial performan.e improvement
would stimulate competition for limited funds among participants, an essential
feature of this project. About 320 municipalities plus CORSAN and six autonomous
municipal water companies would be eligible to participate in PIMES. Under the
proposed loan, policies and conditions for CORSAN and the autonomous water
companies would be consistent with those of other Bank water sector operations.
10.         The project, to be carried out over five years. provides funds for
equipment, civil works and consultant services. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$227.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$56.2 million equivalent (252). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursem.rt
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events,
and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map (IBRD 21579), and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7714-
BR, dated October 3, 1989, is also attached.
11.         Actions Agreed Upon  It has been agreed that: (a) the project would
be carried out in accordance with the Operation Manuals; (b) a special 'Task
Force" to develop housing sub-projects, with functions and staff satisfactory
to the Bank, would be set up and maintained in the Secretaria do Trabalho e Acao
Social e Communitaria (STASC-RS), and that by December 31, 1990, STASC and
BADESUL would have completed a management study of COHAB-RS, to improve and
expand programs for low income nousing in the State; (c) the eligibility criteria
for Participants and Sub-borrowers, for selection of beneficiaries of housing
loans, and for the selection of Sub-projects, would be satisfactory to the Bank;
(d) the Borrower would by December 31, 1990 contribute at least the equivalent
of US$21 million to FUNDOPIMES; (e) the Borrower would maintain a Board of
Directors for FUNDOPIMES in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (f) BADESUL would
staff and maintain the Project Unit in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (g)
BADESUL will ensure efficient project supervision through the use of independent
consultants to carry out performance audits; (h) BADESUL would complete an
interim review by September 30, 1991 of the performance of the pilot housing sub-
component; (i) by November 30, 1989 BADESUL would furnish to the Bank a set of
financial, economic, technical, environmental and social indicators, satisfactory
to the Bank; (j) by October 31 of each year, the State and BADESUL will carry
out jointly with the Bank a yearly review of: (i) the borrowing capacity and
creditworthiness of all eligible Sub-borrowers, (ii) resource allocation,
including grants and sub-loans, ander PIMES by region, type of municipalities,
and nature of investments, (iii) indicators of fiscal, financial and cost
recovery performance of the Sub-borrowers; and (iv) the status of the
Institutional Development Component; (v) on an annual exchange of views with the
Bank on the adequacy of the financial terms of the Sub-loans; (k) FUNDOPIMES'Sub-
loan terms would be 5, 10 and 15 years including one year grace with variable
real interest at least three percentage points above the cost of borrowing to
help cover exchange risks and pay administrative fees; and (1) the criteria for



5
allocation or grants would be satisfactory to the Bank, and the total annual
amount allocated for grants would not exceed 15Z of the total allocated for Sub-
loans for that year.
12.          Specifically for CORSAN and the autonomous municipal water companies
(MWC's), agreement was reached: (a) that there would be compliance with the
National Tariff Law, for CORSAN, and that operational receipts cover the total
cost of operations; (b) that required administrative and legal actions be taken
by December 31, of each year to adjust all accounts receivable for inflation;
(c) that CORSAN maintain a debt/equity ratio no greater than 65z35 for FY 1990,
and 60:40 thereafter; (d) that CORSAN's debt service coverage not fall below
1.5; (e) that marginal cost pricing studies be completed by June 30, 1990, and
marginal cost pricing be implemented within twelve montus; (f) that each company
complete a study of its asset value by December 31, 1990 and to carry out
revaluation updates on a triennial basis; (g) that five year financial
projections be submitted annually to the Bank, and that departures of more than
102 from the agreed targets would only be made in consultation with BADESUL and
the Bank; (h) that financial and operating monitoring indicators and levels as
agreed would be included as conditions of water companies' participat'Lon
agreements and sub-loan agreements with BADESUL;
13.         Conditions of Loan Disbursement_  The following stub-projects would
be subject to a prior satisfactory review by the Bank of an appraisal of the
technical, financial, economic, Institutional wid environmental aspects : (a)
any sub-project costing in excess of US$3 million; (b) the Rio dos Sinos Basin
Pollution Control sub-project, and all major regional environmental sub-projects,
such as toxic or solid waste management for a sub-region; (c) each of the first
five pilot housing sub-projects; and (d) any sub-projects involving relocation.
For projects noted in (d), another condition of disbursement will be the
submission of a satisfactory resettlement plan, its approval by the Bank, and
the Sub-borrower's acceptance that execution of the resettlement plan is a
legally binding commitment.
14.         Conditions for Effectiveness: The following conditions would be mets
(a) the execution of the BADESUL Agreement with the State; (b) the execution of
the Financial Agency Agreement with the State on behalf of BADESUL and the State
Commercial Bank (BANRISUL); (cJ that BADESUL's Project Unit has been established
and adequately staffed; (d) that the Task Force to develop low-cost housing Sub-
projects has been established in the STASC; and (e) that the State has made a
contribution of at least US$7.0 million equivalent to FUNDOPIMES.
15.         Benefits  The improved capacity of the State of Rio Grande do Sul
and its municipalities to mobilize and allocate local resources, coupled with
overall improved fiscal policies and management, will ensure the sustainability
of investments, provide a timely response to the new responsibilities given to
local governments by the recently approved Constitution, and also directly
contribute towards meeting objectives of increased public sector efficiency and
lower deficits. The project emphasizes improving the living standards of the
urban poor, rather than those of higher income groups as has happened in the
past. The weighted average rate of return of quantifiable benefits is estimated
to be 19.9Z.  Additional unquantifiable benefits are derived from the large
number of project components which directly contribute to reduction of



6
environmental damage caused by uncontrolled urban growth, rAnd inadequate waste
management.
16.         Risks   There are two specific riskes   (a) a possible lack of
financial capacity on the part of the State Government, and hence the political
will and credibility to insist on, and pursue policies relating to the
conditional access to credit and cost recevery (rather .han maintaining the
"status quo" and a reliance on state revenue transfers); and (b) difficulties
inherent in coordination, given the large number of participants. Sub-project
and participant eligibility criteria, secure guarantee through receipts and sales
tax commitments, and agreed policies for full cost recovery have been designed
to minimize the former. In addition, the enthusiasm shown and results achieved
by both State and municipal governments, in spite of a very difficult external
environment, ensure strong political commitment to project objectives.
Considerable attention has been placed on defining the institutional arrangements
for the PIMES program before project inception, including that of centraliz:ng
key activities within BADESUL. The organization, principles and procedures for
implementing the project will have been set out for the use of all participants
in a pre-approved Operation Manual, which should reduce the risk of problems
resulting from the lack of communication and coordination.   Because of the
straightforward nature of the technical assistance, training and civil works
involved, there are few technical risks to the project.
17.         Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
