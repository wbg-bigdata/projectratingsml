MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SCIENCE EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES
COMPUTERIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent
of US$50 million to help finance a project for science education and libraries
computerization. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        Aacground. Korea's rapid industrialization over the last three
decades has been characterized by a continuous shift towards higher value-
*        added, technology-intensive production and the expansion of export markets for
these products. Underlying this process has been a strong commitment to the
expansion of R&D activities by both the Government and the private sector.
The Government took the lead in early R&D efforts through the development of a
network of public sector research institutes and through strengthening the
research capacity of the leading universities. At the same time, the
Government decided that the private sector should carry the major
responsibility for R&D and consequently provided an array of financial
incentives to the private sector to encourage greater investment in R&D.
These policies have clearly been successful as seen in the growth of R&D
expenditures which now account for 2.4X of national income, a level close to
those of the advanced industrial economies. The private sector now accounts
for about 70X of total expenditures on R&D.
3.        Fundamental to the success of the growth of R&D was the expansion of
the training of scientists and engineers in the universities. Particular
emphasis was given to expanding graduate programs in recognition of the
rapidly rising technology intensiveness of industry in the 1980s. During
1982-90 enrollments in graduate programs tripled and the output of graduates
increased 4.6 times. Enrollments in undergraduate programs grew rapidly in
the seventies and early eighties but the growth has moderated in recent years
as more emphasis was given to quality improvement. There has been particular
concern about improving the quality of basic science courses because they
serve as the foundation for further studies in science and engineering. Thus,
a strong foundation in basic science programs will transmit its effects
upwards and improve the quality of education for scientists and engineers at
the. higher levels. There is also recognition that developing strong basic
science is the responsibility of the secondary schools as well as the early
years of college. This concern for a strong base was manifested in previous
Bank support for improving science education at the secondary and
undergraduate levels under the second education sector loan (2427-KO), which
was recently completed successfully.
4.        The growth of the universities has been accompanied by a similar
expansion of information requirements to service teaching and research. The
major repositories of such information are the university libraries. The 107
universities and colleges have 159 libraries with a total collection of around
23.5 million items. The collection is increasing at about 102 annually. The
size and growth of the library system calls for automated systems, which at
present are minimal, and the establishment of an automated interlibrary
network to strengthen and integrate cooperative efforts between libraries.



-2-
The Government has a long-term plan to link all the university libraries and
the first stage covering 37 institutions would be assisted under the proposed
project.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The broad aim of the project is to assist in
improving the quality of basic science education and to provide a more
effective flow of information between university libraries which service
teaching and research. More specifically, the project would assist in: (a)
raising the quality of science programs offered in the secondary-level science
education centers and in undergraduate basic science programs in selected
universities in order to strengthen the quality of science arA engineering
degrees; and (b) establishing an interlibrary network linking 37 institutions
to enhance the access to information of students, faculty and researchers.
6.        Project Description.  The project would finance specialized
equipment estimated to cost US$50 million, excluding contingencies. The
project would also finance complementary inputs (US$19.4 million, excluding
contingencies) related to making the equipment operational and maintaining it
thereafter namely, local transportation and installation costs, O&M and
consumables. The project would finance local computer training (US$0.3
million, excluding contingencies) related to the library network. The
proposed loan of US$50 million, to be disbursed over five and a half years,
would finance: (a) modern laboratory equipment compatible with the need to
raise the quality of science education in the secondary-level science
education centers (US$5 million) and in undergraduate science departments
(US$25 million); and (b) computer hardware (US$20 million) for the
establishment of a library network. The loan would finance about 83X of the
estimated foreign exchange cost of the project, or about 611 of total project
costs net of duties and taxes. The Government would finance the complementary
inputs and the computer training. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10190-KO, dated March 20, 1992,
is being distributed separately.
7.        Proet Implementation.  Overall responsibility for project
implementation would lie with the Ministry of Education (MOE) with its
Educational Facilities Bureau (EFB) handling the detailed activities.
Education inputs and related technical advice would be provided by MOE's
Science Education Division (SED) and University Education Office (UEO). The
latter would be assisted by technical advice from the Committee for University
Library Automation (CULA) regarding the library network. Equipument
procurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republ - of Korea in
conjunction with MOE. The project would be implemented over a period of five
years.
8.        Pro1ect Sustainability.  In order to ensure that the equipment to be
financed under the loan is utilized effectively on a sustained basis, project
design specifies the requirements for consumab,le materials and O&M to be
financed by the Government. Long-term sustainability of the computerized
library network would be assisted by the work of the CULA and its associated
working group and expert subcommittees.



9.         Wag=sns from Previous Bank Experience.  The major lesson of
relevance to the design of the project is that a stable and well-qualified
project management staff is essential for successful implementation. A sound
core of project management, experienced in Bank procedures, exists in EFB and
this will be reinforced by technical inputs from the SED, UEO and CUIA.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Improving the quality of basic
science education is directly linked to the quality of scientists and
engineers produced by Korea's universities and colleges. The impact is
cumulative. Improved science education in the secondary schools leads to
higher quality science education in science programs in the early years of
college. This in turn strengthens the quality of science degrees and also
engineering degrees, which are built on a foundation of basic science.  The
proposed project provides the opportunity for the Bank to continue its work in
strengthening basic science education in Korea, introduced under Loan 2427-K0.
the latter also assisted in developing a sound policy framework for science
education within which the proposed project has been designed.
11.       The rapid growth of enrollments in science and engineering programs
and the upgrading of these, accompanied by similar trends in all major tields
of study in Korea's universities, have led to an information explosion which
is beyond the capacity of the present university library system to handle.
Quicker and broader access to information is urgently needed to handle the
rapidly growing demands of students, faculty and researchers. A long-term
plan for the interlinking of university libraries in Korea has been prepared
and the Government has requested the Bank to assist in the implementation of
the first stage. The proposed project, which would finance the supply of
computer hardware, has also provided an opportunity for the Bank to influence
network development. As part of project design, the Bank has provided
expertise to review the adequacy of the first stage plan and also to review
hardware requirements and the appropriateness of associated software. The
Bank has also reviewed network design to ensure that it is technically sound
and that institutional arrangements for long-term network development are
appropriate. The latter include advice on the development of criteria to
monitor progress in long-term network development. Bank supervision of the
project would provide expertise to review regularly the technical and
institutional aspects of network development.
12.       Aggee Actions.  The 5overnment has agreed that:
(a)  the development of practical science courses in the science
education centers and procurement of related equipment, would be in
accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank;
(b) to ensure: (i) that equipment procurement remains focused on
undergraduate science education, maximum unit price would be
US$50,000 for equipment items procured for the undergraduate science
departments; and (ii) that there is no duplication of existing
Txpensive items of equipment, maximum unit price would be US$100,000
for items procured for the joint equipment centers and institutes of
basic science, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank; and
(c) with respect to contracts for mainframe computers, draft bidding
documents including specifications and bid evaluation reports would



- 4 -
be submitted for prior review by the Bank before inviting bids and
awarding contracts respectively.
13.       Benefits.  The project would assist in strengthening science
programs in the secondary schools and universities and this in turn would lead
to higher quality graduates in science and engineering. The long-term result
would be a stronger science and technology infrastructure on which Korea's
future industrialization would be based. The project would also support the
introduction of an innovation in the form of an automated library network
which would improve information flows in the universities thereby increasing
the effectiveness of teaching and research. The technical feasibil' :y of the
network and the arrangements for its long-term implementation, have been
strengthened through technical assistance provided by the Bank during project
preparation.
14.        slsk. The only risk associated with the project relates to the
ability of local authorities to design and implement the library computeriza-
tion component. This is an innovative activity which will require the
utilization and coordination of relevant technical expertise drawn from a
number of institutions. This would be achieved through the operation of an
appropriate policy body (CULA) to handle broad issues, supported by technical
groups to handle detailed design activities.
15.       Rec       ti2n. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
