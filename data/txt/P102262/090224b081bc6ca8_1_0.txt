                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been under implementation since July 1, 2007 and overall implementation progress is Moderately Satisfactory. All activities except for training under Component 2
                         are expected to be completed prior to the original project closing date of July 31, 2013. On Component 1 related to infrastructure, overall implementation progress is Satisfactory.
                         Implementation of all four sub-components forming this operation are on track and all remaining construction works are expected to be completed prior to the project original closing
                         date of July 31, 2013. Current progress of school construction, which accounts for 64% of the total credit, indicates that 18 schools are completed, which is 70% of the 26 schools
                         (total number under this project). All of these 18 schools (12 schools in Pemba and 6 schools in Unguja) are already fully functional. The total enrollments in all 18 schools are 6,880
                         students, equivalent to 81% of enrollment capacity. The construction of remaining 8 schools (30% of 26 schools) will be completed by April 2013. As reflected in the disbursement
                         chart, implementation progress of this operation has picked up significantly in the last two years and has been able to offset the lost time which was caused by extensive delays

                         during the start of the project (the various causes of those early delays are reflected in the earlier ISRs).
                         On Component 2 related to quality enhancing interventions, implementation of all earmarked activities have been completed except two which are ongoing. These two activities
                         include the procurement of remaining textbooks, which is currently at printing stage by the publisher (the delivery expected in July - September, 2013, two months before revised
                         project closing of November 30, 2013); and the training of the last cohort of 1,800 teachers, which will take an additional four months (October 2013) to complete (one month before

                         the revised closing date of November 30, 2013).

                         Over the project implementation period, the Government has made considerable effort in executing the Project efficiently, with the aim of improving value for resources spent. In
                         particular (a) under Component 1 (civil work component), the Government was able to reduce the scope of the original design of the secondary schools which were too extensive.
                         The Government was able to focus on just the core school facilities such as classrooms, laboratories, administration blocks and school utilities, reducing facilities such as hostels
                         (which were deemed not necessary in an small island state); (b) meeting the target of constructing/ rehabilitating 26 (100%) schools with all essential facilities to provide conducive
                         teaching and learning environment in record time and thereby keeping construction costs contained; and (c) the Government (through the on-going final procuring process for
                         textbooks) will be able to procure all textbooks for 1 - 4 grades instead for only the planned 2 grades (5 and 6).

                         Currently about 92% of project implementation timeline has elapsed, while 82% of the US$42 million equivalent credit has been disbursed, with almost 100% committed in various
                         contracts.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Upon Government’s request the project team has completed the restructuring process to: (1) allocate unallocated amount and reallocate savings across categories to finance critical
                         activities that are in need of additional resources; (2) change PDO indicators target values; (3) add a new PDO indicator; and (4) extend the project closing date by four months. The
                         proposed changes will not affect the formulation of the PDO. They will help to consolidate and strengthen various on-going activities across components and categories, complete all
                         planned activities, and meet the PDO as measured by related outcome indicators.

                         A key assumption made during project preparation had created a situation where PDO targets were unrealistically high. Initially, it had been assumed, given the Government's
                         anticipated decision at the time to abolish Form II exams that 100% of students in Form II would transit into Form III. As a result, the targets of (i) students taking the CSEE exams (at
                         the end of Form IV), (ii) passing the CSEE exams, and (iii) passing them with Div. I – III, as reflected by the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) indicator targets, were pitched quite

                         high. Soon after the start of project implementation though, the Government decided not to abolish Form II exams and, instead continue using it as a process to assess student
                         learning. In this situation, the Form II to Form III transition rates, with the bottleneck of Form II exams not being removed, have been less than 60% (but rising slowly), which impacted
                         on all indicator targets related to the end of lower secondary education. Decreased, more realistic target values show better progress rates ( table below provides progress towards
                         PDO achievement).

                         The Government team also suggested adding a new PDO Indicator, to measure lower secondary completion rates, i.e., “The percentage of Certificate of Secondary Education Exam
                         (CSEE) takers divided by the population aged 17 years? (the official graduation age for Form IV). This new indicator was included in order to measures lower secondary completion
                         which is an objective of the project intervention and the indicator (measured as a %) is better able to capture the PDO (completion of lower secondary education). One advantage of
                         this new indicator is that it will allow comparing completion rates over time and with other countries. The baseline value for this indicator was calculated using previous year’s data
                         and projected target values set. The actual values show reasonable progress so far, as reflected in table 13 of AM.

                         Changes to the PDO target values have been proposed for the purpose of setting targets, which are realistic and reflect actual situation in the sector. A new additional indictor was
                         proposed in order to widen the project coverage by capturing wider outcomes in which the project has significantly contributed to its attainment despite not being included in the initial
                         project design. Broadly these changes will contribute favorably to the attainment of overall end targets of the project outcomes.

                         While 3 out of the 4 PDO indicators show reasonably good progress and are likely to be fully met, the absolute number of CSEE Div. I – III passers have actually declined. This
                         decline is consistent with the national trend, which has prompted Government review of the trends. Some extraneous factors such as teachers resistance seem to be affecting the
                         trend downwards, but a full Government report is expected by May end. It is worth noting that CSEE pass rates in Zanzibar are better than the national average. Furthermore, the
                         rates are expected to improve towards targets with project inputs such as improved infrastructure, which is helping to reduce overcrowding. In addition, the Government is keen to
                         pursue incentives and accountability reforms, drawing from recent decisions on these reforms in the mainland.

                         Extension of Project Closing Date by four months, from July 31, 2013 to November 30, 2013. The changes were introduced to allow adequate time to (i) complete procurement
                         processes of remaining textbook and instructional materials for grade 1-4 and (ii) conduct essential teachers training programs.
