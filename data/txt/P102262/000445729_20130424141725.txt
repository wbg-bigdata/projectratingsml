                                     RESTRUCTING PAPER

    A. SUMMARY

This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to introduce four changes
to the Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement Project (the Project) and any
accompanying amendment to the project legal documents, i.e., (1) to allocate unallocated
amount and reallocate saving across categories to finance on-going activities that are in
need of additional resources; (2) to change target values for three Project Development
Objective (PDO) Indicators; (3) to introduce one new PDO indicator; and (4) to extend
the project closing date by four months. The proposed changes are minor and have been
requested by the Government in order to consolidate and complete its various ongoing
activities in view of meeting the PDO.

    B. PROJECT STATUS

1.     Background. The Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement (SDR28.2 million,
US$42 million equivalent) was approved by the Board on April 24, 2007, signed on June
25, 2007 and declared effective on January 29, 2008. The original closing date is July 31,
2013.

2.     PDO. The PDO is ‘to improve completion in lower secondary education (the first
four years) with successful performance among students.’ The original Project design
included three PDO Indicators and ten1 intermediate outcome indicators to monitor
progress towards the PDO. Overall, the PDO remains valid/ relevant and continues to be
achievable, even though a modest extension of project closing date will be needed to
complete all outstanding activities.

3.      Overall, PDO progress has been on track. During the last two years of
implementation, PDO indicators showed increasing divergence with the PDO targets,
prompting the Bank team to downgrade the PDO rating to ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’
and the Government to carefully review the causes. Key assumptions driving the original
targets have been found to be erroneous.

4.      Implementation Progress. The Project has been under implementation since July
1, 2007 and overall implementation progress is Moderately Satisfactory. Most activities
are expected to be completed prior to the project closing date of July 31, 2013. On
Component 1 related to infrastructure, the current progress of school construction is on
track with majority of the schools completed and already fully functional: this includes
the appointment of the heads of schools, teachers, installation of equipment and furniture,
distribution of textbooks. Total enrollment in new schools is currently 6,880. The

1
  The seventh intermediate outcome indicator, ‘textbook/pupil ratio’ is now broken into four outcome
indicators by subjects (Mathematics, Physics, English and Kiswahili).
                                                    4
remaining schools under construction are between 65% - 95% completed. As reflected in
the disbursement chart, implementation progress of this operation has picked up
significantly in the last two years and has been able to offset the lost time which was
caused by extensive delays during the start of the project.

5.       On Component 2, related to quality enhancing interventions, the implementation
of all earmarked activities has been completed except two which are ongoing. These two
activities include the procurement of remaining textbooks, which is currently at contract
signing stage (the delivery may requires extra two months beyond closing date); and the
training of the last cohort of English language, science and mathematics teachers, which
is also expected to be completed four months beyond the project closing date.

6.      Currently about 80% of project implementation timeline has elapsed, while 77%
of the US$42 million equivalent credit has been disbursed. According to the latest figures
from the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT), US$31.08 million of
the credit has been fully paid and by December 31, 2012, after concluding contract for
remaining textbooks, disbursement and commitments is expected to reach 95% of the
credit.

7.     Outcome indicators. Two out of the three original PDO Indicators (the number
of Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE) takers and passers) show
reasonably good progress, driven particularly by good performance amongst females, but
have not achieved the projected targets of the PDO indicators. As a result the lower
secondary completion rate improved from 27 percent in 2007 to 42 percent in 2011.
Zanzibar's secondary completion rate is now similar to other Sub-Saharan African
countries (very close, for example, to Ethiopia's secondary completion rate of 43
percent), while it was much lower before the project was implemented. However, the
third PDO indicator (the number of CSEE passers with Division III+) is off-track: the
number of students passing with Division III+ in fact declined over time. The
Government is investigating this deterioration in exam results at the upper end of the
performance scale since 2009, which has recently also been observed in mainland
Tanzania.
8.      Institutional Arrangements. The Project is coordinated by the Director of
Secondary Education, with technical and operational support provided by her staff
comprising the Project Management Team. The project activities continue to be
implemented as planned by agencies of the MoEVT, notably the Zanzibar Institute of
Education (for the curriculum, textbooks, and girls' science camps), the Office of the
Commissioner of Education (for life skills training), the Department of Teacher
Education, and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Schools (for school leaders training).
Project procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation are carried
out by responsible units of the MoEVT.
9.     Safeguards. There are no changes to the environmental and social safeguards
aspects of the Project. The proposed restructuring of the Project does not require a
revised safeguards management plan, monitoring and reporting requirement.



                                            5
10.     Financial Management. The overall project financial management rating is
‘Satisfactory’. The financial management risk rating assigned to the project remains
‘Moderate’.
11.    Audit. The project audit report for Fiscal Year Ending June 2012 was submitted
to the World Bank six weeks after the deadline. The CAG issued ‘Unqualified’ (clean)
opinion on the financial statement of the project. Currently, the audit is done by the
Office of the Controller and Auditor General (OCAG). The project was required to
implement audit recommendations including refund of ineligible expenditure of TZS.
60,196,300. The Government has taken immediate action in addressing these issues, and
we are informed that TZS 30,000,000 has already been refunded in project account and
the Government has committed to pay the remaining amount by March 31, 2013.

12.     Procurement and Work plan. A revised procurement and work plan based on
proposed changes have already been submitted by the Government and is found to be
satisfactory. Overall, the project procurement processes is rated ‘Satisfactory’.


  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

13.     The proposed modifications for this project restructuring are: (1) to allocate
unallocated amount and reallocate savings across categories to finance critical activities
that are in need of additional resources; (2) to change PDO indicators target values; (3) to
add a new PDO indicator; and (4) to extend the project closing date by four months. The
proposed changes will not affect the formulation of the PDO. They will help to
consolidate and strengthen various on-going activities across components and categories,
complete all planned activities across components and categories before closing, and
meet the PDO as measured by related outcome indicators.

14.     Reallocations. Due to exchange rate gains (SDR vs. US$), the overall project
allocation has increased from initially US$42 million to now US$43.4 million, as per
Client Connection of January 15, 2013. The proposed reallocation will take into account
this increase as well as allocations between categories. (Details see Annex 2, below).

15.     Change in PDO Target Values. A key assumption made during project
preparation had created a situation where PDO targets were unrealistically high. Initially,
it had been assumed, given the Government's anticipated decision at the time to abolish
Form II exams that 100% of students in Form II would transit into Form III. As a result,
the targets of (i) students taking the CSEE exams (at the end of Form IV), (ii) passing the
CSEE exams, and (iii) passing them with Div. I – III, as reflected by the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) indicator targets, were pitched quite high. Soon after the start
of project implementation though, the Government decided not to abolish Form II exams
and, instead continue using it as a process to assess student learning. In this situation, the
Form II to Form III transition rates, with the bottleneck of Form II exams not being
removed, have been less than 60% (but rising slowly), which impacted on all indicator
targets related to the end of lower secondary education. Decreased, more realistic target
values will show better progress rates. The World Bank team, upon suggestion of the
Government, is proposing to revise these targets, in order to allow for an upgrading of the
PDO rating to ‘Moderately Satisfactory’, once formally approved. Proposed changes of
                                              6
new PDO target values are summarized in Table 2 below. Details of revised projection
are summarized in Supplemental Table of Revised Projection below.

PDO Indicators                                                       Original Revised
1) Numbers of pupils, disaggregated by gender, taking the            19,680 13,962
Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE) given at
the end of lower secondary education.
2) Numbers of pupils, disaggregated by gender, passing the            17,908    12,705
Examination (CSEE) at the end of lower secondary education.
3) Number of pupils, disaggregated by gender, passing the             3,739      2,653
Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE) in Div. III
or better.

17.      New PDO Indicator. The Government team also suggests adding a new PDO
Indicator, to measure lower secondary completion rates, i.e., “The percentage of
Certificate of Secondary Education Exam (CSEE) takers divided by the population aged
17 years? (the official graduation age for Form IV).One advantage of this new indicator
is that it will allow comparing completion rates over time and with other countries. See
Annex 1 for baseline, actual, and target figures.

18.     Extension of Project Closing Date by four months, from July 31, 2013 to
November 30, 2013 (see Annex 3, below). This will allow adequate time to complete (i)
procurement processes of remaining textbook and instructional materials for grade 1-4
and (ii) teachers training programs.

     The Project team considers 2012 as project end year. Since project implementation goes up to January 2013, one could have used 2013 as ‘end of project’ year. However, data
   relating to 2013 will only become available in 2014 and this would have significantly delayed project evaluation.

    2.      The Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement Project has been under
    implementation since July 1, 2007 and overall implementation progress is moderately
    satisfactory. The Project's original closing date is June 30, 2013. Currently about 80% of
    project implementation time has elapsed and some 77% of the US$42 million equivalent
    has been disbursed. Implementations of all remaining activities are ongoing as planned.

    3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to achieve the PDO, ‘to improve
    completion of lower secondary education with successful performance among students.’
    Some savings have occurred because operating expenses and procurement of goods have
    been provided at lower prices than originally estimated prices and exchange rate gain has
    realized additional resources. The Government requested to reallocate the savings to
    different activities across components and categories, where greater needs than originally
    planned have been assessed. Requested reallocations of savings are as above table. The
    total amount of credit has increased from initially US$42 million to now US$43.4
    million, as per the Client Connection as at January 15, 2013, due to exchange rate gains
    (SDR vs US$).

1.     The Closing Date for Tanzania, Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement Project
(Credit No. 42930, P102262), will be extended by four months from July 31, 2013 to
November 30, 2013.

2.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Project is ‘To improve
completion of lower secondary education with successful performance among students.’
The Project has the following two components: 1) Increase Enrolment and Improve
Quality in Secondary Education through Provision of Infrastructure; and 2) Improve
Quality of Education through Teacher Training, Curriculum Reform, and Provision of
Learning Materials.

3.     The Project (US$42 million equivalent) was approved by the Board on April 24,
2007, signed on June 25, 2007, and declared effective on January 29, 2008. The original
closing date is July 31, 2013.


4.     The Project has been under implementation since July 1, 2007 and overall
implementation progress is Moderately Satisfactory. The project objectives continue to
be achievable, and most activities are expected to be completed prior to the project
closing date of July 31, 2013.

5.       However, following the last Implementation Support Mission, the Government
and the World Bank team believe that, while the action plan shows completion of most
activities by project closing date, there is possibility of small slippages in procurement
timelines (especially procurement of textbooks and completion of training programs for
teachers). As a result, the Government will be requesting an extension of four months
beyond the current closing date. The measure is being proposed to ensure the quality of
output from the training programs is maintained.

6.    An Action Plan to complete the Project has already been submitted by the
Government and is found to be satisfactory.

7.     This will be the first extension of the Project.
