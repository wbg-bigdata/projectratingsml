INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT BANK LTD
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $10.0 million to
the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank Limited (NIDB) with the guarantee
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        IFC took the lead in promoting the establishment of NIDB in
January 1964 and has subscribed ENO.5 million ($1.4 million) which amounts
to 25 percent of NIDB's ordinary share capital. An agreement for a Bank
loan of $6 million was first negotiated in early 1966, but, because of the
unsettled conditions of the country at that time, this loan was not made.
Following a further appraisal of NIDB in late 1968 the first loan in an
amount of $6 million (588-UNI) was made on March 5, 1969. It now appears
that this loan, intended to finance NIDB's foreign exchange requirements
through 1970, may be fully committed by September.
3.        The project was appraised in November, 1969 and negotiations
for the proposed second loan to the NIDB took place in Washington from
June 9 through June 16, 1970. The NIDB was represented by Mr. Silas
Daniyan, General Manager, and Mr. M. Balogun, Secretary and General Coun-
sel. Mr. Y.A.O. Jinadu, Acting Deputy Solicitor General, represented the
Government. In addition, Mr. A.A. Atta, Permanent Secretary of the Mini-
stry of Finance, was present during the first two days of negotiations.
4.        The proposed loan, the thirteenth to be made by the Bank Group
to Nigeria, would increase the Bank Group's total lending to Nigeria to
$287.1 million (net of cancellations). Of this, IDA has made two credits
totalling $35.5 million.
5.        The following is a summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA Cred-
its to Nigeria at June 30, 1970:

6.        The problems which have resulted in slow disbursement for the
Apapa Road Project (426-UNI) and the Education Project (72-UNI) were dis-
cussed in the recent President's Report on the Transport Rehabilitation
Project (P-807, May 6, 1970). The roads being constructed in Western



State under Loan Agreement 427-UNI are open to traffic and almost com-
pleted. The undisbursed balance reflects a number of factors: delays
in payments to contractors, delay in submission of withdrawal applica-
tions, outstanding deliveries of maintenance equipment, retention money
held, and contingencies. This situation is under review with the Govern-
ment. The effectiveness of Loan 640 has been delayed, since legislation
authorizing the Government to borrow for this project was not approved
until late June. Upon receipt of a supplementary legal opinion the Loan
will be made effective.
7.        In addition to its equity investment in the NIDB, the IFC has
also invested $1.3 million in Arewa Textiles, Ltd. After sales, repay-
ments and exchange-rate adjustments, IFC now holds $0.6 million in this
firm for its own account.
8.        An appraisal of a cocoa project in the Western State has just
been completed and is likely to lead to a loan proposal this fall. A
similar project in Mid-Western State will probably follow a few months
later. Further road construction projects in the North, West and possi-
bly in the East are in the course of preparation; and in the power sec-
tor further lending is under active consideration.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
9.        Borrower:                      Nigerian Industrial Development
Bank, Ltd. (NIDB).
Guarantor:                     Federal Republic of Nigeria.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Nigerian Indus-
trial Development Bank Limited" (DB-64a) is attached.
11.       The industrial sector in Nigeria currently accounts for some 9
percent of GDP, but employs only about 4 percent of the labor force. This
sector has been growing at a rate of 12 percent since 1963 and by the end
of the present (1970-74) Development Plan period is expected to have in-
creased its contribution to GDP to approximately 12 percent.
12.       In this setting, NIDB expects to expand its operations substan-
tially. In 1969 NIDB's gross approvals of EN2.4 million were more than
three times the volume of the previous year, and the aggregate value of
its industrial portfolio rose to EN3.7 million (from IN2.8 million in
1968), of which equity investments accounted for IN1.O million. Although
NIDB's business volume has thus far been quite modest for an economy of
Nigeria's size, there are strong reasons to expect that NIDB's future con-
tribution will be more significant. Among other things, NIDB intends to
expand the scope of its operations to participate with the government in
financing public-sector enterprises. This will enable the company to be-
come more active in contributing to Nigeria's reconstruction effort and in
supporting Nigeria's indigenous industrial development.   While this repre-
sents an important change in NIDB's policy, it is not expected to alter the
character of the company substantially, since NIDB's Board of Directors
decided to limit the financing of public enterprises to not more than 25
percent of the company's outstanding portfolio.
13.       The NIDB is run by a 12-man Board of Directors which includes
an IFC representative. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of
a Nigerian General Manager who has served the company since its establish-
ment and who has been in his present position since 1966. In view of the
experience which the NIDB staff has gained, particularly since the first
Bank loan was approved 18 months ago, NIDB should have no difficulty com-
mitting the proposed loan for well-appraised, economically justified projects
before the end of 1972.
14.       NIDB plans to commit in the period 1970-72 about $20.7 million
of which nearly $3 million may be to state-owned enterprises, including
rehabilitation loans. The foreign exchange component of this program is
estimated at over $14 million, of which almost $4 million (which is ex-
pected to be committed by September 1970) is available under the first
Bank loan. The remaining foreign exchange gap of approximately $10 million
will be financed by the proposed loan.
15.       As of March 31, 1970, NIDB's total resources amounted to some-
what over ZN9.0 million (US$25.2 million) made up of EN2.25 million share
capital, EN4.0 million Government loans, EN2.14 million existing Bank loan
and ENO.65 million reserves and retained earnings. The company's financial



position, profitability and portfolio have improved considerably since the
first Bank loan was made. Profits, before provisions and taxes, as a per-
cent of NIDB's average equity rose from 5.6 percent in 1966 to 9.4 percent
in 1968 and to 10.1 percent in 1969. The average yield on the company's
equity investments increased from 5.1 percent in 1968 to 6.7 percent last
year. NIDB reserves, equivalent to 16 percent of its portfolio, appear
fully adequate to absorb any losses that can be foreseen.
16.       Several of NIDB's principal clients are in the highly-protected
textile field. NIDB plans, in its appraisal of projects, to give greater
attention to the long-run competitive strength of the firms it supports
and, in particular, to the effects of tariffs and other import restric-
tions on the financial and economic viability of its clients. An analy-
sis of the role and impact of protective measures will be a normal part
of all future project appraisals prepared by NIDB. This topic was dis-
cussed with the NIDB representatives during the recent negotiations and
will be a subject of continuing discussion between the Bank and NIDB.
17.       During negotiations it was agreed that the limit for projects
not requiring the Bank's prior approval would be $200,000, rather than
$100,000 as under the first Loan Agreement. An aggregate limit of
$2,500,000 would apply to all loans made below the proposed free limit.
However, the NIDB must submit to the Bank for approval all proposed loans
to, or investments in, government-sponsored enterprises, and such loans
and investments may not exceed 25 percent of the Bank loan. On this basis
it is likely that about 80 percent of the amount committed to sub-projects
under the proposed loan would be subject to the Bank's review and approval.
18.       In addition to amending NIDB's Policy Statement to permit fi-
nancing of Government-sponsored enterprises, the NIDB Board recently ap-
proved two other significant policy changes. One allows the NIDB to par-
ticipate in the financing of hotels; and the other sets a limit of 15
percent on the share of NIDB's outstanding portfolio which may be invested
in any combination of interlocking private companies controlled by a single
person or group of persons. Also, in the interval since appraisal of this
project, an adviser to the General Manager, seconded by the Bank, has joined
the staff of the NIDB. Candidates for the positions of Director-in-Charge
of ICONSEC, NIDB's security underwriting subsidiary, and Deputy General
Manager are being actively sought.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the NIDB, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors separately.



-6-
20.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements follow substantially
the pattern of other agreements for Bank loans to development finance
companies. Article 2.03(d) of the Loan Agreement provides that, except
as the Bank shall otherwise agree, funds shall not be withdrawn under
the proposed Loan until the first Loan shall have been fully withdrawn
or committed. This provision is designed to insure that the NIDB fully
utilizes the first Loan, on which the commitment charge is assessed only
when funds are credited to the Loan Account, before it begins drawing
against the second Loan which will carry the standard commitment charge
beginning 60 days after signing of the Loan Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       The most recent Bank report on economic conditions in Nigeria,
"Interim Report on Nigeria's Economic Position and Prospects" (AW-lOa)
dated September 8, 1969, was circulated to the Executive Directors on
September 15, 1969. This report concluded that the Nigerian economy -
outside the Eastern States - had shown remarkable resilience in absorbing
the strains of war. A December 1969 updating mission and a Bank economic
mission which visited Nigeria in April/May 1970, reconfirmed these find-
ings. It is planned to circulate the report of the latter mission in
September. A basic data sheet (Annex A) is attached.
22.       The civil war ended without significant damage to the country's
long-term productive capacity and perhaps left the country with a greater
sense of unity than prevailed in the past. Thus, given its vast natural
resources and extensive, although largely untrained, manpower, Nigeria's
future economic prospects are very promising. Nigeria may soon become
one of the world's six largest oil exporters. GDP is provisionally esti-
mated to have risen 4.4 percent in current prices and 2.6 percent in real
terms in 1969. However, with an estimated population growth rate also of
2.6 percent, real per capita income was apparently unchanged. Petroleum
production has increased sharply since the end of the civil war in January
1970 and may average one million barrels per day (b/d) this year, and may
be double that by 1973 or 1974 - compared with a pre-war peak of 580,000
b/d in May, 1967. Manufacturing production, stimulated by the imposition
of import restrictions during the war, continued to expand in early 1970
and the government appears intent upon maintaining for sometime most of the
existing protective arrangements, although there has recently been some
liberalization with respect to specific products - in part, at least,
dictated by anti-inflationary considerations and attempts to reduce smuggling.
23.       Data on actual Federal Government revenues and expenditures in
1969/70 are not yet available, but it is clear that the current account
deficit was substantially in excess of the ENIO million estimate given in
the 1970/71 budget announcement. Moreover, the overall budget deficit
probably was in the neighborhood of EN100 million. The 1970/71 recurrent



- 7 -
budget provides for EN163 million Federally retained revenue and a surplus
of EN21 million to finance capital expenditure (net of debt amortization).
However, it seems unlikely that a surplus of this order will, in fact, be
realized. The civil war having ended only a few months ago, the armed
forces are still being maintained at 150,000 to 200,000. This, together
with an interim civil service wage increase to take place later this year,
suggests that recurrent expenditure has been substantially underestimated.
Certain revenues, especially those from petroleum, may have also been
underestimated, but to a lesser extent. Given the magnitude of recon-
struction and development requirements, there is clearly a need for the
Federal Government to intensify its efforts at raising additional revenue
while at the same time tightly controlling less essential expenditures.
24.       State finances have been boosted by the recently decreed change
in the formula for revenue allocation between the Federal Government and
the States. Despite the increase in allocations to the Distributable Pool,
recurrent budget surpluses of the States continue to be meager. Excepting
the three Eastern States, the 1970-71 recurrent budgets for the remaining
nine States combined show an aggregate surplus of about EN26 million; in-
cluding the three Eastern States, the 1970-71 State budgets taken together
have a modest surplus of EN7.7 million on current account, mainly because
of a current account deficit of EN15 million budgeted for by East Central
State. Thus, the 1970-71 outlook for the Federal and State governments
combined is one of, at best, only a small current surplus. Total Federal
and State public capital expenditures for 1970-71 are budgeted at EN190
million, but, in view of the status of project preparation and the resources
which are likely to be available, a substantial shortfall from this target
figure must be expected.
25.       Nigeria's 1970-74 National Reconstruction and Development Plan -
now being considered by the government - will reportedly postulate an overall
6 percent annual growth rate for the economy. Petroleum production and
manufacturing are expected to be the fastest growing sectors. Total in-
vestment during the Plan period is projected at EN1.6 billion of which
nearly 50 percent will be in the public sector where transport and indus-
try will receive major emphasis. The government plans to finance public
development expenditures as follows: approximately 70 percent from current
savings (including surpluses of marketing boards and other public corpora-
tions), 10 percent from domestic borrowing and 20 percent from external aid.
26.       As a result of the heavy deficit financing incurred in waging
the war, domestic credit has increased sharply; in 1969 alone, credit to
government rose by EN90 million. However, the country avoided any signif-
icant general inflation during the war years. The Government estimates
that the GDP deflator rose only about 2 percent per annum during the pe-
riod 1967/68 - 1969/70. On the other hand, certain consumer prices (chiefly
for food and textiles), particularly for low-income residents of urban areas,
have shown a more marked rise during the past year. This is largely attrib-
utable to transportation difficulties and the diversion of foodstuffs to
the army and to formerly rebel-held areas. Price developments over the



near-term will largely depend in the first instance on the outturn of this
year's food crops and on the extent of continued deficit financing by the
Government. Government bulk purchasing arrangements, price controls for
selected commodities and some import liberalization may help to contain
price increases in the immediate future.
27.       In consequence of the war, Nigeria's foreign exchange position
is tight and will probably remain so for the next year or two. The Cen-
tral Bank's gross foreign exchange reserves at the end of April 1970
amounted to EN46 million, i.e. less than 2 months of current imports.
Against this, one must set EN53 million of arrears in payments for commer-
cial imports and EN25 million of accumulated investment income, remit-
tance of which was barred during the war. External public debt outstand-
ing actually declined over the war years; the foreign exchange costs of
the war were financed from current earnings, depletion of reserves, trade
credits and the accumulation of a backlog in remittances of investment in-
come. External public debt outstanding, including undisbursed, at the
end of 1969 amounted to US$566 million equivalent; virtually all of this
was long-term (10 years or more), with the Bank/IDA accounting for 40 per-
cent of the total. Corresponding debt service payments will peak in 1971
at US$61 million or about 6 percent of prospective foreign exchange earn-
ings.
28.       The mounting foreign exchange earnings from petroleum should
provide substantial resources for reconstruction and development. Con-
servatively, Nigeria's net foreign exchange earnings from petroleum may be
projected to rise from about US$400 million in 1970/71 to about US$800
million in 1974/75, the great bulk of these receipts accruing directly
to the government in the form of profit taxes, royalties and rents.
Prospects for non-petroleum exports over the next few years seem less
bright as prices for Nigeria's principal export crops, notably cocoa,
groundnuts and palm produce, are expected to decline - in some cases
from unusually high levels in 1969. However, additional volume should
make up for the anticipated drop in prices, so that agricultural export
receipts as a whole may remain nearly constant.
29.       In summary, Nigeria's long-term prospects for increasing foreign
exchange earnings and government revenues are good. A renewed inflow of
private investment and foreign aid may also be expected. Nigeria emerged
from its civil war with a low and favourably structured external public
debt. To satisfy the demands of reconstruction and orderly development
during the next few years, substantial - but presently undetermined -
foreign resources will be required to supplement Nigeria's own effort as
domestic savings alone cannot be expected to meet the country's identified
needs for new investment. In view of the favorable outlook for export
earnings and the low debt-service ratio, Nigeria is now in a position to
borrow substantial amounts abroad on conventional terms.
