PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA - FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1474-x0)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report (PCR) on the Fourth Education
Project in Korea, for which Loan 1474 was approved in July 1977 in the sum of
US$23.0 million. The actual closing date was June 30, 1983. About
US$200,000 was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Korean Ministry of Labor (MOL) and the
Korean Vocational Training Managment Agency (KVTKA). It is based on: (a)
material contained in MOL's project files; and (b) material in the Bank's
files, including the Appraisal Report (1432-KO), dated June 17, 1977; the
President's Report (P-2114-KO) dated June 21, 1977 and the Loan Agreement,
dated July 22, 1977.
The PCR was reviewed and edited to conform to Bank guidelines by
staff in the Education Projects Division of the East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office who also prepared the highlights.
Following a review of the PCR by OED staff, it was decided not to
audit the project and the PCR was sent for comment to the Borrower in
November 1984. No comments have been received.

FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1474)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A loan of US$23.0 million was approved in July 1977 to expand the
capacity of the Government's system of Vocational Training Institutes
(VTIs). This system already numbered 16 institutions, including 7 assiste&
under the Bank's Third Education Project. The Fourth Education Project was
designed to complete the expansion plan to 24 in all, 8 new institutions, and
to strengthen the programs for instructor training of the Central Vocational
Training Institute (CVTI). The project comprised construction and equipment
for eight VTIs and equipment for the Central Vocational Training Institute
(CVTI).
As with the Third Education Project, that was successfully implemen-
ted and judged an excellent example of Bank/Borrower cooperation, as reported
in the Operations Evaluation Department's Project Performance Audit Report of
June 13, 1983, the Fourth Education Project also fully realized its objec-
tives. The project completion report identifies no issues that significantly
affected project performance. There was some delay in project implementation,
caused by late completion of civil works, and subsequent delay in tendering
and delivery of equipment, and the final disbursement was made in March 1984,
while the original Closing Date was June 30, 1982. In addition, there was an
overall cost overrun of 33% mainly due to modest increase of building areas
and unexpected and unprecedented high rates of inflation in both foreign and
domestic prices caused by the second OPEC crisis.
The rationale for the project was based principally on manpower
surveys that indicated an emerging shortage of manpower at the sub-profes-
sional level. To increase the supply of semi-skilled and skilled manpower in
accordance with estimates of future demand in the labor market, the project
set ambitious targets in terms of enrollment and output (paras. 2.16 and
2.18). These targets were reached with only about 13Z of trainees failing to
complete the training courses (para. 6.03). Evening courses were developed to
improve utilization and increased output by an additional 35%.   Follow-up
studies of graduates indicate very high levels of utilization of graduates in
their respective skill areas.
The project originally provided boarding facilities for 50% of the
students in the VTIs. During implementation the Government decided to provide
100% boarding facilities (para. 3.07(e)). There were two reasons. Students
had come from distant cities and towns and boarding space in neighboring
communities was limited. Also MOL decided to intensify the training by
maintaining supervision of students in the evening and providing counselling
and guidance services.

The Bank's accredited representatives visited Korea on 11 supervi-
sion missions to ascertain the project progress. They generally expressed
satisfaction with project accomplishments. The Korean Government was also
satisfied with the advice and assistance provided by the Bank's visiting
missions (paras. 6.06 and 6.07).
Two major institutional developments during the course of the
project were the establishment of the Changwon Industrial Master's College
(CIMC), for further skill development of workers to the level of master
craftsman, and the creation of the Korea Vocational Training Management Agency
(KVTMA) for unified management of the growing system of skill training and
technical qualification testing (paras. 5.02-5.06).

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
SOejoeconOutic Setting
2.01      Since 1960 Korea has progressed from one of the poorest developing
countries, with heavy reliance on agriculture, into a semi-industrial middle
income nation. In 20 years, per capita income grew four times in real
terms. As agriculture's share of GNP fell from over 40% to 18%, the manufac-
turing sector increased its share from 11% to 34%. Education standards
improved Significantly, as did housing and public health.
2.02      This remarkable record of economic and social gains is attributable
to a variety of factors. Political stability and a strong commitment to
development were essential prerequisites for economic progress. Korea's labor
force is also highly disciplined, industrious and, as the inheritor of a long
tradition of formal education, relatively well educated. Most importantly,
sound policies have enabled Korea to surmount obstacles to development such as
those presented by the virtual absence of exploitable natural resources.
2.03      Education has contributed to Korean industrialization by emphasizing
Widespread provision of basic education (primary and general secondary) and
vocational training. Full enrollment of the primary school age group was
achieved by 1975; over 80% of the corresponding secondary age group is
presently in school. Virtually 100% of the labor force is literate and 90% of
production workers have completed primary or secondary education. Over the
last decade Government has also expanded the number of technical high schools
and vocational training institutes, with the result that planned capacity to
prepare skilled workers for entry into industry to meet that demand is in
Place.
Manpower Development
2.04      The accelerated pace of industrial development and the increasing
ComplexitY of production processes called for a labor force with a higher



-2-
degree of technical competence. This in turn required large-scale efforts in
education and training. Long-term projections of demand and supply for
technical manpower were used to determine the general direction for investment
decisions in technical education and vocational training. These estimates
were periodically updated to take into account new survey data and the gradual
expansion of relevant training capacities.
2.05      For the category of skilled workers (craftsmen and operatives), the
projections indicated that the period 1977-81 would be characterized by
sizeable deficits, totaling over 300,000 (Annex 1) or 20% of the 1981 stock.
This situation justified a continuation of Government's reliance on a variety
of vocational training modes to exploit the potential of the formal and
nonformal training systems as well as of inplant training.
2.06      The urgency of the training needs led to a combination of intensive
pre-employment vocational training and large-scale upgrading of skilled
workers through special short-term courses. This upgrading was to be
conducted in the plant to take into account the needs of individual industrial
establishments.
2.07      The Government allocated the training targets (in terms of number of
trainees) as follows: the formal system (under the Ministry of Education -
MOE) was to train 30% and nonfojDal modes (directly or indirectly under the
Office of Labor Affairs - OLA) - to train 70%. Of the latter share, 15% was
attributed to vocational training institutes, and 55% to inplant training
schemes.
2.08      The Korea Development Institute (KDI) attempted to disaggregate
demand and supply figures into skilled and semi-skilled workers in order to
shed new light on the question of training deficits for industrial workers.
For the subcategory of skilled workers, the cumulative deficit for the period
1977-81 amounted to about 20,000 or 2% of the estimated 1981 stock; the
shortfall for semi-skilled workers remained substantial at almost 300,000 or
40% of the 1981 stock (Annex 1). Although the assumDtions underlying these
estimates may have been contested, the results of this exercise implied that
the training deficits for skilled workers could have been converted to a
situation of approximate balance through further investments in vocational
training, whereas the size and diversity of future training tasks at lower
skilled level called for training arrangements within the private sector,
supported by the Government's system of technical and vocational training.
Project Generation
2.09      The project under consideration here was preceded by a closely
related project, the Third Education Project (Loan 1096-KO).  It was the first
Bank-assisted vocational training project of the Ministry of Labor (MOL). The
loan agreement was signed on March 31, 1975 and became effective June 6,
1/   Ministry of Labor (MOL) was known as Office of Labor Affairs (OLA) in its
early stages of the Project.



-3-
1975.  The original closing date of June 30, 1980 was extended by one year to
June 30, 1981. The total cost of the project was US$22.5 million, with MOL's
share of US$11.0 million.  The Third Education Project was designed to:  (a)
meet manpower requirements at the skilled worker and technician levels for
specific economic sectors, while improving the quality of instruction of the
education system; and (b) lay a sound basis for a flexible, employment
oriented system of nonformal vocational training.
2.10      The project items for the Third Education Project were:
(a)  Under the Ministry of Education
(i) Construction of and equipment for I new technical high school
(grades 10-12);
(ii)  Extension to and equipment for 3 agricultural junior colleges
(grades 13-14), 1 fisheries college (grades 13-16) and 3
fisheries high schools (grades 10-12);
(iii) Equipment for 1 merchant marine junior college (grades 13-14);
and
(iv)  Technical assistance for teacher training and preparatory
technical studies.
(b)  Under the Office of Labor Affairs
(v) Construction of and equipment for 7 vocational training
institutes.
2.11      The 7 Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs) financed under the Third
Education Project were located in local industrial centers at Cheongju,
Jeonju, Jinju, Suncheon, Gumi, Pohang and Ulsan to meet the manpower demand
and an absolute shortage of supply which was projected by Korean economic
planners. To satisfy the national policy, a rapid expansion of nonformal
education through VTIs was deemed appropriate.
2.12      The Third Education Project was successfully completed as evidenced
by the Operations Evaluation Department's Project Performance Audit Report of
June 13, 1983. It had met all the appraisal objectives. It was reported that
the project outcomes were highly satisfactory and represented an excellent
example of Bank/Borrower cooperation.
2.13      In accordance with the aim of the Government's Fourth Five Year Plan
(1977-81) to industrialize the country, the Fourth Education Project was a
logical follow-up to the Third Education Project. The Fourth Education
Project, assisted by the Bank, was designed to increase the number of VTIs
from 16, including 7 supported under the Third Education Project, to 24, or
8 additional institutions. It was understood by the Government and the Bank
that these 8 additional VTIs would follow the same design, operate under
similar management and fulfill the same training objectives as those VTIs
financed under the Third Education Project. The Fourth Education Project was



-4-
first mentioned on file on March 21, 1975, before the date of effectivenaes
(June 6, 1975) of the Third Education Project.
2.14      The Bank identification misslion visited Korea in May 1976.  The
mission recommended providing financial assistance for: (a) strengthening the
administrative capability of OLA; (b) lmprovement of the Central Vocational
Training Institute (CVTI) for instructor training; (c) establishment of eight
VTIs totaling 3,600 places; and (d) technical assistance. The identification
mission also assisted with the project preparation. The project was appraised
in September 1976, negotiated in June 1977 and approved on July 5, 1977. The
project became effective October 25, 1977 and was expected to be completed by
December 31, 1981. Closing date was set at June 30, 1982.
Project Objectives
2.15      At appraisal, the project objectives were to:
(a)  contribute to the supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers needed
for the country's iudustrial development;
(b)  provide out-of-school youth with a means to acquire skills that
would make them employable in industry;
(c)  strengthen vocational instructor training; and
(d)  give technical assistance to the country's efforts in the field of
inplant vocational training.

Vocational Training Institutes
2.17      The locations tentatively selected by the Government for the eight
new VTIs were Naju, Nonsan, Sasang, Weonju, Chungmu (Geoje), Hongseong,
Kimcheon, and Pyeongkaek (Panweol); the first four were planned to be con-
structed in 1978. The proposed VTIs were to be near areas of high industrial
concentration or close to existing or planned national or provincial indus-
trial estates. The locations were reviewed and accepted by -he Bank.
Central Vocational Training Institute (CVTI)
2.18      In addition to raising the general quality of instructor training,
the investment in the CVTI was designed to permit an expansion of enrollments
in the regular two-year course from about 660 to 750 and of the annual output
from about 320 to 370 instructors (a 16X increase). During negotiations, the
Government informed the Bank that it planned a temporary enrollment increase
to 850 as part of its measure to ensure an adequate supply of VTI instructors.
The Bank assistance consisted of financing equipment for precision measure-
ment, metal finishing, electrical fitting, machining, sheet metal work and
welding. This constituted direct support to the VTls established under the
Third and Fourth Education Projects.
Technical Assistance
2.19      A total of about 24 man-years of specialist services and of 22 man-
years of fellowships were provided to support the other project components and
to provide specific expertise needed for the large-scale introduction of in-
plant vocational training. The technical assistance required within the
vocational training system was as follows:
Item                  Amount of Assistance
1.   VTB (see para 2.21 below)    6 man-years of specialist services
2.   CVTI                          10-1/4 man-years of specialist services
and 2 man-years of fellowships
3.   VTIls                         8 man-years of specialist services and
20 man-years of fellowships
2.20      The Government expected technical assistance for the Vocational
Training Bureau (VTB) of MOL to be financed from the loan.  Technical assist-
ance for the CVTI was to be financed under UNDP program; and technical assist-
ance for the VTIs was to be financed through a program of bilateral assistance
from the Federal Republic of Germany. With this understanding the loan was to
cover only 6 man-years of specialist services for the VTB.

Project Costs and Changes
2.21      The loan amount of US$23 million as allocated at appraisal and
subsequently revised is as follows:
Appraisal allocation                     Revised allocation
- …------------ (US$ million)
Civil works                   3.9                                    3.5
Equipment                     13.9                                   19.5
Technical assistance            .3                                      -
Unallocated                   4.9                                       -
Total                      23.0                                   23.0
2.22      In April 1980, the Government requested reallocation of unused funds
(US$4.9 million in category 4 under "Unallocated", US$0.3 million in category
3 under "Technical Assistance and US$0.4 million in category 1 under "Civil
Works") to Category 2 to meet the additional requirements for instructional
equipment and also to compensate for the high rates of inflation during
1978-82. The technical assistance component was reduced to zero as the
Federal Republic of Germany was able to approve a larger program of support
for specialists services than initially agreed with the Government of Korea
(para. 3.14). The equipment allocation was revised upwards to US$19.5 million
in reflection of the high foreign exchange content of equipment procured under
the project. Since the civil works cost overruns were essentially caused by
local cost inflation, the Government was able to budget adequate funds to
cover these local expenditures. Therefore, in order to release additional
loan funds for equipment, the Bank was requested to change the category for
reimbursement of expenditures for civil works from 25% to 10%, thereby
reducing the loan amount allocation of US$3.9 million to a revised allocation
of US$3.5 million. The changes were caused by adjustments in relative prices
and in no way reflected deviation from original project objectives. Indeed,
the Government's ability to increase the level of expenditure on civil works
signalled strong commitment to the original project and its objective. At
closing, the unspent balance of US$0.2 million was cancelled.
III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Personnel
3.01      The VTB of the MOL was the executing agency of the project.  The
Director General of VTB, as the Project Director, was responsible for adminis-
tration, financial control, and liaison with the Bans. For smooth implementa-
tion of the project, the Project Implementation Unit maintained the 29 staff
already trained to implement the Third Education Project. The composition



-7-
was: 1 project director, 7 project assistants, 1 civil engineer, 1 architect,
5 office staff, 5 administrative staff and 9 office assistants. Regular VTB
staff provided additional support.
Project Organization
3.02      At the time of loan agreement in 1977, the VTB of MOL had five
divisions: Training Planning, Public Training, In-plant Training, Technical
Deliberation and Skill Testing. The VTB was reorganized in 1982, and now
consists of four divisions: Skill Testing, In-plant Training, Public Training
and Training Policy (Annex 2). The VTB is also responsible to the Government
for the operations of several boards and decentralized agencies: a
Deliberation Committee for Vocational Training, Deliberation Committee for
Technical Qualification, and an externe  body, the Korea Vocational Training
and Management Agency (KVTMA).
Civil Works
Locations
3.03      The VTI locations were decided after considering and analyzing
factors such as the balanced development across regions, regional requirements
for manpower, plans for recruitment of instructors, and regional and local
plans for industrial development.  Consider^tion was also given not to locate
new VTIs near the already existing 16 VTIs (including 7 assisted under the
Third Education Project, 5 by the Asian Development Bank and 4 by the Korean-
German International Cooperation). Of the eight locations originally designa-
ted by the Government and accepted by the Bank at appraisal, four locations
were subsequently changed, largely because of completion of new plans for
regional development of industry (see para. 3.07).
Design
3.04      The standard construction design, structure and size of VTIs were
similar to those for the Third Education Project. However, each had a capa-
city to train 450 trainees compared to 360 trainees under the Third Education
Project.
3.05      The layout of VTIs consists of several units.  The main characte-
ristics of the design (similar to that of the Third Education Project) are as
follows:
(a) Main Building. Rooms for administrative and managerial staffs,
library, classrooms for teaching and audio-visual room.
(b) Dormitory. Bedrooms with individual furniture, recreation room and
small shower room.
(c) Shower Room. One-story building with shower capacity for 60
persons.



(d)  Workshop.  Space sufficient for 90 trainees to practice in each
trade provided with lighting, ventilation and safety facilities.
(e)  Restaurant.  Kitchen and restaurant provided with boiler room in the
basement.
(f) Others. Transformer station, guard room, oil tank, warehouse, etc.
Construction
3.06      The preparation and processing of civil works were well done because
of experience gained during the implementation of the Third Education Pro-
ject. Each institute director was responsible for following the established
procedure from selection of site to completion. The land space, building
space and construction duration for training facilities and instructor apart-
ments at the Institutes are attached as Annex 3.
Changes
3.07      The following designation of new locations was made during
Implementation (see para. 3.03):
(a) the location of Naju VTI was changed to Mokpo as Naju is a small
city and a VTI already existed in nearby Kwangju;
Cb) the location of Nonsan VTI was changed to Iri on the grounds of
inadequate industrial activity in Nonsan and Iri had an existing and
expanding industrial complex;
(c) the location of Chungmu VTI was changed to Yeongju in Kyungsangbukdo
Province because of existing VTIs in the vicinity of Jinju and
Changwon, and higher priority eventually assigned to industrial
employment in the province;
(d) the location of Pyeongtaek VTI was changed to Choongju because of
land acquisition problems; and
(e) the planned dormijtory capacity to accommodate 50X of the trainees
was expanded to 100%, as almost all the trainees were residential
students who came from remote areas, and also to maximize the
training effect through student counselling and guidance services in
the afternoons and evenings (para. 4.03, footnote 2).
Equipment Procurement
Procurement Plan
3.08      The training equipment lists were first prepared iu 1977 with
cooperation of the German Advisory Team (GAT) taking into account factors such
as curriculum, training plan, training trades, number of trainees and instruc-
tors, workshop space, equipment chl.racteristics, possibility for international
competitive bidding and budget for equipment.



-9 -
3.09      The "Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA
Credits" were followed for procurement of training equipment. Preparation of
equipment lists, bidding documents and contracts were fully approved by the
Bank.
3.10      The technical evaluation of bidding documents was made carefully and
objectively with assistance from GAT, and similar evaluations were separately
made by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK). The equipment pro-
curement was handled through OSROK following the Bank Guidelines. Details are
attached as Annex 4.
3.11      The final procurement of equipment for the CVTI of about US$300,000,
was contracted on April 13, 1983.  The delivery was completed by the end of
1983.
Training Plan
3.12      The training plans were modified annually to adjust to the changing
requirements of the labor force. The Government based the plans on a thorough
analysis of the following factors: priority trades, condition of equipment,
training facilities, number of staff, training targets, skill tests, trainees'
level, age, number and budget.  The training duration in a one-year course was
more than 1,800 hours per trainee per year with a practical work content of
about 75X.
3.13      The training trades were selected after considering the demands of
industries and the VTI's training capacity. Priority was given to heavy
industry in support of the trade export strategy. As a result, the selection
was mainly in machine trades. Also, with many construction companies receiv-
ing overseas construction contracts, there was an upsurge in demand for
skilled construction workers. To meet this demand, the VTIs at Mokpo (with
180 trainee capacity) and Kimcheon (with 90 trainee capacity) specialized in
construction and steel structures, and tile setting and brick laying trades.
The objective of these VTIs was to train multi-skilled construction workers.
The trades and capacity of eight VTls are attached as Annex 5.
Technical Assistance
3.14      Technical assistance of US$0.3 million included in the project was
not utilized because the MOL continued with technical assistance provided
under a bilateral agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany for the Third
Education Project. As GAT had been assisting MOL since April 1976 (first in
connection with the Third Education Project and then the Fourth Education
Project), it is not possible to allocate how much time was spent on each
project. The personnel details and total service time are attached as
Annex 6.
3.15      The duties of GAT were to:  (a) advise and cooperate with the
Director-General of VTB and staff engaged on the project; (b) review plans and
construction drawings of VTIs and assist in supervision; (c) prepare equipment
lists and review bids; (d) review training and skill test standards; (e)
assist individual VTIs with seminars, demonstrations and workshop guidance;



- 10 -
(f) assist in and coordinate overseas training; and (g) any other advisory
matters.
3.16      The GATs' effective technical advice contributed a great deg1 toward
Korea's vocational education. A most effective contribution was the overseas
training of instructors in Germany.
Convenants
3.17      All the agreements were fulfilled by the Government, generally
within a reasonable length of time. The covenants were well supported by the
Government and contributed to the success of the project. Details are shown
in Annex 7.
Bank Performance
3.18      The Bank's accredited representatives visited Korea periodically
(11 supervision missions) to ascertain the project progress and they generally
expressed satisfaction with project accomplishments. For example, the Bank
staff noted that the Government developed and implemented a plan to overcome
projected shortages of instructors. Also the Bank staff reported that the
Government collected systematically and presented for regular review by the
Bank data on employment status and skill attainment of graduates. Moreover,
the Bank staff visits to project institutions uniformally revealed well-
organized training courses operated at a high level of effectiveness with well
trained instructors and disciplined students. The Korean Government was also
satisfied with the advice and assistance provided by Bank missions.
Closing Date
3.19      The closing date of June 30, 1982 was postponed by a year after
consultation with the Bank. The reason for closing date extension was mainly
due to delay in equipment procurement for Yeongju and Choongju VTIs, caused by
slightly slower construction schedule and additional planning to determine
specific courses for these VTIs.
IV. PROJECT COSTS
Appraisal Estimate
4.01      The appraisal report, dated June 17, 1977, contained an estimated
total project cost of US$41.3 million including a foreign exchange component
of US$23.0 million or 55.7% of the total.  Details of summary project costs
are attached as Annex 8.
Financial Plan
4.02      The financial plan proposed by the Government, as shown in the
appraisal report and endorsed by the Bank in the loan agreement, provided for
Bank assistance of a total of US$23.0 million to finance part of the costs of
civil works, architectural and engineering consultants and furniture (30Z);



- 1.1 -
directly imported equipment (100%) and other local procurement (70%); and
technical assistance (100%) of foreign and local expenditures. The part
financed from the government budget would amount to the equivalent of
US$18.3 million.
Actual Costs
4.03      After completion the total cost of the project amounted to
US$55.1 million representing a cost overrun of 33X over the appraisal
estimate, including contingencies. The table below presents a comparative
analysis between appraisal estimates and the actual costs by category of
expenditure.

- 12 -
The part financed by government funds - the equivalent of US$32.3 million -
exceeds the original estimate of US$18.3 million (para. 4.02)  As2,uch, the
government contribution represented nearly 59Z of the total cost _
4.04      The main reasons for the cost overrun (33X) are as follows:
(a) modest increase of building areas; and
(b) unexpected, and unprecedented, high rates of inflation in both
foreign and domestic prices caused by the second OPEC crisis.
4.05      Construction.  The provincial authorities assisted the project by
providing 360,000 sq m land free to the new VTIs. Hence, the land acquisition
cost is not included in the project costs. However, the land purchased by KOL
for instructors' apartments is included in the project. The domestic budget
secured for construction work ran short because of high inflation, and in 1980
the construction work was carried forward to the following year when shortage
of funds persisted. However, the overall project construction was completed
satisfactorily without any serious setbacks to the original schedule, and the
quality of construction was good.
4.06      Equipment.  Equipment procurement was well executed.  The total cost
for equipment amounted to US$25.9 million (local cost of US$6.3 million and
foreign cost of US$19.6 million). There were no budgetary problems for equip-
ment because the original loan allocation of US$13.9 rillion was revised
upward to US$19.5 million. The equipment was procured under five interna-
tional bidding exercises. However, a balance of US$400,000 still remained in
the loan fund when the VTIs were fully equipped and, after consultation with
the Bank, it was decided to procure equipment for the CVTI. This bidding
exercise was contracted on April 19, 1983 for about US$200,000.
4.07      Technical Assistance.  The amount of US$300,000 initially allocated
for technical assistance was not used as the GAT continued to provide expert
services after completion of the Third Education Project. This amount was
re-allocated for equipment procurement.
4.08      Recurrent Costs.  The recurrent costs for the 8 VTIs assisted under
this project are substantially the same as those for the entire system of
VTIs. These institutions shared an average recurrent cost per student in 1981
of US$2,000. This is an acceptable standard of performance.
2/   In fact, the government contribution is even higher because MOL decided
to increase the number of boarders in the VTIs to lOOZ of the enrollment
instead of 50% as specified in the loan agreement, and also to provide
instructors' apartments (40) in each VTI. This additional program has
been entirely financed by government funds without Bank assistance.

Disbursements
4.09      The project was expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1982, and
project implementation was also expected to finish before the closing date of
June 30, 1982. Owing to delays caused by late completion of construction
works and delays in ordering equipment, the closing date was postponed by a
year to June 30, 1983 after consultations with MOF and the Bank.
4.10      As of March 1984, the total disbursed amount was approximately
*       US$22.8 million.  The unutilized balance of US$214,265.12 was cancelled on
March 24, 1984. On this record the disbursement performance of the project as
compared with the disbursement profile of East Asia and Pacific Regional
Education Projects was initially slow but accelerated after two years.  See
Annex 9 (attached).
V. MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES DURING THE PROJECT
5.01      Two major changes which occurred during the life of the Fourth
Education Project were the establishment of:  (a) Changwon Industrial Masters'
College; and (b) Korea Vocational Training and Management Agency. Although
not financed under the project, these institutional changes represent a
significant effort on the part of Government to continue to improve the man-
agement and the quality of vocational training. Their development was a
consequence of the program for expansion of vocational training financed under
this project.
Establishment of Changwon Industrial Masters' College (CIMC)
5.02      The Changwon Industrial Masters' College was established in November
1977 under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). It was set up to
train master craftsmen with comprehensive skills and competence, who would be
in charge of training and supervision of skilled workers, safety management,
effective utilization of equipment, improvement of working conditions and pro-
duction work. In March 1982, the college was placed under the Korea
Vocational Training and Management Agency (KVTMA) as a subordinate organiza-
tion. The development of this College could partly be attributed to the
Bank's continued effort in vocational training in Korea, because this institu-
tional development followed on the establishment of some 24 VTIs. The
Master's College became the apex of this system.
5.03      Although the creation of CIMC does not have a direct effect on the
Fourth Education Project, it has had an indirect effect in that it provides
VTI graduates further opportunity for development of their technical skills.
The Korea Vocational Training and Management Agency (KVTMA)
5.04      To train and manage skilled workers effectively, it was deemed
proper by the Government to establish outside of an operating ministry an
organization that had comprehensive control over skilled manpower training and



- 14 -
allocation to match the industrial demand. KVTMA was established on March 18,
1982. Its charter proposed to contribute to the promotion of national welfare
and national economic development through the efficient management of voca-
tional training and technical qualification testing.
5.05      The KVTMA functions are to establish and operate vocational training
facilities, implement and guide vocational training, train managers of voca-
tional training institutions, implement a national technical qualification
system, guide employment of skilled manpower, perform surveys and research in
support of vocational training and technical qualification testing, develop
and distribute textbooks, implement and supervise national and international
vocational training competitions and promote international cooperation in
vocational training. The KVTMA organization is attached as Annex 10.
5.06      The most important achievement of KVTMA was to improve the
responsiveness of the training system to the requirements of industry. Before
the establishment of KVTMA such effective management was not possible because
different central agencies of Government were in charge of training, i.e.,
MOE, MOL and MOST, among others. The other important outcome of KVTMA is
economy in budget and effective management of personnel. This is a direct
result of consolidation.
VI. OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS
Overview
6.01      The establishment of eight new VTIs and the assistance for the CVTI
under the Fourth Education Project had a great influence on the Korean voca-
tior&aL education system. Despite the continuous quantitative growth achieved
with the promulgation of the Vocational Training Law of 1976, the Fourth
Education Project was the turning point which resulted in not only a quantita-
tive growth but a substantial qualitative improvement. It also led to a
maturity of the vocational training system in Korea, and to two important
steps in institutional development, namely, CIMC and KVTMA.
6.02      The new VTIs are now operated under the supervision of KVTMA.  The
establishment of KVTMA during the implementation of the Fourth Education Pro-
ject uncoupled the VTIs from direct government management and ensured smooth
operation of the VTIs as well as high quality leadership in management of the
VTIs.
6.03      In 1979, the first trainees were recruited at Weonju and Pusan VTIs
through competitive testing.  The places/applicants ratio at 1:1.55 (capacity
900 places against 1,395 applicants) shows high social demand for these
courses. With training capacity of 7,200 places during the years 1980-82 and
with the capacity fully utilized, 6,242 persons graduated from regular
courses, indicating a high internal efficiency of 872. During the same
period, 5,735 graduates passed the skill test of Craftsman Class II and the
92% success rate is a result of effective training in the VTIs. The external
productivity with 5,196 graduates, or about 9O% obtaining jobs in industry in
their respective fields also very high. The table showing completion ratio of



- 15 -
entrance examination, status of graduates, skill tests and employment by VTIs
is attached as Annex 11.
6.04      Each VTI has evening courses to maximize the use of training
facilities. Most of the trainees in evening courses apply to skill test
grades at the level of craftsman and virtually 100% obtain a certificate for
that grade. Intensive utilization of facilities through evening courses is
one of the most important achievements of this project.
6.05      The CVTI is responsible for training of all VTI instructors.  The
CVTI output was adequate to staff all the VTIs in Korea. The quality of
training was high. Staff of VTIs were recruited at the time of opening of
training courses.  Each instructor is responsible for 10 trainees with sub-
stantial emphasis on individualized instruction. The number of instructors
and staff at the end of 1982 was adequate as indicated in Annex 12 (attached)
and also because of reasonable student/instructor ratio. The quality of
training was satisfactory as evidenced by the high passing rate in skill tests
and comparative success in international skill competitions.
Bank Contribution
6.06      The timely Bank loan contributed significantly to the development of
a larger and more effective vocational training system in Korea. The report
of the Bank's identification mission recognized the need for and feasibility
of establishing VTIs in Korea. The quick and cooperative actions taken by the
Bank during project implementation enabled the project to progress smoothly.
6.07      The Bank contributed to an efficient design for VTIs of six groups
per stream, allowing for an efficient rate of utilization. The Bank staff
also assisted in program selection for the VTIs. In addition, the Bank staff
helped develop the monitoring system for graduates.
6.08      There was no preparation mission for this project (para. 2.14) with
identification in May 1976 and appraisal in September 1976. The identifica-
tion mission assisted with the project preparation. This shows that for
repeater projects, processing steps could be lessened and the Bank's resources
used for achieving the lending program could be reduced.
Government Contribution
6.09      During the implementation period, the MOL made every effort to
observe the loan agreement and follow the Banl: guidelines. Deviations, if
any, were discussed and agreed upcn with the Bank.  Problens caused in
relation to withdrawal of funds, amendments to letters of credit, approval of
equipment lists, approval of contracts, approval of reallocation of funds,
approval of changes in location and trades at VTIs were settled satisfactorily
during the Bank supervision missions.
6.10      The project scale and plan as identified by the Bank on size and
location of eight ViIs was satisfactory to the MOL. One problem was the
failure to locate some of the VTIs correctly during appraisal, thus requiring
changes later on (para. 3.07), but the adverse effect was minimal.



- 16 -
6.11      The unexpected cost overrun, both local and foreign, was the main
problem. However, the Korean Government met the cost overrun.
6.12      The Government contributed to the expansion of trainees' dormitories
and instructors' apartments, and these changes were evaluated satisfactorily
by the Bank.
