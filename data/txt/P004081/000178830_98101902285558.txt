REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $23.0 million to help
finance a vocational training project. The loan would have a term of
17 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.2% per annum.
The UNDP and the Federal Republic of Germany are expected to provide assistance
in meeting a substantial part of the technical assistance requirements under
the project (see paragraph 43).
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Kotl::n
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158 dated March 4, 1977.
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        During the last few years, the external economic environment has
been subject to unexpected, sharp and sudden changes which seriously affected
economic activity in Korea and, more particularly, its external trade and pay-
ments situation. The boom in world trade led to increases in the volume of
Korean exports of 46% and 54% in 1972 and 1973 respectively. But in 1974,
the quadrupling of oil prices combined with a sharp rise in the prices of
foodgrains and capital goods led to a deterioration of 18% in the terms of
trade. At the same time, the deep recession in the industrialized countries
caused a slackening in the growth of exports to some 9%. The purchasing power
of exports, which had expanded by over 46% each year in 1972 and 1973, actually
decreased by nearly 11% in 1974. During 1975 export volume grew by a remark-
able 23%, assisted by the devaluation of the won in December 1974 and a very
vigorous drive to expand and diversify markets. However, part of this gain
was offset by a further deterioration of 10% in the terms of trade.
4.        Among the major economic targets set by the Government in 1976 were
the containment of inflation to 10% and a reduction in the balance of payments
current account deficit substantially from $1.9 billion in 1975 to $1.4 billion.
The former goal was achieved and the latter substantially surpassed. Wholesale
prices which had increased by nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end
of 1975 have increased by around 9% in 1976, primarily because import costs
(which more than doubled between 1972 and 1974) apparently decreased by
about 2% in 1976; moreover, the growth in domestic credit was limited in 1976
to 21% (compared with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively).
5.        Primarily, as a result of the recovery in the OECD countries,
Korea's exports appear to have increased in 1976 by about 40% in volume and
there was an improvement of 13% in the terms of trade. While part of this
/1 This section i; substantial,y identical to that contained in the corresponding
section of LI, President's Report (No. P-2099-KO) on a Sixth Loan to the Korea
Development Fiaance Corporation (KDFC) which was approved on June 14, 1977.



-2-
increase in exports may have been supplied by a drawing-down of inventories,
it is evident that it could not have been achieved without substantial
additions to production capacity in the last couple of years. A remarkable
feature of Korea's economic management through the crisis of 1974 and 1975
was that fixed investment continued to grow at an average of 11% per annum in
constant 1970 prices, raising its ratio to GNP from 24.3% in 1973 to 25.6% in
1975.
6.        The real growth of GNP in 1976 is estimated at 15.2% as compared
with an average increase of 8.5% in the two previous years. This was the
result primarily of buoyant exports, but the extraordinary growth in agricul-
tural output was also a significant factor. Value added in agriculture grew
at over 7% in each of the last two years. While weather conditions were
favorable over the past three seasons, there has also been a real improvement
in yields as a result of better technology and the more effective use of the
various inputs.
7.        Although there was a large increase in the outstanding external debt
during the Third Plan period (1972-76), the real burden of external debt has
in fact declined. The ratio of debt service payments to exports (of goods and
nonfactor services) declined from an average of 21% in the early 1970s to an
estimated 11% at the end of 1976. Total outstanding debt is estimated at
about $7 billion in medium- and long-term maturities and an additional $2 bil-
lion in maturities of less than one year. Debt service payments are estimated
to have been nearly $1 billion in 1976, which was well within Korea's repay-
ment capacity.
8.        It would appear that Korea achieved several of the objectives it
set for itself in the Third Plan, despite the-balance of payments difficul-
ties experienced in 1974 and 1975 and a generally less favorable international
economic environment than had been expected. The rate of growth of GNP was
around 11% per year compared with the original target of 8.6%. Considerable
progress has also been made in expanding the manufacturing sector. However,
progress in reducing reliance on foreign savings and in restraining inflation
fell short of expectations. Furthermore, even with employment growing at 4%
per annum during the Third Plan period, there has been little improvement in
the unemployment situation. Although over two million jobs were created
during the Third Plan period, they were barely sufficient to keep pace with
the growth in the labor force; the open unemployment rate in the urban areas
remains at about 7%.
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
9.        The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) has afforded an oppor-
tunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiency" and "greater equity and social development."
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. The Plan projects that the current
account deficit will be eliminated during the next few years. National sav-
ings are expected to finance as much as 92% of total investment as compared
with about 72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76). However, these projections



- 3-
may prove overly optimistic. The domestic savings target appears somewhat
ambitious, while the projected investment requirements may turn out to be too
low.
10.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.   Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean scheme of
things. The main emphasis is: (a) on providing adequate employment oppor-
tunities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent aggravating the
unemployment problem; and (b) on achieving a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of growth. Rising employment is the most important instrument for
achieving an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. This is all
the more so because, despite the success in reducing the rate of growth of
population to around 1.8% per annum, the labor force continues to grow at
over 3% per annum because of the baby boom following the Korean War in the
early 1950s. Health outlays will increase as a proportion of total invest-
ment with special stress on preventive care and an innovative health deliv-
ery system to service low income families, especially in the rural areas.
Rural incomes are expected to increase as a result of a further improvement
in agricultural terms of trade and increased opportunities for nonfarm employ-
ment, primarily through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and small indus-
tries development. The quality of life in the rural areas is to be further
enhanced by the provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
11.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in the
basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has followed
so successfully since the mid-sixties. GNP is expected to rise at 9.2% per
annum, fueled by the growth of 16% per annum in the volume of manufactured
exports. The manufacturing sector, which now contributes 32% of GNP, is
expected to provide 54% of the increase in GNP during the Plan period,
increasing at 14.3% a year. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 30% to about 42% in 1981,
with the manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total exports compared
with 85% in 1975. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in effi-
ciency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage will gradually shift
towards manufactures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which
require relatively more skilled labor. It is also necessary to achieve some
import substitution in steel and chemicals to ensure an adequate supply of
intermediate inputs for the export industries. These changes in the indus-
trial structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms for
the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate indi-
genous technology.
12.       The Plan targets for exports are challenging but appear to be
attainable, given the extraordinary drive of the Korean exporters, a con-
tinuation of the present level of export incentives and the assumption that
the economies of the OECD countries will grow at an average rate of around
4-5% annually while the volume of world trade expands at an annual rate of
about 8% during the period.
13.       Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the
mobilization of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is
expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization of
private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the move-
ment of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. The terms of trade are



- 4 -
projected to be fairly stable through the Fourth Plan period and a rate of
inflation of the order of 10% a year is foreseen. The Government has taken
measures designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be gener-
ated by these developments to an increasing extent into the financial sys-
tem, and, thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In
addition to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of
savings, the measures include the imposition of a capital gains tax at the
rate of 50% on undeveloped land, and 30% on nonprincipal household dwellings.
Funds that went into real estate are now flowing into the securities market
where the after-tax yields are more attractive. At the same time, direct
measures have been taken to force corporations to "go public," thus increas-
ing the supply of corporate securities. Steps are also being taken to
increase the variety of financial securities in terms of maturities, yields
and conditions that would constitute an attractive package to investors.
14.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings are
being supported by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surchage imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value-added tax intro-
duced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban consumers through
the Grain Management Fund and the Fertilizer Fund is being reduced. The
increased resource mobilization and the strong restraint on most current
expenditures will result in substantial budgetary current surpluses which
could be used to finance capital expenditures.
15.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.    The con-
tinued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light of the
need to create additional employment for the growing labor force. Further-
more, the predominant role the export sector is expected to play is appro-
priate in view of Korea's limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the
manpower and the entrepreneurial capacity to implement the Plan's investment
program. The Plan strikes a reasonable balance between the various objec-
tives of increasing employment, maintaining a minimum growth of per capita
incomes, strengthening the balance of payments and making progress towards
diversifying the industrial structure so as to sustain export growth in the
1980s.
16.       The main impediment to the successful implementation of the Plan
is likely to be the difficulty that Korea may encounter in raising the
necessary resources. As indicated above, Korea's ability to meet its invest-
ment requirements from domestic savings may fall short of the Plan projec-
tions, while a sizeable continuing inflow of external capital will also be
necessary to help meet the burden of amortizing the external debt. It is
estimated that Korea may need to borrow an average of $2.5 billion per annum
over the next several years, and its ability to obtain foreign capital in
adequate amounts and in reasonable terms will continue to be a challenge.
The servicing of the debt should not pose serious difficulties given the
present debt servicing ratio and the prospects for continued export growth
provided that the proportion of external debt incurred on shorter term and at
high interest rates is not excessive. On the assumption that Korea can
obtain the required inflow of capital on reasonable terms, the debt service
ratio which now stands at around 11% is expected to decline slowly to just
under 10% at the end of the decade and remain at that level during the 1980s.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       As of April 30, 1977, Korea had received 31 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, totalling $1,417.3 million in loans
and $106.9 million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the
refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
18.       A substantial part ($558.2 million) of Bank financing has been for
the transport sector - $219.7 million for railways, $191.5 million for
highways and $147 million for ports. $289.5 million has been lent for
agricultural projects. The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has
received $150 million, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) $142.5 million, and
the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) $30 million in Bank loans for relending to
private industry. A total of $80.3 million has been provided for three
education projects; $25.0 million for a tourism project; $15.0 million for a
secondary cities project; and $60 million for a rural infrastructure project.
In addition, two Program Loans amounting to $175 million have also been
granted to Korea.
19.       As of April 30, 1977, $574.6 million of the total Bank lending
remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits, mostly from commitments
in the past two years. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans,
IDA Credits, and IFC Investments as of that date and Notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As indicated in the Notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory.
20.       Excluding one project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had by
April 30, 1977, entered into 16 commitments totalling $69.0 million (net
of participations and cancellations). On March 22, 1977, the Board approved
an investment of up to $15.37 million in the Korea Development Leasing
Corporation (KDLC), of which up to $10.0 million will be sold to partici-
pants. A project for the production of special and stainless steel is in an
advanced stage of preparation and under preliminary consideration are projects
in cement distribution and construction materials.
21.      The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and rural
development is reflected in the Bank's lending program for FY77. The Miho
Watershed Area Development Project, the Second Agricultural Credit Project,
and the Yong San Gang II Project, were approved by the Executive Directors
in July and September 1976 and in January 1977, respectively.
22.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural sectors
and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent infrastructural
development. Although the transport sector will be given less emphasis than
in the past, the investments required are large, and thus there is considerable
support for this sector in the proposed program.
23.       The development of the various sectors of Korea's economy necessitates
continued promotion of the educational sector with emphasis on vocational and



- 6 -
technical training. The participation of the Bank in this effort was accom-
plished through the approval of three projects, for a total of $80.3 million.
The Bank's support has had the broad objective of technical manpower develop-
ment, through an expansion of the relevant segments of the educational system
and through specific quality improvements. While the first two projects
were addressed to priority needs in various segments of the system (and were,
therefore, somewhat heterogeneous), the third project includes a major com-
ponent aimed specifically at developing a new subsystem of vocational training.
The First Project, supported by Credit 151-KO provided in 1969 ($14.8 million),
covered extensions to and equipping of 27 technical, commercial, agricultural,
agricultural-technical, and comprehensive high schools; one post-secondary
agricultural and four technical schools; four university departments of
education; and related technical assistance. Project implementation was
delayed initially because of the late arrival of consultants and the relative
inexperience regarding equipment procurement, but proceeded well later on.
The project met or exceeded its most important objectives in both physical
and educational terms.
24.       The Second Project continued to assist the Government in the imple-
mentation of its economic development policies through the improved alignment
of the education sector with the needs of agriculture, industry, and social
development. The project is about a year behind schedule because of time-
consuming procurement procedures and under-staffing of the procurement unit
in the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK). Progress on civil works
was temporarily slowed because of the shortage of counterpart funds in 1976.
These difficulties have now been overcome, and the project is proceeding
satisfactorily; it is expected that an extension of the Closing Date by about
one year would be needed because of initial delays.
25.       The Third Project comprises two subprojects:   the financing of
facilities and equipment for various educational establishments at high school
and post-secondary levels under the Ministry of Education; and of seven new
Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs) under the Office of Labor Affairs (OLA).
The implementation of the former component is generally on schedule, while that
of the latter is about six months behind schedule due to changes in course
structure and location of some project institutions.
26.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt
(disbursed) outstanding at the end of 1975 was about 8.7%, and the share
of debt service was of the order of 4.6% at that time. These ratios are
expected to increase to around 18% and 11% by the end of the present decade.
PART III - THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR: MANPOWER NEEDS
27.        Korean society has traditionally placed a high value on education
as a cultural and social asset and this is reflected in Government outlays
as well as in private household expenditures. The investment in education has
had a significant impact on the quality of the labor force. The breadth and
intensity of the improvement in educational attainment has made a major con-
tribution to the country's economic development. Formal education in Korea,



-7-
as early as the mid-fifties, was at a stage comparable with that of countries
enjoying income levels thrice as high. Compulsory primary education was
introduced in 1948 and has covered the provision of a basic education of
six years to an entire generation since then. Thus today, virtually all
persons in age groups below 50 years are literate. This investment in
education contributed in large measure to the success of the export-oriented
industrialization strategy pursued over the last decade, since the availa-
bility of a skilled and adaptable work force enabled concentration on labor-
intensive industries (such as textiles, clothing, electronics and plywood)
and partially compensated for Korea's limited resource endowment. The
quality and widespread distribution of educational opportunities also facili-
tated the rapid evolution of an efficient managerial and entrepreneurial
class which displayed considerable skill and initiative in the exploitation
of export possibilities.
28.        Korea's long-term industrial plans are based on the premise that
the growth-path followed over the last decade can be extrapolated through
the early 1980s by continuing to rely on export-led industrial growth to
provide the momentum for economic development. However, the pattern of
economic growth is expected to change and show a much greater emphasis on
investment in heavy industry both in order to realize the benefits of import
substitution and to counteract the effects of the trend towards protection-
ism in some of Korea's potential markets and of increasing competition from
other developing countries with lower labor costs.
29.       The accelerated pace of industrial development and the increasing
complexity of the production process call for a labor force with a higher
degree of technical competence, regardless of the occupational level, and
require continuing large-scale efforts in education and training. The Fourth
Plan provides for a tripling of the investment in education and manpower
development, as compared with the previous Plan. It is proposed to expand
enrollment at all educational levels above the primary schools and to improve
the quality of vocational and scientific training.
30.       The demand and supply projections for technical manpower over the
Fourth Plan period (1977-81) indicate a net surplus of 6,000 scientists/
engineers, and a deficit of 8,000 technicians by 1981 (or 6 and 5% respec-
tively of the projected 1981 stocks). However, in view of the inevitable
margins of error inherent in manpower projections, it is expected that the
aggregate supply of subprofessional and professional manpower will roughly be
in balance with the requirements of the economy.
31.       For the category of skilled workers /1 (craftsmen and operatives),
the projections indicate that, without the proposed project, the period
1977-81 would be characterized by sizeable deficits, totaling more than
300,000 or 20% of the estimated 1981 stock. This justifies a continuation
of the Government's reliance on a variety of vocational training modes to
/1 In Korea, the term "skilled worker" applies to occupations that would be
classified as "skilled" or "semi-skilled" elsewhere. Unless otherwise
indicated, this report follows the Korean terminology.

exploit, to the extent possible, the potential of the formal and nonformal
training systems as well as of in-plant training. Based on present relative
training capabilities and expected additions to them, the Government has
allocated training targets in terms of numbers of trainees as follows: the
formal system (under the Ministry of Education) is to train 30% and nonformal
modes (under the Office of Labor Affairs) are to contribute 70%. Of the
latter share, 15% has been attributed to the Vocational Training Institutes
(VTIs), and 55% to in-plant training schemes.
The Vocational Training System
32.       There are three main sources for the supply of skilled and semi-
skilled industrial workers in Korea: (a) technical high schools /1 with
a three-year course under the Ministry of Education; (b) vocational training
centers with a variety of public or private sponsors and with courses ranging
in duration from a few weeks to two years; and (c) on-the-job training in
industry sponsored by the private sector.
33.       Enrollments in the country's 42 public and 30 private technical
high schools account for roughly one quarter of the 480,000 vocational high
school pupils. The programs encompass three broad areas: mechanical,
electrical, and chemical engineering. Curricula contain about 60% theoretical
subjects and 40% practical work of about 1,250 hours over the 3-year course,
giving the pupils a degree of practical proficiency slightly below the skilled
worker level. However, the amount of theoretical instruction provided would
mean that the graduate enjoys a great degree of flexibility and a definite
possibility of future occupational growth. The lack of appropriate equipment
in the past seriously hampered the proper operation of the technical high
schools; however, with the upgrading of existing, and the establishment
of new technical high schools under the Bank Group's three education projects,
and the simultaneous increase in class size from 40 to 60 students, the annual
output can be expected to increase to some 28,000 by 1980, more than half of
the 52,000 graduates anticipated in the manpower projections. The Government
currently plans to upgrade the technical high school system, and the tentative
allocation of $135 million in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) for the
improvement of vocational high schools appears to be broadly consistent with
this aim.
34.       Vocational training facilities in Korea (other than the vocational
high schools) operate under three main agencies: those of the Central
Government, the local governments, and the private sector. The Central
Government subsystem includes 56 centers with about 16,500 trainees in 1976
sponsored by the Ministry of Justice (about 6,500), the Ministry of Defense
(4,000), and the Office of Labor Affairs (5,000), the remaining trainees being
enrolled in 6 smaller centers. Local (mainly provincial) governments operate
15 vocational training facilities (slightly over 3,000 trainees); of these,
/1 Training in industrial trades is carried out in technical high schools,
in some agricultural and in comprehensive high schools. The more general
term "vocational high school" applies to all nongeneral high schools:
agricultural, technical, commercial and comprehensive.



-9-
8 Rural Vocational Training Centers (RVTCs) were established with UNICEF/ILO
assistance. Organized vocational training in the private sector falls into
two broad categories: (a) accredited vocational training recognized by the
Office of Labor Affairs (OLA) following specific qualification criteria in
nonprofit institutions organized as "Juridical Bodies" under public law, and
(b) in-plant (on-the-job) training. The first category comprises 34 centers
and over 15,000 trainees, the second (in-plant vocational training facilities)
includes 396 centers with about 39,000 trainees. It is also estimated that
about a third of the 1,350 nonagricultural establishments with more than 200
employees that have a vocational training obligation already have vocational
training facilities.
35.       The most significant component of vocational training under the
Central Government is the network of Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs)
under the Office of Labor Affairs (OLA). The reasons for this are: the
close institutional links between OLA and industry, the foreign sponsoring of
virtually all VTIs, and the concentration on key industrial trades. At
present seven VTIs are in operation and two more will open in 1977. They
will be joined by five VTIs in 1978 and two in 1979, financed under the Bank's
Third Education Project. Without the proposed project, by 1980 OLA will be
operating 16 VTIs with a total of almost 7,000 places and will be able to
train more than 10,000 skilled workers in 1-1/2 shift operation. VTIs enroll
middle school (grade 9) leavers in a one-year regular course completed by a
craftsmen test consisting of a theoretical exam and a practical skill test.
Besides the regular day course, VTIs organize evening courses that can be
replicas of the day course, or adaptation courses for industrial workers.
36.       VTI instructors are recruited among high school leavers (grade 12
completed) and trained in a two-year course at the Central Vocational Training
Institute (CVTI) at Incheon, near Seoul. The CVTI also conducts short-term
training courses for in-plant vocational instructors. VTIs suffer from a
shortage of instructors, as only 60% of the CVTI graduates become instructors,
30% are drafted into military service and the remaining 10% are recruited by
industry at more attractive salaries. As a result, of the 309 authorized
positions of instructors for the VTIs that are in operation, 45 are vacant.
There is a more serious shortage at the CVTI of instructor-trainers who are
usually recruited among graduates of university engineering departments. The
reason seems to be that the position and salary of CVTI instructor-trainers
are inferior to those of alternative job opportunities for those graduates.
As a result about 50% of the budgeted teaching positions are currently vacant.
The Government has taken measures to resolve the issue of shortage of VTI
Instructors and CVTI Instructor-Trainers; these measures include: the provi-
sion of rent-free staff housing for all VTIs and the CVTI, which would amount
to an increase in real salaries of up to 100%, the bonding of CVTI graduates
for a period of four years, arrangements to offset the effects of the drafting
for military service of graduates, increase the enrollment and adjust the
duration of the training in the CVTI. In addition, other measures are being
initiated to ensure that there would be no shortage in the future. The
Government will establish, by December 31, 1977, a plan acceptable to the Bank
to resolve this issue (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 10 -
37.       Direct supervision of the VTIs and the CVTI and indirect super-
visicn of other vocational training is vested in the Vocational Training
Bureau (VTB) of the OLA. The Bureau has 18 professional staff which is
inadequate in view of the imminent expansion of the VTI system and the new
administrative and technical tasks that will result from the implementation
of the Basic Law for Vocational Training (e.g., the establishment of aggre-
gate annual sectoral and occupational training targets, the review of annual
training programs for establishments falling under the Law, and the assess-
ment of contributions to the Cost-Sharing Fund for Vocational Training). This
will require an expansion and strengthening of the Vocational Training Bureau
(VTB). OLA has prepared an outline of the future staffing of the VTB. A
tentative Staff Expansion Plan designed to provide 28 additional posts to
the VTB and 110 posts for the district offices administered by VTB was being
considered by the agencies concerned in Korea, and it is expected that a
decision on it would be taken shortly. The Government also confirmed during
negotiations its intention to communicate to the Bank detailed information on
the new administrative structure of VTB and the specific functions of the
additional staff and to exchange views with the Bank from time to time regard-
ing further increases (Section 3.09 of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.       The VTIs are financed entirely from the Central Government Budget.
Trainees do not pay any fees for courses, lodging, and school uniforms and
may receive a subsidized loan to cover the expenses of school meals. However,
under the Basic Law for Vocational Training (December 1976), a trainee is
obligated to work in the enterprise assigned to him on graduation for a period
of at least twice the length of his training. The Government has set up the
VTIls with the explicit purpose of providing an educational alternative for
deserving pupils from low-income families, mostly from rural areas, who for
finarcial reasons cannot continue their education. For the same reasons, it
provides boarding for all trainees - a policy which the Bank supported in the
Third Education Project through the inclusion of 50% of the VTI boarding
facilities.
39.       In addition to the 16 VTIs referred to in paragraph 35, the Govern-
ment plans to establish 8 VTls with 450 places each, in the years 1978 and
1979, so that by 1980 the OLA system would comprise 24 VTIs and the CVTI,
an average of two to three VTIs per province. The Government also intends
during the Fourth Five-Year Plan to anchor the VTls more firmly in their
regional economies and convert them into vocational training corporations
with the status of Juridical Bodies. This would mean that local industry
would become involved in the planning and implementation of VTI programs
through their representatives on the Board of Directors, although OLA would
retain the right of ultimate control of financing, personnel, training and
examinations. This change in their legal status will enable VTIs to tap
additional sources of revenue, e.g. through consulting services to industry,
and provide them with a greater measure of budgetary flexibility.



- 11 -
40.       Another important development in vocational training will be the
transfer of an increasing share of the training responsibilities to the
private sector. Under the Basic Law for Vocational Training, the Government
will enforce a training obligation that has been in existence for two years.
It involves firms with more than 200 employees who are expected to provide
vocational training for up to 10% of their work force each year either through
an in-plant training scheme with a variety of incentives to the firm, or by
paying a training levy based on the average training costs of the trades
represented in the enterprise. The setting of annual global, sectoral,
and occupational targets by OLA would permit a timely response to changing
labor market conditions.
IV - THE PROJECT
41.       The proposed project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited
Korea in October 1976. A report entitled "Appraisal of a Vocational Training
Project" (No. 1432-KO, dated June 17, 1977) based on its findings is being
distributed separately. Supplementary Project Data are given in Annex III.
Negotiations were held in Washington from June 6 to 9, 1977 with a Korean
delegation led by Mr. Heung-Koo Kang, Economic Counsellor at the Korean
Embassy in Washington.
42.       The proposed project would constitute the second phase of the Bank's
support for Korea's vocational training system and with it the network of VTIs
would include two to three VTIs per province, i.e. a geographic coverage that
would obviate the need to transfer large numbers of trainees between provinces.
Since all VTIs will be located in, or close to, urban agglomerations or indus-
trial estates, this will also permit close and continuing contact with the
majority of industrial establishments and will facilitate placement of VTI
graduates in appropriate jobs. Its main objectives are:
(a) to contribute to the supply of technical manpower at skilled
and semi-skilled worker levels needed for the country's industrial
development;
(b) to provide out-of-school youth with a means to acquire skills
that would make them employable in industry;
(c) to strengthen vocational instructor-training, and
(d) to provide technical assistance in the field of in-plant
vocational training.
The Project Components
43.       The major components of the proposed project are:
(a) Establishment of Eight Vocational Training Institutes.
To assist in the construction, furnishing, and equipping of



- 12 -
eight additional VTIs with 450 places each. The project would
include boarding facilities for 50% of the trainees. It would
comprise facilities for eight trades: turning, machine fitting,
welding, electrical fitting, plumbing, sheet metal work, pipe
fitting and milling, with each VTI teaching five of these trades,
reflecting the local industrial structure and labor market con-
ditions. The locations tentatively selected by the Government for
the new VTIs are Sasang, Naju, Nonsan, Weonju, Chungmu (or Rojae),
Hongseong, Kimcheon and Pyeongtaek (or Panwol) (see Map); the
first four are planned to be constructed in 1978.
(b) Investment in the Central Vocational Training Institute.
To assist in financing equipment in the fields of precision measure-
ment, metal finishing, electrical fitting, machining, sheet metal -
work and welding. This will improve the general quality of instruc-
tor training, and permit an expansion of enrollments in the regular
two-year courses from about 660 to 750 and of the annual output of
instructors from about 320 to 370.
(c) Technical Assistance. To support the other project components and
to provide specific expertise needed for the large-scale introduction
of in-plant vocational training. The technical assistance would be
allocated within the vocational training system as follows: 6 man-
years of specialist services for the VTB (to be financed under the
proposed loan); 10-1/4 man-years of specialist services and 2 man-
years of fellowships for the CVTI (to be financed by UNDP), and
8 man-years of specialist services and 20 man-years of fellowships
for the VTIs (to be financed by the Federal Republic of Germany).
44.       The impact of the proposed project would be as follows:
Number of places       Increase  Additional Output
Item                    Existing /a    New   Total    in %      per annum /b

/b Assuming 1-1/2 shift operations (regular courses only).
/c Numbers rounded to nearest hundred.

Project Implementation
45.       Responsibility.  The project unit established in the Office of
Labor Affairs for the implementation of the OLA component of the Third
Education Project would be responsible for administration, financial control,
and liaison with the Bank. Three additional full-time staff have been appoint-
ed to the project unit and the Government has undertaken to maintain the unit
with the necessary organization, staff, functions and responsibilities (Sec-
tion 3.01 of the draft Loan Agreement). This will strengthen supervision of
the design and construction of civil works, and of delivery and installation
of equipment. Civil works would follow the space standards and equipment
lists established for the VTIs in the Third Education Project, and sketch
plans for major civil works and major components of lists of furniture and
equipment would be reviewed by the Bank before procurement.
46.       Administration.  The imminent growth of the VTI system and the new
administrative and technical tasks of the Vocational Training Bureau (VTB),
due to the large-scale introduction of in-plant vocational training, make
expansion and strengthening of the VTB mandatory. As indicated in paragraph
37, the VTB staff is being strengthened to cope with the increasing volume and
complexity of the work for which it is responsible.
47.       Sites.  Four out of eight sites for the new VTIs have been selected.
The Government has informed the Bank that it would complete the selection of
suitable sites for all VTIs by October 31, 1977. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to acquire sites at least three months before the planned
start of construction.
48.       Professional Services.  Design and supervision of civil works would
be the responsibility of consultant firms that are acceptable to the Bank and
selected and commissioned by OLA on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). The services of qualified
consultant firms are available in Korea.
Project Costs and Financing
49.       The total project costs are estimated at $56.2 million equivalent.
This includes the cost of staff housing to be financed by the Government, the
bilateral and UNDP-financed technical assistance and contingencies. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at $29.1 million, or 52% of total
project cost. A breakdown of costs is given in the Loan and Project Summary.
Construction estimates are based on the recent cost of similar institutions in
Korea and refer to April 1977 prices. Average building cost per square meter
of $145 is reasonable and compares well with construction costs in other East
Asian countries. The estimated unit capital cost per place of about $7,000
exceeds the unit capital cost for the VTIs under the Third Education Project
as estimated during appraisal ($5,500) by about 25%. This difference is
attributable to price increases in the 2-1/2 year time interval between the
two estimates (more than 20%) and to the inclusion of spare parts and safety
equipment in the proposed project. Technical assistance cost was estimated on
the basis of $50,000 per man-year for expert services. Physical contingencies



- 14 -
for unforeseen factors amount to 10% for site development, construction,
furniture and professional services and 7.5% for equipment. A price contin-
gency of $10.7 million has been included based on expected price increases
for civil works of 9% annually during the period 1977-1979 and 8% in 1980,
and for equipment and furniture of 7.5% in each of the years 1977 through
1979 and of 7% in 1980.
50.       The proposed loan of $23.0 million would finance 41% of total
project cost, including contingencies. The balance would be met by the
Government (55%) and the UNDP and the Federal Republic of Germany (4%).
Incremental recurrent expenditure generated by this project would amount to
about W 2.1 billion per annum in 1976 prices, slightly over 30% of the total
estimated recurrent VTB budget for 1980. This additional expenditure would
not cause budgetary difficulties because the Government assigns high priority
to the development of its vocational training system, of which the proposed
project is an integral part.
Procurement
51.       The project unit in OLA will work closely with the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea (OSROK) for the procurement of civil works, furniture and
equipment. Contracts for civil works and furniture would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding following domestic advertising and local pro-
cedures satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign contractors would be allowed to
participate. Korea's construction industry is large and efficient, and all
civil works in the First, Second, and Third Education Projects have been
awarded to local contractors, even though foreign firms were allowed to
participate. Prior Bank approval would be required for all civil works
contracts exceeding $250,000 equivalent. Equipment contracts of $100,000
equivalent and over would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines; domestic manufacturers
would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the existing customs duty,
whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports.
Equipment purchases that cannot reasonably be grouped to form contracts for
at least $100,000 equivalent would be awarded without prior Bank approval on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following Government
procedures that are satisfactory to the Bank, provided that the aggregate of
all such contracts shall not exceed $3,500,000 equivalent. In addition,
off-the-shelf items, not exceeding $10,000 in each contract and amounting to
less than $500,000 equivalent in the aggregate could be purchased on the
basis of a minimum of three quotations.
Disbursement
52.       The proposed loan would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported equipment;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured
equipment;
(c) 70% of the cost of imported and locally procured equipment;



- 15 
(d) 25% of the expenditure (excluding that on staff housing) on
civil works, professional services, and furniture; and
(e) 100% of the cost of technical assistance, excluding the UNDP
and bilaterally financed components.
53.       These percentages, except for category (b), are roughly equivalent to
the relevant foreign exchange components. The estimated disbursement schedule
is given in the Loan and Project Summary. Disbursement is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1981. Construction, equipment and furniture procure-
ment should be completed in about three years because preparations for implemen-
tation are in an advanced stage and most standard designs are already available,
and all elements of the proposed project would be implemented in about 4-1/2
years.
Benefits, Justification and Risks
54.       The proposed project would contribute to industrial development in
Korea, particularly to the expansion of heavy and chemical industries, through
the provision of training facilities for skilled workers. In supporting a
flexible and industry-oriented mode of training, it would have a built-in
element of adaptability to changing market conditions. More specifically,
the project would:
(a) increase the annual training capability for skilled and
semi-skilled workers in the VTI system by 5,400 or 53%, and
would create a situation of approximate balance between the
supply and demand for skilled workers;
(b) expand and improve the Central Vocational Training Institute
to provide an adequate supply of properly trained instructors
to support the growth of the VTI system; and
(c) provide, under the technical assistance component, expertise
relevant for establishing a large-scale in-plant vocational
training network.
55.       The proposed project would support the Government's aim of promoting
social equity specifically through the provision of boarding places mostly for
rural trainees, amounting to 50% of total enrollments, and generally through
the development of the VTI system itself which would constitute an alternative
means of industrial skill acquisition (and subsequent employment) for deserving
middle-school graduates from low-income families.
56.       The realization of these benefits depends on the fulfillment of two
important conditions, namely: (a) a sufficient and timely supply of VTI
instructors and, a fortiori, trainers for the future instructors; and (b) the
development of an adequate and appropriate administrative and technical
infrastructure in OLA to cope with both the expansion of the VTI system and
new tasks deriving from the introduction of in-plant vocational training and
related changes in the administration, funding and supervision of vocational
training in the private sector.



- 16 -
57.       The extension of the tracer system, to be established for the VTIs
financed under the Third Education Project, to the institutions included
in the proposed Vocational Training Project, in the form of a performance
monitoring system in all the project institutions, would ensure a regular
feedback of data on project performance and would permit an early recognition
and correction of weaknesses in project design or operation (Section 3.06 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
58.       Possible risks associated with the project will be greatly reduced
by appropriate Government measures. The Government has taken, or is about to
introduce, appropriate measures to ensure smooth project implementation and
successful operation of the project institutions. These measures include
the appointment of three additional full-time staff to the existing unit of
OLA, the selection of sites for the first group of four VTIs to be built in
1978, steps to eliminate present and future shortages of VTI instructors and
CVTI instructor trainers, and the preparation of a phased program of expansion
for the VTB during the period of the Fourth Plan (1977-81).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Loan Agreement follows the pattern of Bank agreements for vocational
training projects. Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III
of Annex III to this report.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795     Yong San Gang Irri&ation Project; US$33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283   and US$15.0 Million Credit of February 2. 1972; Effective
Date: September 15. 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
The project, located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. Works are expected to be completed in mid-1978, about
.18 months behind schedule. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams and later when rapid inflation outpaced the alloca-
tion of local funds. The dams have now been completed and good progress is
being made on other works. The project cost is estimated at about US$151 mil-
lion compared to US$88.6 million at appraisal being financed at present by
the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD); but because of increases in rice and
barley prices, the economic rate of return of 14% is close to the appraisal
estimate.
Loan No. 942     Seeds Prolect; US$7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973:
Effective Date: April 24. 1974: Closing Date: December
31, 1978
The project consists of: (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm machinery for seed pro-
duction; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation
of a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irriga-
tion and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary
legislative and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and estab-
lishing an "Office for Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken.
Project implementation although one year behind the appraisal schedule, is
proceeding satisfactorily. Project cost (OSPD/NAPIO components) have increased
from the appraisal estimates of about US$14.0 million to more than US$20.0 mil-
lion. Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected at appraisal but
is expected to substantially improve in FY77/78.
L1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 994      Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project;
US$13.0 Million Loan of June 7, 1974; Effective Date:
March 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project provides long-term funds to the Agriculture and
Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC) for onlending to subborrowers in the
private sector for the purpose of integrating on farm production of fruits and
vegetables with modern hygienic processing facilities, using land that is
presently idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved are
mainly asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry and
peach. The project is to be implemented over a four-year period, and AFDC
lending of project funds to subborrowers is being channelled through the
National Agriculture Cooperative Federation. The project became effective in
March 1975 at a time when Korea's export markets were adversely affected by
the worldwide economic recession. With the global economic upturn in 1976
and the consequent improvement in foreign demand for Korea's processed food,
investor demand for modernization and expansion of agricultural processing
facilities improved. Thus, significant progress in project implementation
has been achieved since November 1975. Project lending for processing facil-
ities, mushroom growing houses, and asparagus cultivation was initiated in
recent months, and loan demand is expected to pick up momentum in the coming
year. On farm development of oak mushrooms, which has been implemented on
schedule since the outset of the project, continues to progress satisfac-
torily.   However, in view of the absence of lending in 1975 for processing
facilities, which accounts for nearly 70% of total project costs, implemen-
tation of the project as a whole will be further delayed.
Loan No. 1193     Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
US$15.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of: (a) the establishment of about 450
new dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of
the First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the
expansion of existing processing plants, the diversification of their
production, the establishment of two milk collection centers and fifty small
milk cooling units and the construction of a frozen milk products plant at
Yeongnam; and (d) the expansion of technical services for both farm develop-
ment and milk processing.
Loan No. 1216    Rural Infrastructure Project; US$60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T   US$40.0 Million Third Window; Effective Date: June 4, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project includes about 62 minor irrigation, 29 upland reclama-
tion, 11,000 fuelwood, 900 roads and bridges, 4,200 water supply, and 2,700
rural electrification subprojects. Technical assistance is provided for
upland reclamation and improvements to hydrologic services. Special evalua-
tion studies are also included. Project implementation is on schedule,
costs and disbursements are all close to appraisal estimates. The monitoring

Industrial Sector
Loan No. 905     Fourth KDFC Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of June 13,
1973; Effective Date: September 10, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1095     Korea Development Bank Project; US$60.0 Million Loan
of March 31, 1975; Effective Date: June 17, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project provided funds to KDB to make subloans to finance direct
imports for subprojects principally in the manufacturing and transportation
sectors. Almost the full amount has already been committed to finance 31 sub-
projects, ahead of the time estimated at appraisal. Disbursements now amount
to over 94% of the loan amount, also ahead of the original estimate. KDB's
performance in using the loan has been highly satisfactory.
Loan No. 1145     Fifth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
US$55.0 Million Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective Date:
September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The loan covers about half the KDFC's foreign exchange
requirements through the end of 1977. The proceeds are used to finance
direct imports of machinery and equipment, and the foreign exchange component
of domestically produced capital goods and of civil works. About 82% of the
loan proceeds have already been disbursed.
Loan No. 1175     Medium Industry Bank (MIB); US$30.0 Million Loan of
November 26, 1975; Effective Date: January 28, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The project provides funds to MIB to make subloans to small-
and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises over two years. The project
is progressing satisfactorily. Disbursements are at present over 57%
of the total loan.
Loan No. 1338     Second Korea Development Bank Project; US$82.5 Million
Loan, of which US$7.5 Million for the Korea Industrial
Leasing Company, of November 16, 1976; Effective Date:
March 23, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project provides $75.0 million to be used by KDB to make
subloans and investments to finance direct imports for industrial subprojects

during the period 1977-78; the remainder of the loan, $7.5 million, would be
relent by KDB to its wholly-owned subsidiary KILC, which would use these
funds to acquire machinery, equipment, facilities and other property to be
leased to investment enterprises during the same period.
Education Sector
Loan No. 906     Second Education Project; US$23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394   US$20.0 million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973: Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides equipment for, and extensions to, 75 educa-
tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education.
The project execution is now about 12 months behind schedule. The principle
cause of delay has been slow equipment procurement owing to staff shortages
in the Office of Supply (OaROK). The Government is taking steps to overcome
the source of delay. All eqiipment lists have been approved; tenders have
been made for US$28 million, and contracts have been awarded for US$11 mil-
lion. Total project cost remains at US$75.8 million, about 8% above the
appraisal estimates. Disbursements are expected to reach US$20 million by
the end of FY77. Covenant requirements under the Development Credit Agree-
ments are largely met. The project is now expected to be completed by
mid-1978, which requires an extension of the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1096    Third Education Project; US$22.5 Million Loan of March 31.
1975; Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes under the Office
of Labor Affairs (OLA). After 15 months of execution, project implementation
is about 3 months behind schedule but considerable progress has been made.
Site layouts and sketch plans have been approved for 11 institutions and one
is already under construction. All sites have been acquired. Remaining
sketch plans have been prepared and construction will begin at ten institutions
in 1977. Progress in equipment procurement is satisfactory. No cost overrun
is anticipated at this time. The chief problem, about which the Bank has
requested Government action, is temporary lack of counterpart funds which may
delay project implementation. Both MOE and OLA project units are functioning
satisfactorily.  Disbursements are expected to be made on schedule.
Tourism Sector
Loan No. 953     Kyongju Tourism Project; US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 4, 1974; Effective Date: May 6, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project forms part of the first phase of the planned development
of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose dam;



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 11 pages
an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of the
water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city of
Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and telecom-
munication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or realign-
ment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure including storm water drainage,
environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course; a school
for training hotel personnel; and a feasibility study for the development of
tourism on Cheju Island. Final design for almost all project components is
complete and several contracts have been awarded. Execution of the works,
however, is progressing slower than originally scheduled mainly due to a
rather slow start, and delay in water exploration. It appears likely, there-
fore, that project completion will have to be extended by one year to the end
of 1978. Considerable efforts are being made by the newly established Kyongju
Tourism Agency to promote hotel investors' interest and an agreement with a
major international hotel company for construction of the first hotel is now
in the final stage of negotiations. About 40% of the loan has been disbursed
and disbursements are expected to accelerate in the months ahead.
Regional Development
Loan No. 1070     Secondary Cities Regional Project; US$15.0 Million
Loan of January 15, 1975; Effective Date: August 18,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Construction on seven, out of nine subprojects, is
progressing on schedule. A contract for the eighth subproject will be awarded
shortly. Three housing sites, a city market and two access roads will be
completed by mid-1977. Consultants appointed to provide Technical Assistance
to Gwangju Regional Development Unit have started work. The project is nearly
a year behind appraisal schedule, mainly due to delays in fulfilling con-
ditions of effectiveness and establishing the Gwangju Regional Development
Unit. Total project costs are in line with the appraisal estimate of
$25.0 million, and disbursements as of April 30, 1977, were 22% of the loan
amount.
Transportation Sector
Loan No. 769      First Highway Project; US$54.5 Million Loan of June 29,
1971; Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The construction of approximately 370 km of national highways
between Jeonju and Busan was satisfactorily completed in December 1973,
at a final cost of about 5% above the appraisal estimate. Feasibility
studies and detailed engineering have been completed for 1,400 km and 900 km
of national highways, respectively. A study of road maintenance and the
establishment of a pilot maintenance organization formed the basis of the
creation of a country-wide Highway Maintenance Organization which is being
carried out under the Second Highway Project. The Closing Date has been



ANNEX II
Page 9 of 11 pages
extended by two years to permit completion of procurement of highway mainte-
nance equipment, and staff training. About 98% of the total loan amount has
already been disbursed.
Loan No. 863     Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
November 22, 1972; Effective Date: February 26, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The main elements of the project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 km of line running from Seoul to
the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision of yard
facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improvement of
facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and rolling stock.
No major problems have been encountered; most of the loan proceeds have been
committed, and over 95% already disbursed. The Closing Date has been extended
by a year to December 31, 1977 to allow time for the completion of procurement.
Loan No. 917     Ports Project; US$80.0 Million Loan of June 27, 1973;
Effective Date: September 18, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Six civil works contracts and three equipment supply contracts
are already let and work is proceeding satisfactorily except at Mukho which
is slightly behind schedule. A contract has also been let for the grain
handling facility but no work has started. Three civil works and one equip-
ment contract are out for bids. This will complete all contracting require-
ments for the project. Overall the project is about 50% completed and at
this stage only the grain handling facility appears likely to be delayed
(about six months) beyond the May 1978 target date for completion. Total
cost is currently estimated to be US$160 million with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$107 million. The Loan provides US$80 million foreign exchange
and the overrun is being financed by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD).
The Korea Maritime and Port Authority (KMPA) is being adequately staffed, but
there has been a delay in adopting operational and financial procedures
recommended by consultants appointed to advise KMPA on these matters. Dis-
bursements are at present about 40% of the total loan.
Loan No. 956     Second Highway Project; US$47.0 Million Loan of January 25,
1974; Effective Date: April 4, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The works, consisting of construction, chiefly on new alignments,
of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of a
further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the high-
ways opened to traffic in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equivalent,
exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future projects
of about 1,000 km of roads were started in August 1975, followed by detailed
engineering which is expected to be completed in mid-1977. Delay occurred
in setting up a new nationwide highway maintenance organization but the



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 11 pages
organization has now been established in accordance with decrees published
in June 1975. All the maintenance offices have been constructed and staffed
and equipment procured under the Loan. The Government has been requested to
increase the budgetary allocation to enable an adequate program of periodic
maintenance to be carried out. By the end of April 1977, disbursements were
above 97%
Loan No. 1101    Fifth Railway Project; US$100.0 Million Loan of April 10.
1975; Effective Date: July 15, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The project will help the Korean National Railroad (KNR) continue
as a major carrier of freight and passengers by helping in: the upgrading,
modernization and expansion of track, rolling stock, motive power, and other
equipment; the improvement of the efficiency of operation; and the strengthen-
ing of its financial position. The main components of the Project are: an
increase in station and line capacity and improvements in signalling; acquisi-
tion of rolling stock, diesel and electric locomotives, spare parts and repair
facilities; track renewal and improvement; bridge strengthening; completion
of electrification of 71 km of industrial lines; and other miscellaneous
items. Contracts, financed by the loan, have been signed for procurement of
passenger and freight cars, wheel sets, spares for locomotives, rail, bridge
girders and track maintenance machinery, amounting to about US$75 million
equivalent. About 66% of the loan proceeds have already been disbursed. In
connection with this loan, the Government undertook to formulate a financial
recovery plan for KNR and to discuss it with the Bank. A mission which
visited Korea in October 1976 discussed this matter with the authorities
concerned.
Loan No. 1203    Third Highway Project; US$90.0 Million Loan of
February 3, 1976; Effective Date: May 17, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The loan provides funds to help finance: (a) the construction,
chiefly on new alignments, including paving, of about 195 km of four national
highways, including supervision of the work by consultants; (b) paving and
improvement chiefly on present alignments, of nine national highways totalling
about 600 km, including supervision of the work by consultants; and (c) feasi-
bility studies by consultants of about 1,200 km of national and provincial
roads, to be followed by detailed engineering. Contracts for construction and
paving have been awarded and work is progressing on schedule. The Government
is currently drafting the terms of reference for feasibility studies. Dis-
bursements are already about 9% of the total loan.
