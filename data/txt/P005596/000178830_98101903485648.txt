APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        In August 1965, the International Development Association was asked
by the Tunisian government to help finance the construction and equipment of
31 multilateral secondary schools. Later, 3 agricultural centers were added
to the application.
ii.       The project, as now recommended, will comprise construction and
equipment for 15 secondary schools and 3 new agricultural training centers,
and equipment only for a further 16 secondary schools. If approved, the
project will constitute a second credit to Tunisia for the expansion of
secondary education. The first credit (TUN-29), approved in September 1962,
in the amount of $5.0 million, helped finance 6 schools with additional places
for 3,920 students, the construction of which is now complete.
iii.      Arising from the first credit, the Bank participated in financing a
study of secondary school building in Tunisia (London Group of Project
Consultants) directed at achieving maximum economy in accommodation and cost:
this and a further study simultaneously conducted by the Tunisian authorities
have together resulted in significant economies of the order of 20 - 30% as
compared with previous practice.
iv.       The estimated cost of the proposed project is $19.8 million.   This
includes $9.9 million for construction and equipment of 9 new schools, $3.7
million for expansion and equipment of 6 schools, $2.3 million for equipment
only of 16 schools, $1.3 million for the construction and equipment of 3 new
agricultural training centers, and $2.6 million for contingencies.
v.        The number of student places in the schools where both construction
and equipment would be financed through the proposed IDA development credit
would total 18,600 and, in the 16 remaining schools where equipment only is
financed, a further 27,000 students would be given increased opportunities
for scientific and technical training. In addition, the three agricultural
training centers would provide accommodation and equipment for 1,100 trainees.
vi.       The proposed project constitutes an important part of Tunisia's
educational development program. It is of high priority and fully justifiable.
Additional teachers are available for staffing schools under the project as
well as other schools to be newly constructed or expanded under the development
program. French teachers will continue to be required and will be provided
under bilateral agreement. The project represents a suitable basis for a
proposed IDA development credit of $13.0 million, i.e., about 66% of the
total cost of the project, and the Tunisian Government will provide the
remainder.

APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        In August 1965, the Tunisian government applied to the International
Development Association for a second credit to help finance the construction
and equipment of 31 multilateral secondary schools urgently required for the
country's education expansion program and the training of middle-level man-
power as envisaged in the Development Plan for the period 1965-1968. An
appraisal mission visited Tunisia from February 24 to March 24, 1966. Its
members were Messrs. Ahmad Tuqan (secondary education), Gunter Naleppa
(architect) and J. C. Jones (consultant, technical education).
2.        A Bank economic mission visited Tunisia in 1965 to review the 1965-
1968 Development Plan. Its report (No. AF-39a) was distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors on January 19, 1966. In particular, Volume VII on education
was of value and served as a useful guide to the mission in its appraisal of
Tunisia's present application as also were discussions with Unesco in Paris.
3.        The application as originally received concerned 19 schools on which
construction had not then started and 12 others where building had already
commenced. It was found by the appraisal mission, however, that construction
on some of the 19 schools had already commenced so as to accommodate new
admissions in October 1966 and 1967. The mission therefore considered each
school separately to determine whether modifications could be made to conform
to the desired standards of economy recommended by the report of the London
Group of Project Consultants engaged by the Bank and the Tunisian Government.
(see para.82) This was not possible in all cases and, in the result,
construction costs are included for 15 of the 31 schools.
4.        In addition to the multilateral schools in the Ministry of Education
plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, which is solely responsible for agricultural
education and training, has requested assistance in the financing of three
agricultural training centers. The present project consists, therefore, of
the construction and equipment of three agricultural training centers, the
construction and equipment of 15 multilateral schools either new or to be
expanded, and the provision of equipment only for 16 schools now under
construction.
5.        In September  1962, the first development credit was made to Tunisia,
marking the first IDA assistance to education. The credit, amounting to
$5 million, was for the construction and equipment of a Normal School for the
training of first-cycle secondary school teachers, a new technical lycee and
the expansion of another, and three multilateral secondary schools. The
credit is now almost fully withdrawn and the schools and lycees which it has
helped to finance are in operation with an enrolment capacity of 3,920 students.
The final costs fall within the range foreseen in the credit agreement.

Social and Economic Background
6.        Tunisia was a protectorate of France from 1880 until 1956.  Since
becoming independent in 1956 it has made considerable progress under the aegis
of a stable government. Though it is not rich in natural resources, sub-
stantial results have been obtained from exploitation of limited means. The
economy has expanded and development programs have been relatively well
conceived and executed. Gross domestic product (in 1960 prices) rose from
D.330 million in 1960 to D.415 million in 1964 and is projected under the
official plan to reach D.540 million by 1968, an average annual increase of
6.8%. New job creation is projected at a rate of about 2% per year.
7.        Administratively, Tunisia is divided into 13 districts (governorates)
with populations ranging between 220,000 and 700,000. Each district is sub-
divided into from five to ten delegations according to its size. In all there
are 94 delegations.
8.        The present population is estimated at 4.5 million, and is increasing
at a rate which is believed to be at least 2W per annum. The 1956 census
showed that one-third of the population was rural and two-thirds urban. It
was estimated in 1964 that Moslems formed 98.8% of the total population. The
distribution of the population by age groups (1956 census) is given in ANNEX 1.
9.        The status of women in Tunisia has changed remarkably since
independence. Girls are attending co-educational schools at all levels of
education and, though they are fewer than boys in school enrolment, a great
deal has been accomplished to increase their number and length of stay in
schools. Women's employment is on the increase in government offices, banks
and private enterprises.

II. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
10.       During the French administration of Tunisia, schooling was provided
for the European population and a limited number of Tunisians. In 1949, out
of 27,500 non-Tunisians from 5-14 years of age, 26,000 (94%) were in school,
but only 95,000 (12%) out of 775,000 Tunisians in the same age group. French
was the language of instruction from the lowest primary grade with Arabic
taught as a second language.
11.       Since independence (1956) the education system has undergone con-
siderable revision. Arabization of primary education has proceeded according
to a reasonable plan in which French continues to be taught as a second
language. Partial Arabization at the secondary school level is being under-
taken gradually but there is no intention of abandoning French either as a
second language or as a medium of instruction in certain subjects.
12.       Recent government policy indicates four major objectives;  namely,
(1) uniformity of the educational system, (2) T"re-nationalization" - to give to
Arabic language, Islamic studies and Arabic history a proper emphasis,
(3) adaptation of curricula to local needs, and (4) expansion of education at
all levels. The policy also lays down the structure of education as a primary
cycle followed by college moyen or full "secondary" education (ANNEX 2).  A
more detailed description of the system is given in the following paragraphs.
The Ministry of Education
13.       The Minister and his senior officers have held office for many years,
providing important continuity in policy. The Secretariat of the Ministry of
Education includes sections for administration, planning, cultural affairs
and youth counselling and sports. On the inspectorial level, technical edu-
cation has a chief inspector and a group of assistants all of whom are
competent and well experienced. There is a parallel section for general
education and teacher training staffed by experienced personnel. District
inspectorates with administrative and supervisory responsibilities at pro-
vincial level discharge their duties efficiently and their work is well co-
ordinated with the corresponding sections at headquarters.
Primary Education
1i.       Admission to primary education (six years' duration) is open to
children six years of age or over;  the curriculum includes Arabic, French,
arithmetic, history and geography, ethics and drawing.  The government aims
to achieve universal primary education as quickly as financial means permit
and with this in view teachers and classrooms are being used to the maximum
possible at present. In the lowest two grades, children attend for fifteen
hours a week instead of the usual twenty-five or thirty hours, making it
possible for teachers at this level to take two classes a day and for the
classroom to be used on a double-shift basis. In grades three to six, children
attend for twenty-five instead of thirty weekly hours so that five teachers
can be responsible for six classes. The curtailed school program has been
planned to give a well-rounded primary education by concentrating on the more
important aspects of the curriculum. Considerable economy in teaching



personnel has been achieved; while 6,200 teachers are normally required for
6,000 classes, the reduced program employs 5,300 teachers for 7,500 classes.
The saving in classroom requirement is also considerable, 7,500 classes
requiring only 4,400 classrooms.  As the crash-program nears its end, the
Ministry of Education intends progressively to increase the number of weekly
hours.
15.       Upon completion of the primary cycle, provision is made for some
40% of the graduates to take college moYen or secondary school studies: one-
third to the former and two-thirds to the latter.
College Moyen
16.       This course, of three years' duration, is intended for those leaving
the primary schools at a late age (14 to 17 years) either because of delayed
entry to the primary school or of repetition of classes. Such students are
not considered able to pursue the more exacting program of the secondary
school. The college moyen has three sections: general, commercial, and
industrial, the curricula for which are summarized in ANNEX 3.  With the weekly
hours allotted to languages, essential in commercial training, the time spent
in "special" studies is about 70%. In the industrial section, about 40% of the
total weekly hours are spent in workshops and with the time allotted to
ancillary subjects, about 70% of the timetable is spent in direct preparation
for employment. In these two sections, the time allotted to training for a
future career is appropriate.
17.       The "general" section of the college moyen offers a curriculum not
markedly different from that of the corresponding section of the secondary
school but at a somewhat lower level. It can be regarded as a form of com-
pensation for pupils who fail to gain admission to the secondary school but
suffers the disadvantage that only exceptionally does it lead to higher
channels of secondary education. In contrast with the commercial and technical
sections of the college moyen, it offers little direct preparation for employ-
ment. For these reasons the Four-Year Plan provides for an increase of 3% in
the commerce intake at the expense of the general course giving a new distri-
bution: general studies 17%, commercial studies 23%, and industrial studies
6o%.
Secondary Education
18.       Secondary education extends over six years of study divided equally
between first and second cycles. It has a dual aim: to provide the middle-
level cadre, both technical and non-technical, and to prepare students for
higher education suited to the country's higher manpower needs.
19.       During a common first year students take practical workshop training
and mechanical and artistic drawing, in addition to the usual general studies.
They are under observation during the whole year and undergo systematic
written and oral examinatio: s together with psycho-technical tests designed to
ascertain intellectual and practical aptitudes. At the end of the first year,
students are directed into one of three sections, general, economic or
technical, for which weekly timetables are summarized in ANNEX 4.



- 5 -
20.       In the second cycle, each of the main sections is divided into
separate specializations. The subjects and the number of weekly hours allotted
to each specialization in the second cycle are summarized in ANNEX 5 and show
that the programs are well-rounded and that the allocations to core subjects
are generally satisfactory. Certain policies in particular are noted
favorably:
(a) In the economics program general subjects are given more time
than specialized subjects, it being assumed that most students
will continue economic studies at the university level rather
than enter upon immediate employment.
(b) In the technical section the applied mathematics program
prepares students for higher training leading to an engineer-
ing degree, whereas the industrial programs are intended to
lead to direct employment.
Certain deficiencies in programs were observed during the appraisal, notably:
(a) that the mechanical engineering courses place greater emphasis
on manipulative skills (appropriate to craft training) than on
the laboratory and technological studies required for technician
training;
(b) that opportunities for specialized training of girls in
the industrial section are restricted, and
(c) that practical laboratory work in science teaching is
often inadequate.
These deficiencies have been discussed with the Ministry of Education and the
government has given assurances that corrective action will be taken.
Teacher Training
Primary Schools
21.       Pupils wishing to be trained as primary school teachers are selected
from among those completing the first cycle of secondary education. They
receive an attractive government grant throughout the whole of their training
embracing three years of general studies in the second cycle of secondary
education together with a further year of pedagogical training and supervised
periods of practice teaching. The course is residential to attract students
and carries an obligation to serve as a government teacher for a minimum
period of ten years. So far, the number of applications to enter the course
has been sufficient to meet the target of 25% of those leaving the first cycle
of the secondary school.
22.       On completion of the formal course, the trainee passes through a
probationary year of teaching service where he is subject to supervision and
guidance from inspectors and professional colleagues. His appointment may be
confirmed at the end of the year or, if performance has been less than satis-
factory, may be deferred for one or more further probationary years.



- 6 -
23.       The Ministry also recruits graduates at first cycle secondary level
from the traditional Zaituna (Islamic religious schools). After one year's
supervised teaching their appointment as teachers of Arabic and related
subjects is confirmed.
24.       Finally, the Ministry publicly invites applications from all
suitably qualified young persons to accept immediate appointments as emergency
teachers. Those who are appointed undertake a short but effective summer
course after which they are posted to schools where they are subject to the
usual period of supervised teaching. It is clear that the government is
following a very active policy in teacher recruitment and training.
First Cycle Secondary Schools and "College Moyen" System
25.       Teachers for the first level of secondary education are trained in
the Training College for Assistant Secondary School Teachers established with
the aid of the IDA first credit and developed with technical assistance under
a United Nations Development Program project. Selected at the end of the first
secondary cycle, trainees take the general subjects of the second cycle with
special reference to their needs as teachers rather than to the requirements
of university entrance: two years of pedagogic training follow. Graduates
from the school are still few in number but have achieved an excellent
reputation for the quality of their work as teachers.
Second Cycle Secondary Schools
26.       Secondary school teachers with university qualifications are
recruited from the several faculties of the University of Tunis or under bi-
lateral aid agreement from France. In order to maintain secondary education at
a reasonably high level, this latter source of supply must continue for some
time despite the higher salaries and other costs involved.
Higher Education
27.       The decree establishing Tunis University was issued on March 31,1960;
it has five faculties: Science, Letters, Law, Mloslem Theology, and Medicine.
28.       The University faculties are modelled on those of France with
instruction given in French except for the Faculty of Moslem Theology; a high
percentage of the teaching staff consists of French nationals. The level of
instruction is high and examination standards are satisfactory.
29.       Engineering and agriculture faculties have not yet been established:
those desiring to prepare for degrees in these subjects must study abroad. In
1964/65 approximately 5,000 students were studying at the University of Tunis
and 3,500 students were studying abroad.
30.       There are five other institutes of higher studies:  (1) the Advanced
Teacher Training College, (2) the Pedagogic Center, (3) the Advanced School of
Law, (h) the College for Advanced Commercial Studies and (5) the Normal School
for Assistant Secondary School Teachers. There are also four research centers
for (1) economics and social studies, (2) studies of arid zones, (3) atomic



- 7 -
physics and (4) audiovisual aids. Establishment of a new school of Business
Administration is under way.
Agricultural Education in Tunisia
31.       In common with most other countries, specialized agricultural
instruction is not given at the primary level but, in the rural schools at
least, much more could be done by way of illustration from the everyday
background of the children and by the introduction of extra-curricular work
involving common agricultural procedures.
32.       Formal agricultural education and training (ANNEX 6) begins at the
college moyen level and is the responsibility of the Mlnistry of Agriculture.
Courses of three years' duration are given in 16 of these colleges with entry
from among pupils who have completed their primary education and are not less
than 14 years of age. Upon leaving, some 60% of the pupils pass into a
vocational training school from which they emerge two years later as junior
technical assistants or as instructors in government or cooperative service: a
further 25% secure direct employment in farms and other agricultural under-
takings.
33.       For the remaining 15% of those leaving the college moyen three
agricultural schools (a fourth is under consideration) provide second cycle
secondary education leading to employment as senior technical assistants,
agricultural teachers, and farm managers. The course is of three years'
duration and provides for equal intake from the first cycle of general second-
ary education and from the agricultural college moyen; the former concentrates
upon agricultural subjects during the first year of the course and the latter
upon a general scientific training. During the second and third years, common
courses are followed in one of three main streams: a) scientific, b) technical,
and c) instructor training.
34.       Some 75% of the graduates leaving with the diploma of secondary
agricultural studies find immediate employment in government or other service
while the remaining 25% enter the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Agriculture de
Tunis (E.N.S.A.T.) where they are joined by entrants from the end of the
second cycle of general secondary education. The courses, of four years' and
six years' duration, lead to diploma awards as agricultural engineers and
agronomic engineers, respectively.
35.       An entirely different path leads from the primary school to the
Agricultural Vocational Training Center, of which twelve examples already
exist and three more are requested under the project. Recruiting at 14 years
or 15 years of age, the centers offer two-year courses leading to certificates
marking the completion of elementary agricultural studies or of agricultural
apprenticeship training.
36.       The curriculum includes general education and farm economics,
together with technical subjects, selected according to the area served, which
include irrigation, sheep farming, fruit farming, cattle rearing, forestry,
commercial grasses, horticulture, agricultural machinery, fishing and rural
feminine crafts. In addition to these full-time courses, producing practical
farmers with a sound knowledge of modern methods and techniques, the centers



- 8 -
also provide upgrading courses of from one week to three months' duration for
existing farm workers wishing to keep abreast of recent developments or to
qualify for promotion.
Vocational Training for Industry
37.       The Ministry of Social Affairs is concerned principally with
apprenticeship and adult training but, to meet the needs of the many young
people who have not completed even a primary education, pre-apprenticeship
courses of one year's duration have been established in some sixty centers,
a number which may be doubled in the near future. The courses, of one year's
duration, serve the dual purpose of providing basic knowledge of Arabic,
French, workshop calculations, technical science, and drawing, and of developi
ing a range of practical skills (fifteen hours per week) upon which apprentice-
ship can be successfully built. An intake of some 6,000 students per year
is envisaged.
38.       Adult training is given in some ten or twelve centers using accepted
methods of accelerated training. Such courses normally extend over a period
of six months and aim at achieving a high level of skill in a relatively narrow
field; the volume of such training is closely geared to the estimated demand.
39.       Additionally, refresher and upgrading courses of varying lengths are
provided in five "centres de perfectionnement".  The largest of these, the
National Institute of Productivity and Vocational Training, Rades, is addition-
ally concerned with the training of instructors for pre-apprenticeship and
adult accelerated courses. In three years, it has produced some 150 instruc-
tors, 200 workshop supervisors and 100 or more other upgraded personnel. In
order to expand the work of this institute, the government has submitted to
the United Nations Development Program a request for matching funds (50% of
total cost) amounting to US$789,000 for new construction, equipment, expert
services, scholarships, etc.
40.       The training program under the Ministry of Social Welfare is quite
substantial. Since the Ministry of Education has its own training program,
particularly in the college moyen  coordination between the two ministries is
not as close as it should be.

III.  EXPANSION OF EDUCATION: EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Primary School Enrolment and Expansion
41.       The Ten-Year Program for 1959-1969 (ANNEX 7 Col.l) envisaged an
increase of primary school enrolment from 373,000 children in 1959/60 to
840,800 by 1968/69, the latter figure being raised to 848,6oo under the
current 1965-1969 Four-Year Plan. The educational pyramid for primary and
other levels of education for 1965/66 is shown in ANNEX 8.
42.       ANNEX 9 gives a breakdown by grades of primary enrolment and shows
that of the first grade entries in the years 1958/59/60, 59%, 63% and 70%,
respectively, continued in attendance to the sixth grade. This improvement
shows that the school system has become more stabilized and that the percentage
of children leaving school before completing the full primary course is decreas-
ing. Future enrolment forecasts take drop-outs and repeaters into account.
43.       In 1965/66, the total number of children of primary school age was
estimated to be 972,000 as compared with a school population of about 717,000.
Thus about 73.7% of the primary age group was in school. For comparison with
other countries, Morocco had 51.2% of the age group in 1963/64, in 1962/63
Nigeria's Western and Eastern Regions had 58% and 68%, respectively, and
Jordan had about 81% in the school year 1962/63. Of the total number of
children in Tunisian primary schools 65.9% are boys and 34.1% are girls. This
inequality, common to many developing countries, is deeply rooted in local ways
of life and tradition, and can only be remedied slowly.
College Moyen Enrolment and Expansion
44.       Estimated enrolments in the college moyen over the period of the
Ten-Year Program are shown in Col.2 of ANNEX 7. The current Four-Year Plan
has lowered the 1968/69 enrolment target from 39,000 to 34,500. ANNEX 11
breaks down the enrolments (1965/66) by sex, year of study, and distribution by
specialization. Enrolment in 1965/66 has increased to 2.6 times the enrolment
in 1959/60 and is expected to increase to 3.9 times by 1968/69.
45.       Government policy, requiring a ratio of 1:2 for new entrants to the
college moyen and the secondary school, differs little from actual ratios
varying between 1:2.2 and 1:2.5. On the other hand, present enrolments in
the general, commercial, and industrial sections of the college moyen are in
the ratios of 42:19:39 as contrasted with the recent official target of
17:23:60.
46.       The enrolments for 1965/66 show that girls form 27.3% of the total,
a percentage which, although small, compares favorably with that of most other
countries at a similar stage of development. Further analysis shows that 38%
of the girls were in the commercial section, 28.7% in the general section,
and 25.5% in the industrial section. The relatively small percentage of
girls in the industrial section results from the lack of choice of subject as
contrasted with the wide choice open to boys. (See para.20).

Secondary Education Enrolment and Expansion
47.       The development of secondary education under the Ten-Year Program
is shown in Col.3 of ANNEX 7. The target has been reduced from 97,500 to
87,900 in 1968/69, but the enrolment will still be 4.4 times what it was in
1959/60.
48.       The distribution of the students by years of study and lines of
specialization for the year 1965/66 is given in ANNEX 12. Out of a total of
approximately 57,000 the first cycle claims some 411,000 students and the
second only 16,000. The main reason for this disparity is that the effect of
increased enrolments in the lower primary school since independence has still
to be fully felt at the upper secondary level.
49.       Comparison of enrolment by specialization (ANNEX 12) shows that
about 25% of present second cycle students are taking liberal arts and
languages and that a similar proportion is specializing in science and mathe-
matics: the majority of future candidates for higher education will come
from these two groups. The remaining 50% of the students in the second cycle
is divided among teacher training (21%), commerce and related studies (14%),
and technician courses (15%).
50.       The total number of girls attending secondary schools in 1965/66 is
given as 14,720 (25.7%) as compared with 42,624 boys (74.3%). The division
between boys and girls in the secondary part of the education pyramid
(ANNEX 8) has been based on this ratio.
Teachers Needed to Meet Expansion of Education
51.       The following figures summarize expansion according to the Four-
Year Plan:
Total Enrolment of Pupils 1965/66 - 1968/69
as Recently Revised
Year      Primary   Increase  College Moyen  Increase   Secondary   Increase
1965/66   715,000      -         23,000         -         57,300       -
1966/67   770,000    54,900      27,300        4,300      64,800      7,500
1967/68   827,000    57,000      30,700        3,400      75,600     10,800
1968/69   878,600    50.400      34,500        3.8oo      87,900     12.300
162,300                  11,500                 30,600
52.       In primary education, the need for additional teachers has been
estimated at 1,200 for each of the first three years of the Plan, but for
October 1968, 1,500 new teachers will be needed to meet the increase in the
number of weekly hours for sixth grade pupils from twenty-five to thirty. The
yearly output from all primary teacher training sources has been relatively
constant at 1,200 for a number of years, but will be increased in the future
to meet the need for additional primary teachers under the Four-Year Plan.
Admission to primary teacher training schools and to teacher training sections

of secondary schools is expected to be as follows:
October 1965 . . . . . . 1,3h0 (actually realized 1,366)
"     1966 . . . . . . 1,630
it    1967 . . . . . . 1,650
1968 . . . . . . 2,020
1969 . . . . . . 2,220
"1970 . . . . . . 2,480
53.       In the celler mnoevi the number of additional teachers and instruc-
tors required during the Four-Year Plan is estimated at 910, to be met from
among graduates of the School for the Training of Assistant Secondary School
Teachers (350), from technical lycees (300), from university graduates (90)
and from foreign teachers, mostly French (100). The remaining shortage of
70 teachers will be met by supplementary hours of work undertaken by the exist-
ing teaching staff against additional remuneration. This system is commonly
practiced in Tunisia.
54.       In secondary education the Plan calls for the recruitment of 2,100
additional teachers. It is estimated that university graduates sponsored by
the Ministry of Education will provide 390 teachers, non-sponsored university
students some 260 teachers, the School for the Training of Assistant Professors
a further 350, and that some 120 graduates will be supplied from the Higher
Teacher Training School. In addition it will be necessary to employ about 600
foreign teachers and to find the equivalent of the remaining 380 teachers by
remunerated supplementary hours (on an average each of the 4,000 teachers then
employed would give less than two remunerated supplementary hours per week).
A recruitment of 600 foreign teachers does not appear over-optimistic, in view
of the present French policy of exempting from military service those wishing
to teach abroad.
55.       So far, account has not been taken of attrition but, keeping in mind
the young age of the teaching staff and the adequate salary scales, the present
rate of attrition is low and is likely to remain so.
56.       The above analysis shows that the supply of adequately qualified
teaching staff should be sufficient to implement fully the Four-Year Plan for
the expansion of education at primary and secondary levels.
57.       In the primary cycle the average number of pupils per teacher is 58,
the high ratio being due to the condensed program explained in paragraph 14,
which permits one teacher to cope with more than one class-section every day.
In the college moyen the average is 17 students per teacher, the comparatively
low ratio being due to the smaller groups of students in workshops. In
secondary education, taking first and second cycles together, the average is
25 students per teacher, which is a reasonable ratio.
Repeaters and Drop-Outs
58.       As in other countries where the school system is modelled on the
French pattern, promotion from one year to another requires the passing of a
formal examination. Failure to pass is reflected in the high percentage of



- 12 -
those who must either repeat a class or drop out of the system. In the primary
school, the average repeater rate is of the order of 25% with a drop-out rate
of about 10%; higher rates are experienced in the upper classes; in the
college moyen the corresponding rates are 15% and 10%. In the secondary
school the rates have been estimated at 10-20% and 15-20%, respectively.
59.       To ensure that available teaching strength, accommodation and finance
are used more economically, the high repeater and drop-out rates should be
reduced by modifying the promotion system which at present is based almost
solely on the students' marks. The Tunisian authorities have indicated their
intention to take this matter in hand.

IV. FINANCING EDUCATION
60.       Until recently, the cost of constructing and-equipping primary school
buildings was shared between government and the local population but, as from
1963, these costs have been met entirely from public funds. Construction and
equipment costs for the college moyen and for secondary education have always
been so met. Tuition is free at all levels of public education.
61.       The development of the Ministry of Education operational budget
over the last four years is shown below:
Total education    Total national    % of education     Education
operational budget    operational         to total       budget as
Year        (Dinars)        budget (Dinars)  operational budget % of GNP
1962/63    12,976,000         56,8oo,ooo           22.84%          3.14%
1963/64    14,844,000         59,950,000           24.76%          4.39%
1964/65    17,558,000         68,300,000           25.70%          4.65%
1965/66    20,573,000         77,636,000           26.49%          4.92%
For comparison, Italy in 1963 spent 4.3% of its GNP on education, Morocco and
Ghana in 1964 spent 4.8% and 5%, respectively.
62.        The table in the previous paragraph shows that while the country's
total operational budget has increased by about 20.8 million dinars (36.7%)
during the last four years, the Ministry of Education budget has increased
by 7.6 million dinars (58.5%).
63.        The following table shows a breakdown of the educational operational
budgets for 1963/64 and 1965/66:
1963/64                 1965/66
Budget                  Budget
(Dinars)       %        (Dinars)       %
Primary Education        8,465,000     57.1    11,209,000     54.5
Secondary Education      4,250,000     28.6      6,748,ooo    32.8
Higher Education         1,073,000      7.2      1,272,000      6.2
Administration             310,000      2.1        383,000     1.8
Scholarships and
various grants           7h6,ooo      5.0        961,000      4.7
TOTAL IN DINARS         14,844,000    100.0     20,573,000   100.0
64.        Primary and secondary education taken together are reasonably
constant at about 86% of the total budget but the percentage allocation for
primary education is decreasing in favor of secondary education.
65.        The bulk of budget expenditure (1965/66) went to salaries (87.5%.
Teachers' salary scales are shown in ANNEX 13, giving the starting and terminal



- 14 -
salaries for Tunisian and expatriate teachers in each major category: terminal
salaries are almost double those at commencement in order to retain teachers
in the profession.
66.        The Tunisian government is not responsible for the entire remunera-
tion of French and Belgian teachers. The former, recruited under bilateral
agreement, are paid two-thirds of their remuneration by the Tunisian government
and the remainder by France. Despite this arrangement, the cost to Tunisia in
respect of a French teacher in primary or secondary schools is about twice
that of a Tunisian teacher. Belgian teachers recruited under bilateral agree-
ment do not constitute an additional charge on the government since Tunisia
pays them at almost the same rates as Tunisian teachers and the Belgian govern-
ment meets the difference. All other foreign teachers, i.e., those recruited
directly by Tunisia, receive salaries which, on the average, are 60% higher
than Tunisian teachers of the same grades. As 1,400 (28%) of a total of
5,000 secondary school teachers are expatriates considerable economy would be
achieved by an expansion of secondary teacher training facilities.
67.        Total capital expenditure during the Four-Year Plan (1965/66 -
1968/69) is expected to reach 455 million dinars of which 36.4 million dinars
are allotted to capital investment in education (9.8 million for primary
education, 18.4 million for secondary education, and 8.2 million for higher
education). It is significant that more than one-half of the total capital
investment is in secondary education.
68.        The recurrent education budget for 1965, the first year of the Plan,
totals 20.57 million dinars and is estimated at 24.6 million dinars for 1966.
Figures for the remaining two years of the Plan are not yet available but may
be estimated at 27 million dinars for 1967 and 30 million dinars for 1968.
These estimates provide fully for the increased recurrent costs of education
arising from the expansion program including those generated by the project
under consideration. In this case educational expenditure would be about 30%
of the total recurrent budget in 1968 compared with 26.5% in 1965.(See para.61).
There is, therefore, reason to believe that Tunisia will not find it possible
to maintain the same rate of growth of its recurrent education budget for the
years after 1968 and should take measures to slow down the rate of growth
relative to the overall growth of the economy. The Tunisian authorities have
given assurances that this will be done and will keep the Association informed
of its progress.

V.  MANPa4ER AID EMIVPLOYMGNT
69.       The total population of Tunisia was 3.943 million in 1956, reached
an estimated 4.386 million in 1964, and is expected to increase to 4.929
million in 1968/69. The labor force is estimated to rise from 1,385,000 to
1,469,000 over the period 1964-1968.
70.       As shown in ANINEX 14 the total of 1,226,000 employed persons in
1964 was divided into 695,000 (57%) in the agricultural and fishing sectors;
257,000 (21%) in the industrial sector; and 274,000 (22%) in the commercial
and services sectors. The same table shows that for 1968, the expected
total of 1,331,000 will be divided into 717,000 (54%) in the agricultural
and fishing sectors; 314,000 (23.5%) in the industrial sector; and 300,000
(22.5%) in the commercial and services sectors.
71.       These projections were based on surveys made in different produc-
tive sectors pending the reorganization of the employment services which is
under way and will provide in future a regular flow of manpower information.
The surveys show that for the period 1966-1968, the output from government
post-primary education and training will not provide the numbers of middle-
level manpower needed to fill both the new jobs to be created during this
period and to replace the workers who retire.
72.       Assuming that after 1968/69 when the project is completed, the
present 2% annual growth of employment is maintained, with a distribution
similar to the pattern envisaged for the period 1965-1968, the additional
supply and demand of labor can be estimated as follows:
1969-1971
Estimated Output Available for
1969-1971     Employment from Secondary Education

- 16 -
73.       The estimated additional output of 4,800 skilled workers and 3,000
clerical workers from the agricultural training centers and the colleges
moyens and 2,700 sub-professional workers from the secondary schools, indi-
cates that the project will bring an important contribution towards the
satisfaction of the manpcwer needs, but the supply of sub-professional and
skilled workers will still remain well below the demand. As in the past, the
remaining vacancies and those resulting from the retirement of workers will
have to be filled by those who went through traditional apprenticeship or
other in-service training schemes. It should be noted that an estimated 50%
or 900 secondary graduates per year will ccntinue into higher education for
periods of three to five years in training for high-level professional and
managerial positions, of which secondary school teaching should form a sig-
nificant part.

VI. SCHOOL PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION
Planning and Design
74.       Determination of need for new schools, their size, number, and
location is the responsibility of an education planning office within the
Ministry of National Education but individual school design is normally
undertaken by private architects whose work 's submitted for the approval
of a Technical Commission chaired by the Ministry of Public Works and re-
presentative of all ministries involved. The Planning Office is under-
staffed and the government has agreed to take steps to strengthen it.
75.       There is an adequate local supply of competent architects but, in
the past, in the absence of prescribed and uniform school standards, design
has often been wasteful. In the appraisal of the first education project
it was observed that school construction costs were not only high but varied
widely from case to case. A private firm, the London Group of Project Con-
sultants, and two French school administrators were engaged in 1962 to assist
the Tunisian government in developing uniform standards of design and im-
proved organization with a view to standardization of criteria and a reduc-
tion in costs. The London Group report was completed in July 1965 and pro-
vided the basis for the Bank's appraisal of the proposed project and the
selection of schools for financing as described more fully in para. 82.
Construction
76.       The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for tendering pro-
cedures and for technical supervision during construction. Traditionally,
separate contracts are prepared for each specialist trade or firm involved
but the number of general contractors capable of handling whole projects,
though still small, is increasing. Lists of pre-qualified contractors of
both types are maintained by the Ministry; there appears to be no discri-
mination between local and foreign contractors.
77.       Competitive tenders, based upon approximate quantities, are in-
vited by press announcement for all construction work exceeding 1,000 dinars
in value.
78.       Most basic building materials, with the exception of timber, are
available locally but such items as structural and reinforcing steel, sani-
tary fittings, and electrical equipment have to be imported. For secondary
school buildings the cost of imported items represents some 35% of the
total construction cost.
79.       Recent construction standards are satisfactory and show improved
overall economy: costs normally range from 28 to 33 dinars per square
meter ($5.0 to $5.80 per square foot) but exceptionally may reach 38 dinars



- 18 -
($6.60 per square foot), due to regional differences in the cost of trans-
portation of building materials and equipment. For comparison with Tunisia,
costs per square foot for secondary schools in the United States are roughly
three times as high and about twice as high in the United Kingdom.
Maintenance
80.       The Ministry of National Education is responsible for normal main-
tenance work but major repair work is entrusted to the Ministry of Public
Works. Standards of cleanliness and of maintenance are satisfactory. The
rapid expansion in school buildings will call for increased maintenance pro-
vision in the government budget.

VII. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
81.       The proposed project involves the construction and equipment of
9 new multilateral secondary schools, 6 extensions to existing secondary
schools and 3 new agricultural training centers together with equipment
only for 16 secondary schools already under construction. The locations
of the 31 schools and the 3 new agricultural centers are shown in red on
the map at the end of this report. The project provides about 18,575 new
places in the Ministry of Education schools and about 1,100 new places in
the agricultural centers, a total of 19,650 new student places. By pro-
viding equipment to the 16 secondary schools a further 27,000 students
will have improved teaching facilities. The total cost of the project,
excluding sites, is estimated to be about $20 million.
82.       The original request, to which 3 agricultural training centers
were later added, comprised both construction and equipment of 31 multi-
lateral secondary schools. On arrival in Tunisia, the appraisal mission
found that to nzeet the urgent enrolment needs of the 1966/67 school session,
construction of 18 schools had already begun on the basis of designs which
were finalized before the completion of the London Group report. The
government was advised that the Association would consider assistance only
to schools (a) of which construction had not yet begun, and (b) whose de-
sign standards were consistent with the recommendations of the London Group
report. On the basis of these criteria the Association and the Tunisian
authorities agreed upon a list of 15 schools for which assistance to con-
struction would be considered. In addition, it was agreed to consider pro-
vision of equipment for 16 of the schools whose construction had begun.
83.       For the 15 schools whose construction would be assisted substan-
tial savings will result from the application of the London Group recom-
mendations (see para. 96). It is expected also that the economies to be
aahieved in the proposed project will be extended to all future school
construction.
Details of the Project
84.       The teaching accommodation provided in each project item is shown
in ANNlEX 15, giving a total of 276 ordinary classrooms, 174 specialized
rooms (i.e., science laboratories, science lecture rooms, rooms for history,
geography and drawing), 66 workshops, 112 administration rooms and 9 gym-
nasia. In planning full and economical use of accommodation, a work-load
of 34 hours per week has been taken for classrooms and specialized rooms
and 40 hours per week for workshops. The 6 extensions to existing schools
will not only contribute to the total number of new places, but will also
offer to these schools improved teaching facilities in the form of speci-
alized rooms and workshops not at present available.



- 20 -
85.       Hostel accommodation would be provided for a total of 6,200
students, representing about 28p of the new places in secondary schools
and 100l in the agricultural training centers, the latter being more
isolated and having to serve larger catchment areas. In both cases the
amount of hostel accommodation has been calculated as the minimum essen-
tial to meet the needs of the school districts, taking into account all
possibilities for daily commuting. The standard of accommodation has
also been kept modest and economic, substantial savings having been in-
troduced by double bunking. Hostel accommodation represents approximately
27% of the cost of the project.  Dining and kitchen facilities will serve
not only the resident students but also provide a noon meal for day
students. The adoption of two-shift meal-serving has made substantial
savings from previous practice. The number of dining places is therefore
fixed at one-half of the total student places. The facilities themselves
are of economical design.
86.       In the secondary schools, the boarding sections are economically
run by the school administration with funds obtained, (i) from the Ministry
of Education in respect of subsidized students, (ii) from a welfare organi-
zation known as the National Committee of Solidarity which, among other
activities, assists students from its collected funds, and (iii) from fees
paid by students' parents. The average cost of maintaining each boarding
student is about 60 dinars ($114) a year. In a sample involving more than
3,000 boarders from 10 different schools, it was found that 41% of the
total boarding cost was met from government subsidies, 24% from the
National Committee of Solidarity, and 35% from fees paid by parents.
87.       The project includes 52 staff houses and 28 one- or two-room
flats, an average of slightly more than three units per school. They are
provided only for those persons whose duties require their residence at
the schools, namely, the headmaster, the chief supervisor of the boarding
section, and the bursar, with an additional supervisor's house at schools
where boarding accommodation exists for both boys and girls. Junior
supervisors are given accommodation within the dormitories. Otherwise,
apart from a small number of service staff required to live on the school
premises, accommodation is not provided for staff or teachers. Staff
housing represents 4.7% of the cost of the project.
88.       AiN\EX 15, Part C, refers to the three new agricultural training
centers to be administered by the Ministry of Agriculture. These are to
be lccated in the districts of Kairouan, Cap Bon, and Kasserine; they
will each accommodate 360 students, all boarders, recruited from the pri-
mary school for two years of training essentially practical in character.
As in other such centers, existing farms have been acquired with their
buildings, but additional construction of a modest character will be
necessary to provide classrooms, and dining and hostel facilities.
New Student Places Provided by the Project
89.       In school year 1968/69, the last in the Four-Year Plan, 20.6% of
the 14-20 age group will be attending the college moyen, secondary schools



- 21 -
and agricultural centers. The increase in the number of students over the
1965/66 enrolments will be 7.5% of the relevant age group and the part pro-
vided by the proposed project will be 3.2%.
90.       ANNEX 16 indicates that a total of 19,650 new places will be pro-
vided under the project, representing 42.6% of the government's planned
expansion in this field from 1965/66 to 1968/69.   Of the total, 4,560 places
(39.8% of the government-planned expansion) will be allocated to college
moyen, 14,010 places (44.7%) to secondary schools and 1,080 places (31.8%)
to agricultural training centers. The project provides 13,460 places for
boys and 6,190 for girls. Of the 6,212 boarding places, 4,274 are for boys
and 1,938 for girls.
91.       About 27,000 students (17,800 boys and 9,200 girls) will be
attending the 16 schools for which equipment only is to be provided.    This
number is divided among college moyen (8,000), first cycle secondary
courses (14,000) and second cycle secondary courses (5,000).
92.       The lists of equipment required for all project schools have been
examined and amended where necessary. As they now stand, they are adequate
to the needs of the curricula, but not excessive.
Cost of the Project
93.       The cost of construction, professional fees, and equipment for
each project item is shown in ANNEX 17. The total cost, including 15%
allowance for contingencies, amounts to 10.4 million dinars ($19.8 million).
The following abstract gives the breakdown for each major project group:

94.       The cost estimates for construction are realistic; they are based
on standard costs per square meter, to which have been added the costs of
external works, special foundations where required, and fixed installations.
The estimates take recent building experience and tenders into account.
Unit Costs
95.       Considering construction only and taking the 9 complete multi-
lateral schools with 12,460 students of whom 4,392 are boarders, the average
cost per student-place is about 300 dinars ($570). If the costs of furni-
ture, equipment, and professional fees are added, the average cost per
student-place is 417 dinars ($792). Construction costs per pupil for teach-
ing accommodations and boarding accommodations are 190 dinars ($361) and
325 dinars ($618), respectively. In the three agricultural training
centers where all students are boarders, the overall cost per student-place
is 620 dinars ($1,176).
96.       A comparison of the cost per secondary school place with that of
similar schools in the first credit is of interest. In the first credit
the average construction cost, based on present enrolment, was in excess
of 400 dinars per place whereas the cost per place for new schools in the
present project is estimated at 300 dinars. A true comparison requires
that allowance should be made for the lower ratio of boarding accommoda-
tion and the increased cost of materials and wages in the later project.
With these corrections, the present project shows a saving of some 25% in
construction costs per student-place. On this basis, construction cost
of the 15 schools has been reduced by about $2.7 million.
Implementation of Projects
97.       Sketch plans have been prepared for all schools, for some of which
completed plans were available and tendering had already taken place. Con-
struction work on all secondary schools in the proposed project could begin
not later than October 1966 and the building of the three agricultural
training centers could commence early in 1967.
98.       Sites are available for all schools within the project and have
been acquired by appropriation of state-domain land, by purchase from
local funds, and by gift.
99.       The proposed project is expected to be completed in three years,
with expenditure phased as follows:
First year,   1966/67    Tunisian Dinars    3.12 million, or 30%
Second year,  1967/68    Tunisian Dinars   4.68 million, or 45%
Third year,   1968/69    Tunisian Dinars    2.60 million, or 25%
TOTAL PROJECT COST       Tunisian Dinars   10.40 million ($19.8 million)
The I4inistry of Public Works is quite capable of handling and supervising
the building program. Procurement will be consistent with Bank/IDA guide-
lines and regulations for international competitive bidding.

VIII. CONCLUSIOiNS AND RECOIENDATIONS
100.      Tunisia has made outstanding progress in the expansion of pri-
mary education, the effect of which is apparent in the increasing number
of qualified primary school leavers for whom additional secondary school
facilities have to be provided (paras. 41-43).
101.      The Four-Year Development Plan (1965/66-1968/69) env-saging ex-
pansion of college moyen enrolment from 23,000 to 34,500 and secondary
enrolment from 57,000 to 88,000 is realistic, and will help to meet the
country's requirements in middle- and higher-level trained manpower (paras.
72, 73). The percentage of students in the general sections of the college
moyen is to be reduced and the percentage in commercial and industrial sec-
tions increased (para. 17).
102.      The school system is based on the French pattern, with the French
language retaining its importance in the secondary cycle, although Arabi-
zation is proceeding gradually. The need to recruit expatriate teachers,
mainly French, will continue for a number of years. The prospect for re-
cruiting these teachers is favorable. However, a major effort will be made
to train local replacements as rapidly as possible (paras. 25, 26, 53, 54,
66).
103.      Despite recent progress, a significant feature of the school
system remains the high rate of repeaters and drop-outs (paras. 42, 58, 59).
The government has pledged to increase its efforts to reduce the rate of
drop-outs and repeaters.
10h.      In school construction considerable economy has been achieved as
a result of the studies made by the Tunisian authorities and recommenda-
tions contained in the London Group report which the Bank helped finance.
The space standards now adopted are satisfactory. Compared with the first
credit, the cost per student-place has been reduced by about 25% (para. 96).
105.      The School Planning Division in the Ministry of Education is in-
adequately staffed. The government has given assurances it will strengthen
the staff of this Division (para. 74).
106.      In general, the educational standards, curricula, organization,
and teaching practices of the Tunisian educational system are sound. The
government has agreed to take corrective action with regard to certain
specific deficiencies which were noted (paras. 20, 31, 40).
107.      Educational developments to date under the 1959-69 Ten-Year
Program have claimed an increasing share of government resources (para. 61)
and the financial implications of the current 1965-69 Four-Year Plan are



that this trend will continue (para. 68). The government recognizes that
this trend cannot continue indefinitely and will initiate a review
immediately to reduce the growth in educational. expenditure to a rate not
greater than the growth of the national product. The Association will be
kept fully informed of the progress and results of the review.
108.      In view of the assurances referred to above, the proposed project
provides a suitable basis for an IDA development credit. The proposed
credit in the amount of $13 million would cover approximately two-thirds of
the total cost of the project including professional fees and contingencies.
