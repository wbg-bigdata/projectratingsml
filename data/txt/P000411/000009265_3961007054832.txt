REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Republic of Cameroon
Beneficianres:             Ministry of Public Health and Ministry of Economy and Finance
Amount:                    SDR 29.5 million (US$43 million equivalent)
Terms:                     Standard with 40 years maturity
Project Description:       The project supports the implementation of the Government's population
and health policies and seeks to: (a) consolidate these policies both
legislatively and organizationally; (b) establish the requisite management
and technical conditions for rapid expansion of health service delivery; and
(c) finance reform measures and field operations in rural and urban areas
not currently covered by other donors. Over the period 1995-2001, the
project would:
a) provide institutional support for continued development of the national
population policy and rapid implementation of a national family planning
and information, education and communication strategy by: (i) supporting
the activities of the National Population Commission; and (ii) improving
demographic data collection and dissemination for population policy-
making and operations;
b) promote complementary organizational and administrative reforms
needed to strengthen the management of health sector resources and
advance the decentralization of health services by: (i) supporting the
restructuring of MOPH's health services and management structures,
including selective improvement of its physical facilities; and (ii) developing
health management information systems; and
c) expand the coverage and improve the quality of primary health care
services to underserved low-income populations by: (i) reinforcing health
services delivery through the establishment of decentralized functional
health districts (including rehabilitation of district-level facilities),
increasing the availability of quality maternal and child health and family
planning services, and systematic introduction of nutritional interventions to
improve nutrition for children under five, pregnant women, nursing
mothers, and female adolescents; and (ii) strengthening key support
programs through training for PHN personnel, the supply of essential
generic drugs, contraceptives and vaccines, and the expansion of
communication   programs  through  information,  education   and
communication activities.



iv
Benefits:                   The project would support expansion of quality primary health care
coverage to an additional 3 million people by establishing 9 rural districts in
the Center, East, West and Far North provinces and 9 urban districts in
Yaounde and Douala.  The objectives of the project include reducing
maternal mortality by 30 percent to 50 percent in those districts, increasing
vaccination coverage for the main target groups from under 40 percent to
60 percent to 80 percent, increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate from
less than 5 percent to between 10 percent and 20 percent by the year 2000,
and enhancing the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population
groups. The project is also expected to improve the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of PHN sector operations by strengthening sector management
and coordination and by enhancing the productivity and improving the
quality of services provided by MOPH personnel. Increased availability of
low-cost essential drugs, contraceptives and vaccines would raise the
credibility and acceptance of PHN  services by the public, increase
utilization of services, and reduce mortality and morbidity from preventable
and curable diseases.
Risks:                      Because of the relatively recent (1992/93) adoption of the population and
health policies, some difficulties and potential delays should be anticipated
in translating policy orientations into clearly defined institutional mandates
and relationships and an overall strategy into implementable programs.
Specifically, the existence of firmly entrenched distortions and rigidities in
the health care system and MOPH's generally weak coordination of
activities may prove difficult to overcome in a first project. The possiblc
lack of continued Government commitment to new PHN policies poses
another risk and the commitment will be closely monitored to ensure
adherence. Government has established the legal basis for the community
participation structures and their relationship to MOPH. During project
implementation, internal coordination would be strengthened by
restructuring MOPH's management and formalizing coordination links
within the TCC. Short-term specialist consultant services and staff training
would be provided under the project to assist GOC agencies in its
implementation. Finally, previous project experience indicates that while
the proposed reforms are generally supported by providers and consumers,
they are complex and require an extensive and continuous effort to educatc
the public. The project would support the Health Education Unit of MOPH
which is responsible for these information activities.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Despite its middle-income status, Camneroon's population and health indicators resemble
those of low-income countries in Africa. The population is estimated at 12 million and is growing at the rate
of 3 percent per year; the total fertility rate is 5.8. Life expectancy is 54 years; the infint mortality rate is 65
per 1,000 live births; and the under-five mortality rate is 126 per 1,000 live births. Faced with a deepening
economic crisis and political uncertainties, Cameroon will likely see these indicators worsen in the coming
years unless significant remedial actions are taken.
1.2          Reinforced by continuing IDA dialogue with the Government, many of these remedial
actions are underway and have been incorporated into formal statements of population and health policies
adopted in 1992/93. The population policy abandons the Government's traditionally pronatalist stance and,
inter alia, authorizes all health centers and hospitals to deliver family planning services and information.
Cameroon's health policy formalizes many measures already undertaken to reorient its primary health care
system on the basis of integrated services, decentralized management of resources, and the organization of
higher quality and sustainable health services at the level of the newly created health district.
1.3          IDA has been actively involved in the development of both the population and health
policies. The Government of Cameroon, recognizing the need for continued investment in human resource
development during this critical period, has requested IDA assistance in the implementation of these policies.
The proposed project would provide broad-based support for the following objectives: (a) to promote the
institutional and organizational reforms needed to decentralize health services; (b) to strengthen the
management of health sector resources; and (c) to improve health sector performance through the
establishment of 18 fully operational health districts.
1.4          The project would be the first IDA-financed operation for integrated development of
population, health, and nutrition activities, although previous projects, including the Social Dimensions of
Adjustment Project and the Food Security Project, have separately addressed some of these issues.
1.5          IDA assistance to GOC is justified by several factors, including: (a) successful dialogue on
significant population and health issues; (b) clear policy statements providing a framework for and indicating
a commitment to program implementation; and (c) need, based on Cameroon's economic difficulties and on
the importance of continuing to invest in human resources.

II. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A.    Background
2.1           Country Description.  Administratively, the Republic of Cameroon is divided into ten
provinces with widely varying ecological and climatic conditions, ranging from semi-arid Savannah in the
North to rain forest in the South. Socio-culturally, the country is equally diverse, comprising more than 200
ethnic groups and Christian, Muslim and animist faiths. French and English are the two official spoken
languages, but bilingual abilities vary significantly between provinces and within provinces and about a third
of the adult population speak neither French nor English. See Annex I for Basic Data on Cameroon.
2.2           Economic Conditions.  Can.vroon is among the countries of Africa with the greatest
development potential.  It is richly endowed with tropical forests, coastal fisheries, mineral deposits
(petroleum, bauxite, natural gas), fertile agricultural land, and a largely favorable climate. The country's
economy is served by a well-developed infrastructure and communications network, and until the mid-1980s
a well-functioning financial system. From Independence in 1960 until 1985, this potential was realized, and
real economic growth averaged about 7 percent a year throughout the period. Agriculture was the main
source of growth and foreign exchange earnings until 1978, when oil production started and became the
cornerstone of economic growth.
2.3           A sharp terms of trade loss and an appreciating real effective exchange rate combined with
the onset of declining oil production dragged the economy into a steep depression in 1985/86 following seven
years of oil-driven economic growth. Cameroon launched an adjustment program in 1988/89 with support
from the IMF and the World Bank to address the mounting economic disequilibria; this program sought to:
curtail the growth of public expenditures; strengthen and broaden revenue collection; reform the civil service;
liberalize the trade regime; liquidate, privatize and restructure the parastatal sector; and restructure the
commercial banking sector. However, the program failed to address certain fundamental problems in the
economy and the economic decline continued unabated. A major change occurred on January 12, 1994 when
the parity of the CFA franc was realigned from 50 CFAF/FF to 100 CFAF/FF. To take advantage of the
positive effects brought about by this action, the Government, with assistance from the IMF and IDA,
quickly adopted and started implementing a program of economic measures and structural reforms covering
three key areas: (a) downsizing and strengthening the efficiency of the public and parapublic sectors;
(b) improving the incentives framework for productive and production-supporting sectors; and (c) adopting
poverty alleviation measures. An economic recovery credit was approved in June 1994 and a structural
adjustment credit is under discussion in close collaboration with the International Monetary Fund.
B.    Demographic Situation
2.4           Estimated at 8.7 million in 1980, Cameroon's population is now estimated at 12 million.
The annual growth rate has increased from 1.6 percent (1950-1955) to the current 3.0 percent, due in part to
significant declines (about 30 percent) in the crude death rate from 1976 to 1987. Annexes 2 and 3 provide
additional details on Cameroon's population.
2.5          The 1991 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) found that women give birth to an
average of 5.8 children during their lifetimes, which represents a 10 percent decline since 1978. This figure
masks a significant urban/rural differential: average parity for women in Yaounde and Douala is estimated at



3
4.4 children, while for rural women it is 6.3. Knowledge of modem methods of contraception has increased
from 29 percent to 66 percent of women in union during the period 1978-1991, but the 1991 DHS found that
only 4.3 percent of these women were using such a method.
2.6          If current demographic indicators remain constant, Cameroon's population will reach
15.5 million by the year 2000 and 21 million by the year 2010. Using alternative population growth
scenarios prepared by the Futures Group yields the following results:
* Projection A:  Fertility declines to 4.0 by the year 2010 and reaches 3.0 in 2025 with
corresponding populations of 17.9 million in 2010 and 24 million in 2025.
* Projection B: Fertility declines to 3.0 in 2010 and 2.2 in 2025 with corresponding populations of
16.3 million in 2010 and 20 million in 2025.
If mortality rates continue to decline and emphasis is not placed on reducing fertility, Cameroon's population
will double every 22 years, with corresponding increases in the demand for social services, including health
and education.
2.7          With a total surface area of 475,000 km2, the average population density in Cameroon is
only 25 inhabitants per square kilometer. Significant variations in population density exist among provinces:
the West province averages 107 inhabitants per square kilometer, while the East province averages five.
2.8          The rate of urbanization is also increasing: from 28.5 percent in 1976, to 37.8 percent in
1987, to an estimated 42 percent in 1991. If the current rate of urbanization continues, Government estimates
that 50 percent of all Cameroonians will live in cities by the year 2000. The major cities of Douala
(1,094, 100 inhabitants) and Yaounde (955,300 inhabitants) are growing at rates of 5 and 6 percent per year
respectively, due to the influx of young Cameroonians (under 25 years of age) seeking education and
employment opportunities. By the year 2000, Yaounde and Douala will each have about 1.5 million
inhabitants. Annex 3 estimates the populations of Yaounde and Douala from 1993 to 2025.
C.    Health Status
2.9           Overview. The principal causes of reported morbidity and mortality in Cameroon are listed
in Annex 4. Malaria, intestinal parasites, skin diseases, and respiratory infections comprise almost 75
percent of morbidity; malaria and anemia account for almost 50 percent of mortality, with respiratory
infections, neonatal tetanus and malnutrition adding an additional 25 percent.
2.10         AIDS is currently a health risk throughout Cameroon, including rural areas. The principal
transmission method is heterosexual intercourse. Of the 2,488 AIDS cases reported from 1985 to June 30,
1993, 70 percent are in individuals between 20 and 39 years old, and about 5 percent are among children
younger than five years old. About 80,000 to 100,000 people, including about 2 percent of the sexually
active urban population, are estimated to be HIV positive. Prevalence rates vary by risk group and by
province. Projections for AIDS in Cameroon show that the disease will become increasingly prevalent in the
next decade. By the year 2005, it is expected that there will be between 140,000 and 220,000 seropositive
individuals and between 10,000 and 14,000 new cases of AIDS.
2.11          Maternal Health. A high maternal mortality rate, estimated at 430 per 100,000 live births,
indicates the precarious health situation of women of childbearing age. Overall, the two main causes of



4
maternal mortality are obstetric hemorrhage and sepsis (infection), both of which can be complicated by
prevalent conditions such as malaria and anemia. Nationally, 64 percent of all deliveries occurring in the
five years before the 1991 DHS survey took place in health facilities. Twenty-one percent of deliveries were
assisted by friends or relatives, 12 percent were assisted by traditional birth attendants, and 4 percent were
unassisted.
2.12          The level of maternal health varies significantly among provinces and between urban and
rural areas. Provincial level data on maternal mortality range from 900 per 100,000 live births in Maroua
(Far North province) to 250 per 100,000 live births in Bamenda (Northwest province). The DHS survey
found that in Yaoun&/Douala, mothers received ante natal care for nearly all births (99 percent), and the
majority of mothers (86 percent) were vaccinated against tetanus. In rural areas, however, only 71 percent
of the births involved ante natal care and tetanus toxoid was given in only 61 percent of pregnancies. See
Annex 5 for more detailed information regarding maternal health.
2.13          Child Health. Children under five years of age are at a significant health risk in Cameroon.
The infant mortality rate is estimated at 65 per 1,000 live births and the under five mortality rate is 126 per
1,000 live births. The 1991 DHS study found that in the two weeks preceding the survey, nearly I in 5
children had had an episode of diarrhea, I in 10 children under five had suffered from coughing and rapid
breathing, and I in 4 children under five had had a fever. Only 41 percent of children with fevers and 50
percent of children with diarrhea were taken to a health facility for treatment.
2.14          The DHS study found the main causes of death among children under five to be (in
descending order of importance) diarrhea, malaria, measles, respiratory infections, and undernutrition; 60
percent of malaria deaths occur in children in this age group.
2.15          Although vaccine-preventable diseases did not figure prominently in the causes of mortality
and morbidity for Cameroon as a whole, these diseases are apparent at the provincial level. MOPH data on
measles (Eastern, Littoral, Northern, and South provinces) and neonatal tetanus (Central, Eastern, Far
North, and North provinces) confirm UNICEF findings that these diseases are the most significant causes of
death for infants less than one year old, accounting for 34 percent of all infant deaths in 1986. UNICEF also
estimates that less than 40 percent of Cameroonian children were fully vaccinated by their first birthday
against childhood (EPI) diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and measles).
See Annex 6 for vaccination coverage by type of vaccine and by province.
2.16          Nutrition.  Results from  the 1991 DHS, presented in Annex 7, indicate significant
nutritional problems: 24 percent of children under five suffer from moderately to severely chronic
undernutrition (height-for-age measure); 3 percent suffer from moderate to severe acute undernutrition
(weight-for-height measure), and 14 percent are underweight (weight-for-age measure). Comparison of these
results with the 1978 National Nutritional Survey indicates the seriousness of the problem in the provinces of
Adamaoua, North, Far North, and East, where chronic under nutrition has increased from about 15 percent
to 25 percent and acute undernutrition from I percent to 4 percent.
2.17          The DHS found a clear age-specific pattern in the prevalence of undernutrition in
Cameroon, from less than 2 percent incidence of stunting, undernutrition, and wasting in infants aged I to 6
months to over 33 percent stunting, 20 percent underweight, and 10 percent wasting between the ages of 18
and 24 months. The survey concludes that inappropriate infant and child feeding practices are strongly
associated with the high levels of undernutrition found in Cameroon. Annex 8 presents data on feeding
practices by age for the different provinces.



5
2.18          The nutritional status of women also raises concern. The 1978 National Nutrition Survey
showed that pregnant women suffered from deficiencies of iron, calories and lipids and gained only one-third
the normal weight gain during pregnancy. As a result of poor maternal nutritional status, 13 percent of
babies in Cameroon were born with low birth weights in 1985.
D.    Health System
2.19          Public Health Sector Organization and Management.  The Ministry of Public Health
(MOPH) is Cameroon's principal governmental agency addressing health issues, although the National
Social Security Fund (CNPS) also provides services through its network of clinics. Other agencies involved
in health research, education, and communication include the Ministries of: Higher Education and Scientific
Research (medical training), National Education (school-based health programs), Social Welfare and
Women's Affairs (health, family planning, and nutrition education to women's groups), Agriculture (health
education to women's agricultural groups), and Economy and Finance (consideration of population variables
in the national development planning process).
2.20         The current organizational structure of the MOPH was established by ministerial decree No.
89/011 in January 1989. This decree established six central directorates. The Directorate of Hospital
Medicine is responsible for planning, administering and supervising all public hospitals; it also oversees
private hospitals. The Division of Training and Cooperation manages the paramedical training institutions.
The Directorate of Preventive and Rural Medicine is responsible for epidemiological surveillance, control of
endemic diseases, and execution of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). The Directorate of
Pharrnacy is in charge of planning the supply of drugs to all health facilities, assuring their quality, and
inspecting all public and private pharmacies. The Directorate of Studies. Planning and Health Statistics
plans and executes capital investment projects; and performs data collection and analyses which include
planning, monitoring, and evaluating health facilities. The Directorate of General Affairs is in charge of
general administration, personnel, finance, and health facility management. The Directorate of Family and
Mental Health is responsible for the promotion of mother, child, and juvenile health which includes family
planning, nutrition, and information, education, and communication (IEC). See Annex 9 for the organigram
of the Ministry of Public Health.
2.21          Ministerial decree No. 89/011 also organized the provincial health system to reflect the
administrative divisions of the country. Health delegations were established in each of the ten provinces.
Headed by a provincial delegate who reports directly to the Minister of Public Health, the provincial health
delegation comprises six services (corresponding to the central MOPH directorates) and supervises all health
activities in the province including hospitals, pharmaceutical supply, planning and statistics, training, and
administration. Provinces are sub-divided into departments under the authority of the departmental public
health service, which has responsibility for hospitals and health centers as well as for preventive and rural
health services.
2.22          Co-management of the health system, linked to both decentralization and cost recovery
measures, has been promoted since June 1990 when the Minister of Public Health signed a lettre circulaire
authorizing the creation of community health and management committees at the village, health center and
sub-divisional levels. Health committees (called COSA) for each catcbment area (aire de sante) are being
established and will have responsibilities for planning activities and expending resources made available to
the community health facilities; a sub-committee of the COSA (called COGE) would be responsible for
managing the funds obtained through cost-recovery. At the district level, COSADI are being established with
similar responsibilities.



6
2.23          The Declaration of Health Sector Policy (Annex 14) organizes health services at three levels
comprising: (a) local health centers, usually staffed by certified nurses and providing preventive and basic
curative care to the surrounding population; (b) district and departmental hospitals (of 100 to 150 beds),
usually staffed by at least one physician and providing first referral services for the health centers; and
(c) provincial and central level hospitals (of more than 200 beds) providing specialized medical services.
2.24          As a result of a rapid expansion of health facilities in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
Cameroon today possesses an important network of health structures. MOPH lists 1,031 government-
operated health facilities which include I teaching hospital, 2 referral hospitals, 3 central hospitals, 8
provincial hospitals, 38 departmental hospitals, 132 district hospitals, and 847 health centers. Coverage
remains a problem in both rural and urban areas; while there are competing facilities in some areas, large
segmnents of the population do not have access to care. Urban areas are underserved by public sector health
services; even doubling the WHO-recommended ratio to one health center per 20,000 people, Yaounde and
Douala both lack about 45 health centers. While the availability of private services is clearly greater in urban
areas, the issue of financial accessibility remains.
2.25           Facility maintenance and equipment repairs are a growing concern. No overall policy
governs equipping and maintenance of health centers, and the annual budget allocates less than I percent of
the estimated amounts for repairs. In addition, within the Ministry of Public Health, coordination and
planning of maintenance activities is divided between the Directorate of Hospital Medicine (responsible for
biomedical equipment and its maintenance) and the Directorate of General Affairs (responsible for
maintenance of health facilities and transport).
2.26          Private Health Sector Organization. Non-profit religious missions and for-profit clinics
constitute the bulk of private providers of health care. There is also a growing number of non-governmental
organizations involved in health activities. Numerous traditional practitioners provide services to the
population, but because they are not licensed and their operations are not subject to well-defined standards or
quality control, their activities remain largely undocumented. For-profit facilities represent about 5 percent
of the 539 private health facilities identified by MOPH; they are located in the major cities of Yaounde,
Douala, Garoua, Maroua, Bafoussam, and Bamenda. MOPH estimates that in 1992 there were 322
physicians (including 78 in the confessional sector) and 39 pharmacists in the private sector.
2.27          Religious health facilities, organized by the principal denominations, make up the majority
of the private health system in Cameroon. The Catholic health services (SCS) comprise 179 health facilities
(including 8 hospitals) and 1,315 personnel. SCS data estimate about 1.5 million consultations performed in
1991-1992. About half of these consultations took place within the Diocese of Yaounde (including the
surrounding rural villages) and half in the other Dioceses of Douala, Bamenda, and Garoua. In addition, SCS
operates two training schools (in Yaounde and Bamenda) which train nurses and nurses' aides.
2.28          Protestant health services (FEMEC) comprise 122 health facilities (including 24 hospitals)
and 2,633 personnel (including approximately 80 expatriate staff). FEMEC estimates the number of
consultations at about 2 million for 1991. The Ad Lucem Medical Foundation operates 7 hospitals and 11
health centers, totaling about 2,000 beds, in four provinces (West, Central, Littoral and South). In addition,
Ad Lucem is involved in the importation of essential drugs for the non-profit private sector (see para. 2.39).



7
2.29          Formal mechanisms for cooperation between private non-profit/confessional service
providers and the government-run services have generally been ineffective, although the government has until
recently very modestly subsidized the health services of these groups. Collaboration at the level of service
delivery is similarly informal, and the modalities for establishing working partnerships between these two
sectors in each health district need further development.
2.30          Health Personnel. In February 1993, staff working in Cameroon's different health structures
in numbered 19,027, of which 4 percent were physicians, 31 percent trained or "assimilated" (i.e., trained on
the job) nurses, and 26 percent nurses' aides. As with most other Sub-Saharan African countries, this
personnel is inequitably distributed and insufficiently and/or inappropriately trained.
2.31          Central province has the highest ratio of physicians to population with about 15 per 100,000
inhabitants; at the opposite extreme is Far North province, with 2 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants. Even
within Central province, 230 of 293 physicians may be found in Yaounde where the Teaching, Central, and
General Hospitals are located. Yaounde itself has a ratio of 23 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants. The
situation for nursing personnel is similar: Central province has 70 nursing personnel per 100,000 inhabitants
while Far North has only 17 nursing personnel per 100,000.
2.32           Personnel norms are being developed, and redeployment of existing staff will remain a
critical issue for the sector. As in virtually all other African countries, however, personnel are reluctant to be
posted to rural areas where working conditions are more difficult. The problem is more acute between
regions rather than within regions, but within regions excess personnel are particularly prevalent in facilities
in provincial capitals. While formal mechanisms for personnel transfers between and within regions are well
defined, the actual process may require significant negotiation among the parties involved.
2.33          Poor allocation is linked to another significant personnel issue, the low productivity of staff,
one study of nurses' use of time found that over 70 percent of their day was spent in nonproductive activity.
Reasons for this low productivity of medical and para-medical staff include inadequate training and
supervision, insufficient continuing education, a lack of incentives for good performance, and insufficient
work input such as drugs and equipment. There is an urgent need to experiment with both financial and non-
financial incentives for health facility staff.
2.34          Essential Drug Supply and Distribution. ONAPHARM was created in 1985 to ensure both
the supply of pharmaceuticals to the public and private non-profit sector and the quality of all imported and
locally produced drugs. Accorded financial autonomy (though MOPH retained oversight responsibilities),
ONAPHARM received both an initial capital of US$9 million (CFAF 2.5 billion), to establish a distribution
system and purchase its initial stock, and annual subventions. By 1988, however, ONAPHARM had
accumulated such debts to its suppliers that it was forced to drastically reduce its supply activities.
2.35          In 1989, MOPH created the Directorate of Pharmacy (para. 2.20) which is responsible for
the formulation, coordination, and supervision of pharmaceutical policy. Roles and responsibilities between
the still existing ONAPHARM and the Directorate of Pharmacy with respect to quality control are unclear.
In addition, because ONAPHARM is bankrupt and the Directorate of Pharmacy has not been given
resources for drug supply, public sector acquisition and distribution of essential drugs in Cameroon are
virtually non-existent.



8
2.36          Supply functions, where they exist, have been taken over by external donors with the
objective of implementing their specific projects. GTZ (German Technical Cooperation Agency) established
the first provincial drug supply system in Bamenda (Northwest province) in 1986. The system operates as
an importer and wholesale distributor for public and some non-profit private health care facilities in the
province. Drug prices include the actual cost of the drugs plus an average mark-up of 195 percent to cover
management costs (salaries, incentives, consultancies, training, administration, maintenance, consumables,
quality control, losses, and depreciation of buildings and equipment). Turnover in 1990-91 was about
US$800,000 with a surplus of US$230,000. This surplus was redistributed to member communities for
improvement of health care facilities. GTZ no longer provides financial assistance to the supply store or to
health facilities for cost recovery in the Northwest province. These facilities depend entirely on recovered
revenues through drug sales to finance their non-wage operating costs and to obtain drugs.
2.37          Structures identical to the Northwest province's drug supply system have been organized,
with GTZ's assistance, in the Southwest and Littoral provinces. Similar provincial drug supply systems
(CAPPs) are being established with help from other donors in Adamaoua, the South, North, and Far North
provinces. Areas not supported by a donor generally rely on private pharmacies for their pharmaceutical
needs, making essential drugs prohibitively expensive for many poor Cameroonians.
2.38          In January 1993, the EU (with GTZ technical support) began to re-organize the basis for a
national supply system with the establishment of CIAME (Centre Interimaire d'Approvisionnement en
Medicaments Essentiels). To date, CLAME has provided three types of services: (i) importing and selling
drugs from stocks; (ii) acting as a purchasing agent; and (iii) providing a tendering service only. For
purchasers able to meet CIAME's financial conditions, this agency has successfully filled the gap left by
ONAPHARM's difficulties (paras. 2.34-2.35), and it was anticipated that it would eventually become the
national structure for drug importation. During appraisal, MOPH proposed the creation of a national
purchasing agency for essential drugs (CENAME) to replace CIAME and to serve as a purchasing agent for
the provincial drug supply systems. Discussions of these alternative approaches for national drug supply are
continuing (para. 3.22). Until a new drug import system is adopted, MOPH would continue to rely on
CIAME as the interim Central Drug Supply Store.
2.39         Ad Lucem Medical Foundation represents another approach to drug supply, catering both
for its own health facilities and for those of other confessional health facilities in Cameroon. Currently, Ad
Lucem is experiencing severe financial difficulties and diminishing revenues. Nevertheless, revenue from
drug sales in 1992-93 totaled US$3.8 million and is estimated at US$5.0 million for 1993-94.
E.    Health Expenditures and Financing
2.40          Cameroon's public health care system is financed by the national budget, revenues from the
(recent) authorization to retain the proceeds from cost recovery at the local level, and external aid. The
current status and future prospects for financing Cameroon's health sector from these sources are analyzed in
Annex 10 and summarized in Table 6 of that annex.
2.41          Government Financing. The Government finances health service delivery through: (a) the
use of buildings and land ceded to the Ministry of Public works; (b) civil servant medical and para-medical
staff salaries paid by the Ministry of Finance; and (c) investment and operating support provided by the
MOPH. Overall Government spending for health has never substantially exceeded 5 percent of the national
budget (compared with 10 percent recommended by WHO) but did attain approximately US$12 per capita
(35.8 billion CFAF, or 8% of the national budget) in 1985-86. The economic crisis forced deep budget cuts



9
in 1986-87 and 1987-88; since 1988-89 the budget has remained relatively stable both as a percentage of the
national budget and in absolute terms while obviously declining in real terms.
2.42           The structure of the MOPH budget, the process of budget formulation and adoption, and the
procedures for expending authorized amounts are typical of francophone Africa. MOPH's budget is
dominated by salaries (for some 19,000 personnel): for FY 93-94, the wage bill, despite reductions both n
salaries and benefits, consumed almost 90 percent of the total operating budget; for FY94-95 additional
reductions in salaries will reduce the wage bill by about a third. At the same time, the government has
proposed to increase non-wage current expenditure budget appropriations by 30 percent for 1994/95.
2.43           Govemment financing is also hampered by a very centralized budget preparation process
and slow disbursement procedures. The budgeting process is conducted essentially by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance; no input is sought from communities, health centers, provincial health authorities and
hospitals, and very little even from the MOPH, with the result that the process has become increasingly
arbitrary. Once allocated, tardy spending authorization, inflexible line item management, and lengthy pro-
curement procedures represent formidable obstacles to efficient execution of budgets. These administrative
complexities, compounded by a lack of funds, have since 1991 reduced actual investment and non-salary
operating expenditures from 71 percent to 50 percent of authorized expenditures, representing an additional
de facto reduction of 30 percent. To make sure that budgeted expenditures for 1994/95 are actually held in
full, the President has instructed the Ministry of Finance to assign first priority to these outlays in its
execution of the Treasury cash budget. Further increases in the national health budget agreed upon during
negotiations would raise the share of the health sector from 5.0 percent in FY 93/94 to 7.0 percent in FY
96/97 and 10.0 percent by the end of FY 99/00.
2.44           Community financing. Since 1964 all health facilities have been authorized to charge fees
for services which, except for a percentage retained by consulting physicians as incentive payments, were
retumed to the treasury. Laws passed in 1990 and 1992 are designed to significantly increase financial
resources available to meet operating expenses. The Drug Financing Law of 1990 authorizes public health
care facilities to establish community-managed drug revolving funds through which drug sale revenues can
be retained locally; the Hospital Financing Law of 1992 authorizes selected tertiary-level hospitals to retain
50 percent of fee-generated revenues. Additional regulations regarding the application of these laws are under
review.

2.45           The existing systems of cost recovery in Cameroon (confessional health centers; bilaterally
funded projects; and private non-profit health facilities) exhibit a wide variation in the kinds and amounts of
costs to be recovered, in the approach for individual payment, and in the methods for collecting and
managing revenues. Preliminary results from the functioning cost recovery systems indicate that substantial
amounts can be generated for non-salary expenditures. While the lack of standardization may potentially be
a source of misunderstandings and abuses, it is far less important than consensus on: (a) the fundamental
issues affecting the viability of cost recovery, including the availability of essential drugs, an equitable



10
pricing policy, and common approaches for dealing with chronic under utilization of health services; and
(b) the continuing importance of the MOPH budget. Table I depicts the potential for cost recovery in the
health centers (HC) based on three scenarios: slow, medium and fast construction of health centers.
2.46          External Financing. The principal sources of external support to Cameroon's health sector
include the traditional multilateral donors (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, EU, etc.); a wide range of bilateral
donors, several with many years of experience in the country (Germany, the United States, Belgium and
France), and a significant non-profit sector comprising both international non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and local confessional groups. Germany (GTZ) is involved in the development of the decentraized
health districts in the South West and the North West provinces. USAID financed maternal and child care
programs in the Adamaoua and South provinces. France is providing assistance in hospital management in
the North and Littoral provinces. Annex 10 provides the commitments of donor by year, Annex 11 contains a
map with the locations of the major donors by administrative district.
2.47          As the table below indicates, the sources and amounts of external assistance have increased
in recent years. Between 1990-91 and 1993-94, commitments from all sources (multilateral, bilateral, and
NGO) to the health sector increased from approximately US$1 per capita (3.01 billion CFAF) to US$2.75
per capita (8.3 billion CFAF) in 1993-94.

2.48          Annex 10 presents the current status and future prospects for financing Cameroon's health
sector. Table 6 in the annex summarizes current and projected future costs of the priority programs and
estimates internal and external sources of financing. Based on a number of assumptions concerning the
internal sources of funding (growNth of the Government's national budget, MOPH's share of that budget, and
the success of cost recovery) and the level of foreign assistance, the table indicates that the period 1994-1999
will be critical and that the proposed IDA credit would fill a funding gap. Financing of sector activities by a
combination of increased Government budget, cost recovery revenues and forcign aid is considered
sustainable under present conditions.
Ill.   NATIONAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
A.    Population Policy
3.1           Background and Content. Cameroon's traditionally pro-nataiist population policy has been
changing since 1989, when the MOPH created the Directorate of Family and Mental Health and began
promoting birth spacing as a part of maternal and child health services. With financial and technical
assistance from the World Bank and UNFPA, a national population policy was formulated and published in
March 1993. The policy authorizes all health centers and hospitals to provide family planning services to
offer a wide range of contraceptive choices.



I1
3.2           The policy considcrs family planning as part of an overall strategy to improve the well-being
of families and couples in general and of women and children in particular. Among a wide range of proposed
actions, the policy seeks to: (a) facilitate access to voluntary family planning services, especially in rural and
per-urban areas- (b) ensure availability of information and educational programs concerning contraceptive
methods (modem, natural and traditional), STDs (including AIDS), and causes of sterility; (c) promote
responsible parenthood through educational efforts; (d) strengthen girls' education to increase levels of
education and age at first marriage- and (e) improve research and coordination to ensure efficient
implementation of the policy and increased participation of the entire population. Excerpts from the National
Population Policy are providcd in Anncx 12.
3.3           Family Planning Services. The new policy provides an important framework for action, but
much remains to be done to control population growth. Attitudes towards family planning are generally
favorable: 85 percent of respondcnts in a 1991 survey of five urban areas believe that women should control
reproduction. Further, 12 perccnt of women surveyed in the DHS study wanted no more children, and about
33 percent of women wanted to wait at least two years between births. If these family planning needs were
met and these unwanted births were avoided, the total fertility rate would drop to 5.2 from the current rate of
5.8. Rural women arc less favorable to family planning.
3.4           Demand for family planning services is increasing, but the availability of accurate
information and adequate services remains a major problem. In 1991 8 in 10 provinces were offering FP
services, 12,541 clicnts werc registered, and 42.3 percent among them were new acceptors. An MOPH study
on contraceptive use in 1992 revealed that slightly more than 27,000 people used a modern method of
contraception during 1992. The most frequently used method was pills (47 percent), followed by injectables
(33 pcrcent), IUDs (12 pcrcent), and tubal ligations and condoms (4 percent each). Use of methods varied
according to urban or rural location: only 3 percent of rural women used a modem method compared to 12
percent of women in Yaoundc/Douala See Annex 13 for detailed information on attitudes toward family
planning and on contraceptive use by province and method.
3.5           Issues. The National Population Commission (NPC), an interministerial body under the
leadership of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), is responsible for defining population policies
and overseeing implemcntation of the National Population Policy (NPP). MEF's Directorates of Planning
(DP), Census (DRG) and Statistics and Studies (DES) provide technical support to the NPC but they lack
sufficient technical and financial means to formulate detailed operational strategies for implementing the
NPP.
3.6           Several factors in Cameroon have had a negative impact on the promotion of family
planning. These include: the assumption that women need the husband's consent before receiving
contraceptives (83 percent of male respondents and 75 percent of female respondents make this assumption);
concerns about the safety of modem contraceptive methods (only 30 percent believe that modern methods are
safe); and the perceived hostility of family planning service providers (44 percent of respondents indicated
that nurses were rude and disrespectful towards family planning clients). Information campaigns aimed at
both men and women about family planning are necessary, as well as training programs for service
providers.
3.7           Sources of family planning information and frequency of exposure to such information vary.
The 1991 DHS found that almost no women were exposed to such messages in the month preceding the
survey.  A  1992 study by Population Communications Services (PCS) focused on urban areas and
determined the following as important sources of family planning information: radio (64 percent), television
(46 percent), newspapers (24 percent), and songs (23 percent). Nationally, exposure to television and radio



12
vanes according to province: in the Adamaoua, North, and Far North provinces only 23 percent of mothers
with children under five years of age listen to the radio and only 13 percent watch television. Traditional
methods of communication are also frequently used for transmitting family planning information; 75 percent
of respondents reported using conversations to communicate such information.
3.8           The Health Education Unit (HEU) of MOPH, located in the Directorate of Family and
Mental Health, is responsible for creating radio and television programs, plays, posters, and booklets relating
to health. Currently, this service is underutilized, and other ministries have begun their own IEC efforts. A
strengthened Health Education Unit could act as coordinator of ongoing IEC activities, collecting ideas and
lessons and initiating training for leaders of grassroots women's groups about disease prevention and family
planning. Potential beneficiaries include: the Groupes d'animation rurale and the Maison de la femme
(Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs) and the Agents de developpement communautaire
(Ministry of Agriculture).
3.9           The limited number of public and private health facilities offering family planning services
as well as the quality of the services provided represent significant constraints for the increase of
contraceptive prevalence rates.  The Directorate of Family and Mental Health (DSFM) is currently
implementing a program to integrate family planning services into the minimum service delivery package of
the health centers. Based on recently adopted guidelines and service protocols, the program emphasizes the
quality of clinical services and counseling, the availability of (a limited range of) contraceptive supplies, and
accurate reporting of results. Future development of services will need to emphasize a wider range of
contraceptive choices, increased outreach services, and improved supervision.
B.    Health Policy
3.10          Background and Content. Even before the Alma-Ata Conference (1978) on primary health
care, Cameroon experimented with different ways to expand health services beyond the existing hospital
system to reach the community level. The Public Health Development Zones pilot project, located in six
areas, used mobile outreach teams from the Departmental level to visit villages and conduct sessions on
health education, treatment of minor illnesses, and provide referral services. From the experience, the
MOPH concluded that: (a) communities were willing to participate and organize themselves in order to
improve health services in their area; (b) health activities could be carried out at the community level and
community members found these activities desirable; (c) the mobile approach was not cost-effective; and
(d) coordination of this program with other health activities carried out by the MOPH was extremely
difficult.
3.11          Beginning in 1982, the MOPH sought to bring health services to communities on a
continuing rather than intermittent basis. Policy emphasized the need to integrate primary health care
activities into the overall strategy and activities of the MOPH and to create formal mechanisms to facilitate
community participation, including Village Health Committees (VHCs), Village Health Workers (VHWs),
and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs).  Under this approach, community funds provided (through
construction or renovation) a health hut as a base for the CHWs and TBAs as well as an initial stock of
medicines for the village pharmacy (propharmacy); the MOPH trained and supervised the Health Workers
and the Traditional Birth Attendants. By 1987, the MOPH concluded that: (a) health centers were not
integrated into the PHC system and were unresponsive to changing local needs; and (b) communities were
unable to sustain their initial effort with the result that most health huts and committees ceased to function
effectively. In response to these criticisms, the National Primary Health Care Committee was formed in June
1987 to review Cameroon's PHC policy.



13
3.12          In 1989, MOPH reorganized its strategy for primary health care delivery; thereafter, with
assistance from the World Bank (and other multilateral and bilateral donors), MOPH formulated its health
sector policy which was approved by the Government in December 1992. The PHC strategy endorses the
principles of (a) decentralized health service delivery and management; (b) co-financing of the costs of
health care; and (c) implementation of an essential drugs policy. The three principles embodied in the new
PHC strategy are being successfully tested in a number of bilateral donor-sponsored projects including the
primary health care project in South West province supported by GTZ and the integrated urban health center
at Soboum, Douala funded by Swiss Cooperation. The proposed project would build on these experiences.
Annex 14 summarizes the national health sector policy.
3.13          Increased decentralization would clearly establish responsibilities at each level of the health
care system: (a) the Central Lcvel of MOPH, responsible for policy-making, standard setting, training and
cxtemal aid coordination, (b) the Provincial Level Health Authority, responsible for supervision, technical
support, and coordination of all PHC activities in a province , and (c) the Operational Level Health District,
comprising the health centers and dispensaries located within the district, the community including the health
committee (representing the villages or neighborhoods served by the health center), and the District Hospital
(DH) serving the role of referral/counter-referral facility for the surrounding health centers.
3.14          The Health Center would provide a minimum package of integrated services (preventive,
promotive, and curative) at the center and in the surrounding community through outreach activities.
Included in this package are: pre- and post-natal maternal care; under fives growth monitoring;
immunizations; family planning; nutrition and health education, diagnosis and treatment of prevalent diseases
(malaria, respiratory infections, etc.); and local control of endemic diseases. Management of the health
center would be based on a continuous exchange of views between the beneficiary communities and the
health services and would result in a more efficient and effective use of available resources.
3.15          While the primary health care policy clearly emphasizes rural areas, the principles would
also be applied in urban areas where certain health problems are worse than in rural areas: the 1991 DHS
shows that acute under nutrition among children under 5 years old is four times more prevalent in urban
areas; nearly half of infants aged 6 to 9 months in Yaounde/Douala are fully (and prematurely) weaned;
affordable pharmaceuticals are also difficult to find, since urban residents must depend on private
pharmacies; and the population per health center ratio is higher, with resultant crowded facilities, decreased
quality, and long waiting time.
3.16          Co-financing has been instituted on the basis of legislation passed in 1990 and 1992 (para.
2.44). Community financing, generated and managed locally, would be used for the operation of the health
facility; non-community financing (from governmental sources and international assistance) would fund
salaries, training, construction and equipment, and purchase of an initial stock of drugs.
3.17          Components of an essential generic drugs policy are being formulated. A national list of
essential drugs for public sector health facilities was signed on June 15, 1993. The decree also states that
only drugs on this list can be prescribed and that revisions may be made as needed. Legislation on the
importation, control, and distribution of drugs is being formulated.
3.18          Sector Development Issues. Donor support for the Government's health sector policy and
PHC strategy has provided the means for initiating many of its elements on a national scale by MOPH,
including definition of the elements of a health district approach, experimentation of alternative cost recovery
mechanisms, and testing of an autonomous purchasing agency for essential drugs. These field-tested



14
approaches form the basis of the activities to be financed by the proposed project. However, the de facto
organization of donor support by province (Annex  11) and the relative autonomy allowed thus far to projects
has contributed to certain regional inequities which may in turn pose problems for coordinated development
and implementation of the national health policy. For this reason, the project will both correct regional
imbalances and support efforts to coordinate health scctor activities.
3.19          Currently, sector coordination and management is the responsibility of the Technical
Committee for Coordination and Follow-up of Health Sector Projects (TCC). Composed of senior MOPH
personnel and organized largely on an ad hoc basis, the TCC has accomplished much. Continued progress
will require broader participation (through the inclusion of representatives of other key ministries involved
with PHN issues), more formal technical support (through a strengthened permanent secretariat), and a
clearly defined and mandated role for policy and program development.
3.20          Effective operationalization of the health district approach will require the establishment or
reinforcement (at all three levels of the health pyramid) of systems to manage human, material, and financial
resources. Certain of these management issues are currently under review by the Government, including:
revision of the health management information system, improved management and redeployment of
personnel, analysis and coordination of sector financing (including cost recovery and external aid), and
strengthened budgeting and accounting practices. Other management issues crucial to the success of the
health district concept are at different stages of development, including staff training, essential drugs, and
appropriate infrastructure and equipment.
3.21          Most advanced is the definition of appropriate infrastructure and equipment and their link to
staffing and activities of the health centers and district hospitals. National seminars in Bertoua (1992) and
Bafoussam (1993) have identified the location of the health districts (specifically, the district health services
and hospitals) and defined activities, space and equipment needs, and required staffing of a functional health
district. Two major issues remain. First, because implementation experience is limited to a few functional
health districts (heavily supported by externally funded projects), questions of technical feasibility and
financial viability have only been addressed partially (based on data from operating sub-districts) or
theoretically (on the basis of districts operating in other countries). Second, experience in implementing
urban health districts is very limited both in Cameroon and elsewhere. The proposed project would be thc
first in Cameroon to contribute to the creation of functional health districts in both rural and urban areas.
3.22          The chronic shortage of drugs in public health facilities and the high cost of drugs in
commercial pharmacies (exacerbated by the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc) have combined to limit
access to adequate medical treatment for the majority of Cameroonians. Government remains committed to
overhauling its drug policy, and consultations involving Government, the pharmaceutical sector, and donors
have established a consensus on the general content of the needed reforms. Donors (including the IDA) have
agreed that the European Union and WHO would take the lead in the dialogue with the Government on drug
policy formulation. Donors and Government have agreed that the new Central Drug Supply Store would be
a flexible, efficient structure, act as a purchasing agent for the provincial drug supply centers using
recognized competitive bidding procedures, and maintain only a minimum buffer stock for emergency
purposes.
3.23          Development of key elements of an essential drugs policy and procurement system  is
underway but needs to be systematized. MOPH has established its list of essential drugs, but it has not yet
been distributed and explained to health facilities nationwide; quality control measures both for licensing the
import of generic drugs and for sampling and chemical testing are currently inadequate, and the existing
provincial drug supply systems need to be reviewed and integrated with the national system to reduce costs.



I5
In addition, the commercial and social roles of thc private pharmaccutical sector must bc more clcarlv
defined and a more comprehensive regulatory framework adopted conccniing issUes such as gencric drugs,
pharmacist training and pricing  With support from WHO and thc European Union. thc Govcrnmcnt has
established a committee composcd of MOPH officials and the pharmaccutical Industry representatives to
prepare recommendations for Governmcnt action which should include refonms of the drug supplv and
distribution system, financing of drugs and quality control mcasuires
3.24           Training of medical and paramedical personncl has not kept pace with citller tcchnical or
managerial developments in the field   Cameroon has onc mcdical school, the Yaounde-bascd Centre
universitaire des sciences de la sante (CUSS), wvhich trains about 60 to 70 ph\sicians per year  The
curriculum must be updated and adapted to include the Governmcnt's reoricntation of primary health care
and health system management, including supervislon of hcalth personnel  ln-scrx ice training to incrcasc
physicians' knowledge and skills is insufficient  Paramcdical pcrsonnel have bccn trained in the 34 nursing
schools located throughout the country, but the majority of these schools arc now  closcd because of
prolonged hiring freezcs. Medical and paramcdical training has cmphasized ciirativc rather than prevcntive
health care and has virtually ignored managcment of decentralized healtlh servicesh anv rcorganization of the
health system including preventive health, outrcach and familv planning also \\Ill rcquilrc additional training
in those areas for existing health personnel.
3.25           Finally, the decline of more than 10 pcrcent In actual cxpcnditurcs since l (9)0-(l and the
poor economic prospects for the country posc problems for the sustainability of the proposed Investments.
During project implementation, the financing plan (para. 4 67) makcs minimal demands on the Government
(less than US$1 million per year. mostly taxes). To cover the recuLrrclt costs generated by the projcct, assur-
ances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) GOC' would take all necessary  mcasures to increase
progressively the share of the health budget in the total governimcnit budget from thc currcnt level of 5.0
percent to the level of 7% bv FY 1996/97, 8% by FY I 99X/99, and to I 0%)Io bv the end of FNY I (99/2000 and
allocate such increases to non-salary expenditurcs until the cornplctionl of the project  'I'he project would

efficiency of budget expenditures.

the first freestanding Bank Group opcration in the hcalth scctor in Camcrooni UIindcr the Social Dimcnsions

led the Government and the Bank to cancel the health componcnt and latcr the cntirc project
3.27           Within the framework of SDA, a Japanesc Government grant (adminlistercd by the Bank)
has since 1991 financed activities to: (a) formulatc and publish national hcalth and population policies,
(b) develop operational strategies for their implementation- (c) rc-equip and revitalize basic health care
facilities and strengthen serviccs for the poor (emphasizing maternal and child health. but also control of
sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS), and (d) strengthcn the insttutLional capacitY of thc MOPH in
strategic planning, programming and budgeting, financial and personniiel managcmiita and coordination of
sector operations.



16
3.28          Lessons Learned. This would be the Bank Group's first freestanding operation in the PHN
sector. Experience with other Bank projects suggests that project execution activities should be integrated
into MOPH's existing departments and technical services and that the timely availability of counterpart
funds and the budget approval/expenditure process should be closely monitored to minimize delays. The
experience gained from the implementation of the Japanese grant, the recommendations of the 1993 country
implementation review (CIR), and the conclusions of the recent country procurement assessment report
(CPAR) have also been incorporated into the proposed project. Specifically, project implementation would
be integrated into the ministerial structures of MOPH and MEF (para. 5.5) to ensure the internalization of
management skills. Counterpart funding for incremental recurrent costs would be included in future budgets
of both ministries (para. 3.25). Project activities address recommendations of the latest country portfolio
review (CPPR) for improving financial management and increasing donor coordination while reducing the
use of (foreign) technical assistance. Measures for improving procurement procedures were discussed during
appraisal and IDA credit negotiations and include strengthening ministry and provincial capabilities,
international competitive bidding and introducing standardized bidding documents (paras. 5.13-5.19).
3.29          IDA Country Assistance Strategy/Rationale for IDA Involvement. The most recent country
assistance strategy (CAS) discussions took place in June 1994 during the Board presentation of the
Economic Recovery Credit (ERC). The Cameroon CAS emphasizes the development of the human
resources sector and strongly focused interventions to alleviate poverty, including improvements in the
delivery of social services to low-income groups. In the health sector, Government policy emphasizes the
strengthening of family planning activities, the improvement of primary health care services and the
establishment of programs to combat nutritional deficiencies. The CAS provides that IDA will support the
implementation of this policy through the proposed health, fertility and nutrition project. Through a Japanese
Grant for Population and Health administered by IBRD and the PPF-finaneed preinvestment studies, IDA
has played an active and key role in the successful PHN sector policy dialogue with GOC, which has
produced major shifts in health and population policies in Cameroon. With coordinated donor support of the
PHN policy, GOC now wants to move to an implementation phase of the new policies and needs the financial
support of IDA to translate policies into operational programs. IDA assistance complements the activities of
other donors, and is focused on geographical areas where no other donor support is envisaged. The proposed
project would: (a) contribute to the strategic reorientation of the PHN sector by completing the policy
formulation/testing phase and consolidating these advances legislatively and organizationally; (b) establish
the requisite technical and managerial conditions to increase the productivity of investments in the PHN
sector; and (c) finance the rapid expansion of health service delivery in geographical areas (both rural and
urban) not currently envisioned by other donors.
3.30          As an active participant in the ongoing population and health sector policy formulation and
implementation dialogue, IDA would support measures to: (a) promote institutional and organizational
reforms (including increased decentralization of health services), (b) strengthen the management of health
sector resources, and (c) improve sector performance of health and family planning service delivery and
support programs. As a new donor in the PHN sector, IDA would promote both multisectoral coordination
and donor cooperation to review policy and coordinate program implementation. Under the proposed project,
IDA would assist the Government to establish an organized framework (consortium of key donors) for
regular consultations with major donors and all relevant ministries (including Planning, Social Welfare and
Women's Affairs, Agriculture, and National Education Ministries).

IV.   THE PROJECT
A.    Project Summary
4.1           Project Objectives. The project would help the Government implement key components of
its population and health policies. The basic objectives of the project are to: (a) provide institutional support
for continued development of the national population policy and rapid implementation of a national FP/IEC
strategy; (b) promote complementary organizational and administrative reforms needed to strengthen the
management of health sector resources and advance the decentralization of health services; and (c) expand
the coverage and improve the quality of primary health care coverage to underserved, low-income
populations.
4.2          The project Action Plan (Annex 15), refined during appraisal and confirmed at negotiations,
provides a strategic framework organizing the remaining policy decisions, prerequisite implementation
actions, and anticipated outputs. It would serve as a tool for monitoring progress of sectoral reforms. An
overall project implementation manual has been prepared and was discussed during negotiations; provincial
implementation manuals would adapt this strategic framework to local conditions and priorities during
project execution.
4.3           Proiect Description. The project would assist the Government through the year 2001 with a
combination of national-level support to reorient and reorganize primary health care delivery; and intensive
regional-level assistance to decentralize and strengthen basic health care services in 18 health districts not
currently receiving external financial aid. Nationally, the project would provide assistance to implement the
1993 population policy ; develop public PHN services; train MOPH managers and service providers; supply
essential generic drugs, vaccines, and contraceptives; and expand communication activities. Regionally, the
project would support the expansion of quality primary health care coverage to about 3 million people
through the establishment of 18 fully operational health care districts out of about 130 districts projected
over the next 10 years. The 18 districts selected are low-income districts with high concentration of the poor
and currently lack of adequate services. Coverage would be divided between rural and urban areas, with
Bank assistance to nine rural districts in the Center, East, West and Far North provinces and nine urban dis-
tricts in Yaounde and Douala.
4.4          The specific components of the project are as follows:
(i)   Assistance in the Development and Implementation of the National Population Policy and the
FP/IEC strategy (US$1.8 million or 5 percent of base cost), by supporting the activities of the
National Population Commission and improving demographic data collection and dissemination for
population policy-making and operations;
(ii)   Organizational and Administrative Reforms of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to
Strengthen the Management of Health Sector Resources and Promote Decentralization of
Health Services (US$1.5 million or 4 percent of base cost), by supporting the strengthening of
MOPH's health services and management structures and developing health management information
systems; and
(iii)   Expansion of Primary Health Care Coverage and Improvement in the Quality of Health
Service Delivery (US$34.7 million or 90 percent of base cost): Expanded coverage would be
assured by supporting PHC services through decentralized health districts; improving family



I 
planning and maternal and child health services. and strengthcning Nutrition Interventions. Quality
of servicc dcllvcr wotuld hc assured by strengthening the training and retraining of health sector
managcrs and hcalth serN ice providers at all levels including community health workers for outreach
actiN ities. supplx in g sscltiall gelneric drugs, vaccines, and contraecptives to the public and private
non-profit hcalth scrvicCs. and introducing multisectoral approaches to strengthen the Health
Education lUniit of MOPII and cxpand communication programs through IEC.

B      Detailcd l rsciitat ion of the Project
4.5            Support the Activities of the National Population Commission (NPC).  The project
would provide institutional support to the National Population Commission (NPC) to: (a) continue building a
national consensus on1 the necd for. and the econiomic and social benefits of, family planning and child
spacing. (b) gather aind dissemiin1ate infornmation necessary to develop population action plans, and (c)
develop sectoral stratcgics antd progranms to implement the National Population Policy.
4.6           T[he NPC. an iutcrmiinlistcrial bodx supported by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF). is responsible for population policy planning and monitoring. The project would assist the NPC and
its technical secretariat, the Directorate of Planning (DP), to carry out this mandate by financing training of
DP staff and consolidating its offices, and initiating a work program  (in collaboration with technical
Ministries) to prepare the operationial strategies for fertility reduction. The project would finance seminars,
logistical expCensCs associated N ith the} mectings of the NPC and the costs of printing and distributing the
population policx docuLments.
4.7            Additional training would bc pro\ ided for NPC demographers and managerial staff; DP
would idcntifN candidates and prcparc training schcdules for IDA review before implementation.  Local
training institutions \\ould be used to the extent possible, since both the University of Yaounde and the
Institute of Demography 'Training anld Research (IFORD) offer appropriate courses of study.
4.8            Improve D)emographic Data Collection and Dissemination.  To formulate detailed
operational stratcgics for imuplcnemeitation of the National Population Policy, NPCs population planners
would need additional inf'ormailtioll on issues such as the fastest growing populations (and the reasons why),
region-specific determinants of fertility, and Culturally appropriate approaches to fertility reduction
measures. Withl projcct support. the Directorate of Census of MEF would carry out a series of fertility
surveys. Agreenmcnt was reached v\ith GOC during negotiations that a fertility survey would be carried out
everv two \,ears and a contracepti%c prevalence survey would be carried out annually, starting in CY 1996,
both in accordancc x\ith termls of refercrce acccptable to IDA, and that the results would be furnished to IDA
for comments  In addition, the Dli \ould also rcview the impact of population growvth on the environment
through periodic rcgionial studies
4.9            Under thc project. the staff and scope of work of DP would be expanded to enable it to
assist the technical Ministrics of GOC to develop and implcment sector-specific population strategies  GOC
gave assurances at negotiations that it would submit to IDA by June 30, 1996 for review and comments a
plan of action to develop sectoral strategies for thc implementation of the National Population Policy as part
of ongoing dialogue On population issues, and im1plement the plan,



19
4.10          As one strategy, the project would finance dissemination of the National Population Policy
through (a) training and awareness-raising seminars for the provincial and district health teams and (b)
sensitization campaigns, seminars and workshops to inform community leaders, opinion-makers and couples
of the benefits of family planning.
4.11         With project financing, the DP would establish in Yaounde a national information center on
issues related to population and development. The population and development information center would
collect reading materials on population issues in the country and organize periodic seminars for youth,
political and opinion leaders and women's groups. IDA assistance would include the provision of books,
materials and equipment.
4.12          Support the Strengthening of MOPH's Health Services and Management Structures.
The project would support ongoing efforts to (a) reorganize MOPH; (b) introduce/improve management
systems and tools (personnel management; finance, budgeting, and accounting; etc.) needed to improve the
efficiency of MOPH operations; and (c) decentralize health service delivery by increasing local control of
health service operations.
4.13          Certain central functions of MOPH would be strengthened and expanded, including (a) PHN
policy formulation and monitoring; (b) service delivery norms and standards, including training of health
personnel; and (c) planning and management of sector financial resources, including investment planning and
external aid coordination. To improve the internal administrative efficiency of MOPH, the project would
finance appropriate office equipment and training as well as minor rehabilitation and upgrading of services
(telephone, electrical and paint work) for selected MOPH central offices in Yaounde and in the participating
provinces.
4.14         The project would improve strategic management of MOPH by increasing the role and
reinforcing the technical capabilities for policy formulation and monitoring of the Technical Committee for
the Coordination and Follow-up of Health Sector Projects (TCC)(para. 3.19). The TCC would become a
permanent oversight body of MOPH, chaired by the Minister and responsible for PHN sector policy and
strategy definition, program planning and external aid coordination and monitoring of sector operations. The
TCC would be enlarged to include representatives of the ministries in charge of planning, finance, social
welfare, women's affairs, education, and agriculture.
4.15          Currently, MOPH proposes that the TCC create subcommittees (standing or ad hoc as
needed) to oversee implementation of specific aspects of the health policy; the secretariat's role would be
limited to administration and support of these subcommittees and of the full TCC. During appraisal, the
mission agreed with MOPH on the specific role of the TCC with respect to the implementation of the
proposed project. The project would support the activities of the subcommittees and the secretariat, assist
with publication and dissemination of TCC's documents, and support both the TCC's sector coordination
activities and its project coordination responsibilities. At negotiations, an initial set of sectoral issues for
discussion by the TCC and a proposed approach for addressing these issues were discussed.
4.16   The TCC would also play an important role in coordinating the Technical Directorates' justification
of, and search for, external assistance. In the short term, the project would support basic policy analysis
activities which: (a) cut across provincial and individual donor-sponsored project boundaries including data
collection staff training, and program supervision, (b) emphasize common policies, norms and service
standards to be applied in the national health system, and (c) permit MOPH to clearly articulate its position
to donors through the TCC. In the longer term, the project would promote a consortium of key PHN donors,



20
as a means for organizing regular consultations between the Government and the major donors; these would
include semi-annual Government/ Donor/IDA joint supervision missions for field operations.
4.17           At present, the general principles of the new health policy often lack the supporting details
needed to translate them into fully operational programs throughout the country. To establish effective
norms and standards, the project would (a) provide technical support for drafting additional legislation and
regulation; and (b) promote (through the TCC) simplification and increased flexibility in managing of
MOPH's human, material and financial resources. Ministerial decrees have been adopted, authorizing the
establishment of the health districts, and specifying the roles and responsibilities of central and provincial
structures, and the internal functioning and rclationship of the various health committees.
4.18           During appraisal, measures were idcntified for reinforcing MOPH's authority in matters of
personnel management: hiring, transfer, promotion and discipline, etc.  While existing civil service
regulations are sufficient, their application is inconsistent and ineffective. At negotiations, GOC indicated
measures and means for applying them to ensure equitable geographical distribution of staff and improved
internal management of civil scrvice personnel assigned to MOPH and gave assurances that it w,.>uld take
necessary measures. The project would improvc the administrative procedures and practices for managing
staff at the central, provincial and district levels and strengthen the planning process for staff recruitment and
dcployment in the sector. The project would finance the costs associated with the implementation of the
proposed organizational changes, including the cost of printing and disseminating new job descriptions and
internal procedures, and relocation costs for staff redeployed.
4.19           Financial planning and management of the sector would focus both on the investment and
recurrent budgets. Investment planning and budgeting for the health sector would be strengthened at all
levels; the project would provide financial and technical assistance for: improving medium-term (three year)
health sector planning; strengthening project preparation capabilities at the central and provincial levels; and
providing additional assistance to provincial health authorities in preparing investment projects for their
respective health districts. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would review with
IDA in June of each year: a) all investment expenditures made in the health sector in the previous year and
planned for the coming three years, with particular attention given to their recurrent cost implications; and
b) expenditures of the non-salary recurrent budget across existing programs and services to cover at a
minimum their estimated annual operating costs for materials, fuel, maintenance, etc.
4.20           The project would support MOPH efforts to improve the methods and procedures for
formulating and executing the operating budget. The project would help MOPH to: (a) restructure its budget
at the different levels through a need-based estimation of required resources (more objective criteria, size of
populations served, standard of physical plant, etc.); (b) increase the share of the national budget earmarked
for non-wage operating costs; and (c) reduce spending delays by simplifying procedures for accessing
budgeted resources. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it would submit to IDA not later than
April 30 of the year evidence that the previous year's budget was spent as originally intended, and prepare
and discuss the proposed operating budgets for the subsequent year.
4.21           Effective decentralization would establish the provincial health authorities and train the
district health teams as the managerial units of field operations and both would have additional
responsibilities concerning: planning and program management; use of approved budgets and available
health personnel; and acquisition and distribution of drugs as well as the use of recovered revenues for drug
resupply activities. The provincial level will also have a variety of program coordination functions, including
technical support, training and supervision of the decentralized health districts.



21
4.22          Staffing of the different positions of the provincial health authorities is underway, and the
Government has provided assurances that all key positions in the provincial health authorities supported by
the project would be fully staffed at all times. To improve the working conditions of the provincial
authorities, the project would finance minor building repairs, appropriate office equipment, and vehicles.
4.23          Project support to the provincial health authorities would initially focus on improving their
abilities to assist the districts in the preparation of the health district development plan for extending the
coverage and quality of services. Assistance would include training, logistical support for organization of
planning workshops, and short-term technical assistance where needed. The project would also finance
provincial efforts to implement improvements in the health management information system (HMIS) and in
personnel management (supervision, perforrnance evaluation, and training).
4.24          Because of the delays anticipated in implementing decentralization, project support to the
provincial health authorities would allow for alternative approaches and permit flexibility in the use of
resources to establish the basic components of the health district.  Estimated timetables for full
implementation of the health district were prepared during appraisal with central and provincial staff and
indicate a minimum of approximately three districts per year. To reduce the costs of supervision and to
promote the sharing of experiences, districts would be established collaboratively with other donors and,
where feasible, contiguously.
4.25          The project, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, would
establish a permanent system of financial accounting and auditing of income deriving from cost recovery on
drug sales and medical visits. An independent accounting firm has been selected to assist with this effort.
During appraisal, terms of reference were agreed to for assistance to develop requisite accounting
procedures. At negotiations, the Government presented a satisfactory institutional and regulatory framework,
agreed to by the Ministry of Finance, for collecting revenues from drug sales and medical visits and
accounting and financial management of costs recovered by the health centers and district clinical facilities,
and gave an assurance that it would maintain a system acceptable to IDA. The project would finance the
costs associated with the implementation of the technical tools needed for accounting and financial
management. The Government has given its assurance that financial officers would be appointed on each
provincial team and at the central level to oversee the cost recovery operations and audit the related accounts.
4.26          Develop a Health Management Information System (HMIS). The project would support
development and expansion in the covered areas of MOPH's proposed HMIS currently being tested with the
support of several projects. The proposed HMIS would provide information to MOPH managers at the
district, provincial and central levels on the basis of agreed-upon indicators reflecting epidemiological trends,
morbidity and mortality trends, service delivery (utilization rates and service ratios), and resource use (status
of health infrastructure, staffing needs and training requirements; budgets and revenues; and pharmaceutical,
contraceptive, and vaccine supplies.
4.27          The project would assist the statistics section of the Planning and Studies Directorate of
MOPH in the design and production of statistical forms to be used in the country, in providing on-the-job
training and periodic supervision of health statistics staff at all levels, and in the centralization of processed
data for annual publication and dissemination. The project would finance the introduction of methods to
increase local use of collected data and to improve feedback to field staff on the quality and meaning of data
received. Included in the project are costs for training workshops/seminars for MOPH statistics staff, data
processing equipment for provincial and central level personnel, and publication and dissemination of the
collected information.



22
4.28          Support PHC Services through Decentralized Health Districts.  The project would
finance the expansion of primary health care (PHC), maternal and child health (MCH) services, and family
planning (FP) services in half of Cameroon's provinces (Center, Littoral, West, East, and Far North) and its
two principal cities (Yaounde and Douala). Between 1995 and 2000, 18 fully functional decentralized health
districts (HDs) comprising 150 integrated health centers and 18 first-referral clinical facilities (district
hospitals) would be made operational with active beneficiary community involvement and support. The
following rural and urban districts have been selected by the GOC:
Rural: Yokadouma and Mouloundou (East province); Foumban, Malantouen, and Mbouda (Wcst
province), Eseka and Ntui (Center province); and Kousseri and Makari (Far North provincc)
Urban: New Bell, Log Baba, Cite des Palmiers, Deido, and Bonaberi (Douala), and Bivemassi,
Nkolndongo, Cite Verte and Djoungolo (Yaounde).
Within the proposed urban districts, depressed areas and "bidonvilles" would be targeted in order to address
rapidly the very low health, fertility and nutrition status of the poor.
4.29          Under the project, a health district (HD) would serve a population of about 100,000 people
and would respond to the majority of health problems encountered by its defined community. Each fully
functional health district would comprise: (a) a network averaging six integrated health centers (IHC); (b) a
district clinical facility (DCF) providing first referral and counter-referral services; and (c) a district health
team responsible for operating the health district. GOC has adopted appropriate texts and regulations to:
(a) establish the legal basis of the health districts in Cameroon, and (b) specify the modalities to ensurc
decentralization of management responsibilities within the public health system.
4.30          The definition of staffing norms, spatial needs, and standard equipment lists is well
underway. Based on current pilot health districts in the Littoral, North-West, South-West, and Far North
provinces as well as in the Soboum urban health center in Douala, implementation plans (with re-
,ponsibilities and estimated completion times) for establishing the IHCs, DCFs, and district health tcams are
defined in the implementation manual. With existing implementation capabilities at the district and provin-
cial levels, the time required to establish a fully functional health district is estimated at approximately thrce
years. The project would finance the proposed activities during each phase of these plans, including
mobilization of the population, creation and training of the local management structures, facility rehabili-
tation and re-equipping, management and technical training, and drug supply. Under the terms of reference
agreed upon during appraisal, an infrastructure consultant reviewed the technical norms for facility
rehabilitation ar.a has prepared recommendations for the project's 18 health districts.
4.31          Improve Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning Services. The project wvould
support and expand MOPH's efforts to integrate the entire range of MCH and FP services into the newly
formed health districts. Objectives would vary for each rural and urban district supported by the project but
by the year 2000 the project, in the areas covered, would: (a) reduce matemal mortality by 30-50 percent
(from 430 to 250 per 100,000 live births): (b) raise the vaccination coverage for the main target groups from
under 40 percent to between 60 and 80 percent; (c) lower morbidity and mortality for children under fivc, (d)
enhance the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups (expecting and nursing women, chil-
dren under 5 and young girls); and (e) reduce current levels of fertility among women of reproductive age by
increasing the modem contraceptive prevalence rate from less than 5 percent to betwcen 10 percent and 20
percent.



23
4.32    Services would be aimed principally at mothers and children and emphasize low-cost preventive
health care, family planning, and nutrition services. Each IHC would be expected to provide a minimum
package of integrated services including: (a) prenatal, intra-partum and postpartum care; (b) neonatal and
under-five consultations, vaccinations and disease control (pneumonia, malaria, diarrhea and anemia); (c)
juvenile and adolescent health services; and (d) family planning services.
4.33          Obstetric and pediatric services would be strengthened at the IHC and DCF levels. The
project would finance a strategy combining outreach activities and health promotion with improved clinical
interventions and training of personnel.
4.34          The immunization strategy would include social mobilization and would strengthen
institutional services (schools and women's groups). The project would support: (a) training (basic and
refresher training, cold chain maintenance, IEC/ motivation); (b) purchase of vaccines; and (c) maintenance
and replacement of cold chain equipment. Reporting systems would be improved, and MIS data collection
and processing would be emphasized.
4.35          Basic family planning services would be provided as a component of the minimum package
of integrated PHC services. At negotiations, GOC gave assurances that it would submit to IDA before
December 31, 1995 a national program for expanding family planning services over the 1996-1999 period,
and implement the program. This program would emphasize the quality of FP services and increase access
to clinical services and counseling, ensure regular contraceptive supplies, and improve reporting systems.
4.36          Recently adopted MOPH policies and guidelines for improving the quality of MCH/FP
service delivery ("Protocoles des services de planification familiale" and "Politique et standards des
services de sante maternelle et infantile et planification familiale") would be printed and distributed to all
health centers. They would serve as a basis for training personnel, including the traditional birth attendants
(TBAs) and other potential community development agents.
4.37         All supervision activities organized by the health districts would be based on the Protocoles
et Standards des Services de SMI/PF.  MOPH  has adopted a supervision system  with schedules,
responsibilities, supervision session plans (for the districts), and criteria for evaluating staff performance. At
the central level, supervision would emphasize: (a) compliance with norms and standards of services and
(b) centralize and process provincial HMIS data for planning future operations. Overall supervision of the
FP program would be located at the provincial level which would become the logistical base for materials,
training, and technical assistance. Physicians at the district level would be responsible for supervising the
nurses and midwives, and occasionally, the outreach health staff. They would receive training at designated
training sites, as would the nurse/midwives. The nurse/midwife supervisors located at the health centers
would be responsible for the supervision of TBAs and other development agents within the communit.
4.38          Supervision would emphasize: (a) guidance and training to health staff; (b) assistance with
resources and logistics; (c) monitoring and evaluation. Supervisors would be trained in interpersonal skills,
counseling, and clinical skills. Tools such as reporting forms, budget coefficients, etc. would be developed to
facilitate the supervision work, and the project would share GTZ and USAID experiences and lessons
learned through their projects. Service indicators would be selected and standardized, and special forms
would be used to collect information. Short-term technical assistance would be provided to the health
districts for the implementation of the supervision activities. Evaluation would be based on the results of the
fertility and contraceptive prevalence surveys referred to in para. 4.8.



24
4.39          The project would help GOC reorganize and standardize MCH/FP in all 150 integrated
health centers and 18 district clinical facilities proposed for financing. Rehabilitation of MCH/FP services
within the IHC would be financed as well as equipment, materials, and supplies. In conformity with
nationally established norms, access to family planning services would also be improved by diversifying the
mix of available FP methods: (a) IHCs would provide Type I methods (condoms and spermicides),
injectables, and (where equipment and staff expertise permit) IUD and Norplant insertion/removal would be
carried out; and (b) voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) would be performed only at the district level
clinical facilities, on a referral basis. District physicians would provide obstetrical care and treatment for
referred clients and would perform consultations for infertility and VSC services if they have becn trained to
do so.
4.40          Supervised by the IHC head, outreach services would be provided by both IHC staff and
other sources such as the village health committees, TBAs, and community development agents (supervised
by the ministries of social affairs and agriculture). The project would train and equip these service providers
to perform a number of community-based functions comprising: (a) general PHC work (including nutrition
information), (b) information on the benefits of family planning and available methods (as well as the
dangers of sexually transmitted diseases), identification of potential clients, and referral to appropriate
services; (c) distribution of Type I contraceptives (condoms and spermicides); and (d) referral of women
with side effects or complications requiring medical attention. This would be the beginning of a community-
based distribution system of contraceptives to be extended to the rest of Cameroon in future years.
4.41          Contraceptive needs have been estimated for the period 1994-99 (Annex 16) on the basis of
population projections, current contraceptive prevalence rates (CPR) by modern method, and anticipated
increases of 3 percent per year over the i)roject period. The project would strengthen MOPH's management
of contraceptives by: (a) improving the data base and methods for more accurately forecasting demand by
method, (b) reinforcing procurement and distribution in country, and (c) regularly monitoring supplies and
supervising personnel.
4.42         Strengthen Nutrition Interventions. Given Cameroon's different socio-ecological systems,
nutrition interventions would require multiple strategies based on the characteristics of each region; the
project would finance surveys of the extent and location of the specific nutrition problems as a basis for
developing such strategies. The project would support several types of research into the nutritional problems
faced in Cameroon. Baseline surveys would be conducted to determine the anthropometric status of children
and the weaning practices of mothers. Operational research would also be carried out first to test (on a pilot
basis) new weaning foods using locally available foods and then to monitor child growth after introduction
and promotion of the new foods. The Centre de la Recherche en Alimentation et Nutrition (CRAN) under a
contract with MOPH would carry out studies to assess the acceptance rate and effectiveness of the actions
and the nutritional status of the target populations. The project would train a team of Cameroonians for the
management and coordination of nutrition programs and would finance costs associated with the collection,
analysis, and dissemination of the research results. Annex 17 provides a detailed discussion of the nutrition
component. The project area includes regions of contrasted ecology, food habits, nutrition and health
status. In each sub-region, specific health and nutrition strategies will be developed and specific
objectives will be selected. The project will adopt a two-pronged approach to the reduction of the four
major nutritional deficiencies: protein-energy malnutrition, iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin A deficiency
and iodine deficiency disorders:



25
- Routine prevention and treatment of patients and users of health centers.
- Outreach activities of eradication of parasitic and nutritional disorders organized at three to
six months intervals in villages and slum areas located around the participating health centers.
4.43          The first year of the project will be used to organize and prepare the materials necessary
for the campaigns: IEC, base-line studies, equipment and drugs for the participating health centers,
monitoring and evaluation of impact strategies. The prevention and treatment strategy will include direct
nutrition services through the 150 integrated health centers. In these centers the staff will ensure a close
linkage between health and nutrition activities (growth monitoring, education, micronutrient deficiency
eradication, etc.).  This would broaden the effect of health interventions and enhance their cost
effectiveness.
4.44          Outside the health center, health teams will encourage or seek participation of local
communities with the support of private institutions or NGOs to carry out nutrition activities beyond the
health centers in their respective areas of responsibilities but in coordination with them. Village
committees would include nutrition workers responsible for specifically implementing nutrition and
nutrition-related activities. The objective is to extend the influence of the centers beyond the immediately
accessible populations and promote a preventive approach to reducing malnutrition through
empowerment of local community. This would be done by supporting nutrition workers to implement
child growth monitoring, nutritional supplements distribution and other nutrition-related activities. The
program would be decentralized at the village level under the responsibility of a community worker
selected by the village.
4.45             The Nutrition Service of the Ministry of Public Health and the Center for Nutrition
attached to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research would participate in the training of
health center/NGOs field staff in cooperation with UNICEF under the overall supervision of the training
coordinating consultant. Regular nutrition education and supervision would enable the community
nutrition agents to pursue their malnutrition control activities with minimal support from the project and
therefore increase the sustainability of the component. The project implementation manual spe'ifies in a
simplified way all the tasks to be conducted by the nutrition workers and the different steps required for
proper implementation of nutrition activities at all levels.
4.46          Nutritional activities  including  growth  monitoring, identification  and  referral of
malnourished individuals, and nutritional education of mothers (promoting breast feeding, better weaning
methods and foods for infants), improved feeding practices for young children, and administration of
micronutrient supplements to high risk groups would be part of the minimum package of services to be
provided by all 150 integrated health centers of the project. Mapping and baseline surveys would be carried
out to document the locations, types and extent of specific nutritional disorders by province.
4.47          With respect to micronutrient problems (including vitamin A, iron and iodine deficiencies),
the project would target children under five, pregnant and lactating women, and female adolescents. These
high risk groups would benefit from project-supported actions for food supplementation, distribution of
iodized salt, vitamin A capsules and iron tablets, and education of mothers at the health centers. Cameroon
already iodizes salt for its own use and for export (though quality control needs strengthening); and iron
tablet distribution to expectant mothers at risk would be instituted as part of prenatal care in the project
health facilities.



26
4.48          In districts with a high incidence of protein-calorie malnutrition, the project would support
selective establishment in district clinical facilities of nutritional recovery services for acute cases. However,
given the low level of acute malnutrition in Cameroon, this type of intervention would be very limited.
4.49          Strengthen the Training and Retraining of Health Personnel at all Levels.  During
project preparation, training needs were identified for implementation of the PHC strategy by type of health
personnel and by level of the health service delivery system (Annex 18), and available training capabilities
among MOPH staff were reviewed. During appraisal, agreement was reached with the Government that a
training coordinating consultant be retained to finalize the training objectives, carry out a detailed inventory
of local training institutions and to develop an action plan. The project would expand selected training
facilities in Maroua, Douala and Ayos. The project would (a) develop selected training sites to support the
implementation of the district-based PHC strategy; and (b) renovate, equip, and finance the initial operating
costs of the training centers.
4.50          At the central and provincial levels, the project would emphasize management and
supervision skills for approximately 150 MOPH managers in public health, health services planning, health
economics, systems management and supervision skills. With IDA approval, MOPH will select appropriate
candidates and identify specific training courses, emphasizing locally available training resources and
institutions (see para. 4.51 below). At negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOC would evaluate
annually the technical and management training activities undertaken during the previous year, and furnish to
IDA (for its review and approval) by March of the subsequent year detailed plans based on that cvaluation.
A limited number of scholarships would be provided for overseas training (up to a year's duration). About
10 scholarships would be provided for specialized physician training during the 1995-2000 period.
4.51          At the health district level, the 18 newly created health district management teams (each
comprising 2 physicians, 10 nurses and 10 auxiliaries) would receive initial instruction on their
responsibilities under the decentralized health district system at the Centre d'mnstruction medicale in Maroua
(CIM) and practical training at the Soboum IHC in Douala or in other functional IHCs. The training
activities programmed during project implementation include about 20 three-month sessions for at least 40
district physicians and 400 nurses. Each district team would be trained together to improve interpersonal
relations between physicians and nurses and to foster collaboration and team spirit. In agreement with GOC
and Belgian AID, the project would help CIM expand its intake capacity, including: (a) extension of
classroom space and (b) additional short-term assistance to conduct the training sessions. Different curricula
used by other projects in previous training sessions would be revised and integrated. Training will includc
one month of theoretical training and two four-week practical training courses in the health centers, with
supervision and follow-up technical assistance in applying the training received.
4.52          Health center personnel delivering FP/MCH services in the project areas would receive
intensive training to update and improve their clinical knowledge and skills. The course content and curricula
currently used in Cameroon would be updated and strengthened on the basis of an analysis of the tasks which
each team member will be required to carry out; theoretical training would be offered in schools designated
by MOPH, and clinical training would be organized by the OB/GYN departments of designated hospitals.
After completion of training, participants' service delivery skills would be monitored and facilitation visits
would be organized to help them use their skills and knowledge. The project would also organize ex-post
evaluation of the impact of training on service delivery.
4.53          Training of health center clerks responsible for funds recovered from the sale of essential
drugs would be provided by other experienced drug clerks drawn from other parts of the country. Training



27
would be offered locally at the health district office, and clerks would be supervised by the district team
members.
4.54          Health committees at the local and district levels would receive training on the principles and
operations of the new health delivery system.
4.55          Given the limited training capabilities at central and provincial levels, agreement was
reached and terms of reference prepared during appraisal for the recruitment on a competitive basis of a
training coordinating consultant to: define an overall training plan for implementing the PHC strategy,
prepare specific training modules (based on existing documentation), establish procedures for the selection of
candidates, and organize the training venues. At negotiations, Government confirmed its choice of selected
consultant, training objectives were finalized, an inventory of potential training institutions was examined,
and a training action plan was agreed upon.
4.56          Supply of Essential Generic Drugs, Vaccines and Contraceptives to the Public Health
Facilities. The project would support measures to strengthen Cameroon's policy on essential drugs as well
as actions to implement a program to increase access to quality, low cost drugs. At negotiations, IDA
obtained assurances that before disbursing SDR 690,000 (US$ 1 million equivalent) worth of drugs for the
health districts, GOC would take measures to: (a) adopt and publish appropriate legislation concerning
pharmaceutical policy (including lists of essential drugs by level of care); (b) adopt regulations instituting the
Central Supply Store for Essential Drugs and organizing its management and operations; and (c) propose
measures for ensuring the quality of imported generic drugs (including licensing, chemical control, and
inspection).
4.57          Initial project activities would emphasize information and awareness about the nature and
use of essential drugs as well as specific staff training in the management and control of distribution systems
and revolving funds. The project would fund formal and in-service training courses in coordination with
other donor-sponsored projects implementing the drug policy. It would also support initiatives to improve
the quality of prescriptions (such as treatment protocols and publication of a prescription guide).
Information and training seminars would be organized to familiarize IHC health committee members, HD
management committee members, and the community at large with essential generic drugs.
4.58          Until adoption of legislation acceptable to IDA instituting the Central Supply Store for
Essential Drugs, project financing at central level would support MOPH's existing drug distribution structure
(CIAME) whose operating procedures were reviewed by the appraisal mission and found acceptable;
subsequently, the project would support efforts to: (a) acquire low cost generic drugs, vaccines and
contraceptives through bulk purchasing and international competitive bidding; (b) assure the distribution and
improve administration of these materials throughout Cameroon; and (c) improve systems to recover
(partially) the costs and renew the supplies of the consumed drugs and other materials.
4.59          In each province supported by the project, the project would (a) strengthen the management
and contribute to the buffer stocks of the provincial drug supply stores Centrales d'approvisionnements
pharmaceutiques provinciales (CAPPs). Through material support and possibly technical assistance, the
project would establish and/or strengthen the CAPP (headed by a pharmacist and a financial officer and
responsible for distribution of essential drugs, contraceptives and vaccines, and small equipment), which
would process and manage the drug orders from the health districts. Warehousing facilities for the drugs
would be rehabilitated by the project. Pick-up of drugs and their subsequent distribution to the health centers
would be carried out by the concerned health district office.



28
4.60          The CAPP would supervise cost recovery operations and audit drug cost recovery accounts
in the province. It would also constitute and manage the provincial drug fund to finance bulk purchases of
drugs abroad in collaboration with the other provinces. Such a fund functions independently in Northwest
province and is being successfully operated in Southwest and Littoral provinces with German cooperation,
similar funds are operating in South, Adamoua, and Extreme North provinces, with support initially from
USAID and now from UNICEF.
4.61         At the district level, the project would provide initial stocks of essential generic drugs as well
as contraceptives and vaccines for the 150 health centers and 18 health districts, equivalent to three years'
requirements (valued at CFAF 1.2 million or US$5,770 per health center and CFAF 5.0 million or
US$11,540 per district clinical facility).
4.62          Strengthen the Health Education Unit of MOPH  and Expand Communication
Programs through IEC. The project would finance the development of an IEC strategy comprising
(a) audience research, (b) message development and delivery costs, and (c) evaluation. In addition, the
project would train HEU personnel and service providers involved in communication and would promote
coordination of all agencies concerned with message delivery to ensure the complementarity of interpersonal,
group and mass media approaches.
4.63          MOPH would be responsible for organizing IEC training seminars for health personnel and
for maintaining contacts with outside agencies for the preparation of IEC material for use by the district
teams. The project would fund equipment and specialized assistance for developing communication tools
and IEC materials; but, apart from small materials (photos, videos, and recordings) which would be done in-
house, actual production of IEC materials (posters, plays, films, songs, etc.) would be contracted out to other
Government agencies, such as the Cameroon Radio and Television Corporation (CRTV), or the private
sector. The project proposes to fund non-salary costs of the IEC program activities for a period of six years.
4.64          At the district level, the project would provide a supply of IEC materials for each integrated
health center and distnrct clinical facility. In the community, health committee members would act as contact
persons for organizing information-discussion seminars on health. Home visits would be incorporated into
the activities of the IHCs in an effort to detect high-risk cases or to recapture patients with whom contact has
been lost. Two PHN education seminars would be organized each year in selected schools with a special
focus on nutrition, STD/AIDS prevention, and the dangers of smoking and alcoholism.
C.    Project Cost and Financing
4.65          Cost. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$48.08 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$35 million or 73 percent of total project costs. The foreign exchange component
is calculated on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as follows: (a) civil works 89 percent;
(b) equipment and furniture 90 percent; (c) vehicles 52 percent; (d) medical supplies 96 percent;
(e) consultant services 100 percent; (f) training and scholarships 24 percent; and (g) research 2 percent.
Project cost tables are summarized in Annex 19.

4.66           Base costs are in mid-1993 prices. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been included
for rehabilitation works and goods. Price contingencies are estimated at an average of 3 percent for local
currency and at 3.9 percent for foreign exchange costs, which is consistent with the average projected MVV
Index between CY1990-CY2000. Cost estimates for other expenditures are based on recent experience of
other Bank-financed projects in Cameroon and on quotations from suppliers. National staff salary estimates
are based on civil service pay scales and UNDP local pay scale.
4.67           Financing. IDA's credit will be US$43 million equivalent, representing 90 percent of total
project costs. Over the six year project implementation period, this amount constitutes additional resources
of about US$0.60 per capita per year (based on the current estimated population of 12 million).
4.68           The Government of Cameroon would finance up to US$5 million, or 10 percent of total
project costs. Beneficiary communities would finance up to US$0.6 million (about 1.4 percent of total
project costs), primarily through existing cost recovery mechanisms at the health center and district clinical
facility levels.

D.     Environmental Considerations
4.69          The proposed project was determined to be in Category C, which indicates projects not
expected to have a negative environmental impact. Rather it should have positive effects via reduced fertility
and rehabilitated health facilities. No environmental analysis has been prepared therefore for this project.
V.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Preparation Status
5.1     With support from  two PPF advances of US$340,000 (approved March 21, 1991) and
US$260,000 (approved June 30, 1992), MOPH initiated both a series of organizational reforms and a
number of special studies. Studies were conducted and proposals made in the areas of urban primary health
care delivery, nutrition, pharmaceutical policy, and health sector resource management (personnel, finance
and budgeting, and infrastructure and equipment maintenance).  Organizational reforms included the
establishment of the Technical Committee for the Coordination and Follow-up of Health Sector Projects
(TCC), which oversaw formulation of the health policy, proposed a new structure for MOPH, and
recommended measures (based on the results of the studies) to strengthen health sector management at the
central level and to integrate health services at the local level. A list of documents in the project file may be
found in Annex 25.
5.2     With Japanese grant funds for population and health, the Government undertook short-term
consultancies to prepare project implementation plans in the areas of accounting (para. 4.25), staff training
(para. 4.55), and health infrastructure rehabilitation (para. 4.30).
5.3     MOPH  has prepared a project implementation manual which establishes (a) schedules,
responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms; (b) procurement guidelines; and (c) decisions on outstanding
issues. A draft manual was agreed upon at negotiations and will be finalized before project launch.
B.    Project Implementation
5.4     Based on the number of districts to be established and the amount of time required to achieve
complete coverage in each district, project implementation would occur over a six-year period (1995-2001).
The Action Plan (Annex 15) and the Implementation Schedule (Annex 20) provide details of the calendar for
execution of the project activities.
5.5     Implementation of the Health, Fertility and Nutrition Project would be the responsibility of the
relevant departments and technical services of the Ministry of Public Health and of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance. For the Ministry of Public Health which would implement the bulk of project activities, certain
precautions are being taken to ensure a smooth execution of the project. First, there will be a strong
decentralization of activities to the provinces away from Yaounde.  This would permit beneficiary
participation and local control of the operations by the village-level and district-level health committees
which have already been formed. Second, supervision of more complex components such as training and
infrastructure rehabilitation works would be sub-contracted to private sector firms following competitive
bidding. Third, advance preparation work has been carried out for the infrastructure component by a
consultant who assessed the implementation capacity at the district level, identified the sites, prepared



31
architectural drawings and designs, and estimated the costs, material quantities and completion time needed.
Taken together, these actions would go a long way towards facilitating project implementation.
5.6     Assistance in Development and Implementation of National Population Policy. The Directorate of
Planning (DP) of MEF would provide support to the National Population Commission; organize the training
for demographers (identifying institutions, preparing schedules, and reviewing them with IDA), coordinate
the other regional population studies, and supervise the activities of the national information center on issues
related to population and development. The Directorate of Census would implement the periodic fertility and
CPR surveys. DP would submit to GOC and IDA through the TCC semi-annual reports on the progress of
the population component.
5.7     Organizational and Administrative Reforms of MOPH.   The TCC  would have overall
responsibility for monitoring sectoral reforms and recommending additional legislative and regulatory
proposals. The Directorate of Studies, Planning and Statistics of MOPH would coordinate implementation
of the health management information system, proposed improvements in planning medium-term sector
investment, and the programmed expansion of health infrastructure. The Directorate of General Affairs of
MOPH would be responsible for implementing budgeting and accounting reforms and for coordinating
improvements in personnel management.
5.8     Expansion of PHC Coverage and Improvement of Service Quality.  The provincial health
authorities would be responsible for planning and monitoring the establishment of decentralized health
districts in their respective provinces. They and the district medical directors would be responsible for
planning, organizing, and launching the PHC activities of the integrated health centers and district clinical
facilities. They would supervise implementation of project activities and prepare progress reports for the
TCC. A Financial Officer would be assigned to the provincial team of each participating province to
supervise the cost recovery operations, carry out periodic audits of the health district accounts, and train the
drug clerks in handling revenue collection from drug sales. A procurement specialist would be added to the
provincial teams and the central project office to assist with procurement issues. Since the project would be
implemented by the same departments and technical services of MOPH, technical assistance personnel
currently available in ongoing projects would be called upon to assist the provincial health authorities in
designing and implementing plans for setting up decentralized health districts. The project would finance
additional short-term technical assistance to the provincial health authorities as needed to reinforce their
implementation capabilities (including procurement) and strengthen project management.
5.9     MOPH would provide technical support to the provincial health authorities in the areas of training,
pharmaceuticals, and IEC. In collaboration with the coordinating consultant for training, the Training
Division of MOPH would schedule and organize training for MOPH managers, provincial staff, and district
team health personnel. The Training Division would also manage the scholarship program in consultation
with the other technical departments of MOPH. During negotiations, GOC provided assurances that for all
scholarships funded by the project, it would (a) submit for IDA approval the proposed candidate, training
institution, and course of study, and (b) take all necessary measures to ensure that successful candidates bind
themselves to serve for at least three years in posts for which they were trained. The Directorate of
Pharmacy would coordinate the introduction of legislation and regulation to strengthen pharmaceutical
policy. The Health Education Unit (HEU) of MOPH, with support from other agencies including the
Cameroon Radio and Television Corporation, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs and the
Ministry of National Education, would coordinate the communications program.



32
C.    Project Coordination
5.10    The Technical Committee for Coordination and Follow-up of Health Sector Projects (TCC) has
been enlarged (paras. 4.14 and 7.1 (i)) to include representatives of other ministries concerned with PHN
issues and would coordinate and oversee the implementation of the HFN project (and all other projects in the
sector) under the overall control and guidance of the Minister of Public Health, who would consult
periodically with the Minister of Economy and Finance. With PPF assistance, the TCC is now operational
and meets regularly both to discuss important sectoral issues internally and to maintain contacts with donors.
5.11    At appraisal, the role of the TCC Secretariat was agreed to and includes liaison with the operating
departments of MOPH and MEF involved in the project and with the donors. The TCC Secretariat would
include a full-time experienced Project Coordinator (whose appointment was confinned at negotiations) in
charge of the project, principally to oversee the preparation of technical and financial reports to the
Government and IDA. Nomination on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA of other key project
management staff namely, 6 procurement specialists and 6 financial officers (I for the central level and I in
each participating province) and of additional personnel to the TCC for specific technical areas (e.g., a
Financial Officer whose task would be to supervise the implementation of cost recovery operations
nationally, to monitor progress, and to carry out internal audits of the financial operations in the provinces)
would be a condition of IDA credit effectiveness. Short-term consultant services would continue to be made
available to the TCC Secretariat, as needed. At negotiations, GOC gave assurances that the TCC Secretariat
would remain fully staffed throughout project implementation.
5.12    Annual work programs and corresponding budgets would be prepared by the project implementing
agencies at central, provincial, and district levels; these plans and budgets would be consolidated by the
Project Coordinator, reviewed and approved by the TCC or one of its sub-organs, and submitted to IDA for
review and non objection at the beginning of each fiscal year. Funding has been included in the project to
enable these agencies to improve their planning and budgeting. Funding has also been included to help the
Secretariat monitor the project, manage its consolidated accounts, and prepare semi-annual progress reports
for the GOC and IDA. The Secretariat would manage the agenda of the consortium of key donors to PHN to
be created under the project (para. 3.30), organizing its meetings and follow-up action.
D.     Procurement
5.13    Table 4 below summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs, and the proposed methods
of procurement. Additional details may be found in Annex 21. Following the recommendations of the
Country Procurement Assessment Report issued in April 1994 which concluded that procurement practices
in Cameroon were inadequate, and to enable a satisfactory procurement process, the following measures
were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations:



33
For ICB
  Advertisement to be made through Development Forum, local newspapers and embassies located in
Cameroon.
*  Minimum of 45 days to be allowed between availability of bidding documents to bidders and bid
submission date.
*  Precise quantitative and/or monetary criteria are to be used for bid evaluation and post qualification
criteria,
*  Contract must be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
*  The two envelope system of bid presentation would be discontinued.
*  Registration, income tax and social security clearances for bidding would not be requested from
foreign bidders.
*  Bid guarantees should be allowed from any acceptable Bank of member countries.
.  The obligation for bidders to use a Cameroonian shipping/insurance company should be
discontinued.
  There should be no negotiation between bid-opening and contract award decision.
*  A provision must be added in the bidding document for international arbitration.
*  Payment for import of goods shall be made by letter of credit.
For LCB
*  All bid openings shall be public, allowing bidders or their representatives to attend.
*  Precise quantitative/monetary criteria must be used in bid evaluation.
*  Contract must be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
*  There will be no negotiation between bid opening and contract award decision.
For Consultants
* The short-list shall be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 firms with no more than 2 firms from
the same country.
*  The practice of requesting bid and performance securities shall be discontinued.
*  Quality shall be the main criterion for the selection of consultants.
Additional procurement arrangements are outlined below; these arrangements were reviewed with the
Government at appraisal.
5.14    Project Procedures. All civil works, goods and services financed by the project would be procured
in accordance with IDA guidelines. To the extent practicable, all contracts for works and goods would be
grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$ 100,000 or more.
(i)          Civil Works. All major civil works for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of health
centers and clinical facilities totaling US$19.6 million would be carried out through
contracts in bid packages estimated to cost US$100,000 or more and awarded on the basis
of ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits
(May 1992). Local firms participating in ICB for civil works would be granted a 7.5



34
percent preference. Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of less than US$ 100,000 per
contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.5 million may be procured under contracts
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to IDA. Standard bidding documents would propose a reference
price and indicate unit prices and quantities.
(ii)          Goods.   Contracts  for vehicles, cquipment, medical supplies, materials, drugs,
contraceptives and vaccines would be awarded in convenient packages of US$100,000 or
more according to international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with
Bank Guidelines for Procurement of IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992). Exceptions
to ICB would bc for small contracts spread over a period of time in which foreign firms
would not bc interested.  These would include contracts with a value of less than
US$100,000 and not exceeding US$0.5 million in the aggregate, each of which would be
awarded after LCB according to procedures acceptable to IDA; and small value items
costing US$20,000 or less per contract and aggregating to US$0.25 million which would
follow prudent international or local shopping procedures involving quotations from at least
three reputable suppliers. A preferential margin of 15% or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is less ovcr the c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all ICB procurement, would
be given to domestic firms, if any. and
(iii)         Consultants' Services.  Intemational and local consultants' services financed by IDA
(US$1.4 million equivalent) would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). The model letter of invitation and standard
form of contract for appointment of consultants as developed by the Bank would be used.
The services include training, technical assistance, contract management services,
architectural serviccs for the design and supervision of the rehabilitation works and other
specialist services in the area of procurement, auditing and accounting. The Government
would contract design and supervision of civil works to private firms selected in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
5.15     Procurement Arrangements under the Proiect. For the proposed project a number of activities are
planned in order to cstablish local capacity in the area of project coordination and implementation:
(a)    A Project Coordinator has already been identified. The Project Coordinator would work
under the TCC and coordinate the activities of all the departments and services of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Ministry of Public Health involved in the project.
(b)    A detailed implementation schedule (see Annexes 20 and 21) for works, goods and services
to be procured under the project has been prepared and was reviewed during negotiations
and wvould be updated,annually, during implementation for discussion with the IDA
supervision missions. This would contribute to ensuring timely processing of all required
actions. During implementation, all bid evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review
would contain an updated copy of the implementation schedule and a Form 384.



35
5.16    The Department of Planning of MEF would be responsible for procurement of works, goods and
services for component (i) or Part A of the project. The Directorate of Studies. Planning and Statistics of
MOPH (DSPS) would be responsible for procurement of works, goods and services for components (ii) and
(iii) or Part B and C of the project. However, in addition to six full-time procurement specialist positions (I
central + 5 provincial), DSPS would have access to support from independent procurement specialists
(consultants), as required (estimated at two man-months per year during the first two years of the project and
one man-month per year during the rest of the project). The Directorate of Studies, Planning and Statistics
under the guidance of the TCC would ensure that standard bidding documents for the projects including
those for all civil works and goods for the first year of the project, are prepared and found acceptable to IDA
prior to credit effectiveness.
5.17    DSPS, with assistance from the full-time procurement specialist, would also collect and record
procurement information as follows: (a) Prompt reporting of contract award information; and (b)
Comprehensive monitoring reports to IDA (on a semiannual basis and at time of submission to IDA of each
bid evaluation), indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including
best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions,
including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts; and
(iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.
5.18    Review by IDA.  IDA-financed contracts for works and for goods above a threshold of
US$100,000 or more each, and the first five contracts procured under LCB, would be subject to IDA's prior
review procedures. Selective post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would apply to
about one in three goods contracts. In the case of consultants, prior review by IDA would be required for all
consultancy contracts.
5.19    During negotiations agreement was reached on the proper monitoring of the procurement, as well
as the use of Bank Standard Bidding Documents for ICB, and standard procurement documents for LCB to
be developed and reviewed by and agreed with IDA. At negotiations, the Government reviewed with IDA:
(a) an updated procurement plan; (b) a procedural manual for management and procurement; and (c) draft
bidding documents for the infrastructure rehabilitation program and major equipment as well as draft letter
of invitation for consultant services. The Government gave assurances that it would apply the procurement
procedures and arrangements outlined above.

E.    Disbursement. Accounts and Audits
5.20    The IDA credit of US$43 million would be disbursed over a six-year period; consistent with the
country disbursement profile; a schedule for estimated disbursements is presented in Annex 23. Major
project components would be completed by December 31, 2000, and the closing date for the IDA credit
would be June 30, 2001. The IDA credit would be disbursed according to the components and categories in
the percentages indicated in the following table:

5.21    The project would finance initial supplies of essential, generic drugs at 100 percent; subsequent
supplies would be purchased with the revenues generated by community financing through the cost recovery
system. Imported contraceptives and vaccines would be financed at 100 pereent. Operating costs financed



38
at 100 percent (foreign) or 95 percent (local) would include mission travel and subsistence allowances for
local and expatriate staff involved in the project, fuel and office supplies. Operations and maintenance of
buildings, vehicles and equipment would be financed by IDA at 95%.  Past Bank experience with
disbursement in Cameroon indicates that counterpart funds are made available with considerable delays.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOC would take necessary corrective action (para. 3.25).
5.22    To expedite disbursements, two special accounts would be opened in conmmercial banks in
Yaounde, managed by MOPH and MEF and used for all categories of expenditures. One special account
would be established for MEF for US$ 100,000 equivalent until disbursement and special commitments reach
SDR 700,000 and a ceiling for the amount of CFAF I 10 million (US$200,000 equivalent). The other special
account would be established for MOPH for US$600,000 equivalent until disbursement and special
commitments reach SDR 3.5 million and a ceiling for the amount of CFAF 660 million (US$1,200,000
equivalent), each representing four months of operating expenses. These amounts were confirmed during
appraisal. Five second generation accounts would be opened under the MOPH special account, one in each
of the provinces included in the project, in a branch of the same commercial bank, or the local branch of a
correspondent bank in those places where no local branch exists. Advance payments covering four months
of estimated expenditures would be made to these second generation accounts by MOPH from the main
special account on the basis of realistic budgets of anticipated expenditures proposed by the provincial health
authority and authorized by the Minister of Public Health. MEF would exercise its normal review and
control of expenditures and accounts through its provincial financial controllers stationed in each of the
provinces. The signatories for withdrawal of second generation accounts would be the provincial financial
controller (Ministry of Economy and Finance) and the provincial health delegate, acting together.
5.23    District clinical facility renovation, bulk equipment purchases, vehicle purchases, and consultant
services would be excluded from second generation accounts. Provincial accounts with supporting receipts
would be submitted monthly by the local branches (including the branches of correspondent banks) to the
Directorate of General Affairs of MOPH with copies to the TCC Secretariat. The special accounts would be
replenished by IDA against documented expenditures and upon receipt of withdrawal applications supported
by bank statements from the special accounts and all second generation accounts. Small expenses related to
project administration and miscellaneous operating costs, training workshops and seminars, airline tickets,
fuel, and contractual services valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent would be reimbursed against
certified statements of expenditures for which documentation would be kept at the Secretariat of TCC for
review by IDA supervision missions and project auditors.
5.24    GOC would establish adequate accounts for all project operations in accordance with sound
accounting practices. During negotiations, GOC gave assurances that it would furnish annual audit reports
to IDA on the project accounts and that these audits would be carried out by independent auditors selected on
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Certified copies of the accounts and the auditors' reports would be
forwarded to IDA for review within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The appraisal mission
reviewed with GOC a short list of firns from which one would be retained to audit project accounts based on
a multi-year contract. The selected firm would establish project accounts, train the accounting staff and
carry out periodic financial and technical audits on the basis of a multi-year contract with the Government.
Signing of the auditing contract would be a condition of IDA credit effectiveness. An audit firm has been
recruited by the Government to assist in establishing the accounting and financial management system and to
verify compliance with the procurement and disbursement arrangements under the IDA Credit Agreement
and the Implementation Manual. The audit firm would also review the financial statements, the performance
of the cost recovery system and of financial management, and help evaluate the impact of the project.



39
F.     Monitoring. Evaluation and Supervision
5.25     To increase the independence of judgmcnt and objectivity of the evaluation process, monitoring
and evaluation should be conducted by separate institutions. Monitoring of the implementation of the project
would be responsibilities of the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
whereas the evaluation of its impact would be carried out by a combination of beneficiary community
assessments, NGOs and research institutions (for nutrition indicators for example). At negotiations the
Government and IDA reviewed and included in the documents mechanisms for beneficiary voice, feedback
and incorporation of their concerns (such as satisfaction with the services provided, participation in the
decision making process, etc ..), to reduce dependence on Government. Also, performance indicators were
agreed upon to measure overall progress of the project. (See Annex 22).
5 26     Monitoring would bc the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of
Finance and Economy based on rcports from participating services and departments and "ad hoc" surveys
requested when necessary from consultants. The information obtained from the provinces would be analyzed
and mapped so as to permit appropriate planning. The information generated would be consolidated by the
Ministry of Public Health and used for the preparation of its semi-annual progress reports.
5.27     Monitoring of Compliance with Financial and Procurement Covenants. The Ministry of Public
Health and the Ministry of Economy and Finance would set up an analytical accounting and financial
managemcnt system to monitor costs by activity and by site, to develop standard costs of works, goods and
services and maintain their level at competitive standards.
5 28     Evaluation of Impact. Since the project aims at delivering health, family planning and nutrition
services the evaluation will focus on (a) access and use of health services, (b) availability and use of essential
generic drugs and contraceptives and (c) nutritional status, anthropometric indicators, health of participating
populations, etc.  The objective of the evaluation is to assess whether the project has improved the
information and practices of household regarding health and birth control, their nutritional status and in
general the quality of life of the beneficiaries inside and outside the direct intervention areas. The project
may have a spill-over effect beyond the targeted communities. The indicators used would also include non
quantitative features, such as community participation, access to information, mobility, preservation of
valuable skills and traditions, status of women and other variables which would be part of the evaluation
scheme.
5.29     Supervision. Because of the project complexity and MOPH's relative inexperience with IDA
procedures, IDA supervision would be intensive during the early stages of project implementation. Semi-
annual revieNws of progress in the field are planned, and supervision inputs into key activities have been
programmed (Annex 24).
5.30     MOPH  has recently established guidelines, procedures, and schedules for monitoring and
supervising implementation of the health districts by the central and provincial levels as well as by each of
the main programs. In addition, baseline surveys would be carried out by the Government, for example for
the nutrition component. Provincial health authorities would prepare semi-annual progress reports to be
submitted to the TCC and to IDA. The reports would assess progress (physical, institutional, and budgetary)
against agreed annual programs and targets. In addition, based on MOPH's list of HMIS indicators, IDA
and MOPH reached understandings during appraisal on a set of service indicators, reflected in the draft
Project Implementation Manual and Annex 22, to measure the project's population and health outcomes and
impact. At negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would carry out annual beneficiary



40
assessments based on the agreed indicators. These would provide additional information on the quality of
service delivery.
5.31    A comprehensive mid-term review of the entire project would be carried out jointly by GOC and
IDA not later than June 30, 1997. The review would: (a) evaluate progress on the project's outcome
objectives; (b) identify additional measures, if necessary, to accomplish these objectives; and (c) adapt the
Action Plan Matrix in accordance with the capacity and performance of the various GOC departments
involved. The review would specifically focus on performance concerning: (a) the functioning of the key
PHN sector management structures (the TCC and its Secretariat and the Directorate of Planning of MEF);
(b) progress on cost recovery measures and their impact on health care service quality and utilization;
(c) progress in delivering quality primary and referral health services under the decentralized health district
system; (d) progress in implementing the training activities to improve the performance and productivity of
staff, and (e) the performance of the consultants.
5.32     Finally, the Government gave asssurances at negotiations that an implementation completion
report detailing the project's progress in achieving its objectives, its sustainability and outcomes, and IDA
and GOC's performance would be submitted to IDA within six months of the closing date, along with a plan
for future operations of the project which would be carried out thereafter.
VI.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A.    Benefits
6.1           Through the establishment of nine rural districts in the Center, East, West and Far North
provinces and nine urban districts in Yaounde and Douala, the project would support expansion of quality
primary health care coveragc to approximately 3 million people. Within these 18 districts, project objectives
are: (a) to reduce maternal mortality by 30 to 50 percent; (b) to increase vaccination coverage for the main
target groups from under 40 percent to between 60 and 80 percent; (c) to increase the modern contraceptive
prevalence rate from less than 5 percent to between 10 and 20 percent by the year 2000; and (d) to enhance
the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups. The project is expected to improve the
overall efficiency and effectiveness of PHN sector operations by strengthening sector resource management
and coordination and by enhancing the productivity and improving the quality of services provided by
MOPH personnel. Increased availability of low cost essential drugs, contraceptives and vaccines would raise
the credibility of PHN services, increase utilization of services, and reduce illness and premature deaths from
preventable and curable diseases.
B.     Risks
6.2           Because of the relatively recent adoption of the population and health policies, some
difficulties and potential delays should be anticipated in translating policy orientations into clearly defined
institutional relationships and an overall strategy into implementable programs. Specifically, the existence of
firmly entrenched distortions and rigidities in the health care system and MOPH's generally weak
coordination of activities may prove difficult to overcome in a first project. The possibility of a lack of
continued Government commitment to new PHN policies poses another risk that will be closely monitored to
ensure adherence. Govermment fulfillment of conditions prior to negotiations and Board presentation has
established the legal basis for the community participation structures and their relationship to MOPH.
During implementation, internal coordination would be strengthened by restructuring MOPH's management
and formalizing coordination links through the TCC. Consultant services would assist GOC agencies in



41
implementing the project while permitting build-up of local capacity. Finally, previous experience of other
projects indicates that while the proposed reforms are generally supported by providers and consumers, they
are complex and would requirc an extensive and continuous effort to educate the public. The project would
support the Health Education Unit of MOPH which is responsible for these information activities.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1           Before credit negotiations, GOC agreed to:
(i)    expand the membership of the Technical Committee for Coordination and Follow-up of
Health Sector Projects (TCC) to include representatives of the Ministries of Public Health,
Economy and Finance, Social Welfare and Women's Affairs, Education, and Agriculture
(para. 4.14); and
(ii)    nominate the Financial Officers for the five provinces covered by the project and the
Financial Officer for the central level, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA
(para. 4.25).
7.2    Before Board presentation., GOC agreed to:
adopt legislation decentralizing management responsibilities within the public health system,
establishing decentralized health districts in Cameroon, and specifying the modalities for
district management and operations (para. 4.29);
7.3    Before the Credit becomes effective, GOC would:
(i)    prepare and finalize the standard bid documents in form, substance and format acceptable to
IDA, including the bid documents for all the civil works and goods for the first year of the
project (paras. 5,16 and 5.19).

clinical facilities (category 3 (b)), GOC would:
(a) adopt regulations instituting the Central Drug Supply Store and organizing its management and
operations; (b) finalize and publish appropriate legislation, or decrees as the case may be, conceming
pharmaceutical policv and regulations, and (c) propose satisfactory measures for ensuring the
quality of imported generic drugs (para. 4.56).



42
7.5    Assurances were also given at negotiations that GOC would:
(i)    take all necessary measures to increase progressively the share of the health budget from
5.0 percent of the total Government budget FY 1993/94 to 7.0 percent by FY 1996/1997;
8.0 percent by FY 1998/1999; and 10.0 percent at the end of FY 1999/2000; and allocate
the increases to non-salary expenditures until the end of the project (para. 3.25),
(ii)    carry out a fertility survey every two years and a contraceptive prevalence survey annually
starting in CY 1996, both in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, with the
results to be fumished to IDA for comments (para. 4.8);
(iii)   submit to IDA before June 30, 1996, a plan of action to develop sectoral strategies and
programs for the implementation of the National Population Policy (para. 4.9) and
implement the plan;
(iv)   take necessary measures to ensure equitable geographical distribution of staff and improved
internal management of civil servicc personnel assigned to MOPH (para. 4. 1 8);
(v)    review with IDA in June of each year: a) all health sector investment expenditures made in
the previous year and those planned for the next three years, with particular attention to their
recurrent cost implications; and b) the expenditure of the non-salary recurrent budget across
existing programs and services. (para. 4.19);
(vi)   submit to IDA not later than April 30 of each year evidence that the previous year's budget
was spent as originally intended, and prepare and discuss the proposed operating budgets for
the subsequent year (para. 4.20);
(vii)   maintain a system acceptable to IDA for cost recovery accounting and financial management
of health centers and district clinical facilities.
(viii)  submit to IDA by December 31, 1995, a national program for expanding family planning
services over the 1996-1999 period and implement the program (para. 4.35);
(ix)    evaluate annually the technical and management training activities undertaken during the
previous year and furnish to IDA for its review and approval by March of each year detailed
plans based on that evaluation (para. 4.50);
(x)    Keep the TCC Secretariat fully staffed, and key staff appointed with terms of reference,
qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA throughout project implementation (para.
5.11);
(xi)   for all scholarships funded by the project, (a) submit for IDA approval the proposed
candidate (including his/her functions and qualifications), training institution, costs and
course of study; and (b) take all necessary measures to ensure that successful candidates
bind themselves to serve for at least three years in posts for which they were trained (para.
5.9);



43
(xii)  furnish annual audit reports to IDA carried out by independent auditors selected on and
conditions acceptable to IDA, and furnish certified copies of the accounts and the audit
reports to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.24); and
(xiii) carry out annual beneficiary assessments based on the agreed service indicators (para. 5.30);
and, jointly with IDA, hold a mid-term review of the entire project not later than June 30,
1997 (para 5.31).
7.6          Recommendation. Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 29.5 million (US$43 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years.

HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
FINANCING CAMEROON'S HEALTH SECTOR
II. Government Financing
While government spending for health in Cameroon has never approached the 10% advocated by
the World Health Organization, it had reached historically high levels by 1985/86. As Table 1 indicates,
following deep budget cuts for 1986/87 and 1987/88, the Ministry of Health's budget has remained
relatively stable in absolute terms while obviously declining in real terms.
Table 1: Ministry of Health budgets during the economic crisis
86/87 : 87/88 : 88/89 : 89/90 : 90/91 : 91/92 : 92/93 : 93/94
Investment        :  8,008:   5,014:   2,265:   3,225:   3,365:   3,220:   3,150:
3,150
Operating             27,809:  25,622:  23,976:  25,641:  22,731:  24,362:  25,837:
24,329
Total  Health      : 35,817:  30,636:  26,241:  28,866:  26,096:  27,582:  28,987:
27,479
% of Total       :  4.8% :  4.7% :  4.5% :  5.2% :  5.1% :  5.1% :  5.3% :  5.0%
Though the above table clearly documents continuing government support to the health sector
during especially difficult times, further analysis suggests three fundamental problems with the Ministry's
budget:
-    the rigid budget structure and centralized preparation process which leave little room for
negotiation;
-    the lack of a quantitative basis justifying MSP's additional spending needs; and
-    the difficulties of spending the amounts finally approved by the various ministries and the National
Assembly.
While this report discusses all three problems, solutions to the first and last problems require
intenninisterial decisions beyond the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Budget structure and process
As in other African countries and in other Cameroonian ministries, the MOIHs wage bill essentially
consumes the entire operating budget. The following table summarizes budgeted and expended amounts for
personnel as a proportion of the total operating budget.



54
Annex 10
Page 2 of 7
Table 2: Budgeted and expended MOH personnel costs
as a proportion of total operatin, costs
: 1990/91    1991/92    1992/93    1993/94
Budgeted personnel costs             84%         80%         83%        80%
Expended personnel costs             91%         87%         88%          -
As the table indicates, previous efforts to control personnel costs have been mostly unsuccessful: Despite
the earlier elimination of certain indemnities and the more recent imposition of salary reductions (ranging
from 4-20%), economies have been small and of short duration.
A recent study has identified 1.500 staff (of almost 17.000) as redundant, but even if they were all
released, the net effect would probably be about a 5% reduction in personnel costs. And even if such
savings were financially attractive (and politically feasible), the budgeting process would not necessarily
ensure that the gains would be reallocated to other uses in the health sector.
The proposed project will focus on the issues of equitable distribution and improved quality of staff
rather than on the reduction of the numbers of health personnel. The project will also promote measures to
inform personnel of their rights and responsibilities as health personnel and to consolidate the power of the
Minister to transfer and to discipline his staff.
In many respects, the budget process is as rigid as the budget structure. Annex 3 describes the
different steps of the process (for the investment and operating budgets) as well as the principal actors.
What is clear is that the highly centralized nature of the process has removed virtually all input from the
local and intermediate levels and even most from the Ministry itself.
Ouantitative justification of needs
Even if more flexibility were introduced into the budgeting process, it is not clear for a number of
reasons that the Ministry is prepared to take advantage:
-    With the decline in available resources to respond to demonstrated needs, budgeting norms and
instructions (which reportedly existed into the early 80's) have given way to the routine inscription
of the previous year's amount, increased by some percentage.
-    Allocation of amounts approved by the National Assembly has the objective of providing some
resources to all central and external services but the amounts are often determined arbitrarily.
-    Existing disbursement methods and accounting procedures do not permit adequate justification of
past expenditures.
The proposed project will finance management tools for the the reintroduction of budgeting and allocation
norms based on service performance and standardized methods for estimating costs. In addition, dispersion
of accounting responsibilities (among different directions in Yaounde and by services outside Yaounde) as
well as the payments by the Ministry of Finance (and the Treasury) mean that the MOH has great
difficulties justifying past expenditures. In the proposed project, accounting personnel and procedures will
be organized to improve the Budgeting Sub-Direction's ability to monitor MOH expenditures.

Annex 10

Disbursement procedures
Once the budget is adopted by the National Assembly, the authority to spend is delegated to
all services. Permission to spend is often delayed, however, and along with a lack of flexibility among line
item expenditures and the lengthy procedurcs required to effect the purchase represent obstacles to efficient
execution of the budgets.
Annex 3 details the various steps for procurement of goods and services, depending on the amount
of the procurement and the level (central, intermediate or local) by which it is to be acquired.
Table 4 below demonstrates the impact of these disbursement procedures by comparing budgeted
and actual expenditures for investment and non-salary operating costs.

Amount expended                   2,607       1,640        766         -

Amount expended                   2,408       2,974      2,983         -
65%        62     :   68%          -
The results of this table indicate that while the investment budgeting process is becoming an increasingly
fruitless activity, preparation of the non-salary operating budget remains a useful exercise.
Possibilities for increasing either or both investment and non-salary operating budgets, even in the
medium-term, are so remote that the project should probably focus only on insisting that budgeted amounts
be spent and that expenditure procedures be eased; these measures alone would double non-wage
expenditures in the sector and justify proposed project efforts to improve budget estimates based on real
need.
In the near-term, introduction/extension of cost recovery mechanisms represents the health sector's
single best hope to establish a solid financial base capable of generating sufficient resources to reestablish
and maintain minimum leveis of quality in its facilities.
III. Community Financing
Cameroonians have always paid for health care, both through the payment for medical services and
for the purchase of drugs:
-    A household budget survey of decade ago estimated household expenditures for health at 100
billion FCFA (US$ 400 million). (DesRochers, 1990)



56
Annex 10
Page 4 of 7
A more recent study estimated total private spending on drugs alone at 67.5 billion FCFA (US$
270 million).
In 1988/89, hospitals collected more than I billion FCFA from patients, of which 850 million were
returned to the Public Treasurys and the rest shared among medical staff (DesRochers, 1990, para.
18)
What has changed more recently. as a result of the economic crisis and the obvious impossibility of
maintaining "free" government health services, has been the Government's willingness to accept the
principles of cost recovery and (implicitly) decentralized management of locally generated revenues.
These principles have long been accepted by Cameroon's private, confessional health centers and
hospitals which provide some 35-40% of health scrvices to the population (see Annex 1). Until the onset of
the economic crisis, the Government provided very modest (1-2% of operating budgets) but symbolically
important subsidies to these health services, for the past several years even these amounts have not been
paid, and the confessional health centers and hospitals have had to recover virtually all of their costs,
relying on gifts and donations to finance the gap. Among public facilitics the experience is much more
recent, and until 1990 was expressly limited to specific projects (GTZ in the Northwest and the Southwest,
CIM in the Extreme North, and USAID in the South and Adamaoua).
Legislation has recently been passed permitting health centers to rctain all revenues generated by
their activities (1990) and allowing hospitals to retain half of their rcvenues (1992). Additional regulations
providing for the application of the laxv have not yet been adopted, and a number of approaches are being
tried, virtually all within the contcxt of a project. While cost recovcry has been accepted, its implementation
is occurring in a context marked by significant dcclines in per capita incomc from 240.000 FCFA in 1986
to 140.000 FCFA in 1991 and by important remaining issues concerning the principlcs of cost sharing and
the potential for cost recoverv.
Cost sharing
The national health policy states that non-community funding shall, as a matter of priority, be
directed towards staff training (scholarships, in-service, etc.), construction, equipment and salaries as well
as to the purchase of an initial stock of basic generic drugs, whereas community funding shall especially be
used to run health services. As a practical matter, the introduction of a policy of cost sharing is usually
preceded by an analysis of the structure and variance of health center and hospital costs and by a decision
(with corresponding objectives) on the kinds and proportions of costs to be shared by the various partners.
Analysis of health service investment and operating costs is at an early stage in Cameroon" a recent
study by Medicus Mundi Belgium in Bogo District (Maroua) represents one of the first efforts to present
expenditures systematically by type, source, and amount. While differences among the public experiments
are usually minor, major differences exist betwveen the public health services and private non-profits
(medical/paramedical staff salaries, amortization, etc.).
The resulting lack of objectives raises both equity and measurement issues. The proposed project
would establish a focal point within MOH for financial analysis of the sector and strengthen capabilities for
developing financing options and monitoring cost sharing.

Annex 10
Page 5 of 7
Cost recovery
Whether by default or design, different approaches to cost recovery are being promoted at the
health center level. Annex 4b provides an idea of the amounts involved for the different cost recovery
systems. What seems apparent is that significant sums are being generated in the absence of clear decisions
on a number of important points:
-     determination on how and at what level prices are established and periodically adjusted;
-     organization and administration of the cost recovery system; and
-     adoption of a calendar for the introduction of cost recovery on a national scale.
While there are benefits to testing different approaches, minimum guidelines on a number of important
management issues need to be adopted to avoid eventual misunderstandings and abuses which may threaten
expansion of the idea. The proposed project would support improved financial management at central,
intermediate, and local levels to ensure the integrity of cost recovery.
Some idea of the potential for cost recovery can be made by combining the results of the MMB
study with certain assumptions concerning implementation.

1993/94      1994/95      1995/96       1996/97   :  1997/98       1998/99

HC/Medium   266    758:  447  1,274:  627  1,787:  807  2,300:  807  2,300:  807 : 2,300

This table indicates that, when combined with estimates of hospital revenues (DesRochers, 1993), cost
recovery at the health center and hospital levels could contribute substantially to non- salary expenditures.
All of these assumptions would be radically altered if the cost of drugs were to increase significantly.
Donor Funding
External financing of Cameroon's PHN activities is characterized both by the large number of
donors and by the kinds and amounts of support provided. The principal sources of support include the
traditional multilateral donors (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, EEC, etc.), a wide range of bilateral donors
(several with many years of experience in the country), and a very significant non-profit sector comprising
both intemational nongovemmental organizations (NGOs) and local confessional groups (in particular).

As Table 5 below indicates, both the sources and the amounts of external assistance have increased
dramatically in the last few years.

Including proposed IDA  funding, the amount of foreign aid available to the health sector for the period
1994/99 would be in excess of 30 billion FCFA. These estimates do not include details on the proportion of
investment and recurrent cost financing or on the amounts for technical assistance.

STATEMENT
OF
SECTORLAL HEALTH POGTYC
DECEMBER 1992



Annex 14
Page 2 of 5
S U M M A R y
An analysis of the health situation and the progress made
since indeoendence shows that the health sector in Camoroon still
suffers from serious set-backs owing to the non precise definition
of a health policy and to the economic crisis.
This document attempts to define a sectorial health policy for
Cameroon and provides in its appendix tho statement of a National
Policy towards the reshaping of Primary Health Care ind a series of
priority programmes for the reconditioning of the health system.
These priority programmes are essential to tho operational strategy
of this policy.
The Sectorial Health Policy aims at improving the state of
health of the population through an increase in accessibility to
integrated and quality care for the entire population alongside its
participation.
Th* main aspects of this policy include
- The integration of health care at all levels of the system,
taking into account priority programmes and specific
actions in all health institutions;
- The rationalisation of the management of equipment,
infrastructure and staff by setting up efficiont
information systems for effective planning, taking into
consideration the results obtained, the needs and the
objectives of health servicss;
- The drawing up of a drug policy to render essential drugs
available on a p.rmanont basis at all levels;
- The contribution by public health to the setting up of a
national solidarity systmSm:
- The adoption of regulations to enhance decentralised
management of health services with a view to bringing
management and financing closer to conMunities.
These proposals constitute  a  reference document for  all
involved in the health sector, be them public, peravublic or
private, national or foreign.

4. 1     BASEC PRrNCIPL-ES
The health sector cannot on its own establish an acceptable
health level to 411 Cameroonians by the year 2000 - such a result
can only be achieved through to political will, together with the
joint effort.s of the health and health-related sectors.  Health
development contributes to the improvement of the socio-economic
situation.  It also flows from it.  Health policy must therefore be
part and parcel of a global development policy and should reflect
the socio-economic goals of the government,  so as to meet the
expectations of the population.
The basic principles of -this declaration can be stated as
follows:
- The government must maintain its responsibility which
is to ensure health to the population, the fundamental
right of any individual;
- The right and the obligation of everyone to take part
individually or collectively in the handling of health;
- The responsibility of the government to ensure solidarity,
equity and social justice;
- The respect of the right to information, the integrity of
the individual as well as his freedom in health-related
i ssues.
4.2 PURPOSE
rhe main  purpose  of our  sectorial  health  policy  is to
contribute to the improvement of the state of health of the peopli.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
CONTRACEPTIVE REQUIREMENTS (1994-99)
FORECASTING CONTRACEPTIVES NEEDS: Forecasting contraceptives needs for the next five
years in the Bank-financed project districts, considering that the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) for
all methods will increase from 5% to 20% will be based on population estimates and dernographic
information. The current annual natural population increase being 3.0 %, we can assume that the
population of Cameroon will present around a 330,000 population increase per year. In this initial
projection, the contraceptive prevalence rate by method for 1992 will be used as a basic indicator, but at
this stage the provincial preferences and differences will not be taken in consideration. In addition, for each
method, the calculation will be different depending on whether the client is a new or a continuing user.
Quantity of contraceptives to be ordered should include an additional amount for wastage. These estimates
are only guidelines of the arnount of contraceptives needed per couple for a twelve month period and they
are based on the average length of time that family planning clients actually use each method - their
potential product effectiveness is longer - for example the Copper T 380 A is effective for up to 8 years and
Norplant for up to 5 years. Although it is not possible to predict changes in client demand or interruption
in supply accurately, a further careful analysis of past supply and use patterns during the project will
enable a closer calculation; that is why contraceptives needs should be forecast at least annually and
reviewed quarterly.
CALCULATION:
Total Population to be served:
DOUALA              5 Districts (urban)                 850,000
YAOUNDE             4 Districts (urban)                 790,000
In 5 Provinces      9 Districts (rural)                 996,600
TOTAL               18 Districts                       2,636,600
According to the natural population increase of population of 2.9 % the total population should be:
In 1994                                          2,428,915
In 1995                                          2,499,353
In 1996                                          2,571,834
In 1997                                          2,646,417
In 1998                                          2,723,163
In 1999                                          2,802,134

Annex 16
Page 2 of 4
WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE:
We assume that the total female population represent half of the total population in the project districts:
In 1994,     2,428,915 . 2 = 1,214,457
The Unicef 1991 Women and Children situation analysis estimated that the number of women in
reproductive age represented in Cameroon 22.7 % of the total population of women.
In 1993 only approximately 5% of these women were using contraceptives, but obviously in the remote
areas of Cameroon the CPR might be even lower than the average 5 %.
In 1992 the national CPR by method was:
Pills               40.5%
Injectables         29.2%
IUD                 17.3%
Condoms              6%
Spermicides          1.6%
Implants             0.4%
Example of calculation for pills:
In 1994, the continuing users will be 275,681 x 5 % = 13,784
Among these continuing users, 40.5 % are taking Pills: = 5,582
In one year each continuing user uses 13 cycles
Number of cycles per year needed: 72,566 cycles
New Users
The CPR is supposed to increase 15% in 5 years, this means that we can assume that it will increase
approximately 3% a year, but according to our experience usually the rise is slower in the first two years of
a project. But in forecasting we will assume and use the 3% per year figure. So the first year and every
following year we will have to add 3% of new acceptors-which method will prevail, we do not know, but
we will be able to accurately forecast the by method rate after quarterly reviews and careful analysis of
distribution and services: 275,681 x 3 % = 8,270
Among these new users, 40.5 % will accept pills = 3,349
Number of cycles needed: 3,349 x 6,5 = 21,768
Total of pills to be ordered: 72,566 + 21,768 = 94,334
Total pills to be ordered if we add 10 % for wastage:
94,334 + 9,433 = 103,767

The pills that women are currently using in Cameroon are imported by both UNFPA and USAID.
USAID imports LO-FEMENAL (Blue lady) and OVRETTE (low Estrogen-Pink Lady) - both have a shelf
life of 5 years and are distributed through the public and the private sectors (the social marketing
program.). UNFPA imports MYCROGYNON-MICROLUT and EXLUTON they also planned to order
EUGENON.
The pills are called combined oral contraceptives or Progestin only contraceptives depending on their
composition. The combined pill is the most common and effective contraceptive method widely used in the
world because it is extremely safe and has numerous health benefits and an excellent reversibility. It
contains Estrogen and Progestin. There are two dosage levels of combined pills used in Cameroon. The
classification of the combined pills is made according to the dosage of estrogens, having a normal dose of
50 microg or a low dose of 30 microg and the steroids can be given in an even daily dose (monophasic) or
increased in 2 steps (biphasic) or in 3 (triphasic) along the month. The progestin only pills (POPs -
sometimes referred to as minipills) contain different kinds of progestins at different dosages.
Which pill to prescribe? In many public family planning settings, this decision is made on the basis of
which low dose Oral Contraceptive (OC) is available to the program at the lowest price. In this way, local
and national bids for OCs clearly determine which pills are available for the clinician to prescribe in a
given setting. However if all the present brands of OCs were to be available to a clinician and to his or her
patients at the same cost, one approach is to prescribe the very lowest dose OC first. Providers should
consider several factors when selecting which pill to prescribe for a given woman: a) the pill prescribed
should minimize a woman's risk of major and minor side effects. b) oral contraceptives have been
demonstrated to have major non contraceptive benefits; c)smoking increases a woman's risk of developing a
number of the most serious pill-related complications; d) if a women has been successful using an oral
contraceptive with 30 mcg estrogen, is pleased with it and is experiencing no complications, then it is
appropriate for that women to remain on the same combined pill. Progestin only pills are particularly
desirable for lactating mothers and women who want to use an oral contraceptive but have contra-
indications to OCs like severe headaches and hypertension. But we must keep in mind that they have lower
effectiveness, more breakthrough bleeding and fewer contraceptive benefits than combined OCs. Their
prescription needs much more counseling. In conclusion, a large choice of oral contraceptives should be
made available to the clients and to the providers who could better adapt the prescription to the woman's
personal case and to her preference.
Before the start of the project, it is highly recommended that a careful selection of types of contraceptives'
responding to the clients needs and preferences be made by the providers with the help of a scientific
committee including the OB/GYN department at the CUSS.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTlRITION PROJECT
Nutrition Program
A.             Background informationl
The project area  includes ecological zones which are very different: the Far Northern Province where
staple foods are sorghum, millet and to a lesser extent maize and rice, the West, Center and East Provinces
where roots and tubers, together with plantain bananas anid maize are the staple foods. Because of their
contrasted ecological environment (Sahelian in the North and hulmid forest in the South), the two target areas
of the project call for different strategies. Exposure to parasitic infestations, causes of micronutrient
deficiencies and protein-energy malniutritioni are usually differenit in the North and the South. The high
prevalence of iodine deficiency disorder in the Eastern Province, for example results in part from the
consunption of insufficiently processed bitter cassava. The presence of thiocyanate in the cassava-based diet
impairs the utilization of iodinie and causes endemic goiter, growth and mental retardation in children.
Although some pockets of iodine deficiency are founId also in the Far North (Table 2), the prevalence of
iodine deficiency appears in general lower and muchl mlore localized. It could result both from the low
content of iodine in the soils (hence in the food grown locally) and from the isolation of the populations.
The present chapter will first introduce some data on food intake and nutrition at a national level for
Cameroon, then review some specific characteristics of the project a-eas relevant to nutritional interventions.
National and regional dietary intake
The diet of a large portion of the population of Cameroon is monotonous, low in protein for growing
children, poor in critical vitaminis, essential fatty acids and minerals, causing widespread iron
deficiency anemia, localized iodine deficiency disorders and vitamin A deficiency in specific areas. At
the national level, the mean dietary energy intake of the population calculated from food availability is
around 2,200 Kilocalories, therefore slightly above energy requirements. Average protein intake is 55g
of protein, which could be adequate but this average intake hlides large variations of intake between
individuals because of large socio-economic differences and unequal intra-household distribution
resulting in low levels of intake for a large proportion of consumers. Marked seasonal fluctuations in
food availability inflict in certain years, severe food restrictionis on some groups of inhabitants of the
populated Northern regions.
B.     Objectives and Strategy
The project will adopt a two-pronged approach to the reduction of the "big four" nutritional
deficiencies: Protein-energy nmalnutrition, iron-deficiency anemiiia, vitamin A deficiency and Iodine
deficiency disorders:

Annex 17
Page 2 of 4
- Routine prevention and treatment of patients and users of health centers.
- Outreach activities during four years of eradication of parasitic and nutritional disorders organized at
six monthly intervals in villages and slums areas located around participating health centers. The first
year of the project will be used to organize and prepare the materials necessary for the campaigns:
IEC, base-line studies, equipment and drugs of participating health centers, monitoring and evaluation
of impact strategies.
Whereas the Ministry for Public Health will be responsible for routine prevention and treatment, the
outreach health campaigns will be entrusted to an autonomous agency. The contract of this agency will
be renewed annualy upon evaluation of the results obtained in the field. The Center for Nutrition,
attached to the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, will be the lead agency in the evaluation of
the nutrition impact of both routine and outreach campaigns.
The routine prevention and treatment strategy of this component will provide direct services in
nutrition through the 150 health centers. In these centers ensure a close linkage between health and
nutrition activities (growth monitoring, education, micronutrient deficiencies eradication). This would
broaden the effect of health interventions and be a more cost effective approach. Moreover, nutrition
activities would benefit from the medical structures already in place for the health and population
planning.
Outside the health center, health teams will encourage or seek participation of local communities with
the support of health-specialized NGOs to conduct nutrition activities beyond the direct access of health
centers but in coordination with them in their respective areas of responsibilities. Village committees
would include nutrition workers responsible for specifically implementing nutrition and nutrition-
related activities. The objective is to extend the influence of the centers beyond the immediately
accessible populations and promote a preventive approach to reducing malnutrition through
empowerment of local community. This could be done by supporting nutrition workers to implement
child growth monitoring and nutritional supplements distribution. The program could be decentralized
at the village level under the responsibility of a community worker selected by the village. Regular
nutrition education and supervision would enable the community nutrition agent to pursue its
preventive malnutrition control with minimal support from the project and therefore increase the
likelihood of sustainability.
E. Eradication of deficiency disorders
In project areas of particularly high prevalence of deficiency disorders (iodine, Vitamin A, and iron),
the Nutrition Service of MOPH would also implement eradication campaigns together with other
specialized institutions. This would include: a) mapping the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders
(IDD); b) selecting for each zone or village, the most appropriate method of intervention: iodized salt,
intramuscular injection of iodized oil, oral intake of iodized oil, equipment of village wells with
silicone Elastomer releasing iodine in drinking water; and c) implementing and monitoring the impact
of such interventions in areas of high prevalence of IDD.

Annex 17
Page 3 of 4
The Nutrition Service of the Ministry of Public Health and the Center for Nutrition would participate
in the training of health center/NGOs field staff in cooperation with UNICEF, under the overall
supervision of the Training coordination consultant. This would consist in training sessions twice a
year, (five days each time) in community nutrition interventions.  It would include assessment
techniques on the impact of poor nutrition and poor health, comparative impact of alternative strategies
to reduce malnutrition, cost effectiveness in the reduction of mineral and vitamin deficiencies (iron,
folate, iodine and vitamin A deficiencies), use of nutrition surveillance for intervention design and
nutrition planning.  This training will be as decentralized as possible and include practical field
experience and short visit to villages.
The project implementation manual will specify in a simplified way all the tasks to be conducted by
each party in the implementation of the community nutrition program and the different steps required
for proper implementation of nutrition activities.
Specific tasks of nutrition workers
Village nutrition workers included in the IHC team, thanks to frequent and pertinent training, would be
able to undertake the following tasks:
- Growth monitoring of children 0-5 years
- Use of cereal-pulses mixed flour as weaning food
- Oral rehydration against diarrhea
- Promotion of breast feeding
- Reduction of parasite infestation
- Reduction of iron deficiency and folate deficiency
- Reduction of iodine deficiency disorders
- Reduction of vitamin A deficiency
- Referral of most severe cases to nearest health center or nutrition rehabilitation centers
- Group discussion of causes of malnutrition
- Identification of income generating projects
- Reduction of the prevalence of malaria
Tar-gets and objectives
The table below indicates the targets and objectives of this component in terms of coverage and
reduction of malnutrition. The community nutrition program would directly monitor the growth of
about children between 0 and 5 years of age and follow-up about lactating or pregnant women.
Through these interventions malnutrition rates in project areas are expected to decline from 14% to
about 8 % (or a relative reduction of 43 % from the current malnutrition rate).
