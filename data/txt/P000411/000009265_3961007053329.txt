MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A HEALTH, FERTILITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1 .          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Cameroon for SDR 29.5 million, the equivalent of US$43 million, on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for health, fertility and nutrition.
2.            Sector Background. Cameroon's population of 12 million is growing at about 3%
annually. Fertility remains high at 5.8 per woman, and the contraceptive prevalence rate for modem
methods is less than 5%, despite good knowledge of methods and the desire to limit family size among
couples. The health status of the population has improved considerably over the past three decades, but life
expectancy at birth is only 55 years; the infant and child mortality rates are 65/1,000 and 126/1,000
respectively, and matemal mortality ranges from 250/100,000 live births in cities to 430/100,000 live
births in rural areas.  Infectious diseases, malaria, intestinal parasites, skin diseases, traumas and
nutritional disorders are the dominant pathologies and sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, are a
growing threat.. Results from the 1991 demographic and health survey indicate significant nutritional
problems: 24% of children under five years suffer from moderate to severe chronic undernutrition (height-
for-age measure); 3% suffer from moderate to severe acute undernutrition (weight-for-height measure); and
14% are underweight (weight-for-age measure). Iron deficiencies and anemia affect 40% of expecting or
nursing mothers, and there is a high incidence of iodine deficiency and vitamin A-related disorders in some
regions.
3.           Over the past 15 years, Government of Cameroon (GOC) policy has emphasized curative
care and hospital construction at the expense of preventive services. There are marked disequilibria in the
deployment of staff and financial resources relative to the distribution of the population and their health
needs. Poor management of the health care system has resulted in a chronic shortage of drugs, materials
and medical equipment, lack of facility maintenance, limited non-wage operating funds, and lack of
retraining and supervision of health staff. The referral system has broken down, especially in cities,
creating overcrowding and a high demand for primary care services at tertiary care facilities. Sector
coordination mechanisms are weak, particularly in view of the multiplicity of donors, and the fragmentation
of donor-sponsored projects.
4.           GOC's new health sector policy, formulated with active Bank assistance during project
preparation, stresses low-cost preventive services delivered in decentralized health districts with active
community participation and support. Government has also issued a national population policy aimed at
fertility reduction and child spacing.
5.           Project Objectives. The project has three objectives: (a) to provide institutional support
for continued development of the national population policy and rapid implementation of a national family
planning and information, education and communication (IEC) strategy; (b) to promote complementary
organizational and administrative reforms needed to strengthen the management of health sector resources,
and to advance the decentralization of health services; and (c) to expand the coverage of primary health
care (PHC) to currently underserved low-income populations, and improve the quality of services delivered.



- 2 -
6.            Project Description. The project would assist the Government through the year 2000 with
a combination of national-level support for efforts to reorient and reorganize primary health care delivery,
and intensive regional-level assistance for decentralization of basic health care services in 18 health
districts currently not receiving extemal financial aid. Nationally, the project would provide assistance to
implement the national population policy adopted in 1993; develop public PHN services; train MOPH
managers and service providers; supply essential generic drugs, vaccines and contraceptives; and expand
communication activities. Regionally, the project would support the expansion of quality primary health
care coverage to approximately three million people through the establishment of 18 fully functional health
care districts. Coverage would be divided between rural and urban areas, with IDA assistance to nine rural
districts in the Center, East, West and Far-North provinces and nine urban districts in Yaounde and
Douala. The specific components of the project are as follows:
(i)    Assistance in the Development and Implementation of the National Population Policy and
Family Planning/IEC Strategy (US$1.8 million or 5% of total base cost): by supporting the
activities of the National Population Commission; and improving demographic data collection and
dissemination for population policy-making and operations,
(ii)    Organizational and Administrative Reforms of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to
Strengthen the Management of Health Sector Resources and Promote Decentralization of
Health Services (US$1.5 million or 4% of total base cost): by supporting the strengthening of
MOPH's health scrvices and management structures; and developing health management
information systems; and
(iii)   Expansion of Primary Health Care Coverage and Improvement in the Quality of Health
Service Delivery (US$34.7 million or 90% of total base cost): by supporting PHC services
through decentralized health districts; improving family planning, maternal and child health
services; and strengthening nutrition interventions. The quality of service delivery would be
assured by strengthening training and retraining of health personnel at all levels of the system,
including community health workers for outreach activities; supplying essential generic drugs,
vaccines and contraceptives to public health facilities; and strengthening the Health Education Unit
of MOPH and expanding communication programs through IEC.
7.            Project Implementation. The project would be implemented by the existing departments
and technical services of MOPH and MEF. The Technical Committee for Coordination and Follow-up of
Health Sector Projects (TCC) established with PPF funds, would coordinate the overall implementation
process and would be responsible for liaison with the operating departments and the donors. Annual
program-budgets would be submitted to IDA for approval. The implementing structures would be
strengthened by the project to carry out the planned activities.
8.            Project Sustainability. Long-term benefits would include reduction of fertility, morbidity
and mortality for targeted groups. Medium-term benefits would be clear PHN policies and strategies
focused on prcventive services, improved strategic planning and management of MOPH, increased public
resources for health and a more efficient use of available resources, and more effectively trained and
competent PHN personnel.  Cost recovery and active beneficiary participation in the financing and
management of services would promote self-reliance for increased levels of recurrent budgets. The fertility
reduction activities will, in the long-run, case the growing pressure on natural resources and the demand for
social serviccs and cmployment.



- 3 -
9.            Lessons from  Previous IDA Involvement. This would be the Bank Group's first
freestanding operation in the PHN sector in Cameroon. Experience with other Bank projects suggests that
project execution activities should be integrated into MOPH's existing departments and technical services
and that the timely availability of counterpart funds and the budget approval/expenditure process should be
closely monitored to minimize delays.. Based on the findings of a recent government review, IDA would
assist the Government in reforming and improving its procurement procedures and processes.
10.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. The most recent country assistance strategy (CAS)
discussions took place on June 16. 1994 during the Board presentation of the Economic Recoverv Credit
(ERC). This project is consistent with the CAS. The Cameroon CAS emphasizes the development of the
human resources sector and stronaly focused interventions to alleviate povertv. including improvements in
the deliverv of social services to low-income groups. In the health sector. Government policy emphasizes
the strengthening of family planning activities, the improvement of primarv health care services and the
establishment of programs to combat nutritional deficiencies. The CAS provides that IDA will support the
implementation of this policy through the proposed health, fertility and nutrition project. Through a
Japanese Grant for Population and Health administered by IBRD and the PPF-financed preinvestment
studies, IDA has played an active and key role in the successful PHN sector policy dialogue with GOC,
which has produced major shifts in health and population policies in Cameroon. With coordinated donor
support of the PHN policy, GOC now wants to move to an implementation phase of the new policies and
needs the financial support of IDA to translate policies into operational programs. IDA assistance
complements the activities of other donors, and is focused on geographical areas where no other donor
support is envisaged.
11.          Agreed Actions. Although a consensus now exists within Cameroon to decentralize the
health system by creating the health districts, to liberalize the drug market, and to redeploy health personnel
into underserved areas, GOC has been slow in passing the enabling legislation to permit MOPH to initiate
action. Prior to Board presentation of the project, GOC implemented the following measures: (i) adoption
of an administrative text decentralizing health districts and instituting the new organization of MOPH
health services that stresses low-cost preventive primary health care, family planning and nutritional
services and their efficient management; (ii) expansion of the membership in the MOPH's TCC to include
other key ministnres concerned with PHN issues, and to strengthen external aid coordination within an
organized framework; and (iii) nomination of the Financial Officers for the five provinces covered by the
project and a Financial Officer for the Central level, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. On drug
policy, GOC has established an interim Central Drug Supply Store (CIAME) and its regional distribution
centers jointly owned and operated with the non-profit private providers to broaden the competition for
pharmaceutical procurement and distribution. During negotiations, GOC agreed to:
*  As conditions of IDA credit effectiveness:
(i)    prepare and finalize the standard bid documents in form, substance and format acceptable
to IDA, including the bid documents for the first year of the project;
(ii)   enter into a multi-year contract with an auditing firm under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA to establish an accounting system for the project and to monitor its
operations;
(iii)   enter into a contract with a consulting firm under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA
to prepare the training programs and to monitor and evaluate their execution; and



- 4 -
(iv)   nominate key project staff including six procurement specialists and six financial officers
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
* As conditions of disbursement against the category related to drugs:
(i)    adopt regulations instituting the Central Drug Supply Store and organizing its management
and operations;
(ii)   finalize and publish appropriate legislation conceming pharmaccutical policy and
regulation, and
(iii)   propose satisfactory measures for ensuring the quality of imported generic drugs.
* During project implementation:
(i)    take all necessary measures to increase progressively the share of the health budget from
5.0 percent of the total Govermment budget in FY 93/94 to 7.0 percent by FY 96/97; 8.0
percent by FY 98/99; and 10.0 percent beginning in FY 99/00 and allocate the increases
to non-salary expenditures until the end of the project;
(ii)    carry out a fertility survey every two years and a contraceptive prevalence survey annually
starting in CY 1996, both in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, and
fumish the results to IDA for comments;
(iii)   submit to IDA before June 30, 1996 a plan of action to develop sectoral strategies for the
implementation of the National Population Policy and implement it;
(iv)   take the necessary measures to ensure equitable geographical distribution of staff and
improved intemal management of civil service personnel assigned to MOPH;
(v)    review with IDA in June of each year a) all health sector investment expenditures made in
the previous year and those planned for the next three years, with particular attention to
their recurrent cost implications; and b) the expenditure of the non-salary recurrent budget
across existing programs and services;
(vi)   submit to IDA not later than April 30 of each year evidence that the previous year's budget
was spent as originally intended, and prepare and discuss the proposed operating budgets
for the subsequent year;
(vii)   maintain a system  acceptable to IDA  for cost recovery accounting and financial
management of the health centers and district clinical facilities;
(viii)  submit to IDA by December 31, 1995 a national program for expanding family planning
services over the 1996-1999 period and implement it;
(ix)   evaluate annually the technical and management training activities undertaken during the
previous year and fumish to IDA for its review and approval by March of each year
detailed plans based on that evaluation;



- 5 -
(x)    keep the TCC's Secretariat fully staffed throughout project implementation;
(xi)   for all scholarships funded by the project, (a) submit for IDA approval the proposed
candidate (including his/her functions and qualifications), training institution, and course
of study; and (b) take all necessary measures to ensure that successful candidates bind
themselves to serve for at least three years in posts for which they were trained;
(xii)  carry out annual beneficiary assessments based on the agreed service indicators; and,
jointly with IDA, hold a mid-term review of the entire project not later than June 30, 1997.
12.           Poverty Category. The project is included in the Program of Targeted Interventions since
it focuses on depressed urban areas and 'bidonvilles" with high concentrations of the urban poor and on
underserved low-income rural areas.
13.           Environmental aspects. The environmental category assigned to this project is C. It
would have no direct adverse impact on the environment, rather positive effects via reduced fertility and
rehabilitated health facilities.
14.           Program Objective Categories. The project supports Cameroon's antipoverty strategy by
expanding primary health care and family planning services to approximately 3 million low-income people
in underserved health districts, mostly women, children under five years and adolescents. The institutional
measures would strengthen MOPH's ability to provide services nationwide, thereby improving coverage of
basic health services and access to care.
15.           Participatory Approach. The project will expand the health facilities with beneficiary
communities involvement and support. Day-to-day management of the decentralized PHN structures would
be carried out jointly with local health committees.
16.           Benefits. Through the establishment of nine rural districts in Center, East, West and Far-
North provinces and nine urban districts in Yaounde and Douala, the project would support expansion of
quality primary health care coverage to approximately 3 million people. Within these 18 districts, project
objectives are to: reduce matemal mortality by 30 to 50%; increase vaccination coverage for the main
target groups (children under five years and childbearing-age women) from under 40% to between 60 and
80%; increase the modem contraceptive prevalence rate from less than 5% to between 10 and 20% by the
year 2000; and enhance the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups. The project is
expected to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of PHN sector operations by: strengthening
sector resource management and coordination; and by enhancing the productivity and improving the quality
of services provided by MOPH  personnel.  Increased availability of low-cost essential drugs,
contraceptives and vaccines would raise the credibility of PHN services, increase utilization of services,
and reduce illness and premature deaths from preventable and curable diseases.
17.           Risks. Because of the relatively recent adoption of the population and health policies, some
difficulties and potential delays should be anticipated in translating policy orientations into clearly defined
institutional relationships and an overall strategy into implementable programs. Specifically, the existence
of entrenched distortions and rigidities in the health care system and MOPH's generally weak coordination
of activities may prove difficult to overcome in a first project. The possibility of a lack of continued
Government commitment to new PHN policies poses another risk that will be closely monitored to ensure



adherence. Government has already established the legal basis for participatory community structures and
their relationships to MOPH, during project implementation, internal coordination would be strengthened
by restructuring MOPH's management and formalizing coordination links within the TCC. Consultant
services would assist GOC agencies in implementing the project. Finally, previous experiences of other
projects indicate that while the proposed reforms are generally supported by providers and consumers, they
are complex and would require extensive and continuous effort to educate the public. The project would
support the Health Education Unit of MOPH which is responsible for these infornation activities.
PART III - RECOMMENDATION
18.          1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
