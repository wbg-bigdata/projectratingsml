REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $25.0 million.
The loan would be for a term of 25 years including a five year grace period
with interest of 7.25 percent per annum to help finance a population project
designed to assist the broad objectives of the population program and to
strengthen the health and family planning delivery system of the Department
of Health. Parts of the project would be financed on a parallel basis with
grants by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the United
States Agency for International Development.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are
incorporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors in due course. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines has increased consid-
erably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more
than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached 10% in 1973. However
underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, and in common with most
other countries the rate of inflation has increased appreciably in the past
year. T'hese problems and the long-term implications of the energy crisis
for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs and employment are
now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% in
1973. Rice production in the present crop year is estimated to have increased
by 30% over the level of the previous year when floods reduced production
levels. This increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions,



- 2 -
increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments
in supporting rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-suffi-
ciency. The Government has vigorously implemented a program of agrarian re-
form among rice and corn tenants concentrating mainly on the larger holdings
in the first phase. Titles are being transferred to tenants and supporting
services improved.
5.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed expansion of the industrial sector. The growth of industrial produc-
tion for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated to
have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects of increased
profitability are attracting a large amount of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms and improvements in tax
administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms
in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 37%
increase in tax revenues in FY 1973, and an estimated 40% this fiscal year.
As a result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 12% this fiscal year.
7.        High prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$120 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year.
8.        However, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
of world inflation, by higher export prices, by domestic food shortages,
and more recently by the increased cost of petroleum. Provided the Government
obtains sufficient cereal imports for the coming July-September lean period
for domestic supplies, and provided there is a good harvest later in the
year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1975, but it probably will
take 1-2 years for the price effects of the energy crisis to work themselves
out fully. The rapid inflation has also exacerbated the decline in real
wages which fell by a total of about 25% between 1969 and 1973. The urban
wage earners have been most affected. In the past year, agricultural incomes
have improved very substantially, while, with some exceptions, entrepreneurs
have been able to pass on increased costs. Money wages will have to be
raised in the near future if further deterioration in the living standards of
wage earners is to be avoided.



-3-
The Energy Cri sis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year,
it looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 million c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and rapid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's
foreign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3Z
a year for another decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. This growth is not likely to be seriously constrained by lack
of foreign exchange, for despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum
and other imports, continued high prices for major export commodities will
result in another overall balance of payments surplus this year. Moreover,
the rapid increase in export prices at a time when external debt has not been
changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt service from 23% of export
earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year. There has also been a sub-
stantial improvement in the climate for private investment in the Philippines,
especially in exports. Unless there is a calamitous drop in export prices,
the Philippines should be able to maintain a reasonable balance of payments
position throughout the rest of the decade. There will probably be a substan-
tial increase in financing requirements, but with rising domestic incomes and



- 4 -
a substantially improved capacity to borrow abroad, it should be possible
to mobilize the needed resources.
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, to export ventures and to selective
import-replacing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17 bil-
lion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY 1974-77; about
40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the transport
sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean doubling the pro-
portion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY 1968-72 to about 3.5%
in FY 1974-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to GNP would
have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have to be raised
from the present level of 1.4% of GNP to beyond 2% in the next few years.
With the Government's program for further tax reforms, there are reasonable
prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so, it would mean continued
heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local market and from abroad.
Implenienting this program would also call for continued improvements in
public sector management which has already been strengthened by the Government
reorganization.
14.       The improved climate for private investment is attributable to the
strong performance of the economy in 1973 after three years of stagnation,
the current higher prices for many commodities, and the efforts of Govern-
ment to attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are proposed
in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other industries
which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from recent levels
of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the decade. A large
portion of the funds for these projects is likely to come from abroad. Even
so, the supply of long-term funds from domestic sources will need to increase
substantially.
Balance of Payments
15.       Because of continued high prices for major export commodities, ex-
port receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase by about 66% to $2.6 billion,
largely because of the increased cost of petroleum. In response to the
energy crisis the Central Bank negotiated a series of standby credits with
various foreign commercial banking groups earlier this year. However, be-
cause of the improved outlook for export receipts, these standby credits may
not be used this year. The economic mission estimates that the overall
balance of payments will record a surplus of about $250 million this year,
with international reserves increasing to about $1.1 billion, the equivalent
of about 3-1/2 months of imports. With export prices continuing at relatively
high levels, a small deficit in the overall balance of payments is likely
in 1975.
16.       After allowing for continued reserve accumulation and repayment of
loans, the total foreign exchange requirements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion. About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances,



- 5 -
official grants, direct investment, and short-term trade finance. The re-
maining $4.5 billion would have to come from foreign borrowing. Last year
the Bank estimated total requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In
June 1973 the Consultative Group for the Philippines met and accepted the
need for rising levels of commitments for development projects to support the
Philippines' increased development program. The increased estimate of re-
quirements reflects the effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook for
growth in the Philippines, and the improved capacity to carry foreign debt.
17.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for balance
of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973, the Philippines'
medium and long-term external debt stood at about $1.9 billion, of which pub-
lic debt was 44%. Because the Government has exercised strict control over
the amount and type of new external borrowings, the total amount of debt out-
standing has not increased much since 1970, and the maturity structure has
improved. Moreover, the debt service ratio is expected to remain at about
14% in 1975. With this moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would probably
lead to a small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15%
by the early 1980s.
18.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require re-
sources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for fi-
nancing the import component of development projects. Some financing of local
currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of economic
and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
19.       The Philippines has received 23 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $466 million, net of cancellations. About 48% of the Bank/IDA
lending or about $225 million has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education. The remainder has been
divided between agriculture and industry. About $126 million of this has
been for irrigation, livestock, fisheries, rice processing and rural credit
and about $115 million for industry in three loans to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines and one loan to the Development Bank of the
Philippines. There has been a marked improvement in the way Bank Group
projects in the Philippines have been executed in the last two or three years
compared with experience in the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart
funds combined with poor administration caused serious problems. Apart
from the rice processing project, where the scope of the project has been
revised because of changed circumstances (see Annex II), all our projects
are now going well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and Ik'C investments as of May 31, 1974, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.



20.       The Bank lending program increased substantially last year to
$165 million reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government
and its improved capaciLy to prepare and implement projects. Future Bank
lending will continue to concentrate on public infrastructure and agriculture.
We will also continue to help industry and provide more assistance for
projects in the social sectors.
21.       The following projects are among those which may be ready for Board
consideration in FY 75 -- Power VI, Inter-Island Shipping, Tarlac Irrigation,
Mindoro Rural Development and Small Industry. The sixth power loan would
help the National Power Corporation (NPC) to expand its power generating and
transmission facilities in Luzon, while the loan for inter-island shipping
would be relent through DBP to private shipping companies for the acquisi-
tion of new and used ships and conversion and repairs of existing ships of
the inter-island fleet. The Tarlac Irrigation project would help rehabili-
tate irrigation systems in a heavily tenanted area of Central Luzon, while
the Rural Development project would help finance a range of rural investments
designed to promote the integrated development of the island of Mindoro.
The small industry loan would provide funds for relending to small firms
and technical assistance to help strengthen the institutions serving these
firms.
22.       Since 1972 the Philippines has received a limited amount of assist-
ance from IDA, but on the basis of a reappraisal of the prospects for the
Philippines' balance of payments in the light of changes in commodity prices,
and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer members of IDA for
concessional assistance, further IDA lending to the Philippines does not
appear to be justified. The Philippines now has the capacity to borrow
larger amounts abroad to meet the needs of the increased investment program
now planned. The Bank's share in this higher level of foreign borrowing
will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the recent economic mission.
At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 9% and its
share in debt service is about 5.5%. Since the Philippines will have the
capacity to service more commercial debt in future, it is unlikely that the
Bank's share in debt service will rise even with a higher level of lending.
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $68.0 mil-
lion for investments in ten companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of MHay 31. 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $.S million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $47.6 million.    On the
same date $12.6 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinner ware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.



PART III - THE POPULATION SECTOR
24.       The demographic problem of the Philippines is essentially one of
very rapid growth resulting from high fertility and declining mortality.
Its present population growth rate of 3 percent per annum, which is among
the highest in the world, requires a large proportion of annual investment
just to maintain the present low level of per capita income. The birth rate
is estimated at about 40 per 1000 population, the death rate about 10 per
1,000, and the total fertility rate 1/ at 6.4. As the relatively high infant
mortality rate (about 80 per 1,000 live births) comes down the population
growth rate will become higher unless fertility is reduced. If the current
level of fertility continues the present population of 40 million would
exceed 100 million by the year 2000. A successful family planning program,
however, could limit the population to about 80 million by the year 2000.
Organization and Performance
25.       About 25 different organizations in the Philippines are involved
in family planning programs. When the Government became more directly
concerned with the population issue around 1969-70, various private and
semi-private groups and several local and provincial Governments were already
working on programs designed to encourage fertility decline. Notable among
those private agencies which carried out pioneering work in this field are
the Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH), the Family Planning Organ-
ization of the Philippines (FPOP) and the Responsible Parenthood Council
(RPC). Altogether the private agencies carry out a large portion of the
present family planning services offered to the population. However, they
operate mostly in urban areas and the task of reaching the rural and remote
regions, where 70 percent of the population lives, with family planning
advice and service will mainly be the responsibility of the Government.
26.       In 1971, the Government established the Commission on Population
(POPCOM) as the official coordinating agency of family planning in the
Philippines. It is chaired by the Secretary of Social Welfare and it includes
as members the Secretaries of Health and Education and the Director of the
National Economic Development Authority. Its role has been strengthened by
recent Presidential decrees and its functions include: formulating long term
programs in family planning; making demographic studies; coordinating family
planning programs -- including services, training and communications -- and
making family planning part of a broad educational program. The population
program has the strong endorsement of the President of the Republic who has
recently stated: "It is recognized that a high population growth rate consumes
vital resources from the economic development effort. In our country where
resources are scarce and critical, a high population growth rate is untenable
and demands immediate solution."
1/   Live births per woman in the reproductive ages.



27.       There are over 2,100 family planning clinics in the Philip,ines
operating under 25 different agencies. Included in this number are 1,300
Rural Health Units (RHUs) belonging to the Department of Health (DOH) which,
offer family planning services. The frequency of the services offered by
these clinics varies widely from full time to one afternoon a week sessions.
Understaffing and inadequate staff training in family planning are common,
and in general, clinic facilities are in too poor a condition to provide
sound clinical services to patients (e.g. only about a third of the RIUs
occupy Government owned buildings suitable for their specific functions; the
rest are housed in various locations such as municipal buildings, multipurpose
halls and rented private premises). Moreover even this relatively large
number of clinics can provide family planning services to only about a third
of the population. The rest of the population, which is almost entirely
rural, does not have access to family planning advice and services. Since
the private organizations and many of the provincial governments are offering
family planning services through outpatient clinics in the large urban areas,
the Department of Health plans to concentrate on making such services avail-
able in small urban and rural areas with particular emphasis at the barrio
level, and establishing post-partum institutional programs in its hospitals.
However, a new health and family planning delivery system will have to be
adopted to reach almost two-thirds of the country's population which is now
without services. This includes upgrading of the administrative and physical
condition of RHUs so that they will be able to assume the additional task of
an expanded family planning program.
28.       The Department of Health (DOH) is also involved in training medical,
paramedical and promotional personnel for the family planning program in
seven Regional Training Centers coordinated by the Office of Health Education
and Personnel Training with headquarters in Manila. However, none of the
present accommodations are suitable for training as they consist mostly of
provisional arrangements for the use of office space within the Regional
Health Offices.
29.       The performance of the national family planning program to date has
been encouragirg. Over the past four years there has been almost a five-
fold increase in the number of new acceptors from about 90,000 in FY 1970 to
over 440,000 in FY 1973. The Government's policy is to offer several methods
of contraception, in particular the pill, intrauterine devices, rhythm,
conventional contraceptives, etc.; couples are free to choose the most
suitable method for spacing or limiting the family size. While considerable
progress has been made over the past few years, many aspects of the program
need attention. A large number of family planning agencies perform poorly
and there is a concentration of clinics in urban areas. Clinic services in
RHUs and hospitals need to be put on a daily basis and information education
and communication efforts are needed to parallel the extension of clinic
services.
30.       Although progress has been encouraging, it is only a beginning.    In
order to achieve a population growth rate of 2.5 percent by the year 1985,
the proportion of married women in the childbearing ages who practice contra-
ception regularly would have to increase from 19 percent in 1974 to 36



- 9 -
percent in 1985 (about 60 percent of these couples would require program
services). Achieving these goals will depend on the expansion of services
to semi-urban and rural areas as well as the effectiveness of educational and
promotional efforts to change people's attitudes toward family size.
Financing
31.       The population program of the Philippines relies heavily on external
funds. USAID, which has assisted the program since its early stages, has
made the largest financial contributions. It provided US$25.0 million in the
period 1967-73, and appropriated US$7.0 million for FY 1974. lJsaid assis-
tance has been mainly for family planning training, provision of contracep-
tives and general program support to the POPCOM. The UNFPA signed a US$3.3
million agreement in January 1972 with the GOP, covering both on-going and
planned projects of which about half (US$1.4 million) is for family life
education in public schools. Recently, a new agreement was worked out
through which the UNFPA has committed to the Government US$6 million for
programs in training, communication, research and evaluation in the next
five years, which are additional to those included in the 1972 agreement.
32.       Other donors include the Ford Foundation, the Pathfinder Fund, the
International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Population Council and the
Rockefeller Foundation. Direct government allocations to pqpulation programs
were minimal up to FY 1973 when ? 5.9 million was appropriated.    With the
reduction in USAID iinancing of salaries of family planning workers and the
overall expansion of the program, the government budget for family planning
increased considerably in FY 1974 to about p 40 million.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project is based on the results of an IBRD population
sector survey undertaken in early 1972 and on a Government re-examination of
the national family planning program undertaken in late 1972. Bank missions
appraised the project in March 1973 and in July-August 1973. During the
various phases of project preparation, appraisal and negotiations, close
coordination with other donors, particularly USAID and UNFPA, was maintained.
The loan was negotiated in May 1974 and Mr. Pio de Roda, Under Secretary of
Finance, led the Government's negotiating team. The Appraisal Report (No.
333 PH on the proposed project is being circulated separately to the Execu-
tive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
Description of the Project
34.       The project will help the Government to reduce the fertility rate
by improving its ability to reach and motivate the rural population with
family planning services, information and advice; for this purpose assistance
will be given to both the Commission on Population (POPCOM) and the Department
of Health (DOH). The project will provide for the construction and equipping



- 10 -
of Rural Health Units and training facilities.   Technical assistance and
salary support to some innovative parts of this program will be significant
in terms of the volume of activity which they will generate and their influence
on the national family planning program. More specifically, there are four
main components to the project:
Part A would strengthen the coordinating capability of the
POPCOM and support the development of field staff to
direct the family planning program.
Part B would extend and reinforce the rural health and family
planning services of the Department of Health by establish-
ing a new system of health delivery in rural areas.
Part C would provide facilities and additional services for
the training program of the Department of Health.
Part D would provide additional staff and technical assistance
to the Department of Health to strengthen its capacity to
coordinate and evaluate its program.
Under the proposed loan the Bank would help finance parts B, C and D of the
project while the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)
and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will
finance separate items of Part A of the project. Because of the substantial
participation of other donors in family planning activities in the Philippines
the project has been designed to complement the inputs of other agencies.
35.       Part A of the project would include the establishment in POPCOM
of an Information Education and Communications (IEC) Division to be financed
under a separate agreement wiTH UNFPA approved on March 21, 1974. The main
functions of the IEC Division will be to plan and coordinate all the diverse
communications efforts of the numerous family planning agencies operating in
the Philippines. The project would also provide for the establishment of a
Training Division in POPCOM and strengthen POPCOM's regional offices. These
items will be financed under separate agreements with USAID. The Training
Division would enable POPCOM to coordinate and improve all population related
training by ensuring that existing and planned training programs meet the
priority needs of the national family planning program, recommending and
implementing training policies, providing guidelines and standards on the
preparation and conduct of training programs and monitoring and assessing
on-going training programs. USAID hias committed funds to finance the salary
and equipment costs of the Training Division for the next four years. The
regional offices of POPCOM were recently established to help develop and
implement the famnily planning program at the regional level, help solve field
problems and elicit participation from official and private sources for the
family planning effort. USAID will finance for one year the salaries and
other operating expenses of the eleven regional offices.
36.       Under Part B of the project about 200 Rural Hlealth Units will
be provided to bring family planning services to the rural population, without
whose participation the Government's program to reduce fertility could not be



achieved. About 160 Type A Rural Health Units serving municipalities of
10,000-50,000 population, and about 45 Type B RHUs, serving smaller municipa-
lities would be constructed, equipped, and furnished. Construction of the
Barrio Health Stations (BHS) is not financed through the project, but the
Government has agreed to rehabilitate or establish BHSs within municipalities
where RHUs will be constructed as complements of the project facilities. The
Government has also agreed to undertake a survey of existing BHSs and formu-
late a program to rehabilitate them. As part of the revised RHU service
procedures, the project would provide simple radio/telephone equipment to
link the base RHU with the Barrio Health Stations. About 40 of the Type A
units in the more difficult areas would have two houses for staff attached
to them and one house would be provided for each of the Type B units. These
new RHUs to be built through the project would replace dilapidated and inadequate
facilities, some of them hardly in operation, and thereby considerably improve
the availability of family planning and health services to over one million
(or 18 percent) women in the child bearing ages. The project would also
include the procurement of 200 jeeps for use by RHUs, together with spare
parts for new and existing vehicles and funds for vehicle maintenance. In
addition, it would provide for the employment of about 2,400 additional mid-
wives to work in the Rural Health Units and Barrio Health Stations. It is
expected that about 480 additonal midwives would be employed in each of the
next five years. The loan would also finance on a declining basis a part of
the salaries of a core staff in the Health Department to organize implementa-
tion of new procedures applicable to the Rural Health Units.
37.       Under Part C of the project about eleven Regional Training Centres,
under the Department of Health, would be constructed, equipped, and furnished.
These centres would be used for in-service health and family planning training
of Government staff. Each centre would have, besides teaching and administra-
tive facilities, a library, living accommodation for trainees and staff, and
vehicles. The loan would also help finance additional materials and services
for about nine workshops for staff of the regional training centres. A signi-
ficant activity in the training centres will be a three month pre-service
course for midwives which will help them become family planning/community
health workers in RHUs and resident staff in Barrio Health Stations. As
midwives will play a big role in the new health family planning delivery
system, the Government has agreed to form a committee to review policy
for the training of midwives. Funds would also be provided for 33 midwifery
fellowships for graduate nurses who would be employed as trainers in the Re-
gional Training Centres and as supervisors in the rural health program.
The project would also provide 24 man months of technical assistance to the
Department of Health to advise on the organization and coordination of train-
ing and development of midwife/community health/family planning training
programs.
38.       Part D of the project would help develop an improved statistical
system in the Department of Health by helping to finance on a declining basis
the salaries of additional staff to establish a health statistics unit, provide
needed equipment and provide six man months of technical assistance for statis-
tical services. This system would be the basis of RHU performance evaluation,
central data analysis, production of periodic health/family planning statis-
tical reports and a feedback system to the RHUs. Funds would also be provided
for study tours for three senior nurses in the Department of Health, for 18



- 12 -
man months of technical assistance for advisory services on logistics of drug
distribution and new rural health unit procedures. Provision is also made in
this project for financing an evaluation study of project facilities and
programs. This study would serve as the basis for the design of facilities
needed for further expansion of the system. The main objective of this
evaluation will be to relate capital and operating costs to (a) staffing
patterns and worktime (b) use of facilities and (c) the amount of services
delivered.
39.       Besides these provisions for evaltuation, the Government has agreed
to carry out an evaluation of its family planning program through the Plann-
ing Division of its Commission on Population. The evaluation would relate
program inputs (personnel years, visits, number of clinics, costs etc) to
both intermediate results (number of acceptors, continuing users etc.) and
fertility decline. The results of such a continuing evaluation would be used
to further improve the program's effectiveness and to measure its results.
Project Execution
40.       The Commission on Population would co-ordinate the work of the
various Government agencies participating in the execution of the project.
Construction of facilities would be the responsibility of a Project Construc-
tion Unit to be established within the Department of Health. The Unit would
be headed by a Director of Project Construction and staffed by a full time
project architect, and such support staff as a project accountant and an
equipment specialist. Additional staff, such as personnel from DPWTC to help
in site selection, would be borrowed from other government departments as
required. Since cost control and maintaining the pace of construction in the
rural areas will be a difficult managerial task, the Government has agreed
to employ construction management consultants in addition to consultant archi-
tects.
41.       Our review of the progress of the project would be closely co-
ordinated with the other donors participating in the project. This task
will be made easier by the presence of a UNFPA coordinator and the USAID
mission in the Philippines.
Project Cost
42.       The estinated total cost of the project net of taxes and duties
is $50.0 million equivalent. Assuming all civil works contracts are won by
domestic firms, the estimated foreign exchange component of the project would
be $15.4 million (31 percent of total project cost). The proposed Bank loan
would cover 50 percent of the total project cost of which $15.3 million would
finance foreign exchange costs and $9.7 million would finance local costs.
Under separate agreements the UNFPA would provide a grant of $0.4 million
and USAID would provide a grant of $0.5 million. The Government would finance
the balance of $24.1 million. All project costs have been updated to June
1974. Future escalation for civil works costs has been estimated based on



- 13 -
recent and expected price increases in the Philippines at an average rate
of 38% in the first 18 months and 12% per annum thereafter. Physical contin-
gencies are estimated at 10% of the base cost of civil works. Price escala-
tion for other project items has been estimated at an average annual rate
of about 10% a year during the five-year period. The project is scheduled
for completion by 1979.
Procurement
43.       As far as practicable all contracts would be packaged in amounts
of not less than $70,000 equivalent. All contracts estimated to cost the
equivalent of $70,000 or more would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. For contracts less than $70,000 the Government may use
its normal methods of procurement, provided that the total of such contracts
does not exceed the equivalent of $200,000. Domestic manufacturers of furni-
ture and equipment (including spare parts) would be accorded a margin of
preference equal to 15 percent for purpose of comparison with other bids.
Disbursement
44.       For vehicles, spareparts, equipment, and furniture, disbursement
would be made on the basis of 100 percent of foreign expenditure or the ex-
factory cost of locally procured items. For technical assistance, disbursement
would be made on the basis of 100 percent of total expenditures. For civil
works and incremental recurrent costs the loan would finance 39 percent of
total expenditures, making the loan equivalent to 50 percent of total project
cost. Disbursements for incremental recurrent expenditure would be made on
the basis of 90 percent of expenditures during the first year after signing
and 70 percent, 50 percent and 30 percent and 30 percent in successive years
thereafter. Retroactive financing is recommended for up to $350,000 equiva-
lent for expenditures incurred after May 1, 1974 for preliminary engineering
and architectural work and to set up the Project Construction Unit.
Project Justification
45.       The national population program is designed to reduce the total
fertility rate by about 25 percent -- from 6.4 in 1970 to 4.8 in the year
2000. Over 15 million births would be averted during that period as a
result of the program. Family planning practice is also expected to
increase independently of program efforts, as a result of improvements in
socio-economic conditions. If this effect is also included, a total of 25
million births could be averted from 1970 to the year 2000. Total population
would then be close to 79 million, almost double the current population, but
some 23 million lower than the 102 million persons which would result if
fertility remained constant. The population growth rate would be 2 percent
per annum in the year 2000 instead of the current 3 percent.
46.       The project is estimated to contribute directly to at least one
sixth of the projected fertility decline of the national program -- by
averting 2.5 million births between 1979 and the year 2000. This direct



- 14 -
effect of the project would result from bringing family planning servi-
ces to the rural population, whose participation is essential to achieve
such a fertility decline. The new RHUs, the network of Barrio Hlealth
Stations and the additional midwives will provide services to at least 7.8
million more people by 1979 than at present (or 1.6 million more women in
the reproductive ages).
47.       Other important, but non-quantifiable benefits can also be expected
from the project. These result from information-education and communication
activities which are expected to increase the demand for family planning
services, training of family planning personnel at the regional level, tech--
nical assistance for training and communication activities, continuing
evaluation of the program, transportation, etc. These elements of institu-
tional development for the POPCOM and the DOH may well be as important in
making the program more effective and reducing the population growth as the
direct effect of the services provided through Rural Health Units and Barrio
Health Stations.
48.       The above demographic effects will have important social and
economic consequences. Smaller families will mean an improvement in the
quality of life through more food and better nutrition for each family member,
better maternal health and child care, improved education opportunities, etc.
The poorer families of the rural population will be the main beneficiaries of
this program. In the long run a less rapidly growing labor force is likely
to make the serious unemployment and underemployment problems that the
Philippine economy is now facing, more manageable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the B.nk, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft resolutior approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The features of particular interest referred to
in Part IV - The Project - are set forth in Section 3.05, 4.05 (b), 4.04 and
3.06 (b) of the Loan Agreement. The establishment of the Project Construction
Unit (referred to in Section 3.02) and appointment of its Director and Archi-
tect is an additional condition to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement
(see Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement).
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   ProJects in Execution -/
Ln. No. 607-PH      Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of
June 4, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly
due to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthen-
ing of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of
disbursement. This has particularly quickened over the last nine months.
The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973, has been postponed to
June 30, 1974. As of March 25, 1974, a balance of only $42,450 remained
uncommitted.
Ln. No. 637-PH      Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods
but construction of the dam is now progressing ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remains
economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Developmnt Bink
of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modernization
of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It included six large
integrated processing plants to produce the high quality rice required for
the anticipated exportable surplus, which did not materialize owing to set-
backs in rice production. The President's memorandum to the Executive
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-L0) proposed amendments te the loan
agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation of existing facilities
and to streamline procurement procedures.    In spite of this the project
has made very little progress and by the end of February 1974, only
US$0.5 million had been disbursed.    During the critical shortage of rice
last year the Government successfully encouraged an increase in maize
production, and the ccnsumption of maize mixed with rice.    This has led to
a demand for maize processing, storage and handling facilities, and
Government has proposed the project be expanded to include grains other
than rice.   Much of the new demand will come from public entities and
small individuals, so that Government has proposed they also be included,
and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to cover the smaller
processors.   These amendments, designed to widen the project's objectives,
to cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full
implementation, were presented to the Executive Directors in the President's
Memorandum dated April 15, 1974 (Sec M74-244).    The Executive Directors
approved the proposals and the Loan Agreement has been amended accordingly.
Ln No 731-PH    Highway;  US $8.0 million Loan of April -1., 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was suspended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances in the
Cot'abato area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
end which is outside the area affected by the fighting.    The project also
includes two components financed by UNDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and feasibility
studies for future highway projects.   Work on the technical assistance
component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have been
completed.
Ln No 809-PH and   Fifth Power;   US $22.0 million and US $10.0 million loan
Cr No 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972;   Closing date:  June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon.   The project is behind schedule because
procmrement has taken longer than expected.    The Closing Date has been
postponed to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed procurement and because
retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier until
at least one year after the plant is commissioned.    A tariff increase was
imposed in January 1973 because of rapid domestic inflation.    The situation
has also been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge to
cover increased fuel costs.   A further tariff increase has been approved,
effective July 1, 1974 and this should enable NPC to achieve its covenanted
rate of return in FY 7h,75.
