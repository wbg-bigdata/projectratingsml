Sri Lanka has a two-tier exchange rate system.   Its currency
(Rupee) is linked to the Pound Sterling at a parity rate of f 1.00 =
Es 15.60. Parity rates with all other currencies are determined from
time to time by the Central Bank. Further, most import items, with the
notable exception of rice and fertilizer, are subject to a surcharge of
65% in the form of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certiffcate (FEEC). On
the other hand, some exports, excluding tea, rubber and coconut, are
entitled to receive FEECs, giving them a premium of 65% over the offi-
cial exchange rate. In 1974, the FEEC rate was applied to about 60% of
current foreign exchange payments and to about 32% of current receipts.
The above June 1975 parity rate was used in the preparation
of the Appraisal Report. In October, the latest date for which we have
information, the parity rate, as set by the Central Bank, was US$1.00
Rs 7.45 and the FEEC rate was US$1.00 = Rs 12.20.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THiE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Agricultural Development Project to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the
equivalent of US$25 million on standard IDA terms to help meet capital
and technical assistance requirements in the agricultural sector. The
proceeds of the Credit would be allocated to various Government and quasi-
Government agencies and the private sector to support on-going priority
programs to increase output in the foodcrop sector and to maintain employ-
ment and quality of end-product from existing production in the tree crop
sector.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Recent Economic Developments and
Current Prospects for Sri Lanka" (Report No. 622a-CE, February 20, 1975)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 28, 1975. Country
data are provided in Annex I. Also, the latest sector report, "Republic
of Sri Lanka - Agricultural Policy and Program Reviewrl (Report No. 579a-CE,
February 1975), was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 28,
1975.
3.        The economic difficulties that presently beset Sri Lanka can be
traced principally to two basic characteristics of the country's economic
and social system: first, the dependence of the economy on three export
crops -- tea, rubber and coconut -- and, second, a political commitment to
the welfare state. This commitment found its expression in two policy
tenets which, for the past quarter century, successive Governments have
followed in varying degrees: the supply of mass consumption goods, prin-
cipally food and textiles, at low prices, and the provision of public serv-
ices -- mainly education, health and transport -- free of charge or substan-
tially below cost.
4.        Sri Lanka's progress in social fields has been noteworthy. Public
services are widely available at little or no cost and a more equal distribu-
tion of income has been achieved by promoting high wages, subsidizing serv-
ices, and distributing food free or below cost. The welfare state is based
mainly on the earnings of the export sector.   Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has
experienced a pronounced weakening in the market for tea and rubber begin-
ning in the mid-fifties. The reduction in export earnings limited import
of capital goods and was Dne of the main reasons for little economic growth
in the past two decades. Between 1969-70 anrd 1973-74, GNP at constant
prices increased at an annual rate of about 2.2%. With population grow-
ing at a rate of about 1.8% p.a. between 1969-70 and 1973-74, there was



only a slight improvement in per capita gross income. This situation has
led to high unemployment and under-employment. /
5.        Against this background, Sri Lanka has had to face in the past
two years, (i) the shocks of sharply escalating costs for imported food-
stuffs, which are expected to absorb nearly two-thirds of the country's
earnings from merchandise exports in 1975, (ii) a doubling of the oil
import bi]l, and (iii) sharp increases in the prices of imported raw mate-
rials, spares, and investment goods. Despite considerable rises in export
prices for rubber (1973-74) and for tea (1974-75), Sri Lanka has emerged as
one of the developiDg countries most seriously affected by the recent world-
wide price inflation.
6.        The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) responded in October 1973 by
making adjustments in the amounts and prices of food supplied at subsidized
rates, doubling the price of petroleum products, and raising transport tar-
iffs by 50% or more. Additional measures were taken in July 1974, the most
important of which were an increase in the price of flour and a virtual ban
on the sale of off-ration sugar. Furthermore, in response to the unexpected
cost increases of imported raw materials, GOSL allowed some of the public
corporations and enterprises to pass on these increases to their customers.
7.        Nevertheless, these constructive -- and politically difficult --
measures were inadequate to bring about a significant improvement in the
budgetary situation in 1974. The net food subsidy was Rs 925 million (22%
of total current expenditure), more than twice the original estimate, because
of the increase in commodity prices. Other current expenditures also rose,
mainly because of further wage increases in the public sector. However, as
a result of the rising export and import prices and the once-and-for-all
effects of the introduction of the "pay-as-you-earn" system into the in-
come tax, current revenues were more buoyant than expected, and more than
made up for the rise in current expenditures.
8.        The 1975 budget is likely to show a small deficit on current
account as compared with a modest surplus in 1974. As a further step to
reduce the net food subsidy, in April 1975, the GOSL discontinued rationing
and subsidizing of the distribution of wheat flour, and also made off-ration
sugar available to all at a price of Rs 7.50 per pound against Rs 0.72 per
pound of rationed sugar.
9. -      Capital expenditures are now estimated to have risen in 1974 by
about Rs. 204 million (17%) compared to 1973. Considering the likely rate
of price increase, this implies a fall in real terms. Because of the meager
Government savings, capital expenditures in 1974 were financed largely from
borrowing, estimated to have risen to about Rs. 1.2 billion, 11% above the
1973 figure. About 61% was borrowed domestically, mainly from the state
savings bank and pension and insurance funds, and the remainder abroad. In
1975, borrowing may increase to around Rs. 2.0 billion, of which the share to
be borrowed externally may go up from 39% to 50%. A worrisome aspect of this



picture is the rapid rise in the external debt service burden, due to increas-
ing short-term borrowing.
10.       Sri Lanka was not able to take full advantage of rising world com-
modity prices in 1973-75 because of the difficulties faced in increasing the
volume of exports of its traditional commodities. Replanting of tree crops
has been particularly inadequate, because of past depressed prices, and more
recently because of increasing insecurity of tenure. The volume of tea ex-
ports actually declined by 15% in 1974, but is expected to increase during
1975. Rubber exports have declined since 1970 (except in 1973 when "slaugh-
ter tapping" was extensively used in response to a sudden price hike), mainly
because of long periods of drought experienced in the rubber-growing areas,
inadequate availability of fertilizer, and uncertainties created by the land
reform. Rubber production and exports in 1975 are expected to increase as a
result of more favorable weather conditions and increased producer margins
following the reduction of export taxes on rubber in July 1975. The excep-
tionally low volumes of exports of coconut products in 1973 and 1974, caused
by severe drought, limited the benefit from the very high world prices, par-
ticularly in 1974. No significant increase in coconut exports can be ex-
pected during 1975. An encouraging development in 1973 was the increase in
the share of non-traditional exports. In addition to measures taken in 1970
to promote minor export crops, the Government's policies towards exports in
1973 and 1974 were providing incentives to export-oriented industries to
counter adverse effects of increasing input costs and to promote diversi-
fication of exports. To this end, mostly fiscal and financial, rather than
price, incentives were used. The 1975 Budget withdrew some incentives, but
it was careful to keep the possible adverse effects on export-oriented in-
dustries to a minimum.
11.       The composition of imports has undergone significant changes in
recent years. Because of increases in prices of food, petroleum and fer-
tilizer, their share of the import bill increased to 65% in 1974, compared
to 47% in 1972. The 1975 imports program envisaged substantial increases
in imports of food, investment goods, and intermediate goods other than
fertilizer and petroleum products. However, in view of the foreign ex-
change shortage, the Government was expected to cut the 1975 import program,
particularly items other than food, fertilizer and petroleum products.
12.       The composition of capital movements showed significant changes
in 1974, compared to the early 1970's. The share of the current account
deficit financed by grants and long-term loans has declined sharply. Sup-
pliers' credits and short-term loans, which were negligible in 1971 and
1972, rose to $83 million in 1974. One important consequence of these
developments is the increasingly unfavorable maturity structure of Sri
Lanka's external debt. Debts with one to five years maturity increased
from 2% of total debt at the end of 1973 to over 10% by end-June 1974.
For 1974, owing to the relatively sharp increase in foreign exchange
earnings mainly as a result of price increases, the debt service ratio
remained just below 13%, almost the same as in 1973. In 1975, however,
the debt service ratio is projected to rise to 19%.



13.       The Government's latest bal.a.ce of pl,yments projection for 1975
indicated a further deteriorationi, as compared witlh 1974.   It was estimated
that Sri Lanka would need a net capital inflow of nearly US$190 million in
order to finance the current: account deficit.
14.       An Aid Group for Sri Lanka, for which the Bank acts as the Chairman,
was formed in 1965 and has held eleven meetings.    At the eleventh meeting,
held in Paris in April 1975, the members recognized Sri Lanka's need for
increased assistance, particularly in agriculture, and gave indications of
assistance over US$200 million for 1975, compared with aid indications of
US$163 million made at the meeting in 1974. Out of US$200 million assis-
tance indicated, US$50 to 60 million are expected to be disbursed during
1975. However, this would still leave a substantial uncovered gap in the
balance of payments.
15.       Given its substantial financing gaps, Sri Lanka has recently had
to cut its finance requirement by reducing the current account deficit to
a significant extent, thus disrupting the economy. The net external reserve
position has been so weak that no part of thie additional financing could come
from it. Since servicing of short-term indebtedness is now imposing a large
burden on the payments position, it is important that, in the coming years,
external finance required should be obtained, as far as possible, in the form
of fast-disbursing assistance and on concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
16.       Since the beginning of its operation in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has made seven loans totalling US$73.5 million and eight credits tqtal-
ling US$54.1 million (net of cancellations) in support of fourteen projects.
About 47% of Bank Group assistance has been for power, 33% for agriculture
(irrigation and dairy development), and the remainder for DFC operations,
highways and a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials
for industry). Three early power projects, the first DFC project, and the
program credit were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully disbursed.
At the request of the Borrower, a credit for highways was cancelled in 1970,
after disbursement of US$0.6 million, following the Government's decision
to make major changes in the scope of the project. The remaining nine
loans and credits have all been made since 1968. The implementation of
ongoing projects has suffered delays, due, in large part, to the civil
disturbances of 1971, but is proceeding satisfactorily at this time. The
IFC's only investment in Sri Lanka, US$3.25 million to the Pearl Textile
Mills, Ltd. (Ceylon), was made in January 1970, but cancelled the same
year at the request of the Company. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank Group operations as of October 31, 1975, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
17.       The Bank Group's strategy is focused on the agricultural sector.
It is designed to help alleviate the foreign exchange constraint by support-
ing measures to increase agricultural output. Projects for modernization of



- 5 -
the existing irrigation networks and the expansion of the Mahaweli Ganga
irrigation network (in part a follow-on to the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Project), have been prepared, with the assistance of the IBRD/FAO Coopera-
tive Programme, and appraised in April/May 1975. A project for diversifi-
cation of crops on marginal lands under tea and rubber, presently being
prepared by GOSL and UNDP, with the assistance of IBRD/FAO Cooperative
Programme, is under active preparation. A second Drainage and Land Reclama-
tion project, a fourth operation for the Development Finance Corporation of
Ceylon, and a Water Supply and Sewerage project are being identified for
possible IDA financing.
18.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 14% (and the Bank
alone for about 7%) of Sri Lanka's total external debt outstanding, and
about 8% (with IDA negligible) of debt service. It is projected that the
Bank Group's share in total external debt will decline slightly over the
next three years (and the Bank's share alone to fall to less than 4%),
while the Bank and IDA shares in the debt service will show a slight
increase.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
19.       Agriculture is dominant in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting for
80 to 90% of export earnings, employment of about 2 million people or half
of the total labor force, one third of GDP, and a large share of public
revenue. Rural people account for 80% of Sri Lanka's population. Over
16% of the labor force in rural areas is unemployed. In addition, there
is considerable under-employment. Food crop production increased at an
annual rate of 3.2% during the 1960s, but has been stagnant since 1970.
Tree crop production increased 1% annually in the 1960s due to growth in
rubber production, but total output of tree crop products has also been
stagnant since 1970. An exception to this generally poor record in agri-
cultural performance has been the success in promoting the production of
several subsidiary food crops and minor export crops, e.g. coconut products
and spices.
20.       The major objectives of Sri Lanka's agriculture policies include:
increased self-sufficiency in food production; diversification of crop
production to reduce dependence upon tea and rubber for foreign exchange
earnings; expansion of employment opportunities in agriculture; and the
improvement of rural living conditions and social services. In order to
achieve these objectives Sri Lanka's agricultural development strategy
should concentrate on achieving balanced growth. This, in turn, would
call for realizing the potential for increasing foodgrain production,
which is particularly high in the Dry Zone (70% of the Island in the
north and east), parallel with increasing the benefits from existing out-
put of the tree crop sector. This policy would also entail reassessment
of incentive systems, and greater emphasis on management considerations
in schemes aimed at improved income distribution such as land reform and
settlement.



- 6 -
21.       Past Government policy lhas not been successful in achieving suffi-
cient sustained agricultural output. However, it is hoped that the past
poor investment climate in the tree crop sub-sector will be improved as a
result of the October 197'5 nationalization of all Sterling and Rupee estates.
Among the problems impeding progress are inadequate attention to extension,
marketing and credit services, excessive reliance on Government controls
and subsidies, diffused institutional responsibilities and consequent lack
of a coordinated approach to the problems of the sector, depressed profits
and returns on investment, and insufficient foreign exchange for necessary
imports. Moreover, the Government has shown a marked preoccupation with
new development, giving insufficient attention to maintenance and utiliza-
tion of existing assets. This has inter alia led to severe deterioration
of irrigation construction and maintenance capacity, farm tractor availa-
bility, and on-estate transport. With this in mind, the proposed Project
is designed to encourage policy improvements and to support on-going prior-
ity agricultural rehabilitation and development programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed Project was appraised in April/May 1975, based upon
discussions with the Government in connection with the Bank's Agricultural
Development Policy and Program Review in June/July 1974 and its subsequent
request for IDA support in early April 1975. A report entitled "Sri Lanka -
Appraisal of an Agricultural Development Project" (No. 911-CE) is being dis-
tributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in
Washington during October 20-24, 1975. The Government was represented by
Mr. S. Velayutham, Director, External Resources Division, Ministry of Plan-
ning and Economic Affairs.
A. Project Description
23.       The proposed Project, the first of its type in Sri Lanka, is aimed
at supporting both the food and tree crop sub-sectors. It is designed to sup-
port on-going priority Government agricultural rehabilitation and development
programs through the provision of imported capital equipment and technical
assistance. Support provided would increase agricultural production in the
short-term and would lay the foundation for longer-term, more comprehensive
development. IDA funds would provide finance for the c.i.f. costs of im-
ported farm tractors, machinery, equipment and transport vehicles (US$18.0
million), and spare parts for farm tractors, earth-moving equipment and the
coconut processing industry (US$6.5 million). Technical assistance would
be provided for pre-investment studies and for improvements in machinery
repair facilities (US$0.5 million). Programs selected for support were
chosen because of their favorable impact upon early and sustained food
production and on employnent and quality improvements of tree crop prod-
ucts.  No IDA funds would be used to import consumiables such as fertilizer
and farm chemicals. In order to secure lasting benefits from the Project,



-7-
the Government agreed during negotiations to provide continued allocation,
after the completion of the Project, of necessary foreign exchange for
importation of replacement and spare parts for the new and the rehabili-
tated transport, tractor and equipment fleets. The Government further
agreed to provide increased funds to the Territorial Civil Engineering
Organization (TCEO), Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways to allow
proper and lasting operation and maintenance of the country's irrigation
system.

B   Detailed Features
Agricultural Research, Training and Extension
25.       The Department of Agriculture, within the Ministry of Agriculture
and Lands (MAL), responsible for research, training and extension, has pre-
pared a comprehensive and well-conceived plan for the reorganization of
these services. This plan, approved by Cabinet, has as its main objectives
increasing crop yields and diversification of production on the basis of a
more effective use of rainfall and storage water, and introducing cropping
systems and farm practices better adapted to local ecological conditions.
The Department's extended activity will be based upon six to eight regional
research, extension and training centers. The Project would support four
centers and their 11 satellite stations, as well as the School of Agricul-
ture and Regional and District Training Centers, by providing foreign ex-
change for the importation of spares for the repair of tractors and farm
machinery, equipment and transport vehicles already in the possession of
the Department, but not operative due to lack of replacement parts, and
specified new farm machinery, equipment and transport. In addition, the
Project would provide transport for extension officers and their super-
visors.
26.       IDA support would be closely linked to a parallel UNDP project
under which technical assistance, as well as laboratory equipment, audio-
visual aids, and technical literature, would be provided. Agreement in
principle on the implementation of this project has been reached with GOSL
and UNDP. FA0 would be the executing agency working in consultation with
IDA. Signature of a UNDP project agreement would be a condition of dis-
bursement for this component (see 2(d) of Schedule 1 of the Development
Credit Agreement).
Seed Multiplication and Processing
27.       Certified seed production is insufficient to meet requirements,
low in quantity and quality resulting in nearly half of the total produc-
tion being rejected for certification. The Department of Agriculture's
new Division of Seed and Planting Material has developed a program under
which 42 GOSL seed farms would be fully developed for expanded registered
seed production with certified seed multiplication mnainly on private farms.
Seed drying, processing, and seed storage facilities would also be expanded
and improved. The Department's program calls for an increase by 1980 in
certified seed for paddy from the present 5,250 tons/year to 20,000 tons/
year and for other cereals and pulses from 1,400 tons/year to 2,200 tons/
year. This production would be sufficient for the projected 2.7 million ac
of paddy and 0.6 million ac of cereals and pulses. Local staff is adequate
in number and experience to implement the program. The Project would assist
in the development of GovernLment farms through the provision of finance for
the importation of farm machinery, equipment and transport.



-9-
Farm Tractor Availability in the Dry Zone
28.       Cultivation in Sri Lanka, particularly in the Dry Zone, is highly
mechanized because (i) soils are subject to extreme baking, and (ii) of the
need for timely cultivation. Shortages of foreign exchange reduced the
number of operating four-wheel tractors from some 11,000 units in 1969 to
an estimated 5,750 units in 1975. It is now estimated that some 3,200 units
work in the Dry Zone, with probably not more than 1,600 units being fully
operative for the lack of spares.
29.       The Project would provide foreign exchange for importation of about
400 new tractors for farmers. Assurances have been obtained that necessary
credit facilities will be available to farmers to purchase the tractors.
The Project would also provide foreign exchange for importation of spare
parts for the rehabilitation of the inactive tractor fleet and the mainte-
nance of operative units, and new tractor implements for demonstration on
GOSL farms. Repair facilities and experienced mechanics are available in
Sri Lanka.
30.       The Project is not aimed at the importation of two-wheel tractors
and their spares as GOSL has a program in hand for their local manufacture.
This program, however, appears overambitious and the type of tractor to be
manufactured is not suitable to most of Sri Lanka's conditions. To assist
in planning, two experts to be recruited under the Project would advise
GOSL on tractor production. These consultants would also assist in the
re-organization of private and public repair facilities, in the planning
of importation and distribution of tractor spare parts through the Sri
Lanka Tractor Corporation (SLTC), and the production of tractor implements
and farm tools.
Operation and Maintenance of Irrigation Networks
31.       Food crop production in the Dry Zone is largely dependent upon
controlled water supply. Approximately 1 million ac out of a total agricul-
tural area of 1.8 million ac are in some way irrigated. Responsibility for
operation and maintenance of 177 existing major tanks, providing water for
477,000 ac, and minor irrigation schemes covering around 470,000 ac, rests
with the Territorial Civil Engineering Organization (TCEO), within the
Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways (MIPH). The Organization is
well-staffed, but lacks transport and equipment essential for supervision
of irrigation networks and for proper water management.
32.       The Project would provide foreign exchange for the importation of
inspection vehicles and surveying and drafting equipment for TCEO. The Proj-
ect would also finance limited construction equipment for the Department of
Machinery and Equipment (DME), within MIPH, for assignment to TCEO on a
rental basis for specific jobs. However, since poor water management on
most irrigation schemes is due to lack of operation and maintenance funds
and lack of water discipline amongst farmers, in the absence of remedial



_ 10 _
action, support to TCEO, and indeed to the food crop sector, would be ill-
advised. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOSL that all
irrigation works unde- the responsibility of the TCEO would be operated and
maintained at 11 times in accordance with sound agricultural and engineer-
ing pracLices.  The Government intends to gradually increase operation and
mainteuaoce fui Is to TCEO from the present Rs 25/ac/year, and that, not
later !h-n FY 1179, these funds would reach Rs 50 in ciurrent terms/ac/!jear
(Sectioin 4.03 oy the Development Credit Agreement).  In the absence of water
charge., the additional required Rs 30 million/year would have to be provided
from tLT b1udget.  The subject of water charges will be thoroughly discussed
with tC.u Government in connection with the proposed two irrigation schemes
under appraisal by IDA, the Mahlaweli Ganga Development Project II (Phase I)
and the Irrigation Iodernization Project.
Rehabilitation of Machinery
33.       The bulk of the earth-moving and construction machinery in Sri
Lanka is under the operational supervision of DME. DME also operates 3
major and 11 regional iepair and maintenance shops. Much of DME's mach-
inery and equipment is non-operational for want of spares and replacement
parts and the Department, with its machinery park operating at about 25%
of its potential, is no longer able to assure equipment availability to
construction organizations when requested.
34.       The Project would provide for the recruitment, within six months
of signature of the Development Credit Agreement, of one consultant respon-
sible for:
(a) proposals for the introduction of a meaningful policy
of spare part procurement and disbursement; and
(b) the improvement of DME,'s repair facilities.
The Project would further provide funds for the importation of spare and
replacement parts to rehabilitate about 150 major pieces of equipment, and
workshop equipment for DME's repair facilities. The DME would assess spare
and replacement part requirements. IDA's approval of this assessment would
be a condition of disbursement for this component (see 2(e) of Schedule 1
of the Development Credit Agreement).
Completion of Two Irrigation Projects
35.       The 1975 work program of thie Department of Irrigation (DI), within
MIPH, includes the construction or reconstruction of 12 irrigation projects.
Two nearly-completed, projects could shortly be brought into production through
the provision of some earth-moving and construction equipment.   The Department
has the teclnical competence and manpower to undertake the completion of these
projects.



36.       The Wahalkade irrigation scheme consists of the reconstruction of
an ancient tank with a storage capacity of 30,000 ac feet to serve an area
of 2,000 ac. The work remaining calls for the construction of four miles
of main canals, the construction of distributaries, and jungle clearing on
1,750 ac. After completion, settlement would be undertaken by the Department
of Land Settlement, plans for which have already been formulated. The major
crop to be grown would be paddy.
37.       The Muthuaiyankaddu scheme involves drainage on 6,000 ac.  Remaining
work consists of earth-moving, construction of drainage structures, internal
roads and field channels, as well as jungle clearing on 200 ac. The area is
already settled and improved drainage would result in immediate increases in
yields of crops, mainly chillies and vegetables.
38.       The Project would provide finance for the importation of machinery
and equipment for the completion of the two schemes. This equipment would
be initially entrusted to DI, but after completion of the two schemes would
revert to DME for reassignment to other irrigation construction jobs.
Sugar Production
39.       The country is heavily dependent upon imports to meet domestic
sugar demand. Until 1972, annual imports exceeded 250,000 tons. In 1973,
due to foreign exchange constraints, sugar imports were reduced by about
30%, but still accounted for about 10% of the value of total imports.
Imports were further cut to about 40,000 tons in 1974. Nevertheless,
second only to food grains, including wheat flour, sugar remains the
single most important food item imported.
40.       Domestic production of refined sugar is based upon two schemes:
factories and associated plantations at Hingurana and Kantalai, operated by
Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation (SLSC). Through the introduction of better
planting material and improved management, production of both schemes in-
creased from 12,000 tons in 1973 to 19,000 tons in 1974. Production, how-
ever, is still only around 50% of the factory capacity largely due to lack
of land development equipment. SLSC has plans for improvements of these
two on-going schemes of which ADB is already assisting the one at Hingu-
rana.
41.       The Kantalai sugar project covers an area of 9,600 ac to be irri-
gated from a reservoir of 110,000 ac feet storage. To date, 5,000 ac have
been developed, an additional 3,100 ac have been cleared, and 1,500 ac are
still under jungle. Land development was delayed due to water shortages
which will be overcome with the completion of the Mahaweli Ganga Develop-
ment Project I in early 1976. Lack of machinery has prevented SLSC from
preparing the land in time for the arrival of the irrigation water. Proc-
essing capacity of the factory is sufficient to handle potential produc-
tion from the total 9,600 ac.



42.       The Pro'ect would p   ride   r he i!-vorl:ation of equipment to
de_1op 4,cJ0 ac, and for trar )virt, cor'runication cquipment, and workshop
machinery atnd tools.  Tie -'     Oak. aent fias zhe n .essary skills to imple-
ment the expansion progrn.M.
Tree Crops On-Estate Ti.-;sport
43.       The support c tile tree crop se:-or: under the Project is consistent
with the Government's -. --termn policy to diversify about one-third of the
tree crop lands to oti,   Uses.  It is',   O *irected at production increases,
but at maintaining eml, .yment and iualil y of end-product.  It will not have
any significant: effect -)a world prices.
44.       Government's pol:Lcy alirs at maitltai lag its markets for existing
tree crop production by decrea-:ing production cost and maintaining product
quality, while reducing total acreage through crop diversification. Accord-
ingly, the Government plans to diversify about 200,000 ac of marginal tea
land and 180,000 ac of marginal rubber land, amounting to one-third of the
total area under these crops.   A first phase of the alversification program,
covering about 75,000 ac of largely marginal tea land, is under preparation
with the assistance of UUDP/FAO and the IBRD/FAO Go-operative Program.    Bank
Group support for the implementation of this project has been sougJht by GOSL
and is under active preparation.   In addition, GOSL iX: operating a pilot
scheme to diversify an area of about 16,000 ac. In the meantime, tree crop
products, tea in particular, will continue to be the major foreign exchange
earner and a dominant employer.
45.       Transport vehicles on tea and rubber est:ates and transport for
smallholder bought-leaf factories are inadequate and for the most part
obsolete. Insufficient availability and frequent breakdown of transport
result in undue delays in processing and in deterioration in qualitv of
green-leaf or in coagulation of latex, detrimental, to quality of ttle end-
product.  Transport constraints also lead to postponements in plucking,
affecting employment as well as quality of end-product.   Antiquated trans-
port is expensive to operate.   Moreover, the shortage of transport has
forced numerous tea factories to switch from local solid fuel (wood) to
expensive liquid fuel for firing driers.   This switch has resulted in
increascs in the cost of production and requires scarce foreign exchange.
Furthetmore, lack of transport in the coconut sector limits the implemen-
tation of GOSL's policy of extended undercropping.
46.       The Project would provide for the importation of about 615 trac-
tors or loiries for transport on tea, rubber and coconut estates, as well
as for green-leaf transport: to bought-leaf factories. In addition, the
Project would provide for t:he importation of about 150 motorcycles for
es;tate supervision. Funds would also be made available for the provision
o spare parts to rehabilitate the existing transport fleet.



- 13 -
47.       Smallholder tea production is characterized by low quality, result-
ing from poor agronomic practices and irregular plucking, smallholder rubber
production by low quality processing. The extension services of the Tea
and Rubber Controller's Departments are responsible for improving produc-
tion performance on smallholdings and also for the administration and super-
vision of a large number of production and processing subsidy schemes. The
inspection of the subsidy program takes priority. Increased mobility would
mean that extension staff would be able to devote more time for extension
services to smallholders. The Project funds would provide for the importa-
tion of about 145 motorcycles and about 10 supervision vehicles for alloca-
tion among the Tea and Rubber Controller's Department and the Coconut Devel-
opment Authority. The motorcycles would be sold to extension officers on
commercial credit as it is felt that this is the best means of ensuring
optimum care and maintenance.
48.       Improvement in tea and rubber processing is sponsored by GOSL
subsidy programs, partially financed, in the case of tea, through ADB
credits. However, no such support is available for the coconut process-
ing industry. This industry, primarily in private ownership, is charac-
terized by numerous small, generally poorly equipped units. Lack of spare
parts adversely affects production performance and quality of the end-prod-
uct. The Project would provide funds for the importation of the most crit-
ical spare parts for mills.
Tree Crops Research
49.       Tree crop research is the responsibility of three research insti-
tutes under the control of the Ministry of Plantation Industries. All three
institutes (i.e. tea, rubber and coconut), but in particular the Tea and-Rub-
ber Research Institutes, lack basic laboratory and research equipment and
transport.
50.       The purchase of much needed transport vehicles under the Project
would be closely linked to a parallel UNDP project. The UNDP project would
provide technical assistance in the field of economics, research, and lab-
oratory equipment. During negotiations it was agreed that, in order to
assure that the transport vehicles to be provided by IDA would be effi-
ciently used, it would be a condition of disbursement against this compo-
nent that the aforementioned UNDP project be signed (see 2(g) of Schedule
1 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Studies
51.       Because past agricultural planning has been concentrated on global
targets and emergency or crash programs, preparation of specific investment
projects has been lacking. The Project would make provision for importation
of necessary equipment and technical assistance to help develop two invest-
ment projects namely:



- 14 -
(a) A smallholder development project in the coconut
production area, arising out of UNDP technical
assistance to the Coconut Research Institute;
(b) The rehabilitation of the Lower Uva region in the
southeast.
52.       The traditional export sector remains very important to the country's
economic development. The sector is subject to numerous supports, subsidies,
controls and taxation, which, as is common in long-established industries, have
grown from year to year over the last decades. Their impact, cross influences,
and cost to GOSL have never been fully analyzed. The Project would provide
assistance for a comprehensive study of economic factors affecting the tree
crop industry, with the aim of providing GOSL with a policy framework giving
clear indications of various alternatives, such as the trade-off between using
the sector as a major source of taxation, or as a means for enhancing exports
and employment. The appointment of a consultant for this study would be a
condition of disbursement for this component (see 2(f) of Schedule 1 of the
Development Credit Agreement).
C. Project Cost and Financing
53.       The total Project cost is estimated at US$60.5 million equivalent,
or US$40.2 million equivalent net of taxes. The foreign exchange component
is US$27.1 million. The Project cost includes an estimated US$2.1 M from
UNDP for technical assistance and provision of research and extension facil-
ities to the Department of Agriculture and to the three tree crop research
institutes. The proposed IDA credit of US$25 M would finance 100% of the
c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and 11 man-years of technical assis-
tance. IDA contribution net of all taxes would be 622%, with the Govern-
ment contributing 33% and UNDP 5%.
54.       Cost estimates are based on findings during appraisal (April/May
1975). No physical contingencies have been applied. Price contingencies
were applied on the basis of projected inflation rates affecting prices of
imported equipment, machinery, spare parts and cost of civil works over the
two-year project period. Since the Project provides assistance to on-going
programs for which GOSL support is assured, only incremental costs have been
included. In estimating equipment requirements, ongoing or planned bilateral
and multilateral aid schemes have been taken into account, as has been the
absorptive capacity of the agencies concerned.

D. Procurement and Disbursement
55.       The main items to be financed under the Project would be spare
parts for tractors, trucks and machinery, new vehicles and new tractors.
Spare parts for, existing vehicles and tractors (US$1.6 million), equip-
ment owned by DME (US$2.9 million) and the coconut processing industry
(US$0.5 million) would be purchased directly from original manufacturers
and would be sold to the end-user. Farm tractors (US$2.2 million) and
vehicles for the estate sector (US$4.4 million), including spares, would
be imported on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with IDA guidelines, bearing in mind the need for standardiza-
tion of the tractor fleet, in particular, of individual estate fleets.
Considerations would also be given to the availability of repair and main-
tenance facilities. Imports would be handled by either the SLTC or the
resident supplier agents.   Transport and equipment for TCEO (US$5.6 mil-
lion), motorcycles for extension officers, and transport for all other
governmental organizations (US$7.3 million) would be grouped and pur-
chased by the appropriate agency under ICB in accordance with IDA guide-
lines. Minor equipment items valued at less than US$100,000 would be
purchased through normal trade channels. For all contracts for the im-
portation of new machinery and equipment in excess of US$100,000, tech-
nical specifications and draft tender documents would be submitted to IDA
before bidding documents are issued and bid evaluations would be submitted
to IDA before making awards. Importation orders for spare parts for the
rehabilitation of the existing tractor and equipment fleet would be placed
in bulk, but spares would be released by GOSL on the basis of the capacity
of existing facilities to undertake repair work. It is expected that equip-
ment would arrive over a period of 24 months.
56.       Technical assistance specialists provided for SLTC (US$200,000),
DME (US$100,000), the Lower Uva Development Program (US$200,000) and the
Tree Crop Incentive Study (US$50,000) would be recruited by the Ministry
concerned in accordance with IDA guidelines for the selection of consult-
ants.
57.       Disbursement from the proposed Credit would be against 100% of
cif costs of imported equipment, machinery and spare parts, and 100% of
foreign exchange costs for consultants' services. Any savings arising
from one project component would be reallocated to others as mutually
agreed between GOSL and IDA. It is estimated that disbursement would
be over a 30-month period.



- 16 -
E. Organization and Management
58.       Overall responsibility for Project implementation would be with
the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA), with execution of
individual Project components through participating Ministries. Inter-
ministerial coordination, supervision and monitoring would be ensured
through a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) to be established under
the chairmanship of the Director, External Resources Division in MPEA.
PCC would be assisted in its task by a team of Government staff assigned
to work as a secretariat on a full-time basis. Members of the Committee
would be representatives of the Ministries directly concerned with Project
components namely: The Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, the Ministry of
Plantation Industries, and the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways,
as well as the Central Bank of Ceylon (CB). During negotiations, it was
agreed that the establishment of the PCC would be a condition of effec-
tiveness (see Section 5.01 of the Development Credit Agreement).
59.       GOSL and the participating government agencies would maintain
separate records to reflect operations, resources and expenditures in respect
of the Project. For this purpose, special accounts would be established and
PCC would be responsible to submit to IDA quarterly statements and an annual
statement for each of the individual accounts, including GOSL's contributions
to the Project (i.e. buildings and seed storage on Government farms, incre-
mental operational and maintenance costs for TCECI), local support for tech-
nical assistance which would be financed through the GOSL budget and UNDP
inputs. The PCC would also submit quarterly progress reports to IDA, based
on reports of technical subcommittees to be established within the three
concerned Ministries.
F. Benefits and Justification
60.       The support to the food crop subsector, costed at US$31 million
(excluding technical assistance), would result in an estimated production
increase from about year Six after Credit effectiveness of 155,000 tons of
rice, 15,000 tons of cereals and pulses, and 11,500 tons of sugar. The
approximate value of these commodities at projected world market prices
in constant dollars would be about US$41 million per annum. Quantitatively,
this incremental production would be equivalent to over 40% of total current
rice imports and to 20% of recent, sharply-reduced sugar imports. Additional
production increases could be expected through the improved activities of the
Department of Agriculture, particularly extension services.
61.       Measuring the incremental benefits which would arise out of the
support to the tree crop subsector (US$4.8 million) is difficult. The Proj-
ect support would primarily help maintain quality of the end-products through
reduction in deterioration of raw material during transport from field to



- 1 7 -
factory. This is necessary to help Sri Lanka retain its existing markets.
The support to the estate sector would also result in greater assurance of
employment for tea pluckers and rubber tappers. Transport for the bought-
leaf factories would be essential to smallholder tea producers and comple-
ment the proposed improvement in extension activities.
62.       On-estate transport would also help reduce foreign exchange ex-
penditure through reduction of liquid fuel (imported) requirements of tea
factories in favor of solid fuel (local wood supply). Savings to the
factories themselves would be around Rs 17/100 lb of made tea or 7% of
the cost of production.
63.       Due to the nature of the Project, no rate of return has been
calculated. The existence of high sunk costs in relation to incremental
investment would lead to an unusually high rate of return. For example,
assuming all other necessary farm inputs are provided, the rehabilitation
of one farm tractor at an average total cost of US$600 would result, within
one year, in incremental paddy production of 40 tons of rice, equivalent to
gross foreign exchange savings of US$9,750 for the remaining life of the
tractor.
64.       The Project would assist in one form or another the vast majority
of smallholder paddy producers in the Dry Zone. The number of beneficiaries
would be around 320,000 farm families or about 13% of the total population
of Sri Lanka. In addition, support to the tree crop sector would help assure
employment of tea pluckers and rubber tappers, the poorest segment of Sri
Lanka's rural population. Provision of transport to bought-leaf factories
would assist the majority of the approximately 115,000 smallholder tea pro-
ducers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
65.       The Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Sri Lanka
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
66.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 26, 32, 34, 50 and 52 of this Report.
67.       Establishment of the PCC would be a condition of effectiveness
(see paragraph 58 of this Report).
68.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.



- 18 -
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
69.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

Cr. No. 121    -    Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 million of June 19. 1968;
Effective Date: August 5. 1968: Original Closing Date:
June 30. 1973. Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Construction is about two-and-a-half years behind the appraisal
schedule, but most problems causing the delay - government change, reorgani-
zation, insurrection in 1971, strikes in 1972 and inadequate repair facili-
ties - have been solved since 1973 and little further slippage is expected.
Total costs have risen due to inflation by US$1 million over the appraisal's
estimate of US$3.3 million; the additional cost is being met from local
sources. The project remains viable because prices of main outputs (onions
and chillies) have risen three to four times the values used for appraisal.
The credit is now expected to be fully disbursed and the area fully irrigated
by the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Ln. No. 634    -    Second Development Finance Corporation Project: US$3
million of July 18. 1969; Effective Date: October 15,
1969; Original Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Revised Closing Date: December 31. 1975
Because of the slowdown in economic activities, there were delays
in committing funds and the original Closing Date of December 31, 1973 has
been postponed for a second time from December 31, 1974 to December 31,
1975, to allow sufficient time for presentation of new sub-projects to the
Bank and the completion of disbursement. Helped by Government's policy to
encourage tourism and non-traditional exports, commitments under the loan
picked up in 1973 and were completed by last December. Loan disbursements
are expected to be completed by the revised Closing Date.
Ln. No. 636    -    Maskeliya Ova Power Project: US$16.5 million of July 28,
1969: Effective Date: January 19. 1970: Original
Closing Date: September 30, 1973, Revised Closing Date:
December 31. 1976
The project is virtually completed. The first unit of 50 MW was
commissioned in February 1974, about 1-1/2 years later than originally esti-
mated. The second unit was commissioned in July 1974. The gas turbine unit
was cancelled upon the request of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Delays
were caused mainly by problems associated with the appointment of acceptable

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

consultants, landslides in the penstock area and various strikes in manu-
facturers' factories. Site work has in general been carried out satisfac-
torily. The extension of the Polpitiya switching station, for which bids
have been received, will be finished by mid-1976. Foreign exchange savings
of about $1.9 million are used to cover the cost overrun on the Power Trans-
mission and Distribution Project (Credit 372), discussed below.

Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Construction is about two-and-a-half years behind schedule (for
the same reasons as under Credit 121 above), but all necessary equipment is
now on order and no further delays are anticipated. Overall project costs
have increased due to inflation by 30% above the appraisal estimate; the
cost overruns are being met by Government. The project remains viable be-
cause the price of the main output (paddy) has increased by over 100% since
appraisal. The project is expected to be completed by December 1976 and
the Closing Date was recently extended to June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 653     -    Mahaweli Ganga Development Project (Irrigation/Power);
and             US$14.5 million each, both of January 30, 1970; Effective
Cr. No. 174          Date:  April 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976:
Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The expected date of first water delivery is now two years behind
the appraisal schedule and overall completion of the project is expected to
be March 1976 nearly a year and a half behind appraisal target. Delays
were due mainly to foundation problems (now overcome) at Polgolla power
house and a slow start at Bowatenna diversion dam. Construction is now
progressing satisfactorily. Good progress has been recorded to date on
agricultural extension and research in the project area. Total project
costs have increased by about 10% largely as a result of rising costs for
electro-mechanical equipment. The economic viabilLty of the project has
not been adversely affected by the cost overruns since produce prices have
increased by 100% since appraisal. The Credit has been fully disbursed and
the Loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the Revised Closing Date.
Cr. No. 372    -    Power Transmission and Distribution Project; US$6.0
million of April 18. 1973: Effective Date: July 25,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Preparation for construction is proceeding satisfactorily and
contracts totaling about $7.3 million for sub-stations, towers, insulators
and certain other equipment have been awarded. Only miscellaneous line
materials remain to be procured. However, inflation since signing has
increased foreign exchange costs by some 30%. We have agreed to cover
the cost overruns from savinigs under Loan 636-CE above.

Cr. No. 504    -     Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9,
1974; Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The Credit supports an integrated project for dairy development
involving the on-farm development of some 2,400 small to medium sized dairy
farms, the importation of dairy cattle, the construction-operation of extended
milk collecting systems and the provision of extension, training and central-
ized calf rearing services. Progress of implementation is satisfactory. The
Project Technical Unit has been established, with key staff (with the excep-
tion of Financial Advisor presently being selected) has been appointed.    Gov-
ernment is understood to have taken steps to appoint such a person. Training
of field staff is under way. Construction of the calf rearing unit and the
study of milk collection routes are also well under way. Initial farmer
response to the project has been encouraging; 2,100 loan applications have
been received, far larger than anticipated, and participating banks are now
making loans under the project. Although disbursements are behind schedule,
largely due to delay in credit effectiveness, the project is making good
progress and is likely to be committed by late 1977.
Cr. No. 566    -     Third Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$4.5 million of June 27, 1975; Effective Date:
August 22, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
The Credit will help meet the estimated foreign exchange require-
ments of DFCC over the next two years for lending mainly to export industries
and tourism.
