CAPE VERDE
PRAIA PORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Cape Verde consists of a roughly horseshoe-shaped collection of
ten islands and five islets about 450 km off the coast of West Africa
(Map IBRD 16104). Nine of the islands are inhabited. The total
population is 296,000 (1980 estimate), of which about 146,000 live on
Santiago, on which is the capital, Praia (Table 1). All but three of the
islands are mountainous, with a steep, rocky topography and volcanic
soils. The topography and climate combine to make agriculture difficult
and unproductive. Agriculture is mainly small-holder subsistence
farming. Of the country's total area (400,000 ha), about 60,000 ha are
cultivated, but only about 1,800 ha are irrigated, which makes the
economy and the domestic food supply extremely dependent on low and
erratic rainfall, necessitating the importation of foodstuffs on a
regular basis. GNP per capita is tentatively estimated at US$300 in
1981.
1.02     Being an island nation, Cape Verde depends on interisland ship-
ping in the way other nations depend on highways; ships carry domestic
goods and passengers between islands and handle the vital imports and the
few exports. Thus adequate ports on aLl islands are essential.
1.03     The principal port is Porto Grande at Mindelo on Sao Vicente.
The second deepwater port is at Praia which, constructed in 1978 by the
Portuguese Government, is deteriorating rapidly. Most of the other
islands have small harbors protected from the prevailing northeast winds
but generally in bad condition with very shallow water alongside small
quays, which necessitates lighterage of cargo. All the ports were
managed  until September 1, 1982, by the Junta Autonoma dos Portos
(JAP)    a public agency under the Ministry of Transport and
Communications. The Directorate of Marine and Ports runs a small
maritime school for deck and engineer officers at its headquarters in
Mindelo.
1.04     The Government gives transport high priority in its development
plans with special emphasis on replacing the collapsing deepwater berths
1/ All ports are now managed by Empresa Nacional de Administracao dos
Portos (ENAPOR), a public enterprise under the Minister of Transport and
Communications.

at Praia and improving interisland shipping. After assessing the
country's needs, it is proposed, in line with the Government's
development strategy, to inaugurate lending to the country with a Praia
port rehabilitation project that will make an important and immediate
contribution to the economy of Cape Verde.
1.05     At the request of the Government, the Bank Group approved an
advance from the Project Preparation Facility in December 1980, in an
amount of US$100,000 for consulting services to (a) prepare a master plan
for the port; (b) collect complementary economic and financial data; and
(c) assist in reorganizing JAP into a financially viable autonomous
government enterprise. A second advance of US$100,000 was granted in
February 1982, to finance the completion of the preparation of tender
documents.
1.06     The proposed project, as appraised, is a suitable vehicle for
Bank Group lending. It will establish the necessary infrastructure in
Praia port, improve port operation, management and accounting systems,
and provide training in ports and related sectors.
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Ports and Maritime Transport
2.01     Cape Verde's foreign trade depends almost entirely on maritime
transport most of which is served through the ports of Porto Grande at
Mindelo on Sao Vincente and Praia on Santiago, from which goods are dis-
tributed to other islands by interisland shipping services. Minor port
terminal facilities exist for the nation's internal trade on all of the
other inhabited is'Lands. The ports subsector is discussed in detail in
Chapter III.
2.02     The national shipping line ARCAVERDE carries approximately one-
third of Cape Verde's foreign trade and provides virtually all inter-
island services. There are some private operators engaged in the inter-
island trade but t'hese are of minor significance.
2.03     ARCAVERDE has done its best during the six years since independ-
ence to meet basic interisland and ocean transport needs within severe
constraints, particularly over-aged and inappropriate vessels, and low
passenger and freight volume to some islands, which makes it difficult to
offer a frequent and economical service. ARCAVERDE's fleet provides
daily shuttle service between each of the two main islands and their
immediate neighboring islands, a scheduled passenger/freight ferry
service stopping on all islands, and freight service on request to serve
domestic needs as well as to bring in imports. In addition, one of its
ships has been fitted for petroleum transport and has been leased to the
Shell Company, which distributes petroleum to the various islands.
2.04     The Federal Republ:Lc of Germany (FRG) has recently provided two
new vessels to replace the ones operating the shuttle service, and has



- 3 -
agreed in principle with the Cape Verde Government to finance a replace-
ment ferry for the interisland service; an FRG financed study to deter-
mine the most appropriate type of vessel is in progress. Otherwise, the
major need is to replace the vessel currently used for petroleum trans-
port, which does not meet insurance company specifications. ARCAVERDE is
in the process of buying a small (200 - 300 DWT) vessel to distribute
fuel in barrels to the smaller islands. The draft Four Year Development
Plan (1982-85) includes provision for a petroleum tanker for bulk distri-
bution to the larger islands, but this needs to be preceded by feasibi-
lity and design studies. Furthermore, a decision is required on whether
ARCAVERDE or the petroleum companies should be responsible for the acqui-
sition and operation of such a vessel.
B. Roads
2.05     There are some 760 km of roads, of which about 300 km are of
cobblestone, and most of the remainder are earth roads or tracks. Roads
are particularly important on the rugged islands, and the largest systems
are found on Santiago and Santo Antao (Table 2). There are no roads on
Boa Vista or Maio, but these islands are flat and sparsely populated.
There are some 7,000 motor vehicles, mainly on Santiago. Private cars
and pick-ups predominate, with some small trucks and light buses.
C. Air Transport
2.06     Cape Verde's principal external air link is via Amilcar Cabral
International Airport on Sal Island, the only airport equipped for night
landing. Capable of accomodating the largest international jets, it
serves about 30 international flights weekly. The capital, Praia, is
linked to Dakar by three flights per week by small 48-passenger
aircraft. Seven of the Cape Verde islands (Table 3) are linked by
Transportes Aereos de Cabo Verde (TACV), a wholly government-owned firm
operating a small fleet of aircraft. Passenger traffic has grown by 9%
per year since 1967, reaching 93,750 in 1980 (Table 4) and flights are
often full, with average load factors of over 80% on the principal
routes. Additional services will be needed in the near future, but the
most economic means of providing these services need to be determined.
Some fleet replacement and expansion may be warranted, but utilization of
the present fleet (in terms of hours per day) could also be improved.
The installation of night landing facilities at Praia (currently in
progress) will help in this regard.
D. Transport Policy and Planning
2.07     The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is respon-
sible for transport planning and policy, including overall responsibility
of the transport parastatals ARCAVERDE, ENAPOR, and TACV (Annex 1).
MTC's competent but small staff is mainly occupied with day to day
administration, with little time to devote to longer term planning

issues. Consultants recently completed an initial screening of possible
investments in the sector, 1/ (Table 5) but this needs to be followed up
by a more detailed analysis to develop a long-term strategy for the
sector, determine the future roles of the parastatals ARCAVERDE and TACV,
and identify the most urgently needed projects. The project provides for
technical assistance to MTC to address these issues, and for follow-up
project preparation, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
III. THE PORT SUB-SECTOR
A. The Port System
3.01     The public port system consists of: (a) two deepwater ports,
Porto Grande at Mindelo and Praia (the project port); and (b) about 30
small ports or landing places on the inhabited islands (Map IBRD
15079). All cargo imported into or exported from Cape Verde by sea is
handled at Porto Grande or Praia and distributed to other islands mostly
by ARCAVERDE's interisland fleet (para. 2.03). The exception is Sal
Island whose three ports are privately owned and operated, two for
exporting salt and the third for importing aviation fuel. However,
interisland shipping is allowed to use these three ports for distribution
of cargo imported through Pcrto Grande or Praia.
B, Port Organization
3.02     Up to May 7, 1982 all the ports in Cape Verde (with the
exception of those on Sal Island) were operated by the Junta Autonoma dos
Portos (JAP) with headquarters at Mindelo. The law that governed the JAP
was a Provincial Government Decree of November 26, 1974, No. 22/74. Upon
independence, all laws were continued "transitorially" by bulletin No. 1
of the Republic of Cape Verde of July 5, 1975.  Notwithstanding its name,
JAP had no autonomy. The provisions in the Decree calling for a General
Council and an Administrative Commission were inoperative, and management
was effected directly by the Minister of Transport and Communications
through the Director of Marine and Ports (also headquartered at Mindelo)
and the Director of Ports at JAP headquarters. Operations at the prin-
cipal ports were the responsibility of Delegates, or Port Managers, under
the Director of Ports. JAP had a permanent staff of about 200 and
employed about 500 temporary labor for cargo handling. Until January 1,
1981, the account.Lng system was on a budgetary cash basis.
3.03     On May 7, 1982, the Government issued a law creating a new port
enterprise, Empresa Nacional De Administracao Dos Portos (ENAPOR).
ENAPOR's organizal:ion chart is given in Annex 1. ENAPOR is a commercial

Quadriennal, Esquisse de Programmation dans le Secteur des Transports,
November 1981.



- 5 -
port enterprise, endowed with all the port assets, including infra-
structure, and with sufficient autonomy to compel management to be
responsible for efficient and financially viable operations, with the
necessary powers and duties to exercise those responsibilities, subject
to necessary overriding control by the Minister of Transport and
Communications. This law is based upon the provisions of Decree-Law No.
11(78 of January 18, 1978, "Bases Gerais das Empresas Publicas" (General
Bases of Public Enterprises). The new law, a summary of which is given
in Annex 2, is satisfactory.
C. Fixed Assets and Accounting Systems
3.04     During 1980, JAP, with the assistance of a financial expert
seconded to Cape Verde by Portugal, prepared a complete inventory of all
the fixed assets owned or operated by it (including Praia Port as it now
stands), as of December 31, 1980. An opening balance sheet as of
December 31, 1980, which is not audited, has been prepared including
fixed assets for cargo handling.
3.05     The Portuguese financial expert has also designed and installed
a basic financial accounting system, operating from January 1, 1981, and
held training classes on the new system for the small accounting staff.
This new accounting system will be continued and developed, as it is
feasible under the new legal status of ENAPOR. Technical assistance is
provided under the proposed project for that purpose (Annex 4, para.
C(d)). Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations
that it will require ENAPOR to keep its accounts according to standard
commercial accounting principles from FY1983 onward.
3.06     There is no local auditing capability in Cape Verde and no
international auditing firms have offices there. The Government has
created an audit unit ultimately to be responsible for auditing
Government enterprises, but it is not yet operational and it will take
time to recruit and train staff. The Bank of Cape Verde and the
Government have no objection to a foreign firm being appointed as
external auditors to audit the accounts of ENAPOR. Confirmation was
obtained during negotiations that an independent firm of auditors,
acceptable to the Association, be so appointed and that audited accounts,
together with the auditors' report thereon be sent to the Association,
commencing with FY1983. From FY1983 onward, audited accounts will be
submitted within six months of the end of the financial year. Were it
not for the Bank Group's involvement in this project, the port enterprise
would probably not incur the costs of external audit, most of which will
involve scarce foreign exchange. It has been agreed with
the Government to include these costs for the years 1983-1985 in the
proposed project, the Association financing the foreign exchange costs
(para 4.03 (f)).



D. Staffing and Training
3.07     The port enterprise is seriously short of trained personnel for
management, operations and maintenance. Provision is made in the pro-
posed project for training of existing and necessary additional staff in
these areas. The country, as a whole, suffers from a lack of middle and
lower echelon trained personnel, but it has a valuable pool of potential
trainees now graduating from its high schools. This should be borne in
mind when considering the additional personnel to be recruited and
trained under the various technical assistance programs included in the
project.
E. Port Facilities and Operations
3.08     The port enterprise is responsible for:  (a) ship berth alloca-
tion; (b) hiring stevedoring and shore-handling labor; (c) providing
cargo-handling equipment; (d) cargo handling operation; (e) providing
transit sheds and other storage facilities within the port area; (f)
maintenance of port facilities and equipment; and (g) security. Pilotage
is provided only at Porto Grande.
Porto Grande (Mindelo)
3.09     The berths at Porto Grande are constructed in the shape of a
reversed F, built out from the shore. Detailed information is given in
Annex 3. The port: handles the present international and interisland
traffic without excessive delays to vessels but the long narrow finger
pier system makes cargo handling cumbersome. The narrowness of the piers
inhibits efficient: operations since interisland domestic cargoes and
passengers mingle freely with customs-controlled imported cargoes on the
15 m wide apron of the main pier. All imported general cargo must be
hauled some 500-600 m to the port's three transit sheds. Considerable
quantitites of bu:Lk and bagged cargo require some 10,000 truck loads per
year for their evacuation. This adds to operating difficulties. Cape
Verde's only grain silo and flour mill are located in Mindelo and some
75% of the imported grain arriving in bulk is bagged and re-shipped to
the other islands in smaller vessels.
3.10     The port's cargo handling equipment and maintenance facilities,
which are owned arid operated by the port enterprise, are obsolete and in
bad state of repair. The project includes modern cargo-handling equip-
ment and assistance in the introduction of modern cargo-handling proce-
dures and equipment maintenance programs, together with the necessary
training. These will improve the efficiency of port operations to the
extent possible within the constraints of the port layout.
3.11     Mindelo will serve as Cape Verde's main fishing center and a
6,000 ton capacity cold stcrage facility has just been completed immedia-
tely outside the port area, financed by a Dutch grant of US$4.5 million
equivalent. Fishing boats use a shallow draft marginal quay and do not
interfere with general cargo operations. A ship repair yard, initially
to handle the repair of vessels of up to 6,500 DWT and later the cons-



truction of small vessels, is under construction, also outside the port
area. The estimated construction cost is US$38 million equivalent co-
financed by EIB, AfDB, Portuguese Banks and the Cape Verde Government,
participating with US$5, 13, 12 and 8 million respectively. The
Portuguese shipyard LISNAVE will manage and operate the yard. No inter-
ference with general cargo operations is expected from these devel-
opments, which will, however, promote the growth of traffic through the
port.
Port of Praia
3.12     The existing port facilities (Map IBRD 16440) comprise two deep-
water berths constructed at right angle: the outer berth based upon the
port's protective breakwater is 210 m long and 9.5 m deep; and the inner
marginal berth is 310 m long and 7.5 m deep at MLW.I' There are two
transit sheds of 2,400 m2 each. The port enterprise owns and operates
the cargo-handling equiment and is responsible for its repair and mainte-
nance. The port has no electricity or water supply. Water and bunker
supplies, to the extent available, are brought by trucks to the port area
(details in Annex 3).
3.13     Construction of the above berths started in 1975 by the
Portuguese Government and was completed in 1978. The reinforced concrete
caissons proved to be underdesigned and many caissons were damaged during
and after placing. Deterioration of the structure is continuing.
Analysis of existing data and available investigations indicate that,
even if some of the caissons are in better shape than others and could be
considered safe for some years, their general state of repair is such
that the existing structure is unreliable. Total collapse of some
portions of the wharf could occur at any time.
3.14     Operations at the port of Praia are severely hampered by: (a)
partially old and obsolete, or new but unsuitable, cargo handling equip-
ment; (b) lack of spare parts, workshop and repair facilities and equip-
ment; (c) untrained port labor, and (d) lack of acceptable port operating
techniques. These constraints contribute to inefficient handling, high
incidence of cargo damage and pilferage.
3.15     The berthing facilities are inefficiently utilized.  Large
batches of timber and construction equipment clutter the aprons causing
difficulties in unloading and loading of cargo from and onto vessels.
There is no customs fence and control by customs officers is inefficient.
The two available transit sheds for general cargo are badly stacked and
some cargo damaged and, in the absence of long-term storage facilities,
they are also used as warehouses. Customs cargo has to be trucked to a
customs zone in the old port area. Prevailing customs regulations do not
permit the removal of abandoned cargo prior to payment of all duties;
11 Depth of water as given in this report is with reference to MLW.
Tide range is about 1.4 m.



- 8 -
cargo may remain in the sheds for 12 months before being auctioned by
customs.
3.16     Empresa Publica de Abastecimento (EMPA), a state enterprise,
handles the import of 90% of the nation's food and construction material
as well as all exports. EMPA's bulk or bagged imports of maize and ce-
ment are unloaded directly from ship to truck and transported to its own
stores adjacent to the new port area. Its other cargoes are treated as
general imports and transferred to the port's transit sheds. EMPA's
operations in the port area seem efficient.
3.17     The port works two *short shifts 0700 to 1300 and 1400 to 1900
hours, seven days a week. The port has 40 officials but employs no per-
manent labor. Shore labor and stevedores are hired on a daily basis and
are paid by the hour with no bonus for extra output. Considering the
lack of adequate equipment and fairly unorganized conditions, labor works
hard and outputs are relatively high achieving an average of 15 t per
gang-hour for general cargo.
Minor Ports
3.18     With the exception of Porto Novo on Santo Antao, which was built
in 1959 mainly to service the ferry boat to Porto Grande, all the minor
ports are in varying stages of decay. The situation seriously affects
ARCAVERDE's interisland services and improvements at some of the minor
ports are being considered under the Government's current development
plan (Table 5).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)   to ensure continued economic benefits from Praia port by
reconstructinLg its rapidly deteriorating deep-water berths
and providing it with necessary support facilities;
(b)   to increase the efficiency of port operations at Praia and
Porto Grande by providing modern cargo handling and work-
shop equipment as well as technical assistance, including
training;
(c)   to enhance the training possibilities of the maritime
sector by establishing a training center at Mindelo and
providing it with appropriate equipment and technical
assistance; and
(d)   to improve transport planning through a national transport
st tidy.



- 9 -
4.02     The project components have been prepared on the basis of de-
tailed analysis of existing facilities and operations and the immediate
future requirements. The new facilities and equipment will be suitable
for modern port operations and cargo handling techniques, and together
with the proposed training program, will increase cargo handling
productivity.
B. Project Description
4.03     The proposed project includes (Map IBRD 16746):
Part A:
(a)   reconstruction of 520 m deep water berth of concrete
blocks (210 m long and 9.5 m deep, and 310 m long and 7.5

4.06      During negotiations, the above cost estimate was discussed and
agreed upon with the Government.
4.07      Cost estimates for civil works and equipment reflect December
1982 prices and are based on international prices for similar works and
equipment as well as recently executed projects in West Africa. Customs
duties will be levied only cn imported cargo handling equipment.
Estimates for technical assistance are based on an average of US$10,000
per man-month. Physical contingencies are 10% on civil works and 5% on
equipment. Price contingencies are: (a) 12% annually on local
expenditure; and (b) 8%, 7.5%, 7%, 6% and 6% for 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986
and 1987 respectively on foreign expenditure.
D. Project Financing and Disbursement
4.08      Based on an agreement reached between the Governments of Cape
Verde and Portugal. in 1981, the latter will provide a contribution,
estimated at US$ 8.0 million equivalent, to cover 50% of the total cost
of Part A of the project (including corresponding supervision cost).
BADEA will finance US$2.0 million equivalent to cover 12.5% of the total
cost of Part A as well as the total cost of Part B, estimated at
US$8.0 million equivalent (including corresponding supervision cost but
excluding customs duties on cargo handling equipment). Norway will
finance 100% of the total cost of equipment and technical assistance for
part D, estimated at US$4.0 million equivalent. IDA's contribution of
US$7.2 million equivalent wtll cover 35% of the total cost of Part A as
well as the foreign exchange cost of Part C. ENAPOR will provide
US$1.2 million in local currency to cover (a) the remaining 2.5% of the
total cost of Parti A; (b) the local cost of technical assistance for
ENAPOR under Part C; and (c) customs duties on cargo handling
equipment. The Government will provide US$1.3 million equivalent to
cover the cost of the building for the training center (Part D) and the
local costs of the technical assistance to MTC under Part C.
4.09      The financing plan will be as follows:
US$ million equivalent
Government of
Cape Verde    ENAPOR   Portugal  BADEA    Norway   IDA   Total
Part A            --           0.5        8.0       2.0         --     5.5   16.0
Part B            --           0.6         --       8.0         --      --    8.6
Part C           0.1           0.1         --        --         --     1.7     1.9
Part D           1.2            --         --        --        4.0      --     5.2
Total          1.3          1.2         8.0      10.0       4.0      7.2   31.7
It is recommended that at the time of Credit signing, the Association
enter into an agreement with Portugal defining the arrangements for co-
financing, as well as the latter's commitments to the project. A draft
agreement has been reached between the Association and Portugal. It is
also recommended that as a condition of Credit effectiveness: (a) a



- 13 -
financing agreement between the Government of Cape Verde and BADEA; and
(b) a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ENAPOR shall
have become effective.
4.10     Disbursement of funds from the Credit will be on the following
basis:
(a)   35% of total expenditures for Part A (US$5.5 million
equivalent); and
(b)   100% of the foreign exchange costs for Part C (US$1.7
million equivalent).
Estimated schedule of Credit disbursement is given in Table 7. The
proposed project is the first Bank Group operation in Cape Verde.
Consequently historical disbursement data from previous operations in
this country does not exist. The proposed disbursement schedule differs
from the profile for West Africa's past port projects mainly because an
advance payment of 20% of civil works' cost will be paid to the con-
tractor upon contract signature. In addition the project is simple and
no unusual problems are expected, especially as regards soil condi-
tions. The 5-1/4 year period for credit disbursement compares reasonably
with the previously experienced periods in West Africa port projects of 6
years average.
E. Project Implementation
4.11     The project was prepared by qualified consultants financed by
two advances, totalling US$200,000, from the Project Preparation Facility
(para. 1.05). Consultants acceptable to the Association have prepared
tender documents, which have been reviewed by the Government, the
Association and other co-financiers. Tendering is scheduled for
March 1983.
4.12     The Ministry of Transport and Communications of Cape Verde is
responsible for project implementation, except for technical assistance
under Part C (f) of the project, for which ENAPOR will be the
implementing agency. An agreement was reached with the Government during
negotiations that all civil works construction and equipment procurement
will be supervised by independant consultants acceptable to the
Association, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.
4.13     An agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations
that the contract for Part A of the project will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's
Guidelines for Procurement. Cape Verde and Portugal will jointly sign
the contract, since Portugal considers it has a joint responsibility,
under the independence agreement, for the satisfactory completion of this
part of the project. Thus, only as regards this part of the project, the
consultants will report to a Project Management Unit consisting of
representatives from Cape Verde and Portugal, headed by a Cape Verdean



- 14 -
designated by Cape Verde. Contracts for Part B of the project will be
awarded in accordance with BADEA's procedures.
4.14     Construction is expected to start in late 1983 and be completed
by mid 1987. The critical path program for project implementation has
been discussed and agreed upon with the Government. Barring any unfore-
seen difficulty, project implementation schedule would be as shown in
Annex 5.
4.15     The Association will, help the Government prepare terms of refer-
ence for: (a) technical assistance and training as provided under Part C
of the project; and (b) supervision as provided under Parts A and B of
the project. Agreements were reached during negotiations that ENAPOR
will employ, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association:
(a) a management consultant by July 1, 1983; and (b) a port operations
expert and a workshop expert by January 1, 1984. Responsibilities of the
above experts and consultants are outlined in Section C of Annex 4.
F. Impact on Environment and Employment
4.16     No signif:Lcant environmental impact is expected in the city of
Praia or adjacent water areas as a result of the project since all pro-
posed improvements are confined to changes in existing facilities that
have operated in the same location for several years.
4.17     Some 300 skilled and unskilled labor will be required during the
implementation of i:he civil works. Training will improve skills and
enhance job satisfaction of about 400 shore-handling labor and stevedores
and of management, operating and accounting staff in the ports and in
ENAPOR's headquarters at Mindelo. No net decline in employment is
anticipated as a result of the project, since the increase in
productivity from replacing obsolete equipment is expected to be matched
by an increase in traffic by the time the project is completed.
V. TRAFFIC
A. Recent Trends
5.01     All foreign trade in general cargo (mostly imports) passes
through Porto Grande and Praia. These two ports handle over 80% of
interisland trade (Table 8). Traffic since 1976 at these two ports is
shown in Table 9 and summarized below. For the two ports combined, total
foreign trade has increased by approximately 7% per year since 1976.
Interisland traffic grew rapidly between 1976 and 1978, but declined
thereafter, mainly reflecting the fact that completion of the deep-water
port at Praia enabled that port to take more imports directly, instead of
transhipping through Porto Grande, and partly reflecting the fact that
the satellite islands are losing population to Sao Vicente and Santiago.

5.02     Looking at the two ports separately, direct imports at Praia,
which were growing rapidly even before completion of the new port in
1978, have continued to grow,.and Praia now accounts for 52% of the coun-
try's foreign sea trade, compared with 38% in 1976. Imports at Porto
Grande, on the other hand, have levelled off since the new port of Praia
came into operation. Exports at both ports are insignificant. Inter-
island cargo loaded at Porto Grande and unloaded at Praia has decreased
as direct imports to Praia increased. At the same time, Praia's
importance as a source of interisland cargo has increased (from 12,000
tons in 1978 to 18,000 tons in 1981). However, Porto Grande remains the
principal port for loading interisland cargo, partly because it has the
country's only flour mill, and also because of the greater population to
be served in its satellite islands (about 66,000 compared with about
42,000 for Praia's satellite islands).
B. Forecasts
5.03     The traffic forecasts are detailed in Tables 10 and 11, and
summarized below. Further details are available in the project file.
5.04     Praia international trade consists primarily of imports of food,
construction materials, consumer goods, and fuel. Imports of corn are



- 16 -
projected to grow from 22,000 t in 1980 to 27,500 t by 1981 while some
diversion from Porto Grande continues, and while the bulk storage silo
being constructed by the Dutch is being filled.  Thereafter, corn imports
are projected to grow more slowly, at 1% per year. Cement imports are
projected to grow al: 4% per year, which is the rate of growth in
construction as pro jected in the last Bank economic report.  Fuel and
other general cargo imports are projected to grow at 5% per year, about
the same as the projected growth in real GDP.

5.05     Exports from Praia have been negligible, averaging less than
2,000 tons per year.  However, territorial waters are rich in fishing
resources and a development program for the fishing industry is under-
way. BADEA, Abu-Dhabi Fund, and the Saudi Fund have agreed to finance
modernization and expansion of the fishing fleet, and construction of a
cold storage and ice making plant at Praia. In addition to promoting
indigenous fishing, the Government also proposes to exploit the potential
by allowing foreign boats (with some Cape Verdean manning) to fish in
territorial waters. As a result of these initiatives, it is expected
that 5,000 tons of fish will be landed at Praia by 1986, resulting in
exports of some 4,500 tons of frozen fish and fish products. Further
growth in the fish catch is envisaged as detailed in Table 10. Other
exports are expected to cont-Lnue to be negligible, at about 2,000 tons
per year.



- 17 -
5.06      Interisland cargo unloaded at Praia has diminished since Praia
started taking more imports directly in 1979. This diversion effect is
now largely complete, and interisland general cargo unloaded may now be
expected to grow slowly (2% per year from its 1981 figure of 15,100
tons). The growth would primarily reflect flour shipped from Cape
Verde's only mill at Mindelo. Interisland cargo loaded at Praia for
distribution to other islands is likely to grow somewhat slower than the
rate of growth of imports, as Santiago is expected to grow faster than
its satellite islands. A growth factor of 3% per year has been applied.
5.07      For the overall financial analysis of the port enterprise it is
necessary to project traffic at all other ports through 1986. These
projections are detailed in Table 11. Now that the diversion of imports
to Praia is largely complete, imports at Porto Grande are expected to
grow at an average annual rate of 4%. Exports from Porto Grande have
fluctuated considerably from 4,800 tons in 1979 to 13,787 tons in 1980
then back down to 3,567 tons in 1981. However, as at Praia, industrial
fishing at Porto Grande is being developed through modernization and
expansion of the fishing fleet, and participation of foreign vessels.
Cold storage and ice making facilities have recently been completed, with
assistance from the Netherlands. Industrial fishing is expected to
contribute 9,000 tons of exports by 1986. Other exports are likely to
remain at about 7,000 tons, the average for the past three years.
Interisland general cargo through Porto Grande is likely to grow
moderately, at 2% per year. Trade through the minor ports (all inter-
island) is correspondingly projected to grow at 2% per year.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Port of Praia
6.01      Prior to completion of the deep-water port late in 1978, Praia
was a lighterage port. Following the completion of the new port, light-
erage was gradually abandoned and by late 1980 all cargo ship calls were
alongside. As discussed in para. 3.13, because of inadequate design and
construction, the new deep-water berths are threatened with imminent
collapse, which would necessitate a return to lighterage.
Benefits
6.02      By reconstructing the deep-water berths, the proposed project
will provide the following benefits:
(a)   savings in the capital and operating costs of lighterage
facilities (the former lighterage facilities are decrepit
and would need to be replaced);
(b)   savings in ship time; and
(c)   reduced cargo losses.



- 18 -
The detailed estimation of these benefits is described in the following
paragraphs.
6.03     Avoided Lighterage Costs - Engineering judgement is that the
existing berths could collapse at any time. The economic analysis
assumes that, in the absence of the project, all cargo through the port
would revert to lighterage by 1987. Existing lighterage facilities in
the old port consist, of one decrepit and silted lighter wharf with two
mobile cranes including one nearly 40 years old. Of the old lighter
fleet only eight wirLd-powered barges remain but these are being sold to
other islands; in arLy event, they are uneconomic for lighterage opera-
tions on the scale envisaged. A new lighterage system would therefore
aeed to be established. The costs of such a system are detailed in Table
12.  These costs allow for the fact that cargo through Praia would be
less under lighterage operations, because Praia's satellite islands would
tend to be supplied from Porto Grande to avoid lighterage at Praia. The
additional costs of supplying these islands through Porto Grande rather
than Praia have not been taken into account. The estimates of lighterage
costs avoided do not include the costs of transferring cargo between
ships and barges, because this operation is similar to (though probably
more costly than) slhip to quay stevedoring operations which would occur
with the project.  By the same reasoning, cargo handling costs at the
lighterage berths (i.e., after cargo has been unloaded fron barges by the
cranes) have been ignored as these would also have their counterpart
under the project. The costs shown in Table 12 therefore represent only
those facilities and operations which would not be necessary with the
project.
6.04     Savings in Ship Time - Ships can discharge faster when berthing
alongside than when using lighters. This applies especially during
August to October in Cape Verde, when unfavorable sea conditions signifi-
cantly restrict lighterage operations. Details of estimated ship time
savings are presented in Table 13. All interisland cargo is carried in
Cape Verdean owned vessels, so all ship time savings on this trade accrue
to Cape Verde. About 30% of Cape Verde's foreign trade is carried in
national vessels. Furthermore, some of the ship time savings accruing in
the first instance to foreign owned vessels would be captured by Cape
Verde in the form of lower freight and charter rates, or through port
charges. To reflect this, it, is assumed that 50% of foreign trade ship
time savings will accrue to Cape Verde.
6.05     Reduced Cargo Damage - The project will reduce cargo damage by:
(a)   avoiding double-handling of cargo, as occurs with lighter-
age operations,
(b)   avoiding the transport of goods between the existing new
port, area and the lighterage berths,
(c)   providing stocage in the new port area, and



- 19 -
(d)   speeding up evacuation of cargo from the quay through the
provision of cargo handling equipment, technical assist-
ance and training.
It is not possible to estimate the extent of this reduction in cargo
damage with any precision, but a recent consultant's report for a similar
project in Guinea-Bissau X suggested that the reduced cargo losses could
be equivalent to 0.4% of the value of cargo which would otherwise be
lightered. At an average value of CVEsc 28,000 per ton, cargo damage
savings would amount to CVEsc 17 million in 1987, rising to CVEsc 34
million by 2006 (Table 14).
6.06     Benefits Not Quantified - The project is likely to generate
several additional benefits not reflected, or not reflected fully, in the
foregoing benefit streams. Vessels calling at Praia with the project may
be larger than without the project, because of superior stevedoring effi-
ciency. As cost per ton declines with increasing ship size, freight
rates between Cape Verde and overseas may thus be lower with the
project. Partly related to this, the project is likely to allow more
economical grain handling than would otherwise be the case. With the
project, grain will be discharged in bulk by grab cranes then by truck
along the quay to the silo. Without the project, bulk discharge from
vessels to barges will only be possible if vessels are equipped appro-
priately and it is therefore likely that some grain will be delivered
bagged, with the loss of economies in bulk transport and handling. To
the extent that bulk handling is still carried out with lighterage, addi-
tional quay cranes would be required compared with the project case,
where ships gear would be available at alongside berths. Finally, the 75
metre berth will accomodate fishing vessels.
Project Costs
6.07     Project costs for the economic evaluation comprise the initial
cost (including physical contingencies) of civil works, equipment, and
technical assistance, together withi replacement costs where required
during the analysis period. Equipment costs include the mobile crane
needed for stevedoring, but not the forklifts, tractors and trailers used
for cargo handling, which are the subject of separate analysis
(para. 6.09). Maintenance costs are also included, on the basis speci-
fied in the footnotes to Table 14, which also explain the derivation of
salvage value.
Rate of Return
6.08     Based on the benefit and cost streams shown in Table 14 (all
expressed in December 1982 prices), the project would yield a total rate
of return of 17%, and a return to Cape Verde of 14%. Benefits would have

June 1981.



- 20 -
to be 11% lower, or costs 12%. higher, before the rate of return to Cape
Verde would fall below 12%.
B. Cargo Handling Equipment
6.09     Much of the existing cargo handling equipment at Praia and Porto
Grande (Annex 3) will have reached the end of its economic life by
1986. By that date, some 140,000 tons suitable for handling by forklift
trucks, tractors and trailers will, in the absence of the project, have
to be handled manually. By providing the capacity to meet this shortfall
(including workshop equipmen-, spares and technical assistance), the
project will yield savings in cargo handling costs and in cargo damage.
In addition, the cranes to be provided at Porto Grande under the
project!/ will supplement ships gear principally on the larger foreign
trade vessels delivering cereals and cement, and enable several hatches
to be worked at once, thereby reducing ship service time. It is assumed
that 50% of these ship time savings would accrue to Cape Verde
(para. 6.04). The quantified benefits for equipment would yield a total
rate of return of 18% and a return to Cape Verde of 15% (Table 15). In
addition, there are several important non-quantified benefits: the new
cranes will permit more efficient handling of occasional heavy loads and
would also be available for non-cargo handling work (construction and
repairs).
C. Overall Rate of Return
6.10     The overall rate of return on the infrastructure, equipment and
technical assistance components, which together account for about 80% of
total project costs, is 17%; the return to Cape Verde is 14%. Benefits
would have to be 10% lower, or costs 11% higher, before the rate of
return to Cape Verde would fall below 12%.
VII. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past and Present Financial Position
7.01     JAP/ENAPGR's present financial situation is described in Tables
16 and 17. These figures need to be considered cautiously, in view of
the limited reliability of available data.  JAP/ENAPOR's income statement
fo FY1980 is almost balanced. This satisfactory result is conLirmed by
the high level of cash generated from operations (27% of revenue), suffi-
cient at present to cover non-working expenses. The main issue is with
tariff: although its average level is sufficient to cover present oper-
ating expenditures, its structure does not reflect service costs, (over-
1/ The costs and benefits of the mobile crane to be provided at Praia
have been incorporated in the previous analysis (para. 6.07).



- 21 -
charging merchandise and undercharging ships and rental services);
improvements will be needed in this respect, when actual service cost
will be known with a reasonable accuracy (para. 7.04).
7.02     The financial structure of JAP/ENAPOR is conservative and
sound. It displays a large borrowing capacity, with a good repayment
capacity (cash generation amounts to CVEsc. 20.5 million, and total debt
service less than CVEsc. 1 million) and a low level of indebtedness (with
a low 10/90 debt/equity ratio, Table 16). Its working capital is posi-
tive and sufficient for the present time, and its liquidity and cash
situation favorable (7 months of revenue). Hence, JAP/ENAPOR, as of
December 31, 1980, displayed a satisfactory financial situation.
7.03     The opening balance sheet is given in Table 16.  Until 1981,
JAP/ENAPOR's financial accounts were on a cash basis (Table 17);
depreciation on fixed assets was not taken into account and tariffs were
therefore not based on total cost. Each year, except FY1978, shows an
increase in cash surplus from operations, up to CVEsc 30.8 million in
FY1981. Capital expenses amounted to CVEsc. 11.2 million for the same
year, leaving a sizeable net cash surplus of CVEsc. 19.6 million. Every
port, including the small cabotage ports, normally earned cash surpluses,
which were derived almost exclusively from profits on stevedoring.
B. Tariff and Costing Systems
7.04     The present tariff is low by West African standards, but charges
users for the full range of facilities and services provided by the
ports. In the absence of cost accounting and fixed asset valuations, the
charges were based on direct cash outlays related to each service.
Therefore, the present tariffs undercharge capital intensive services,
such as the utilization of the principal facility by ships. JAP/ENAPOR's
tariffs were not revised between 1975 and 1982. However, a 65% increase
has been introduced in April 1982, which will generate sufficient revenue
to cover all costs, including estimated depreciation, prior to the
reconstruction of the Praia port. The average tariff per ton of merchan-
dise, including cargo handling charges, is about US$8 per ton as of June
30, 1982, as compared to US$15 in Conakry, US$12 in Bissau, and US$12 in
Cotonou. This is due (i) to the low level of staffing in JAP/ENAPOR
(about 700), as compared to total tonnage handled (about 350,000 t); and
(ii) to low non-working expenditures, resulting from present low
indebtness and value of fixed assets (excluding Praia port
infrastructure), as summarized by the high .72 working ratio for FY
1980. This situation is temporary, and is bound to change considerably,
after the rehabilitation of Praia port (para. 7.15). The Government has
agreed that cost-based tariffs will be introduced, requiring a cost
accounting system that takes into consideration the cost of service
provided to users, to be implemented from FY1984 onward. Reliable data
from the costing system will be available for calculating cost-based
tariffs by FY1987, and therefore such tariffs should be introduced by
December 31, 1987 for Praia Port and Porto Grande. Meanwhile, tariff



- 22 -
revisions should be based on t:entative cost including estimated
depreciation on infrastructure and equipment (paras. 7.15 and 7.16).
C. Capitalization of the Port Enterprise
Fixed Assets
7.05     A balance sheet as oE December 31, 1980 (para. 3.04) has been
prepared (Table 16), where fixed assets are included at 1980 prices, by
revaluing assets through a price index, provided by the Bank of Cape
Verde. This balance sheet is summarized below.
JAP/ENAPOR Balance Sheet, December 31, 1980

Assets
Net fixed assets in use

Debt
7.06     As past capital investment was financed almost exclusively by
grants, outstanding long terrn debt is still low.  It amounts to CVEsc
38.8 million of aid from the Netherlands, to be repaid by the ENAPOR over
five years, with nco interest.
Working Capital ancl Liquidity
7.07     JAP/ENAPOR's net working capital is high by normal standards: it
amounts to CVEsc 66 million, or 11 months of revenue as compared to
CVEsc. 5.2 million of short-term liabilities.
7.08     Its liquidity is abandant, amounting to CVEsc. 51.5 million
(7 months of revenue). This high level of liquidity is confirmed by the
11.3 quick ratio.



- 23 -
D. Financial Forecasts
7.09     Although the project is a reconstruction rather than extension
of existing infrastructure, it involves a considerable (five-fold)
increase in ENAPOR's fixed assets, partly because the existing facility
at Praia is not complete and therefore is not yet included in ENAPOR's
assets. Hence, the targets for ENAPOR's financial policy should be to
achieve a financial situation under which ENAPOR would have (i) a
balanced income statement; (ii) an acceptable liquidity situation; and
(iii) subsidiarily, a positive and increasing financial rate of return.
7.10     The financial projections (Tables 18 to 21) indicate that the
above targets can be achieved, with substantial, but acceptable tariff
adjustments (para. 7.15), and appropriate investment and financing
policies (paras 7.18 to 7.20).
Tariff Adjustments
7.11     Substantial tariff increases will be needed between FY1983 and
FY1986, in order to generate sufficient revenue to cover increasing
working expenses, rising depreciation (after completion of the
rehabilitation), and financial charges.
7.12     The FY1980 level of working expenses (CVEsc 53.5 million) is
acceptable, due to the absence of overstaffing and to low general
expenses. They are expected to increase in line with traffic and prices,
by about 13% per annum from FY1980 to FY1990 (Table 19), reaching CVEsc.
118 million FY1986, and CVEsc 186 million in FY1990.
7.13     Annual depreciation will increase considerably from CVEsc.
23.3 million in FY1980 to CVEsc 99.9 million in FY1986, when the project
is completed, because of the large capital investment involved (about
CVEsc. 1.8 billion). This large increase will arise despite the increase
in the average duration of depreciation, from 22.6 years in FY1980 to
24.4 years in FY1986, resulting from the predominance of infrastructure
in ENAPOR's capital investment program (89% of the total).
7.14     Interest on the debt, under the financial mix described in
para. 7.19, will increase from close to zero in FY1980, to
CVEsc. 72.4 million after completion of the project, in FY1986. The
average rate of interest on outstanding long-term debt will increase from
zero in FY1981 to only 5.9% in FY1986.
7.15     In order to cover by FY1986 working expenses, for CVEsc. 117.2
million, annual depreciation for CVEsc. 99.9, and interest on the debt
for CVEsc. 72.4 million, revenues should amount to at least
CVEsc. 289.5 million. This will require that average tariff be raised by
66% on top of local inflation between FY1983 and FY1986 (173% in nominal
terms including an average 12.5% local annual inflation factor (Table
18)). The likely timing of tariff adjustments, is follows: 32% in
FY1983; 36% in FY1984; 29% in FY1985 and 18% in FY1986. These
adjustments would raise the average tariff per ton, including cargo



- 24 -
handling charges, from about US$8 in 1982 to about US$13 per ton at 1982
prices in 1986. This level is reasonable in relation to other West
African ports. The Government was informed during negotiations of the
amount and timing of envisaged tariff increases. The corresponding
working ratio should decline from .64 in FY1982 to .47 in FY1984, and .40
for FY1986.  Agreement was reached during negotiations to include in
ENAPOR's financial targets a working ratio of .55 for FY1984, and of .45
for FY1986 and thereafter.
7.16     The tariff structure will be amended, based on service cost, so
that revenues from ships reflect depreciation of the corresponding fixed
assets (para. 7.01). In FY1980, these revenues represented only 6% of
JAP/ENAPOR revenue; under proposed tariff increases (Table 18), they
would represent about 19% of t:he total in FY1986. Rentals should also be
raised substantially to incorporate the depreciation on equipment,
following the results produced by the cost accounting system, to be
financed under the proposed project (Annex 4, para. C(d)).
7.17     The following table summarizes the financial forecasts, which
are detailed in Tables 18 to 21.

Capital Investment and Financing Plan
7.18     ENAPOR's future capital investment for the FY1982-1986 period,
comprises mainly the items included in the proposed project, amounting
approximately to CVEsc. 1.8 billion at current prices. From FY1986
onward, capital investment needs have been estimated, subject to economic
justifications. They include mainly investment in secondary ports and in
Mindelo, for a total of approximately CVEsc. 651 million for the FY1987-
1990 period. These estimates are consistent with the envisaged sector
investment included in the national plan.
7.19     The corresponding financing plan for the FY1983-1986 period is
based on the breakdown of para. 4.09. ENAPOR would contribute only 3%,
the remaining 97% being financed under the following terms:
(a)   $6.3 million of IDA funds should be on lent at 11% payable
on amounts disbursed during construction, over 25 years
with 7 years grace period, starting from credit signature;
(b)   BADEA funds are expected to be onlent at 5% over 20 years
with 5 years grace period; and
(c)   Portuguese contribution would be transfered to ENAPOR as
equity.
The above terms of IDA onlend-Lng conditions were agreed upon during
negotiations.
7.20     As capital investmeni: for the FY1986-1990 period would include
smaller components ior which :Lt is likely to be more difficult to raise
foreign funds, it is assumed that ENAPOR's contribution during this
period would increase to about: 50%. The remaining 50% is assumed to be
supplied by concessionary funds at 6% average interest rate over 20
years.
7.21     Under these financing conditions, ENAPOR's self-financing capa-
city for the FY1982--1988 period will be as follows:
ENAPOR Financing Capacity, FY1982-1988
('000 Escudos)
1982        1984         1986         1988

Self-financing capacity    20,766        71,355      110,668       74,720



- 27 -
This high self-financing capacity will permit ENAPOR to raise
progressively its percentage contribution to its capital investment from
3% in FY1984 to about 50% in FY1988 and FY1990. This would keep the
debt/equity ratio increase within reasonable limits; it would still
increase from 8/92 in FY 1982 to 43/57 in FY1984, and 54/46 in FY1988. A
55/45 target debt/equity ratio was agreed upon during negotiations.
ENAPOR also agreed during negotiations to consult annually with the
Association on ENAPOR's investment and financing three-year revolving
plan.
Rate of Return
7.22     The financial rate of return on fixed assets was negative in
FY1981. The proposed investment plan and tariff increase would produce a
positive rate from FY1982 onward. After a period of decline due to the
rapid increase of fixed assets during construction period, it will stabi-
lize at 4% in FY1986 and increase thereafter up to 6% by FY1988.
Cash situation
7.23     Despite the high self-financing rate to be achieved from FY1986
onward, ENAPOR will continue to have sizeable liquidities, as indicated
below:
ENAPOR's Liquidity Situation, FY1982-1988
('000 Escudos)
1982        1984          1986        1988
Self-financing capacity         20,766      71,355      110,668       74,720

capital investment               --       (12,919)   (35,869)    (82,319)
Increase in available
liquidities                   20,766      58,436       74,799       (7,599)

end of year                   78,517    173,763       327,211      329,417
The cash level sufficient for unconstrained port operation can be
estimated as 4 months of revenue, or CVEsc. 64.1 million in FY1984,
CVEsc. 101.1 million in FY1986 and CVEsc. 129.8 million in FY1988. It
was agreed with the Government during negotiations that during
implementation of the project the excess of cash available above the five
months of operational revenue plus liquidities as needed for financing
ENAPOR's contribution for the following year to its five-year investment
plan as agreed upon with the Association (para. 7.21) will be deposited
by ENAPOR into a bank account to be maintained jointly by ENAPOR and the
Government, at the Bank of Cape Verde.

E. Insurance
7.24     Apart from accident insurance for the stevedores and social
security insurance for permanent staff, JAP/ENAPOR carries no insur-
ance. Nevertheless, there is lack of uniformity among ports in general
as to the type and extent of insurance coverage they carry. It is there-
fore recommended that during negotiations ENAPOR undertake to:
(a)   submit to the Association no later than September 30, 1983
a proposal regarding ENAPOR's insurance coverage; and
(b)   inslare, starting FY1984, to the Association's
satisfaction, against such risks and in such amounts as
shall be consistent with sound port and business
practices.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
will:
(a)   appoint consultants acceptable to the Association on terms
of reference satisfactory to the Association to carry out
studies and provide technical assistance to MTC (para.
2.07);
(b)   appoint independent consultants acceptable to the
Association, on terms of reference satisfactory to the
Association, to supervise all civil work construction and
equipment prccurement (para. 4.12); and
(c)   onlend $6.3 million of the IDA credit to ENAPOR at an
annual interest rate of 11% payable during construction
over 25 years with 7 years grace period (para. 7.19).
8.02     Agreement was reached during negotiations that ENAPOR will:
(a)   keep its accounts according to standard commercial
accounting practices from FY1983 onward (para. 3.05);
(b)   appoint external auditors, satisfactory to the
Association, to audit the financial books and accounts of
ENAPOR commencing with FY1983 (para. 3.06);
(c)   appoint, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association: (i) a management consultant by July 1, 1983;
and (b) a port operations expert and a workshop expert by
January 1, 1984 (para. 4.15);
(d)   take into consideration the cost of service provided to
users, as ca-Lculated through cost accounting, for amending



- 29 -
the tariff structure for Praia Port and Porto Grande, by
December 31, 1987 (paras. 7.04, and 7.16);
(e)   accept the target working ratio of .55 by FY1984, and .45
by FY1986, in order to balance ENAPOR's income statement
(para. 7.15);
(f)   limit its borrowing, except with the Association's
agreement, so as not to exceed a debt/equity ratio of
55/45 (para. 7.21);
(g)   consult annually with the Association on ENAPOR's
investment and financing three-year revolving plan
(para. 7.21);
(h)   deposit in a bank account maintained jointly with the
Government the excess of cash available above the five
months of operational revenue plus liquidities as needed
for financing its contribution for the following year to
its five-year investment plan as agreed with the
Association (para. 7.23); and
(i)   submit to the Association by September 30, 1983 a proposal
as to the type of insurance coverage appropriate for
ENAPOR and shall subscribe such insurance to the
Association's satisfaction starting FY1984 (para. 7.24).
8.03     Confirmation was obtained from the Government during nego-
tiations that:
(a)   the project is exempted of taxes except for customs duties
on cargo handling equipment (paras. 4.05 and 4.07);
(b)   it is in agreement with the cost estimate (para. 4.06) and
the project implementation schedule (para. 4.14);
(c)   the contract for Part A of the project will be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Association's Guidelines for Procurement
(para. 4.13); and
(d)   the amount of the aid from the Netherlands for the provi-
sion of a transit shed and cargo-handling equipment is
treated as a loan to JAP to be repaid by ENAPOR over five
years with no interest (para. 7.10).
8.04     The Association should enter into a cofinancing agreement with
Portugal no later than the date of Credit signing. It should be a condi-
tion of Credit effectiveness that (a) a financing agreement between the
Government of Cape Verde and BADEA shall have become effective, and (b) a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ENAPOR shall have
become effective (para. 4.09).



- 30 -
8.05     The proposed project is suitable for a credit of US$7.2 million
equivalent to the Government of Cape Verde on standard IDA terms.

CAPE VERDE
PRAIA PORT PROJECT
Existing Port Facilities
A. Porto Grande (Mindelo)
Location
1.       Porto Grande is located on the northwest part of the island of
Sao Vincente within a large bay having a generally calm sea rendering it
usable throughout the year. At the back of the bay lies the city of
Mindelo.
2.       Because of its stategic position astride the sea lanes linking
Europe with Asia and America, the bay of Porto Grande is frequented by
numerous transatlantic vessels, which reprovision there while carrying on
commercial operations. The lighthouse at the entrance to the harbor is
equipped with long-range signalling devices to provide bearings to
arriving ships and ships changing course.
Port Facilities
3.       The port has 42,000 m2 of open storage areas and is served by
several deep-water berths totalling 1,160 m long with depths ranging
between 6.5 m and 12.0 m as well as by shallow-draft berths totalling 375
m long with depths ranging between 3.5 m and 5.5 m.
4.       Available equipment includes: three mobile cranes (up to 12 tons
capacity), five tractors, twenty trailers and six forklifts.
5.       The following main buildings and structures are available within
the port area:
(a)   Three warehouses each with 1,400 m2 of covered area;
(b)   One warehouse for goods in transit with 530m2 of covered
area;
(c)   One shed for cargo handling equipment with 136 m2 of
covered area;
(d)   One machine shop with 4,200 m2 of covered and open areas;
(e)   One 20-t weighbridge;
(f)   One two-story building for port administration, custons
office and border police with a total covered area of
990 m22;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
- 36-
(g)   One building for a woodworking shop, spare parts warehouse
and medical station with a covered area of 400 m2; and
(h)   One mess hall for stevedores with 180 m2 of covered area.
6.       The port facilities are built of walls of solid concrete blocks
on submerged rock-fill foundations. The entire port area is provided
with adequate lighting and the berths are provided with water mains and
fuel-oil supply stations. The area destined for fishing operations is
presently being enlarged and will be completely separated from the
commercial area.
B. Praia Port
Location
7.       The city of Praia is located at the southeast corner of Santiago
Island. The new port, completed in 1978, is adjacent to the town in a
small bay open to the southeast.
8.       The old port facilities consisted of a small pier; vessels were
discharged by lighters.
9.       Studies for the new port started in 1960 by the Portuguese
Ministry of Overseas.  The National Hydraulic Laboratory of Portugal
(LNEC) prepared broad outlines for the concept of a small port and
tenders on a design and conscruct basis were invited.  A contract was
negotiated with a portuguese contractor (Construcao Tecnica Ltda.) using
their tender as a basis. Thes tender included construction of a 210 m
long breadwater arm with deep-water berths on its west side and a further
150 m berth along a partially reclaimed shoreline. Work commenced in
1973 before independence and continued through independence, after which
it was decided by the new Government, as "phase 2," to extend the 150 m
berth by a further 160 m and to build two large transit sheds and an
access road. The marine works were completed in 1977/78, the transit
sheds have since been completed, however, the construction of the access
road has not yet been completed. The work known as "phase 2" was
financed by Cape Verde.
10.      The structure of the berths appears to have been grossly
underdesigned. They started to show signs of deterioration even before
construction completion, mainly due to inadequate thickness of concrete
and insufficient reinforcement. At present, the maximum life of the
berths is estimated at three to five years. Several studies have been
carried out since early 1979 to assess the degree of deterioration of the
existing 520 m deep-water berths and provide for a solution, at the
lowest cost possible, to keep these facilities operational. Portuguese
engineering consultants (Castanho, Reis de Carvalho and Vera Cruz),
retained by the Portuguese Government in September 1980, assessed the
berths to be beyond any possible repair and recommended to build
completely new concrete block berths in front of the existing ones and



ANNEX 3
Page 3
- 37 -
construct a small breakwater. Their recommendations have been adopted as
basis for the proposed project.
11.      The port's cargo handling equipment consists of: (a) four
forklifts, 3 to 5 t capacity; (b) three tractors and eight trailors, 3 to
5 t capacity; (c) one 15 t mobile crane (a recent Dutch grant); (d) two
old 3 t mobile cranes (employed mainly outside the port area); and (e)
twenty wooden pallets.

CAPE VERDE
PRAIA PORT PROJECT
Project Description
A.  Main Civil Works
(a)   Reconstruction of the 210 m long deep-water berth with an
alongside depth of 9.5 m at MLW, by building a quay wall
of concrete gravity blocks in front of the existing
caissons. The 30 ton blocks will be precast at a site
some 200 m away from the berth, hauled on special low-bed
trailers and placed one by one on a layer of crushed stone
serving as foundation.  The design is such that the quay
wall, can be constructed in sections of about 100 m long
which could bt used immediately upon completion for
berthing vessels, independent of the other sections.
However, 30 to 50% of the existing berthing facility will
be unoperationial during the four years construction
period. Work will start by the construction of the 75 m
marginal shallow-draft berth (para. B(f)) to serve as a
stand-by berth for small vessels during deep-water berths
construction.
(b)   Reconstructiona of the 310 m long deep-water berth with an
alongside depth 7.5 m at MLW. The construction is similar
to (a) above.
(c)   Strengthening of the existing outside protection to the
210 m deep-water berth by placing heavy armor stones and
concrete bloc'ks (up to 12 t) along the sea side (350 m
long). The existing non protected vertical wall
breakwater was a wrong design from the outset. The lack
of armor stone protection caused the initial difficulties
during the placing of the caissons, and later their
further damage (para. 10 of Annex 3) due to permanent
exposure to wave action. The proposed armor layer will
prevent additional damage to the sea side of the caissons
thus providing a safe backfill and support to the new
210 m long quay wall.
(d)   Extending the above rehabilitated protection by providing
a 40 m round head breakwater to insure adequate protection
to the southern end of the 210 m berth against wave
action.



- 39 -                        ANNEX 4
Page 2
B. Supporting Facilities, Marginal Berth and Equipment
(a)   Construction of a 1500 m2 warehouse to serve as long-term
storage for cargoes not cleared from the transit sheds.
(b)   Construction of the access road (3 km long) linking the
port to the city, including improvement of an existing
bridge.
(c)   Paving of about 10,000 m2 of open storage areas with
cobblestone.
(d)   Construction of an administration building for the port
enterprise, customs and police.
(e)   Construction of customs fence, installation of water and
lighting systems and building of open and covered workshop
areas for maintenance of the port cargo handling
equipment.
(f)   Construction of a small marginal wharf (75 m long) with a
varying alongside depth of 7.0 to 5.0 m at MLW to serve
mainly as working wharf for fishing trawlers and
interisland vessels. The construction system is similar
to that of the main wharves (para. A(a)).
(g)   For Praia Port: Six forklift trucks 2.5 t capacity, one
forklift truck 12 t capacity with container attachment,
six tractors 40 t pull, ten trailers 2 to 4 t capacity,
three mobile cranes (one 15 t and two 5 t capacity), one
generator 400 KVA; one 30 t weighbridge, 1,000 standard
pallets, spare parts for cargo handling equipment, and
workshop equipment. Note: one 5 t crane, one tractor and
two trailers will be used in each of the ports of Maio and
Bravo.
(h)   For Porto Grande: Four forklift trucks 2.5 t capacity; one
forklift truck 25 t capacity (for containers), four
tractors 40 t pull, one mobile crane 15 t capacity, one
mobile crane 5 t capacity, 1,000 standard pallets, spare
parts for cargo handling equipment, and workshop
equipment.
C. Consulting Services and Technical Assistance

D. Maritime Training Center at Mindelo
A comprehensive study to assess the justification for upgrading
the existing Coastal Navigation School (under the Director of Marine and
Ports to a Maritime Training Center) has been carried out by specialized
consultant in April 1980. The study was financed by the Association.



- 41 -                       ANNEX 4
Page 4
The study concluded that:
(a)   Cape Verde's geographic and economic particularities have
made its people take to the sea to an extent which is
unique in Africa, and helped to give Cape Verdeans a
reputation throughout the Atlantic region for being
maritime-minded and for making good sailors. Large
fishermen's and seamen's settlements in the U.S.A. and
elsewhere emanate from Cape Verde. Over 11,000 Cape
Verdeans are registered seamen, most of them employed in
the merchant fleets of other nations. An unknown number
of these seamen studied at maritime schools overseas and
became officers of foreign merchant marines. Cape Verdean
officers are found in coastal freighters in Angola and
Brazil as well as in ocean-going ships from Norway, the
Netherlands, and Portugal.
(b)   In spite of a strong maritime tradition, Cape Verde almost
totally lacks formally trained personnel to man its
merchant and fishing fleets. Some personnel categories
cannot practically be trained in Cape Verde at this stage,
but for others, such as deck and engineer officers and
crew for coastal and fishing vessels and radio maintenance
technicians, good local training facilities are
justified. Such facilities can best be provided by the
re-establishment of the existing Coastal Navigation School
on a new site essentially as envisaged by the
Government 1/
(c)   Approximate but conservative estimates of maritime
manpower requirements of Cape Verde indicate a need for a
Center capable of accomodating as many as 200 students,
while initial plans by the Government envisage a capacity
for 100 students. Preliminary studies of accomodation
requirements indicate an overall cost for training
equipment of about $1.10 million for 100 student places
(including boarding facilities for 30 students), and only
about $0.18 million more, if student capacity is increased
to 200. In view of the uncertainties involved in manpower
forecasts, and practical and staffing problems, it is
proposed that the center be planned for a capacity of 200
1/ Originally a site was chosen to construct a new training center. The
cost of the new building was estimated at US$1.5 million equivalent.
However, the Government allocated in 1981 an existing building
(previously used as a military training school) to be occupied by the new
Maritime Training Center. This is a wise decision. A local contractor
is now rehabilitating this building to render it suitable for the Center
at a cost of about US$100,000 equivalent.

students (with boarding facilities for 30), but operated
in the initial phase at an enrollment of about 100.
(d)   In a small cou.ntry as dependent on maritime activities as
Cape Verde, it. is difficult to adequately define all
necessary personnel categories and related areas of
training. However, reasonable quantitative estimates can
be made of the needs for some major groups, providing an
indication of the order of magnitude of overall needs.
(e)   For seagoing personnel of the existing merchant fleet
under Cape Verde's flag, the study indicates an immediate
need. for aboult 90 certified masters and mates, 50 ship's
engineers, 200) trained seamen (deck) and 50 engineer
ratings. For the fishing fleet which is still embryonic,
but afforded high priority by the Government, the needs
over "the next five years" are estimated at a number
similar to those for the merchant fleet, including 72
skippers/masters/mates and 24 engineers (counted as
1i1.   manning positions).
(f)   For other per3onnel in the maritime field, no estimates
exist. These include harbour pilots (about five appear to
be needed at this stage), port and shipping
adm:inistrators, cargo handling supervisors, shipping
agents, etc. Such staff is likely to be recruited in the
long perspective, from experienced seagoing personnel.
This will contribute to high turnover of maritime
personnel. The annual turnover of ship's engineers can be
expected to be high, due to losses also to other sectors
of Cape Verde's economy. The same expectation is valid
for radio and electronics maintenance technicians.
(g)   Based on general observation and manpower requirements as
summarized in para. (d) to (f), the following courses are
proposed for the initial stage of operation of a new
Maritime Training Center:
(i) Coastal navigation officer/fishing skipper
(2 years);
(ii) Coastal/fishing vessel engineer officer (2 years);
(iii) Deck rating (able seaman) (1 year);
(iv)  Engineering rating (mechanic) (1 year); and
(v) Radic, maintenance technician (3 years).
All the above courses are envisaged as sandwich-type
courses with periods at the Center alternating with
practice on board commercially operating vessels.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.       It has been assumed that implementation of the project will
commence early in 1983 and will be completed by the end of 1986. The
first full year of operations will therefore be 1987. The methodology
used in preparing these forecasts is as follows:
(a)   all financial figures are in current prices.  Project
physical contingencies have been taken into account.
Price contingencies have been taken into account, at an
average 12.5% annual rate for local prices, and 7.4%
annual rate for international prices. The 5% difference
was accounted for as annual devaluation of the Escudo vis-
a-vis international hard currencies.
(b)   tariff rates for principal traffic items were established
to provide the revenues to cover the operating costs as
projected under (c) and financial charges resulting from
(f);
(c)   staff, fuel, and supplies costs were projected taking into
consideration traffic forecasts (as in the economic analy-
sis) in tonnage and in number of ships. Salary increases
include a 4% below national inflation cost of living
adjustment, and an average merit/seniority increase of 3%
per annum. Fuel and supplies prices were projected in
line with inrternational prices, as were general expenses;
(d)   annual depreciation was calculated on historical acquisi-
tion cost, over 30 years for infrastructure and buildings
and 10 years for equipment; and
(e)   $6.3 million of the proposed IDA credit should be onlent
tc ENAPOR on approximate current Bank terms, assumed to be
11% annual interest for 25 years, including seven years of
grace. This rate is above the current rate of domestic
concessionary loans to the public sector, which is about
9%. Credit and banking being under the control of the
Government, there is no market rate on commercial loans.
2.       For the purpose of this evaluation it is assumed that BADEA's
loan terms will be 5% annual interest for 20 years, including five years
grace, and that the loan wiLll be on lent on the same terms.
3.       It is assumed that financing provided by Portugal will be
treated as equity capital.
4.       The resulting financial projections are detailed in
Tables 20-23.

1/ Derived from A&P Appledore Ltd. Representative Ship Costs, August 1980.
2/ For lighterage (without project) assumes waiting time equivalent to 5%
of service time. Analysis of berth utilization with project suggests
there would be no waiting time until year 2002; waiting time included in
project case from this year.
3/ Traffic with the project is as shown in Table 10, less fish catch
landed. There is less interisland traffic without the project because if
Praia returns to lighterage its satellite islands would be supplied
largely through Porto Grande.

1/   Includes capital cost of equipment and spares, plus 5% plhysical contingencies, subsequent maintenance
cost of 8% per year, and cost of workshop equipment.  Cost of mobile crane at kraia kana corresponding
benefits excluded as these are incorporated in evaluation of infrastructure component (Table 14).
2/   Operating costs of forklifts, tractors  and trailers estimated at CVEsc 300 per hour with a throughput
of CVEsc 10 tons per hour, thus CVEsc 30 per ton.  In absence of project, cargo would be handled manually,
at CVEsc 110 per ton.  Cargo handling savings are CVEsc 110 - 30 = 80 per ton.  Prompt removal of cargo from
quayside will reduce damage and spoilage, equivalent to 0.3% of cargo handled, average value of which is
CVEsc 36,000 per ton, producing additional savings of CVEsc 110 per ton.  Average value of cargo is higher                      m
in this calculation than in Table 14  because latter relates to cargo including corn, which has a relatively
low valiue per ton.
3/   It is estimated that the additional cranes will produce a 30% increase in productivity (throughput per hour)
yielding slip time savings equivalent to CVEsc 210 per ton.  Operating costs of CVEsc go per ton need to be
deducted leaving net benefits of CVEsc 120 per ton.
4/   Assumes Cape Verde captures 50% of ship time savings.
