Project
Description:        The project would reconstruct and improve the port infra-
structure and operations at Praia, and assist in transport
planning. The major project components are: (a) civil
works, including rehabilitation and reinforcement of the
deep water berth at Praia Plort, construction of support
facilities, and construction of a small berth for fishing
and interisland vessels; (b) cargo handling and workshop
equipment for Praia Port and Porto Grande; (c) equipment
and technical assistance for the maritime training center
at Mindelo; and (d) technical assistance to (i) improve
port operations and managenent, and (ii) help the MTC
define sector policies and objectives, identify investment
priorities, strengthen transport institutions, and prepare
high priority projects in ,he sector.
Project Benefits
and Risks:          The major economic benefits of the proposed project would
be savings in the capital and operating costs of lighterage
facilities, savings in ship-waiting time, and reduced cargo
losses. The project would also yield savings in cargo
handling costs and reduction in cargo damage, through the
replacement of obsolete cargo handling equipment at Praia
and Porto Grande. Unquantified project benefits include
lower freight rates between Cape Verde and overseas by
allowing for larger size vessels to call at Praia, and more

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF 'HE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE FOR
THE PRAIA PORT PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Devel-
opment Credit to the Republic of Cape Verde for SDR 6.7 million (US$7.2 mil-
lion equivalent) to help finance the Praia Port Project. The Credit would be
on standard IDA terms. Of the Credit proceeds, SDR 5.9 million (US$6.3 million
equivalent) would be onlent to the Empresa de Administragao dos Portos
(ENAPOR) for 25 years, including 7 years of grace, at 11.0 percent per year.
Additional financing for the project would be provided by a loan from the Arab
Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADIHA) in the amount of US$10.0 mil-
lion equivalent, a grant from the Republic of Portugal in the amount of US$8.0
million equivalent, and a grant from the Kingdom of Norway in the amount of
US$4.0 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECCINOMY
2.       The latest economic report on Cape Verde (2730-CV), dated May 15,
1980, was circulated to the Executive Directcrs on July 16, 1980. Its conclu-
sions, as well as the findings of subsequent missions, are reflected in the
following assessment of the state of the economy and its prospects. Country
data appear in Annex I.
Background
3.       The Republic of Cape Verde consists of ten islands and five islets
within an area of 4,000 square kilometers located in the Atlantic Ocean about
450 kilometers from the coast of Senegal. Of the estimated 300,000 inhabit-
ants, 50% are on Santiago Island, mainly in Praia, the political and adminis-
trative capital (55,300), and another 14% on Sao Vicente Island, site of the
economic capital, Mindelo (33,200).
4.       The main problems of development facing Cape Verde are:
- high external transport costs due to its remote location;
- lack of scale economies in infrastructure because of the wide
dispersion of the population;
- a weak agriculture base resulting from low and unreliable rainfall
and rugged topography;
- a limited natural resource base;
- a small, low income population with inadequate training and
education.



-2-
5.       The country has historically been plagued by periodic droughts and
famine which explain the exceptional rate of out-migration. The current
drought, which began in 1967, contributed to the pressures to migrate, parti-
cularly to the U.S. where over 300,000 Cape Verdeans now live.
6.       Known mineral resources are mainly salt and pozzolana (a volcanic
rock used as an additive in the manufacture of hydraulic cement). Fish is the
only relatively abundant natural resource. With a fragile productive base,
international shipping and transit trade remains of paramount importance to
the economy. Real growth in GDP averaged 4% between 1977 and 1981 due to
growth in shipping, as a result of policies to increase agriculture output,
and because of expanded construction activities. Cape Verde remains one of
the poorest countries with a per capita GDP of $200 in 1981. Large emigrant
remittances raise GNP per capita to $300. Some 40% of the population is below
the poverty line. Offsetting the constraints to development has been the
country's success in mobilizing large amounts of foreign, mainly grant, aid.
Between 1978 and 1981 foreign aid amounted to 45% of GDP and financed most of
the public investment program. This, together with emigrant remittances,
enabled the country to deploy resources twice as large as the GDP.
Development Strategy
7.       The success of the Government in attracting such an impressive flow
of foreign resources may be ascribed in part to the political stability which
has prevailed since independence in 1975, and to the commitment and pragmatism
it has demonstrated to try to cope with its most urgent problems and to lay
the foundation for future growth. In the years immediately following Indepen-
dence, the Government's overriding concern was to alleviate hunger and unem-
ployment, which it did with considerable success through two Emergency Pro-
grams, 1976/77 and 1977/78. These programs were financed through the sale of
food aid, the proceeds of which were used as wages for labor-intensive pro-
jects, predominantly in soil and water conservation. After this first phase
the Government's investment policies were directed towards more productive
activities in high priority sectors: agriculture, fisheries, transport and
social services. For example, the Government embarked upon programs to in-
crease the level of fisheries technology and the range of operations, modern-
ize the existing fleet, and improve marketing and transport facilities. A
lobster farm on Sal began operations in 1980 with assistance from the
Netherlands, and exports (mainly to Spain and Portugal) are progressing
satisfactorily.
Structure of the Economy
8.       With limited mineral resources, Cape Verde's economy has tradition-
ally been based on agriculture. The sector currently employs 38% of the perma-
nent labor force, but its share of GD? is only 20-25%, depending on the annual
rainfall. Agriculture consists mainly of small farms growing rainfed subsist-
ence crops (beans, corn, cassava and potatoes), and irrigated bottomlands
producing bananas for export, sugarcane for rum production, and vegetables.
Only 15% of the total area is under cultivation and of that only 9% is irri-



-3-
gated. As a result of the prolonged drought, local contribution to food con-
sumption has dropped from about 70% in 1967 to only 20% in recent years. Fish-
ing contributes about 6% of GDP and employs 9% of the labor force, but
supplies a large and important proportion of protein for the population. Fish
products, mainly tuna and live lobsters, represent more than 30% of total
goods exports. The sector is underexploited, with annual catches estimated to
be one-fifth of potential (about 10,000 versus 50,000 t potential).
9.       The secondary sector has acquired an important role in Cape Verde's
*          economy (25% of GDP and 11% of permanent eniployment in 1981), mainly due to
the expansion of construction activities. Mlineral production, mostly salt, is
relatively unimportant in terms of total value added, but accounts for 10% of
commodity exports. Pozzolana was extracted and exported to Portugal in the
late 1960s, but due to lack of adequate port facilities on Santo Antao Island,
where the mineral deposits are located, exports have been suspended. The
Government is considering the construction of a 60,000-ton cement factory on
Maio Island, which would reactivate production of pozzolana. Manufacturing
contributes only 4% of GDP and absorbs 6% of the labor force. It consists of a
tuna-processing operation and some small activities such as bakery products,
textiles and shoes, furniture and soft drirks. The sector is expected to bene-
fit in the near future from the operations of a shipyard repair facility being
built in Mindelo. Construction expanded with the public investments of the
1977/78 Emergency Plan, and again in 1981 when work begain on the Mindelo
shipyard and the improvements to the Sal Island airport. In 1981 its share of
GDP had reached 21%. The expansion of the sector is expected to continue dur-
ing 1982-1985 under the projected public investments of the first National
Development Plan.
10.      The tertiary sector is by far the most important to Cape Verde's
economy, accounting for around 50% of GDP and 42% of employment. Part of it is
related to public administration, but transport and related services have tra-
ditionally been the mainstay of Cape Verde's economy. The strategic location
of Porto Grande at Mindelo has earned the country considerable income, and a
somewhat similar situation exists at Sal international airport.
11.      Cape Verde's balance of payments has been characterized by a large
and growing trade deficit, usually more than offset by private remittances
from Cape Verdeans living overseas and official transfers. Consequently, Cape
Verde has usually recorded an overall balance of payments surplus. Total ex-
ports of goods and non-factor services, including re-exports and bunkering,
*          increased considerably between 1978-1981 -- from US$7 million to US$24 million
-- due to a continuous acceleration in net receipts from bunkering which in
1981 represented 90% of total exports. Merchandise exports trebled during the
*          same period, mainly due to the sharp increase in the value of fish and banana
exports. Their weight in total export earnings, however, remains at about 10%.
The outlook for receipts from bunkering and stores for ships and aircraft is
considered favorable, particularly in view of recent and planned investments
in transportation and communications. Fish export products are also expected
to increase substantially because of public investments devoted to modernizing
and expanding the sector.



-4-
12.      Cape Verde imports most of its food needs and consumer goods, and all
of its capital goods. During the period 1978-1981 imports of capital goods
increased substantially due to large public investments, leading to a doubling
in the import bill (US$103 million in 1981) and to the current deficit of US$
43 million (65% of GDP). Foreign borrowings for investment projects, rela-
tively modest up to 1980, rose to US$19 million in 1981, financing 45% of the
current deficit in the balance of payments.
13.      Fiscal policy has been prudent: the Government was able to achieve a
23% increase in current receipts allowing a similar increase in current expen-
ditures and a small current budget surplus. Public investment expenditures,
however, have grown rapidly, averaging more than 50% of GDP and about 80% of
total fixed investment during the period. Until 1980 public investment was
financed mostly by foreign grants. In 1981, financing required by the shipyard
and airport projects required both foreign borrowing and credit from the Banco
de Cabo Verde. As a result, external public debt (outstanding and disbursed)
rose from US$17 million in 1980 to US$39 million in 1981. Debt service is
projected to increase from US$0.3 million in 1981 to US$7.2 million in 1985.
In terms of export earnings and emigrant remittances, the service associated
with the current public external debt should be less than 2%.
14.      Proposals for an investment program to implement a First National
Development Plan for 1982-1985 were prepared and discussed with a group of
donors at the UNDP-sponsored Round Table of Development Partners held in Praia
in June 1982. The Plan assigns priority to agriculture and fishing, transit
trade and shipping services and tourism. Preliminary indications are that the
total cost of the Plan will be about US$380 million equivalent. The largest
percentages of investment during the Plan period will be in agriculture and
fishing (25%), transport and telecommunications (24%) and industry (11.5%),
with particular attention given to ports and airports, soil conservation and
reforestation, and industrial activities. Energy and desalination will also
receive more attention (9%), in an effort to reduce oil import costs and the
shortage of water. The Government projects a real growth rate for GDP of 8%
per year during the Plan period as a result of the above investments. A sus-
tained growth of this magnitude seems an optimistic target even assuming ade-
quate rainfall, maintenance of foreign financing levels, minimum delays in
project implementation, and realization of export targets. A more realistic
scenario, which takes into account the high cost of expanding agricultural
output, indicates an annual average growth rate of 4-5% linked to increase
activities related to international and inter-island transit, and one which
would allow a moderate increase in per capita domestic consumption.
15.      Cape Verde remains vulnerable with respect to securing enough foreign
currency to finance the development plan, the debt service associated with
additional borrowings, rising imports for domestic consumption, and the low
level of exports. Despite the optimistic trend of commodity exports, these
are concentrated in three major items (bananas, salt and fish products) and
together cover less than 3% of the total import bill. Export revenues are thus
essentially dependent on services mainly bunkering. Emigrant remittances,
while apparently stable and reliable, are largely used by the families of
emigrants to finance more than 30% of private consumption. Foreign grants and



-5-
borrowings still finance most of Ca-pe Verde' S development expenditures, and
the country will have to continue to rely on foreign financial and technical
assistance, on terms as concessionary as possible. Because of the limited
capacity of the economy to generate savings, foreign aid will have to be
devoted in part to financing local expenditu:res. Fortunately, a large number
of foreign donors are prepared to contribute to Cape Verde's development.
Approximately 82% of the total financing reqluired for the Plan has been
promised by the donors present at the Round "able in Praia, through grants,
concessional loans, and food aid (from the sale of which the Government ob-
tains revenue). Government sources will prov-de another 6%, and the remaining
12% is under active consideration by donors.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAPE VERDE
16.      Cape Verde joined the Bank and IDA in November 1978. While Bank Group
relations have been cordial, they have developed slowly. A first project, for
interisland shipping, was submitted by the Government in 1979, but was later
withdrawn since financing for most of its components was obtained from bilat-
eral sources. Subsequently, the Government requested that priority be given to
processing the proposed Praia Port project, which would be the first Bank
Group operation in Cape Verde. During FY82 three missions visited Praia, and
in June 1982 the Bank was represented at the UNDP-sponsored Round Table of
Development Partners. On this occasion, discussions were held with Government
officials who indicated that a Transport Sector Project was being prepared for
submission to the Association. Also in June, a Bank mission, assisted by an
outside consultant, surveyed the situation of small-scale industries in Cape
Verde, as well as the country's financial system. The results of this mission
may lead to the identification of a Bank-assisted industrial development
project.
17.      The World Bank Group's role in Cape Verde, under present circum-
stances, must be tailored to the country's priorities and must complement
rather than supplant existing aid efforts. Given the large number of donors
active in the country, many of them in the primary sector, opportunities for
Bank Group involvement, necessarily on IDA terms, are limited, although the
Bank may be able to play a useful role in helping to define priorities. Future
Bank Group lending to Cape Verde should be aimed, to the extent possible, on
improving the economy's self-sufficiency and reducing dependence in foreign
flows for both current and investment expenditures. Emphasis should, accord-
ingly, be given to productive investments, coupled with institution-building
and technical assistance. By increasing employment, poverty can be reduced
and revenues generated to improve the level of public services.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
18.      As an archipelago, Cape Verde depends on interisland shipping in the
way other nations depend on highways. Ships carry goods and passengers between
islands and handle the vital imports and the few exports. Thus adequate ports
on all islands are esserntial.



-6-
Ports and Maritime Transport
19.      International maritime transport is served by Porto Grande at Mindelo
on Sao Vicente Island, and Praia Port on Santiago Island, from which goods are
distributed to the other islands where basic port terminal facilities exist.
The national shipping line, ARCAVERDE, carries approximately one-third of Cape
Verde's foreign trade and provides virtually all interisland services.
Roads
20.      There are some 760 km of roads in Cape Verde, of which 300 km are
cobblestone and most of the remainder earth roads or tracks. The largest
systems are found on the rugged islands of Santiago and Santo Antao, while on
Boavista and Maio, flat and sparsely populated, there are very few roads. The
vehicle fleet is approximately 7,000, and is found mainly in Praia, the
capital. Private cars and pick-ups predominate, with some small trucks and
light buses for public transport.
Air Transport
21.      Cape Verde's principal external link is via Amilcar Cabral Inter-
national Airport on Sal Island, the only airport equipped to accommodate large
aircraft and night landings. Built in 1969 in part as a stopover point for
South African Airlines between South Africa and Europe and the USA, the air-
port serves about 30 international flights weekly, including direct connec-
tions with Lisbon and daily flights to London and New York. Praia is linked to
Dakar three times weekly by TACV, the national airline, and Air Senegal. TACV
provides daily service among the islands by small aircraft. The airport at
Praia is currently being illuminated to allow for night operation. Increased
services appear to be warranted, although the most economic means for doing so
need to be studied.
Transport Policy and Planning
22.      The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is responsible for
transport planning and policy, including overall responsibility for the para-
statals ARCAVERDE, TACV, and ENAPOR, the recently created port enterprise. Its
small staff is primarily occupied with day to day administration, with little
time for longer-term planning issues. Consultants recently completed an ini-
tial screening of possible investments in the sector, which formed the basis
for the sector investment program included in the draft National Development
Plan for 1982-1985. However, this study needs to be followed-up by a more
detailed analysis to develop a long-term strategy for the sector, determine
the future roles of the parastatals ARCAVERDE and TACV, and identify high-
priority projects. Technical assistance is included in the proposed project to
address these issues, and also to prepare future projects in the sector.
23.      In the Development Plan, the fundamental objective for the transport
sector is to integrate the national economy by establishing rapid, regular and
low-cost transport between the various parts of the country. A substantial



-7-
investment in transport infrastructure is programmed for the Plan Period,
estimated at US$107 million, or 24% of the total public investment program.
The plan aims to provide, by 1985, all the islands with the necessary port
installations for wharf servicing of coastELI vessels transporting goods to and
from the international ports of Praia and Porto Grande, assured weekly inter-
island communications, and a renovated and adequate airport network. Some 100
km of roads will be built, rebuilt or imprcved, in order to open up isolated
pockets of population and improve the transport of agricultural produce,
especially from irrigated areas.
24.      The Plan also provides for reinforcement of TACV, ARCAVERDE and
ENAPOR through the provision of technical assistance, training, and equipment.
Furthermore, it calls for support to the Ministry's planning office and gen-
eral secretariat, establishment of a management and control system for the
sector, and preparation of a national transport plan. While the emphasis on
institutional strengthening is appropriate, the total sectoral program is
ambitious and investment priorities need to be refined through detailed eco-
nomic analysis, as mentioned above.
The Port Sub-Sector
25.      The Port System. All foreign trade in general cargo passes through
the two deepwater ports, Porto Grande and Praia, which also handle over 80% of
interisland trade. In addition, there are some 30 small ports or landing sites
on the inhabited islands, most of which are in varying stages of decay.
26.      Port Organization. On May 7, 1982, the Government issued a decree
creating a new port enterprise, Empresa Nacional de Administracao dos Portos
(ENAPOR), which came into effect on September 1, 1982. ENAPOR is a commercial
enterprise endowed with all port assets, including infrastructure, and with
sufficient autonomy to compel management to be responsible for efficient and
financially viable operations. It has the necessary powers and duties to
exercise those responsibilities, subject to necessary overriding control by
the MTC. The law creating ENAPOR is based on the 1978 Decree-Law which sets
forth the general bases for Public Enterprises.
27.      Staffing and Training. ENAPOR has a permanent staff of about 200 and
employs some 500 temporary labor for cargo handling, but there is a shortage
of trained personnel for management, operations and maintenance. The proposed
project includes technical assistance and training in these areas. Further
related training under the project will be provided at the Mindelo Maritime
Training Center, which will receive appropriate equipment and technical
assistance in curriculum design.
28.      Porto Grande. Porto Grande is located in the city of Mindelo on the
northwest part of Sao Vicente Island. Because of its strategic position
astride the sea lanes linking Europe with Asia, Africa and America, the port
is frequented by transatlantic vessels which reprovision there while carrying
on commercial operations. Mindelo will serve as Cape Verde's main fishing
center and the area destined for fishing operations at Porto Grande is being
enlarged. A 6,000-ton capacity cold storage facility has been completed



-8-
contiguous to the port area, financed by a US$4.5 million Dutch grant. Con-
struction of a ship repair yard, outside the port, which will initially handle
the repair of vessels of up to 6,500 DWT and later the construction of small
vessels, was begun in 1981 at an estimated cost of US$38 million, with financ-
ing provided by EIB, ADB, Portuguese Banks and the Cape Verde Government.
29.      Praia Port. The facilities at Praia comprise two deepwater berths
constructed at right angles and two 2,400 m' transit sheds. Construction of
the existing Port began in 1973 . The marine works were completed in 1978, and
the transit sheds in 1980. The berths proved to be underdesigned and many of
the reinforced concrete caissons used were damaged during and after placing;
The existing structure is unreliable and the maximum life of the berths is
estimated at three to five years. Portuguese engineers retained in 1980 by the
Portuguese Government assessed the berths to be beyond any possible repair and
recommended the building of completely new concrete block berths in front of
the existing ones, and the construction of a small breakwater. Their findings
formed the basis for the proposed project.
30.      ENAPOR owns and operates the cargo-handling equipment and is res-
ponsible for its repair and maintenance. Operations are severely hampered by
old and obsolete cargo-handling equipment, lack of spare parts, inadequate
workshop and repair facilities and equiment, untrained labor, and unsuitable
operating techniques. These constraints contribute to inefficient handling and
a high incidence of cargo damage. The berthing facilities are inefficiently
utilized, with large piles of timber as well as construction equipment clut-
tering the apron and causing difficulties in loading and unloading of cargo.
There is no customs fence and customs control is inefficient. The general
cargo in the transit sheds is badly stacked which results in cargo damage. In
the absence of long-term storage facilities, the sheds are also used as ware-
houses. Despite the inadequate equipment and somewhat disorganized conditions,
labor output is relatively high, achieving an average of 15 tons per gang-hour
for general cargo.
31.      Traffic. Total foreign trade for the two ports has increased by about
7% per year since 1976, reaching 178,000 tons in 1981, but is expected to in-
crease at an average rate of 5% per year from 1982 to 2006. This forecast re-
flects a continuing rise in imports, at 4% to 5% per year, as well as the
development of exports, mainly through the expansion of the fishing industry.
Interisland traffic grew rapidly between 1976 and 1978, but then declined due
to the completion of Praia Port, which enabled it to receive more imports
directly, instead of transshipping through Porto Grande. Imports at Praia have
grown consistently, and now account for 52% of the country's foreign sea
trade. At Porto Grande, however, they have levelled off since Praia Port
became operational.
32.      In 1981, Praia Port traffic consisted of about 88,100 tons of imports
(mainly corn, cement, fuel and general cargo), 5,400 tons of exports, mainly
general cargo and bananas, and 33,000 tons of interisland cargo. Exports,
which have been negligible, are expected to reach 15,500 tons by the year
2006. Territorial waters are rich in fishing resources and a development
program for the fishing industry is underway, as a result of which it is



-9-
expected that 5,000 tons will be landed at Praia by 1986, resulting in exports
of some 4,500 tons of frozen fish and fish products. By the year 2006, land-
ings and exports should increase to 15,000 and 13,500 tons, respectively.
35.      Accounting, Auditing, Insurance. Until 1980, the financial accounts
of JAP, the former port authority, were on a cash basis; depreciation on fixed
assets was not taken into account and tariffs were therefore not based on
total cost. During 1980, with the assistance of a financial expert seconded by
Portugal, JAP prepared a complete inventory Df all fixed assets owned or
operated (including Praia Port) and an openinag balance sheet as of December
31, 1980. The Portuguese expert also designed1 a basic financial accounting
system and trained the small accounting staff on the new system, which can and
should be continued and developed under ENAPOR's new legal status, and be
effective from FY1983 onward. The proposed project provides technical assis-
tance for this purpose. The Government will require ENAPOR to have a cost
accounting system from 1984 onward (Section 4.01 of draft Project Agreement).
54.      There is no local auditing capabilit;y in Cape Verde and no interna-
tional auditing firms have offices in the cotntry. The Government has created
a unit within the Ministry of Economics and F'inance which will ultimately be
responsible for auditing state enterprises, but it is not yet operational.
ENAPOR will appoint an independent firm of auditors acceptable to the Associa-
tion. Audited accounts, together with the auditor's report, will be forwarded
to the Association, beginning with the year 1983 (Section 4.02 of draft Pro-
ject Agreement). The proposed project includes the cost of the external audits
for the years 1981-1985.
35.      The project provides for management consultants to perform the fol-
lowing tasks aimed at achieving ENAPOR's policy objectives: (a) review the
present financial accounting system and ensure its compliance with the na-
tional accounts code and international standards; (b) devise a cost accounting
system, integrated with the financial accounts which will provide adequate
costing data to enable management to make timely decisions regarding port
tariff rates; (c) establish systems for budget preparation and control, inter-
nal control and audit, management information and (d) recruit additional staff
and train all staff in their respective areas, and assist management in the
use of all the above systems.
36.      Apart from accident insurance for stevedores and social security
insurance for permanent staff, ENAPOR carries no insurance. The Government
*        will require ENAPOR to insure, starting July 1, 1984, to the Association's
satisfaction, against insurable risks, includ-ng third-party liability, and in
such amounts as shall be consistent with sound port and business practices
*        (Section 3.03 of draft Project Agreement).
37.      Financial Performance. JAP maintainecu a satisfactory financial condi-
tion, confirmed by the high level of cash gene!rated from operations (27% of
revenue). Bach year, except FY1978, showed an increase in cash surplus from
operations. All the ports, including the small cabotage ports, normally earned
cash operating surpluses, even though these were derived almost exclusively
from profits on stevedoring.



-10-
38.      ENAPOR's financial structure is conservative and sound, with a large
borrowing capacity, a good repayment capacity and a low level of indebtedness
(debt/equity ratio of 10/90). Since capital investment was financed almost
exclusively by grants, outstanding long-term debt is low, amounting to CVEsc
38.7 million (aid from the Netherlands for equipment) to be repaid by
JAP/ENAPOR over five years at no interest. ENAPOR's net working capital is
high by normal standards, amounting to 11 months of revenue. It has consider-
able liquidity (7 months of revenue).
39.      Tariff and Costing System. ENAPOR's tariff level is low by Western
Africa standards. The average tariff per ton of merchandise, including cargo
handling charges, is about US$8, as compared to US$15 in Conakry, US$12 in
Bissau and US$12 in Cotonou (FY80). This is partly due to ENAPOR's relatively
low staffing level compared to total tonnage handled and to its low non-
working expenditures (depreciation and interest charges) amounting to about
30% of revenue. ENAPOR charges users for the full range of facilities and
services provided by the ports. In the absence of cost accounting and fixed
asset valuations, charges are based on direct cash outlays related to each
service. Therefore, capital intensive services such as the utilization of the
principal facility by ships are undercharged. The tariff structure for Praia
and Porto Grande will be improved by basing future increases on the cost
accounting system. (Section 4.04 of draft Project Agrement).
40.      Financial Forecasts. ENAPOR's financial policy should be to achieve a
financial situation under which, after servicing its debt, it would have (i) a
balanced income statement, (ii) an acceptable liquidity situation, and (iii) a
moderate but positive and rising financial rate of return.
41.      Financial projections indicate that these targets can be achieved
through an additional increase in overall tariffs from all sources of 66% at
constant prices and appropriate investment and financial policies. Such an
increase would raise the average per ton tariff, including cargo-handling
charges, to about US$13 at 1982 prices, and would generate sufficient revenue
to cover working expenses, rising depreciation (after completion of the recon-
struction works at Praia) and financial charges generated by this project. The
corresponding target working ratio will be .55 for FY1984 and .45 from FY1986
onward (Section 4.03 of draft Project Agreement).
42.      ENAPOR's projected investment for FY1982-1986 comprises only the
project items, all of which are economically justified. From FY1986 onward,
capital investment projects relate to secondary ports and to Mindelo, in
accordance with the sectoral investment program included in the Four-Year
Development Plan. ENAPOR's contribution towards financing capital investment
would increase from 3% during project implementation to about 50% over the
FY1986-1990 period. As a result of ENAPOR's investment financing and tariff
policy, its financial rate of return on revalued fixed assets would improve
from the current zero value to 4% in FY1986, and 6% in FY1988. The debt/equity
ratio will increase from its current 8/92 value to a still safe 55/45 level.
ENAPOR has agreed to this (Section 4.03 (a) of draft Project Agreement), and
also to consult the Association annually on its investment and financing plan
for the following three years (Section 4.06 of Draft Project Agreement).



-11-
43.      ENAPOR should retain sufficient liquidity to operate satisfactorily,
but should also avoid the possible over-accamulation of liquidity beyond its
normal operational requirements and its contributions to economically justi-
fied capital investment. Therefore, ENAPOR ill retain all available liquidity
up to: (i) five months of revenues, plus (ii) the amount needed to finance its
contribution for the following year to its three-year capital investment plan,
as approved by the Association. Cash available in excess of this amount will
be deposited by ENAPOR into a joint account to be maintained by ENAPOR and the
Government in the Bank of Cape Verde (Section 4.07 of draft Project
Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Bac'kground
44.      In December 1980 an advance from the Project Preparation Facility was
approved, in an amount of US$100,000, for ccnsulting services to prepare a
master plan for Praia Port, collect complementary economic and financial data,
and assist in reorganizing the port authority (JAP) into a financially viable
autonomous government enterprise. A second advance of US$100,000 was granted
in February 1982 to finance the completion cf tender documents for the pro-
ject. These have been prepared by consultants under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.
45.      The main objectives of the proposed project are to ensure the conti-
nuance of the economic benefits of Praia Port by reconstructing its rapidly
deteriorating deep-water berths and providing it with necessary support faci-
lities; to increase the efficiency of port operations at Praia and Porto
Grande by providing modern cargo handling and workshop equipment as well as
technical assistance and training; to expand training in the maritime sector
by establishing a training center at Mindelo, duly equipped and staffed; and
to improve transport planning through technical assistance to MTC. The new
facilities and equipment will be suitable to modern port operations, and
together with the proposed training program, will increase cargo handling
productivity.
46.      Joint financing of the reconstriuctiDn works at Praia Port has been
arranged with the Portuguese Government-Il and BADEA. The Kingdom of Norway has
agreed to finance the training center at Mindelo through a UNDP-administered
project to be executed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) under
*         a project document signed in June 1982. Equi-?ment and construction of support
facilities, and a small berth for fishing and interisland vessels at Praia
Port will be financed by BADEA.
1/ Based on a Protocol signed by the Governments of Cape Verde and
Portugal in June 1981.



-1 2-
47.      Negotiations for the proposed Credit were held in Praia from December
13 to 18,1982, with a Government delegation led by the Secretary General of
Transports, and representatives from the Ministry of Economics and Finance,
ENAPOR, the Secretariat for Planning and Cooperation, and the Bank of Cape
Verde. Staff Appraisal Report No. 4070-CV is being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. Supplementary project data are in Annex III.
Project Description
48.      The project consists of rehabilitation and improvements at Praia
Port, provision of equipment, and technical assistance, as follows:
(a)   Civil Works, including reconstruction of a 520 m deepwater berth;
rehabilitation and reinforcement of outside protection to the berth;
construction of support facilities (a transit shed, administrative
buildings, paved areas, access road, customs fence, electricity and
water supply, etc.); and construction of a 75 m berth for fishing and
interisland vessels;
(b)   Equipment, including cargo handling and workshop equipment for Praia
Port and Porto Grande;
(c)   Technical Assistance, including training, for port operations,
management and external auditing; and studies and consulting services
to help the MTC define sector policy and objectives, identify invest-
ment priorities, strengthen transport institutions, and prepare
priority projects in the sector; and
(d)   Maritime Training Center, including provision of a suitable building;
training equipment; and operation of the center for the first five
years.
49.      Total project costs are estimated at US$31.7 million equivalent, of
which US$24.7 million (78%) is in foreign currency. Costs are net of taxes
from which the project would be exempt, except for cargo-handling equipment on
which customs duties will be levied. Cost estimates for civil works and equip-
ment reflect December 1982 prices and are based on international prices for
similar works and equipment as well as recently executed projects in Western
Africa. Estimates for technical assistance are based on an average of
US$10,000 per man-month, including per diem, transportation and other reim-
bursable items. Physical contingencies are 10% on civil works and 5% on equip-
ment. Price contingencies are: (a) 12% annually on local expenditures, and (b)
an average of about 7% for 1983-1987 on foreign expenditures.
50.      The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 6.7 illion (US$7.2 million equivalent)
will finance about 23% of total project costs. It will be disbursed against
100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance, and about 35% of total
expenditures for the joint-financed reconstruction works at Praia Port. The



-1 3-
remaining 65% of the reconstruction works will be covered by a US$8.0 million
equivalent grant from Portugal (50%), US$2.0 million equivalent (12.5%) from a
total US$10.0 million equivalent BADEA loan, and a US$0.5 million equivalent
contribution from ENAPOR (2.5%). BADEA will also provide US$8.0 million to
cover the total cost of the support facilities at Praia Port (including super-
vision), as well as the cost of equipment for both Praia Port and Porto
Grande. The Kingdom of Norway will finance the total cost of the equipment and
technical assistance for the Maritime Training Center and its operation for
five years, estimated at US$4.0 million equivalent. The Government will pro-
vide US$1.3 million equivalent to cover the local costs for technical assist-
ance and training (US$0.1 million) as well as the building for the training
center ($1.2 million). In addition, ENAPOR will provide US$100,000 equivalent
to cover the balance of the local costs for technical assistance and training,
and $0.6 million equivalent to cover customs daties on imported cargo-handling
equipment. The IDA credit will include US$200,300 equivalent for refinancing
the two advances from the Project Preparation Facility.
51,      Of the proceeds of the IDA credit, SDR 5.9 million (US$6.3 million
equiivalent) will be on-lent by the Government to ENAPOR for a period of 25
years, including 7 years of grace, at 11.0% per annum, through a subsidiary
loan agreement, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
(Section 3.01 (c) of draft Development Credit Agreement). BADEA has indicated
that its loan proceeds will be at 5% over 17 years with 5 years grace, while
Portugal's funds are in the form of a grant and will be treated as equity. The
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement, and the effectiveness of the BADEA
financing agreement, will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit (Section 6.01 of draft Development Cred:Lt Agreement).
Pgo ect I plenint tion,  
-Tr-.     VaPU u -0  Mnistry of Transport and Communications is responsible
for project implementation. Construction is expected to start in late 1983 and
be completed by mid-1987. All. civil works cons';ruction will be supervised by
independent consultants under terms and condit:ons satisfactory to the Associ-
ation (Section 3.01 (f) of draft Development Credit Agreement). The consult-
ants will report to a Project Management Unit, to be created for the life of
the project. In order to achieve its mandate, EINAPOR will appoint, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association: (i) not later than July 1,
1983, management consultants; and (ii) not later than January 1, 1984, a port
operations expert and a workshop expert (Section 2.02 of draft Project Agree-
ment). The Government will appoint, on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association, consultants to assist MTC in c.efining sectoral objectives and
policy, identifying transport investment priorities, strengthening the sec-
tor's institutions, and preparing high-priority transport projects (Section
301 (f) of draft Development Credit Agreement).
53a      Contractors for the reconstruction works at Praia Port (US$16.0 mil-
lion equivalent) were internationally prequalified in August 1981 in accor-
dance with Bank Group guidelines, in consultation with Portugal. BADEA subse-
quently indicated its acceptance of the firms Ire-qualified. Tendering under
international competitive bidding is expected in March 1983 and contract award



-14-
shortly thereafter. The contract will be jointly signed by Cape Verde and
Portugal. The contracts for the support facilities and equipment (US$8.0 mil-
lion equivalent) will be awarded in accordance with BADEA's procedures. The
Pssociation will assist the Government in preparing terms of reference for -
consultants for technical assistance and training, and for supervision of
civil works.
Environmental Impact
54.      None of the proposed works should affect the ecology of the city of
Praia or adjacent water areas since all proposed improvements are confined to
changes in existing facilities that have operated in the same location for
several years.
Project Benefits and Risks
55.      Quantified economic benefits of the proposed project are: (a) savings
in the capital and operating costs of lighterage facilities; (b) savings in
ship-waiting time; and (c) reduced cargo losses. An unquantified project
benefit will be calls at Praia Port by vessels of larger size resulting from
superior stevedoring efficiency. As costs per ton decline with increaslng ship
size, freight rates between Cape Verde and overseas may be lower. Partly
related to this, the project is likely to allow more economical grain handling
than would otherwise be the case. Grain would be discharged in bulk by grab
cranes, then carried by track along the quay to the new silo. Without the
project, bulk discharge from vessels to barges would only be possible with
appropriately equipped vessels, and thus some grain would be delivered bagged,
with the loss in economies of bulk transport and handling. Finally, the 75 m
berth will accommodate fishing vessels and provide separate facilities for
passengers who currently embark and disembark at the cargo berth.
56.      Much of the existing cargo-handling equipment at Praia and Porto
Grande will have reached the end of its economic life by 1986, by which time
some 140,000 tons of cargo suitable for equipment would have to be handled
manually. By providing the capacity to meet this need, the project will yield
savings in cargo handling costs and in cargo damage. In addition, the new
cranes will permit more efficient handling of occasional heavy loads and would
also be available for construction and repair work.
57.      The combined rate of return for the infrastructure, equipment and
technical assistance components (which account for about 80% of total project
costs) is 17%; the return to Cape Verde is lower atl4% because an estimated
50% of time savings to foreign trade vessels is expected to accrue overseas.
Benefits would have to be 10% lower, or costs 11% higher, before the rate of
return to Cape Verde would fall below 12%.
58.      Cape Verde may face some difficulties with the recruitment of neces-
sary qualified staff and with Bank Group procedures, since this would be its
first Bank Group-financed project. The possible shortage of local funds for
financing even the small portion of local costs required under the project is
also a risk. Project civil works have been designed in accordance with



-15-
standard engineering principles, however, a:d do not involve significant
technical risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT2S AND AUTHORITY
59.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Cape
Verde and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between ENAPOR and the
Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
60.      Special features of the draft Development Credit Agreement are
referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III to this report.
Special conditions of Credit effectiveness are: (a) execution of the subsid-
iary loan agreement between the Government and ENAPOR for on-lending of US$6.3
million equivalent of the IDA credit proceeds, and (b) effectiveness of the
BADEA financing agreement (Section 6.01 of draft Development Credit
Agreement).
61.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Associatior..
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Devel-
opment Credit.
