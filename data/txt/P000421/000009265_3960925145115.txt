PRAIA PORT PROJECT
(Credit 1322-CV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for Praia Port Project
in Cape Verde, for which a Credit 1322-CV in the amount of US$ 7.2 million
equivalent was approved on February 8, 1983.   The Credit was closed on
December 31, 1989 (compared to the original closing date of June 30, 1988)
and has been fully disbursed except for SDR 7,453.14 (about US$ 9,700
equivalent) which has been cancelled.
This was the first Bank Group lending operation in the transport
sector of Cape Verde. The Governments of Cape Verde, Portugal, and Norway
as well as BADEA, ENAPOR, and IDA participated jointly in financing the
project.   Bid prices for civil works were much lower than the appraisal
estimate and the Borrower requested that SDR 2.0 million (USS 2.61 million
equivalent) be cancelled from the Credit thus reducing its amount to SDR 4.7
million.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III of the PCR were
prepared by the Infrastructure Division, Sahel Department, Africa Region.
Part II was extracted from a full PCR prepared by the Borrower.
Preparation of this PCR started during IDA's final supervision
mission of the project in March 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Development Credit and Project Agreements, Memorandum
of Understanding between Republic of Portugal and IDA; supervision reports;
correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, internal IDA memoranda and data
provided by the Cape Verdian authorities to the completion mission.

PRAIA PORT PROJECT
(Credit 132'-CV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A.   Proiect Obiectives
1.        Project objectives were to ensure the continuance of the economic
benefits of Praia Port by reconstructing its rapidly deteriorating deep-
water berths and providing it with necessary support facilities; to increase
the efficiency of port operations at Praia and Porto Grande by providing
modern cargo handling and workshop equipment as well as technical assistance
and training; to expand training in the maricime sector by establishing a
training center at Mindelo; and to improve transport planning through
technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC)
(para 4).
B.   Implementation Experience
2.        Coordination and cooperation among all authorities responsible for
the project (including the Governments of Cape Verde, Portugal, and Norway;
ENAPOR, BADEA and IDA) were excellent in spite of difficulties encountered
during project preparation as regards the role and responsibility of Portugal
in project preparation, financing, and implementation. IDA staff established
a friendly atmosphere with C-pe Verde staff as well as with staff of
different cofinanciers, and this contributed to a smooth and successful
operation (para 9).
3.        IDA made a positive contribution to the physical and institutional
development of the ports subsector and ensured continued financial viability
of  ENAPOR.    IDA  staff  contributed  to  the  successful preparation  and
implementation of the project.  IDA supervision displayed staff continuity
and consisted of missions every six months.    IDA staff demonstrated:
(a) ability to acquaint the Government with the Bank Group role, objectives
and procedures, since this was the first IDA operation in the country;
(b) success in facilitating an agreement acceptable to Portugal and Cape
Verde regarding Portugal's role and responsibility; and (c) ability in
mobilizing funds from several cofinanciers, all agreeing to the same
procedures for prequalification, bidding, contracts award, choice of
consultants for supervision and technical assistance (para 22).
4.        There has not been much variation between planned and actual
implementation. The project remained problem free throughout. Civil works
were successfully completed on schedule.   Cargo handling  and workshop
equipment were purchased 17 months ahead of schedule (Table 3) because BADEA,
the sole financier of equipment, preferred to call for bids at the start of
the project rather than waiting for the completion of civil works.   This
proved to be a wise decision since all equipment were efficiently used as
soon as they arrived. All technical assistance components were adequately



- iv -
completed and the Maritime Training Center benefitted ENAPOR and ARCAVERDE,
the national shipping line (Table 3).
C.   Project Sustainability
5.        The project is expected to continue generating during its economic
life all the benefits for which it was prepared and implemented. The new
facilities were well designed and are likely to continue handling imports and
exports for several decades. Equipment is well maintained by well trained
staff and no major problems are expected especially since adequate spare
parts and training have been provided under the project (para 21).
D.   Prolect Assessment
6.        The project was a success overall.
E.   Findings and Lessons Learned
7.        The project was implemented according to the original schedule
(Table 3). It achieved its short-term objectives and is expected to achieve
its long-term objectives in due time.   Project costs were overestimated
during appraisal.   Actual project costs were lower than the appraisal
estimate by 20% for civil works and 30% for equipment (Table 4).  Credit
disbursements  were  as  estimated  during  appraisal  until  the  physical
components of the projects were completed (Table 2); they were behind
schedule during the last two years when disbursements were limited to
expenditures on technical assistance and training.   Overall, the project
would generate a return of 13.7% to Cape Verde, very close to the SAR
estimate (paras 15 and 16).
8.        Technical assistance and training had mixed success.   Lack of
counterparts to the financial expert, and inability of consultants to adjust
to local conditions for port operations and workshop management explain why
progress has been slow to materialize. Sector studies also largely failed
to have an impact on the Government decisions (para 14).
9.        The main lessons of experience are: (a) Bank Group projects remain
problem free if they are well prepared and adequately supervised; (b) the
Bank Group should not sacrifice the quality of supervision as a result of
budget constraints; and (c) supervision missions for similar projects should
consist at least of an engineer and a financial analyst with continuity of
same ctaff (para 22).

B.   Background
1.        Cape Verde is a collection of ten islands and five islets about
450 km off the coast of West Africa. Nine of the islands are inhabited and
the country depends on shWpping as other countries depend on highways and
railways. Foreign trade relies entirely on maritime transport most of which
is served through the ports of Porto Grande at Mindelo on Sao Vincente island
and Praia on Santiago island, from which goods are distributed by sea to
minor ports on other inhabited islands. Thus, adequate port facilities on
all islands are essential.
2.        At the time of project appraisal, Praia port facilities comprised
two deep water berths that were constructed between 1975 and 1978 before Cape
Verde became independent.  Structures were underdesigned and resulted in such
deterioration that berths were judged to be unreliable and their total
collapse could occur at any time.   Based on a Protocol signed by the
Governments of Cape Verde and Portugal in June 1981, the Portuguese
Government undertook to provide a grant to finance 50% of the costs of
rehabilitating the above-mentioned berths. Since Cape Verde was unable to
provide from its own recourses ;he additional 50%, it requested IDA's
financial asslstance. The Bank Group agreed to participate in financing the
Praia Port Project and this was its first lending operation in Cape Verde.
3.        In addition to the grant from the Portuguese Government, joint
financing of the reconstruction works were arranged with BADEA. The Kingdom
of Norway agreed to finance the training center at Mindelo through a UNDP-
administered project executed by the International Maritime Crganization
(IMO). BADEA also financed cargo handling and workshop equipment as well as
construction of support facilities and a small berth for fishing and
interisland vessels at Praia port.
C.   Project Obiectives
4.        The main objectives of the project were to ensure the continuance
of the economic benefits of Praia port by reconstructing its rapidly
deteriorating deep-water berths and providing it with necessary support
facilities; to increase the efficiency of port operations at Praia and Porto
Grande by providing moderr. cargo handling and workshop equipment as well as
technical assistance and training; to expand training in the maritime sector



- 2 -
by establishing a training center at Mindelo, duly equipped and staffed; and
to improve transport planning through technical assistance to the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (MTC).
D.   Prolect Description
5.        After negotiations, the project comprised the following components:
Fart A:
(a) reconstruction of 520 m deep water berths (210 m long and 9.5 m
deep, and 310 m long and 7.5 m deep); and
(b) rehabilitation and reinforcement of outside protection to the
above-mentioned 210 m long berth;
Part Bs
(c)  construction of support facilities (a transit shed, administrative
building, paved areas, access road, customs fence, electricity and
water supply, etc.);
(d) construction of a marginal berth (75 m long and 5.0 m deep) for
fishing and interisland vessels; and
(e) provision of cargo handling and workshop equipment for Praia Port
and Porto Grande;
Par_ C:
(f) technical assistance to Empresa Nacional de Administracao dos
Portos (ENAPOR) for training, port operation, management and
external auditing; and
(g) technical assistance to MTC to identify investment priorities,
strengthen transport related institutions, and prepare high
priority projects in the sector;
Part D:
(h) provision of a bullding and training equipment for the maritime
training center at Mindelo as well as technical assistance for the
first five years of the center's operazions.
E.   Project Design and Organization
6.        The project was prepared by independent consultants acceptable to
all cofinanciers and financed by two advances from IDA's Project Preparation
Facilities each for US$ 100,000 equivalent. Tender documents suitable for
international competitive bidding were reviewed and agreed by the
cofinanciers.   The project was well prepared.   Its scope and scale were
appropriate in light of its objectives, and the design was in accordance with
the latest modern technology.   Timing of the project was appropriate; in



particular, the new berths to replace the deteriorating ones were made
available before collapse of the old ones produced severe economic losses.
7.        Since MTC did not have the capacity to review the design of the
engineering components of the pro4ect, they depended on the engineers of the
Public Works Department (PWD).  The role of those engineers as well as the
role and responsibilities of the staff of ENAPOR with regard to project
preparation were clearly definec, and, with the assistance of IDA staff,
contributed to the success and smooth implementation of the project.
8.        Project  cost  estimates  as  agreed  upon  between  the  design
consultants, MrC, PWD, and IDA staff proved to be higher than actual costs
by 20% for civil works and 30% for equipment.  This was mainly due to the
fierce competition among contractors and equipment suppliers. As a result
of savings, the Government requested that SDR 2.0 million (US$ 2.61 million
equivalent) be :-ncelled from the Credit; IDA agreed and the Credit amount
was reduced to SDR 4.7 million.
F.   Prolect Implementation
9.        The MTC was responsible for project implementation.  Contractors
for civil works were prequalified under a procedure agreed upon by all
cofinanciers. Contracts for civil works and equipment purchase were awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines  for Procurement.    Civil  engineering construction and
equipment purchase were supervised by independent consultants acceptable to
all cofinanciers. Specialized consultants were employed in January 1985 to
provide technical assistance to ENAPOR in port operation and equipment
maintenance.   An expatriate accountant was employed in January 1985 to
provide technical assistance to ENAPOR in financial management and
administration under  a three-year  contract.    Economic  studies  on air
transport and Porto Grande port were contracted.   External auditors were
employed in June 1986 to audit project accounts. Equipment and teachers for
the Maritime Training Center were adequately provided on time.
10.       There  was  not  much  variation  between  planned  and  actual
implementation. The project remained problem free throughout. Civil works
were successfully completed on schedule.   Cargo handling and workshop
equipment were purchased 17 months ahead of schedule because BADEA, the sole
financier of equipment, preferred to call for bids at the start of the
project rather than wait for the completion of civil works. This was a wise
decision since all equipment were efficiently used as soon as they arrived
to the port. All technical assistance components were adequately completed
and the Maritime Training Center benefitted ENAPOR and ARCAVERDE, the
national shipping line.
G.   Project Results
11.       Results are somewhat mixed.  Whereas fully satisfactory as regards
physical targets, the project's contribution to institution building is less
obvious although one might argue that the collaboration developed between the
Government and IDA throughout implementation of the project helped reorient



transport policy toward greater market freedom and more productive
operations.
Achievement of physical targets
12. Physical targets were met on time and in a cost-effective way which
made possible to finance complementary works for an upgraded landward
protection to the berth reconstructed under the project, including better
drainage structures, and paving of additional storage areas. The
rehabilitated port was inaugurated by the President of Cape Verde in July
1987, and the project is considered a success.
Institutior. building
13.       Studies  were  planned  to  identify  investment  priorities  and
s.trengthen transport related institutions. An analysis of air transport was
carried out by a French consultant, with recommendations on airport
infrastructure improvement and the optimal composition of the Transportes
Aereos de Cabo Verde (TACV), tne national airlines. The report was completed
in June 1987, but TACV refused 1-o discuss the study findings with IDA and it
is therefore not possible to ascertain the extent to which the study may have
influenced air transport policy. Consultant services were also envisaged to
remedy operational and technical deficiencies experienced in urban transport;
but tutelage of the public bus company was transferred from the Ministry of
Transport to another ministry, and the initiative was held in abeyance until
1987 when it was reincorporated in the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and
Tech-.ical Assistance Credit. A third study ought to have been conducted on
maritime transport but the Government was conducting its own assessment of
this essential sub-secto-, and was not interested in a project financed
study. A broad assessment by a Brazilian consultant was carried out in Kay
1988 under separate IDA financing, but seems to have had limited impact.
14.       Consultancy services were financed in three areas of ENAPORPs
management: (a) finance, (b) port operations, and (c) reorganization of the
workshops.   Concerning  (a), the Portuguese financial expert arrived in
January 1985; the scope of his mission was considerably reduced after his
counterpart left in July 1986: the consultant acted as Chief of Accounts
until the end, because no replacement could be found until shortly before he
left in January 1989. The cost accounting system had not been implemented and
the transition to a computer based system of accounts was not completed at
the end of this mission. A Portuguese consultant firm was hired in 1988 and
financed under the project to prepare a master plan for computerization of
port management, and proceeded late in 1989 with Phase 1 of its
implementation covering accounting, stores and personnel management, and
training of staff. This mission has been successfal. Concerning (b), a port
operation expert from Brazil stayed two years and demonstrated technical
competence but his relations with people were not always satisfactory;
because of this, impact was quite small in Porto Grande, and somewhat
stronger in Praia.   Concerning (c), the workshop specialist,  also from
Brazil, was not up to the training part of his mission and had to be replaced
before the end of his two-year term. His successor stayed too short a time
(6 months) to be really effective, and training of local staff could have
been better.



Economic revaluation
15.       The econowic  analysis carried out at appraisal was based on
engineering judgment that the existing berths at Praia could collapse at any
time.   Being one of the only two ports where deep sea ships could be
accommodated, Praia is an essential load center from where cargo is
dispatched to the smeller islands; furthermore, its location on Santiago
where about half of the country's population dwells emphasizes its economic
importance. Without the project, the existing berths might have collapsed
earlier but 1987 was considered as the most likely date of occurre.Lce
following which lighterage would have been needed using new facilities as the
existing ones were found obsolete.   The project would therefore induce
savings in rerms of speedier ship operations compared to the lighterage
alternative and reduced cargo damages. A separate analysis was conducted to
measure the economic rate of return of project-financed cargo handling
equipment: forklifts, tractors and trailers would increase productivity of
shore-based operations in comparison to manual systems, whereas the cranes
to be provided at Porto Grande would supplement ship gear and reduce service
time. Because foreign-owned vessels carried 70% of the international trade
at the time, it was estimated that no more than 50% of savings accruing to
shipowners would directly benefit Cape Verde. Foreign trade was expected to
grow at 3.9% per year on average between 1987 and 2006, and interisland trade
at 2.6%. The pro4ect would yield a total rate of return of 17% and a return
to Cape Verde of 14% on the infrastructure component; respective rates of 18%
and 15% were calculated for the equipment.   Overall, the project would
generate a return of 17% in general and 14% to Cape Verde.
16.       Actual traffic between 1982 and 1989 are given in Annex 1, Table 1.
By 1986, the national port traffic had grown faster than expected: the actual
rate was 6.5% annually instead of 4.9%; since foreign trade reached 233
thousands tons in 1986, compared to the appraisal estimate of 232 thousands,
the difference zame from the faster than anticipated development of the
interisland traffic. Table 1 indicates that Praia brought its share of
foreign traffic from 42% in 1982 to 62% in 1989 which demonstratea that full
opportunity was taken of the new facilities created there under the project;
productivity of ship operations is about twice as high in Praia as in Porto
Grande, the other major port, due to a better organization of labor and a
modern port layout with ample storage space. The economic revaluation has
been carried out along principles similar to those used at appraisal.
Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3 provide details on the various assumptions and on
costs and benefit flows respectively for the infrastructure and for the
equipment components of the project. The economic rate of return for
infrastructure was recalculated and found to be nearly identical with the
appraisal estimate. Cape Verde netted 14% because of the following: (i) the
capital cost of new berths was 22% lower; (ii) avoided diversion costs were
added, because experience showed that large ships would rather go to Porto
Grande to discharge their cargo instead of resorting to lighterage in Praia:
about 25,000 tons cf food products and containerized cargo would thus have
to be reshipped to their final destination in Praia; (iii) 65% of ship
savings were deemed accruing to Cape Verde versus 50%, mainly because the
national fleet expanded its market share and port tariffs were substantially
increased after the project was completed; (iv) cargo damages with lighterage
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



were computed at 0.3% (instead of 0.4% at appraisal); the cost of barges was
also reduced, based on experience with self-propelled barges operating at
small Cape Verdean ports. For cargo handling equipment, the economic rate
of return is lower than estimated at appraisal: 11.9% versus 14.5%. The main
reason is that the cranes have been lightly used so far (250 hours per year
each on average) and do not seem to match needs adequately: they are
reportedly slow and lifting capacity is not sufficient.  In retrospect, it
would have been more useful to purchase another 30-35 ton forklift truck
which would further facilitate container operations in Praia.
Financial revaluation
17.       ENAPOR formally commenced trading as an autonomous  entity on
September 1, 1982. Financial statements prepared with the assistance of a
foreign financial expert did not present an accurate enough picture of the
new entity's financial position and, in their review of the FY83 accounts,
the auditors introduced adjustments to correct previous accounting practices.
This explains why the actual results for early years of implementation year
differ from appraisal estimates.  The port tariff was increased by 65% in
April 1982 and revenues of CVEsc 196 million in 1983 were 38% above the
forecast. They rose to CVEsc 460 million in 1988, which includes CVEsc 60
million of stevedore services invoiced by ENAPOR since 1986; excluding these
to ensure comparability, actual FY88 revenues came close to the appraisal
forecast (+2.8%). About 45% of the increase between 1983 and 1988 stemmed
from tariff revisions (tariff had been assumed to more than double in the
SAR), 20% from traffic increases, and some 15% from diversification of
services (equipment rentals could increase as the project-financed equipment
was delivered) and correction of past invoicing deficiencies, mostly for
storage.
18.       Working expenses rose from CVEsc 113 million in 1983 to CVEsc 303
million in 1988. The same correction for stevedoring services also applies,
reducing the FY88 working expenses to about CVEsc 240 million, or 61% higher
than the appraisal forecast. Labor costs had been underestimated from the
start as social security contributions became payable from January 1, 1983
onward, raising those costs by some 15%. Local inflation of 15% per year
also contributed to higher labor costs, as salaries were raised by 20% in
1986 and again in January 1989. By 1987, total employment included 200 civil
servants and nearly as many temporary staff in the administration; dock
workers were about 1,100 of whom 10X were permanent. In recent years, a new
policy to reduce personnel became effective with the objective to reduce the
administrative and dock staff by 150. Excess staffing is particularly
apparent in Porto Grande where unionized dock labor imposes a gang's size
twice as large as in Praia for similar tasks.
19.       Table  1 of Annex 2 presents  a comparison between actual and
anticipated financial results over 1983-1988.  Working expenses grew at a
much faster pace than the SAR had foreseen, and the Government was slow to
raise tariffs as urged by IDA out of fears that it would foster inflation
(for instance, the 20% increase expected in mid 1985 only became effective
in September 1986).  As a result, ENAPOR never complied with the working
ratio covenant and incurred its first defic'it of CVEsc 122 million in 1988.
Corrective measures have been adopted since then. A 302 tariff increase took



place in November 1988, and the FY89 revenues should reach CVEsc 620 million.
ENAPOR also obtained softer terms for the on-lent BADEA loan: 18 maturities
instead of 12, with the interest rate unchanged at 5%. Since the on-lent IDA
loan was about US$ 5 million equivalent or 20% lower than assumed in the SAR,
the debt service requirements became much lower than foreseen (CVEsc
73 million in 1988 increasing to CVEsc 109 million in 1991 with the first
repayments of the IDA loan). Table 2 of Annex 2 extends the projection to
1993, based on the following assumptions: (i) traffic to grow 4.5% annually;
(ii) labor costs to follow local inflation at 15% annually, but to also be
deflated by staff reduction equivalent to 3.5% each year over the period;
(iii) new investments to be limited to renewal of equipment and routine
rehabilitation of existing assets.   The extended projection demonstrates
healthy finances throughout the period requiring no more than 5% increase in
FY93. With a cash balance of CVEsc 392 million to be accumulated by December
31 1993, ENAPOR would be able to finance a substantial part of its planned
port development from internal sources.
20.       Cash collection is an area of concern. The average collection
period (ACP) for receivables increased from 65 days in 1983 to 141 days in
1985. It remained stable around 120 days over 1986-1988. Major clients are
parastatals, and ENAPOR has received limited support from the Government in
its attempt to collect arrears. IDA missions repeatedly urged the Borrower
to take action on this issue, but none has been forthcoming. It was felt
locally  that  forcing  parastatals  to  pay  arrears  would  lead  them  to
bankruptcy. The situation improved in 1989, with ACP dropping to about 90
days which is still too high. Resolving this problem should be a priority.
H.   Prolect Sustainability
21.       The project is expected to continue generating during its economic
life all the benefits for which it was propared and implemented. The new
facilities are well designed and are likely to continue handling all imports
and exports for several decades.   Equipment is well maintained by well
trained staff and no major problems are expected especially since adequate
spare parts and training have been provided under the project.
I.   IDA Performance
22.       Throughout the project, IDA made a positive contribution to the
physical and institutional development of the ports subsector and ensured
continued financial viability of ENAPOR. IDA staff contributed largely to
the  successful  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  project.    IDA
supervision was effective, with missions ev.ry six months and with staff
continuity. IDA staff demonstrated: (a) ability to acquaint the Government
with the Bank Group role, objectives and procedures, since this was the first
IDA operation in the country; (b) success in facilitating an agreement
acceptable to Portugal and Cape Verde regarding Portugal's role and
responsibility in project preparation, financing, and implementation; and
(c) ability in mobilizing funds from several cofinanciers, all agreeing to
the same procedures for prequalification, bidding, contracts award, choice
of consultants for supervision and technical assistance. Main lessons are:
(a) IDA projects remain problem free if they are well prepared and adequately
supervised; (b) the Bank Group should not sacrifice quality of supervision



- 8 -
as a result of budget constraints; and (c) supervision missions for similar
projects should consist at least of an engineer and a financial analyst with
continuity of same staff.
J.   Borrower Performance
23.       Performance of all Government authorities involved in the project,
especially ENAPOR, was good during project preparation, appraisal and
implementation. Cooperation with IDA, other cofinanciers, consultants and
contractors was excellent. The main strengths of the Borrower's staff were
their ability to learn and their conviction of the importance of institutionL
building,  training,  financial viability and higher productivity.    The
Government and ENAPOR deployed adequate qualified staff to participate in all
events of the project cycle, in particular their contribution to the project
Unit was essential to the project being successful and problem free.  The
Borrower's request to cancel SDR 2.0 million from the Credit as a result of
savings was a step in the right direction rather than asking IDA to agree to
using these funds in financing non-priority items.
K.   Proiect Relationship
24.       Coordination and cooperation among all authorities responsible for
the project (including the Governments of Cape Verde, Portugal, and Norway;
ENAPOR, BADEA and IDA) were excellent in spite of the difficulties
encountered during project preparation as regards the role and responsibility
of Portugal in project preparation, financing, and implementation. IDA staff
were able to establish a friendly atmosphere with Cape Verde staff as well
as with staff of different cofinanciers and this contributed to a smooth and
successful operation.
L.   Consulting Services
25.       The quality of work provided by all consultants was good and on
time.   This  includes  design consultants,  supervision consultants,  and
technical assistance experts. Monthly progress reports were adequate and on
time.  In contrast, audit reports were always late, the Borrower showing
unfamiliarity with this procedure. In general, project consultants provided
valuable assistance to ENAPOR during project implementation including
extensive transfer of knowledge, with the sole exception of the Brazilian
technical  assistance  team.    A  good  relationship  existed  between  the
consultants and ENAPOR as well as among the consultants and the cofinanciers.
M.   Project Documentation and Data
26.       The SAR provided a useful framework for the Government, ENAPOR,
IDA, and the supervision missions. The Credit and Project Agreements were
quite adequate and appropriate for achieving project objectives in the key
organizational and financial areas. Project files kept in Africa Information
Center are adequate and complete.   ENAPOR provided a Project Completion
Report  and  subsequent  clarifications.    ENAPOR's  accounting  setup  has
considerably  improved.     A  Management  Information  System  is  under
implementation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART 1I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.   Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
27.       The Data defining the project profile at comple- on as prepared by
IDA staff and presented in Part III were discussed    ) .roughly with the
Borrower in the field.
B.   Evaluation of IDA's Performance and Lessons Learned
28.       IDA's personnel were recognized as professional in all respects.
Mission members were always highly qualified in their respective fields and
the composition of supervision missions was appropriate to address
implementation problems.   Missions were regularly planned at six months
intervals throughout the implementation period and the frequency proved to
be adequate. The efficiency of IDA's supervision missions was acknowledged
by the Borrower who periodically asked that they occur more frequently.
Credit disbursements were always on schedule.
29.       The main  lesson  is that because  of the good communications
established between IDA and the Borrower, project implementation was not
unduly affected when changes in Government or mission personnel occurred.
The project was successful mainly because of IDA's high level assistance as
well as the seriousness of local counterparts.
C.   Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
30.       The performance of all Borrower agencies involved in the project,
in particular ENAPOR, was quite good both during project planning and during
its implementation. Technical assistance provided to ENAPOR by an accountant
financed under the project for four years, in collaboration with staff of the
finance department, led to the reorganization of ENAPOR's accounts.   The
reorganization was not complete because of the inadequacy of the management
information system. Technical assistance for equipment maintenance was below
expectations as a result of discontinuity of the assigned expert. The port
operation improvement program was affected by incompatibility among the
expatriate technicians especially aL the initial stage of project execution.
In spite of the above shortcomings, overall assessment of the technical
assistance to ENAPOR is positive and led to a better organization and a more
adequate management.   In the course of technical assistance, an intensive
training program was planned and implemented, including on-the-job-training
of skilled labor and overseas training for high-level staff.
31.       Tender documents for civil works and equipment were adequately
prepared and suitable for international competitive bidding. Bid evaluation
was prompt and in accordance with IDA's guidelines.   Applications  for
disbursement were submitted, in general, without undue delay. Creation of



- 10 -
a project implementation unit with clearly stated responsibilities and
authority helped the smooth implementation of the project.
D. Evaluation of the Co-Financiers' Performance
32.       The project was co-financed by IDA, the Government of Portugal, and
BADEA.   Relations between the co-financiers and the Borrower during the
evolution and implementation of the project were good, however:
(a) during project preparation, major difficulties were encountered
while identifying the role and responsibility of Portugal in
project preparation, financing and implementation. The Borrower
appreciates IDA's efforts that resulted in Cape Verde and Portugal
arriving at an agreement;
(b) disbursement of Portugal's grant suffered an initial delay of
several months pending agreement on the currency for payments to
the Portuguese contractor; and
(c) BADEA suspended disbursement of its loan for several months
starting August 1987 because of Cape Verde outstanding repayments
of other loans from BADEA.

Comments on Prolect Timetable
1.        The project was preappraised in October 1980, however, appraisal
took place 16 months later to allow for the preparation of the project by
independent consultants financed by an advance of US$ 100,000 provided by IDA
from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) on December 19, 1980. A second
US$ 100,000 was approved on March 5, 1982.
2.        Although the project was appraised in February 1982, negotiations
started only in December 1982 as a result of extensive discussions between
IDA, Cape Verde and Portugal to define the role and responsibility of the
Government of Portugal as regards project financing and implementation. The
agreement between IDA and Portugal was signed on March 17, 1983.
3.        Credit effectiveness took place six months after Credit signature
mainly as a result of the delay in BADEA's loan to Cape Verde becoming
effective.
4.        Although all civil works construction and equipment purchase were
completed on schedule and the new facilities were inaugurated by the
President of Cape Verde in July 1987, the closing date was extended on
April 6, 1988 by one year to June 30, 1989 to allow for the construction of
additional priority works and purchase of needed spare parts. The closing
date was extended once more by six months to December 31, 1989 to allow for
the completion of additional technical assistance and studies.

1.        At  Government  request,  SDR  2.0  million  (US$ 2.612  million
equivalent at a rate of exchange of SDR 1=US$ 1.30 were cancelled on January
26, 1988, thus, reducing the Credit to SDR 4.7 million.
2.        The  rate  of  exchange  between  the  SDR  and  the  US$  changed
considerably between project appraisal and project completion as follows:
As of July 1 of Each Year
Year      1983       1984       1985      1986       1987       1988      1989

USs
3.        The undisbursed amount of SDR 7,453.14 (about US$ 9,700 equivalent)
was cancelled effective May 7, 1990.
4.        Actual disbursements compared well with the revised schedule of the
reduced credit until the physical components of the project were completed.
Although 84% of the reduced credit were disbursed by the time civil works
construction and equipment purchase were completed (July 1987), only an
additional 11% were disbursed during the following two years mainly because
disbursements on technical assistance and studies are usually at a slower
pace.

Comments on Prolect Implementation
1.        Although tenders were received in April 1983, the contract for
civil works was awarded only in November 1983 as a result of lengthy
discussions between Cape Verde and Portugal on contract award and currency
of payment.
2.        Civil works included in the project were completed as planned.
Additional works agreed by IDA on March 4, 1988 were also completed on
schedule.
3.        Equipment was delivered and tested 17 months ahead of appraisal
schedule mainly because the contract was awarded in December 1983 with 10
months delivery as compared to appraisal planning of October 1983 and 15
months delivery for Porto Grande and January 1986 and 12 months delivery for
Praia Port.

Comments on Proiect Costs
1.        The final project cost is about 20% lower than r.he appraisal
estimate mainly because of the unexpected fierce competition among
contractors and equipment suppliers.
2.        As  a result of actual cost being much lower than appraisal
estimate, the Borrower asked IDA to cancel SDR 2.0 million (US$ 2.61 million
equivalent) from the Credit.

Comments on Prolect Financing
1.        The cofinanciers provided their respective shares of contribution
to the project based on agreements reached in 1982 as follows:
(a) IDA: 35% of total cost of Part A as well as the foreign exchange
cost of Part C;
(b) Portugal: 50% of total cost of Part A;
(c) BADEA: 12.5% of total cost of Part A as well as total cost of
Part B;
(d) Norway: total cost of equipment and technical assistance for
Part D;
(e) ENAPOR: 2.5% of the total cost of Part A, local cost of technical
assistance for ENAPOR under Part C and customs duties on equipment;
and
(f) The Government: US$ 1.3 million to cover the building for the
training center (Part D) and the local costs of technical
assistance to MTC under Part C.
2.        All cofinanciers provided their respective shares on time, however:
(a) disbursement by Portugal suffered an initial delay of several months
waiting for an agreement on the currency of payments. Agreement was reached
later between Portugal and the Portuguese contractor for civil works (Part A)
by which Portugal would pay its share in Portuguese Escudos; and (b) BADEA
suspended disbursements for several months starting August 1987 because of
delayed repayment of oth-r credits.

Comments on Mission Data
1.          IDA's supervision missions were carried out regularly every six
months. Composition was adequate and always included a port engineer except at
the later stages when all physical components were completed and the remaining
works were limited to technical assistance and studies. Maintaining continuity
under the same staff contributed considerably to the project being problem free.

1) TNe  tollowing  cele liv_ ar  "_ d: -              e sre for berths
- 20 yere for shore structures
- 10 yers for utilities
(Costs are expresse  ls 1999 prices, using the irndx of unit value of mnufactured export..)
2) Maintence Is calculated Is peraentge  of capital cost:  - 0.5  for berths per yer
- 2X for hoer structure per year
- 53 for utilities per yer
8) The experience  hes that grain and some container traffic would be diverted to Porte Grands as lightreog  would not be acceptable for
larger ships. The diverted traffic wuld thes amount to 25.000 tons In year 1, growing at 1  per year thereafter. The diversion cost of USJ a  per ton
includes the following c    nomeata:           - reshipping: USJ 26
- transshipment costa: US8 #
4) The lighterog system includes:
-   b-bertha pontoon  at a capital cost of U1# 0.65 million seea, plus m*intenance cost at 5S of capital;
- a fleet of 10-ton self-propelled barges (yearly capacity: 10,000 tons *ech) costed at USJ 12,000 per unit.
he operating costa of tbee barges represent 20X of the investmnt.
C) Assueptions are as follows:  - with project. handling rates of 625 and SOt/day for ocen going ships and coastal ships respectively;
- without project, handling rates of 876 and 96tMday for oceen going and coatal ships respectively;
- daily cost of USS 65000 and US$ 600 respectivoly for oeean geing  and coastal ships,
- 42X of savings on port ship tie is captured by national line  on foreipn trade; and 1001 on interision
- 401 of savings accruing to foreign ships is recouped through higher local dwu.
6) Lighterage would cauge doamges to cargo at a rate of 0.83 of total; vergep cargo value is US$ 660/ton.
7) Traffic grow at 4.63 per yer, except for diverted cargo for which a 1X growth rate is assumd.
