A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The overall goal of the Second Basic Education Project is to improve the development of human capital
in Nicaragua. The project would consolidate and expand the actions undertaken under the First Basic
Education Project (CR 2689-NI). The project's development objective is to promote a more equitable and
effective basic education system, with community involvement in school governance. Its specific
objectives are to: (i) increase coverage at the preschool and primary levels; (ii) improve quality and
efficiency of preschool and primary school education; and (iii) promote continued institutional
strengthening and modernization of MECD.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17496   Date of latest CAS discussion: April 9, 1998
The thrust of the Association's Country Assistance Strategy for Nicaragua (CAS) is to reduce poverty and
income inequality by helping Nicaragua to complete the transition from a centrally planned to a
sustainable market economy. To this end, the Association's support focuses on: (i) consolidating growth
through private sector development; (ii) developing the rural sector; and (iii) developing human capital
and protecting the poor. The proposed project would directly support the last of these objectives. The
project would: (i) expand access to preschool and primary education, especially in rural areas; (ii)
improve efficiency and accountability in delivery of basic education services; (iii) improve the quality of
basic education; and (iv) strengthen the planning and managerial capacity of MECD. Additionally, as
part of the proposed activities, the project would continue responding to the emergency needs created by
Hurricane Mitch, particularly with respect to the improvement of school infrastructure and the availability
of educational materials and textbooks for students and teachers.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Background.' Education indicators reflect Nicaragua's poverty. Nationally, 20 percent of the
population age fifteen and older is illiterate. In the rural areas the figure is 32 percent. The average
number of years of schooling is 5.1 nationally, but only 3.2 years in rural areas. There are 9,300 public
schools at the pre- and primary school level, with a total of about 127,410 preschool students, 683,000
primary level students, and 5,657 preschool teachers (including educadores comunitarios), and 26,315
primary school level teachers.
Approximately 30 percent of the children aged 3 to 6 are enrolled in some kind of preschool, compared to
44 percent in El Salvador, 32 percent in Honduras and 39 percent in the Latin America Region. At the
primary level, net enrollment rate is about 78 percent, compared to 79 percent in El Salvador and 85
percent for the Latin America Region. Secondary schools enroll 27 percent of the population in the age
bracket 13 to 17, compared to 30 percent in El Salvador and 36 percent in the Latin America Region.
The quality of primary school teaching still needs improvement. About one-third of the primary level
teachers are not accredited. Grade repetition and dropout rates are high, particularly in the early grades.
Although there is a formal policy of automatic promotion in the first two grades of the primary level,
repetition rates are still around 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in those grades, higher than for all
1 The education data used throughout this document are from the 1998 LSMS unless otherwise noted. The reader should
be aware that there are discrepancies between the 1998 LSMS and the MECD's data. For instance, according to MECD,
the primary net enrollment rate is 70 percent while LSMS results show it at 78 percent; likewise, according to MECD I"t
grade repetition is 14 percent while it is 20 percent respectively, according to MECD and LSMS.

the other grades at the primary level. Additionally, repetition rates are higher in rural areas than in urban
ones in the first three primary grades. At all grade levels, there are more males repeating than females, 13
percent compared to 9 percent. Likewise, dropout rates are very high in Nicaragua, particularly in the 1
and 4t grades, where 22 percent and 16 percent of all students, respectively, abandon school.2 The
difference in dropout rates between the urban and rural student population at the primary level is also
striking, being at least twice as high in first grade and eight times higher in second. Finally, the
percentage of males dropping out of school is substantially higher than that of females.
Recent achievements
*  In 1993, MECD introduced a program of school autonomy.3  So far, 1,612 primary and 169
secondary schools have become autonomous. This corresponds to: 52 percent of all public primary
students and 83 percent of all public secondary students; 35 percent of the public primary schools and
61 percent of the secondary ones; and 37 percent of the primary level teachers and 81 percent of the
secondary ones.
*  As part of the autonomy program, the MECD has defined a formula to transfer financial resources to
the autonomous schools and designed a new system for financial supervision and control.
* The teacher incentive system was established in 1995. Today, there are 8,000 teachers registered in
this program, which has distributed almost US$1.3 million dollars in incentives to teachers. This has
resulted in a reduction of teacher absenteeism and improvement in punctuality.
• With the support of the Social Investment Fund (FISE), the MECD has repaired 1,446 of the 9,300
preschool and primary schools in the country. The MECD, through a primary school maintenance
system known as SIMCEP, has been responsible for small maintenance and repair activities. The
MECD has also received assistance from Japan, Luxembourg, and the European Union in the
construction of 283 new primary and secondary schools in areas not served by FISE.
- About 4.7 million re-usable textbooks and 4.3 million workbooks were distributed to 850,000 1st
through 6th grade public school students during the last 4 years; currently all ISt through 4h grade
students in public schools have mathematics and Spanish textbooks.
* In addition, MECD has: (a) completed the design of the framework for a national assessment system
to monitor student learning achievement; (b) improved its own administrative and managerial
capacity; and (c) expanded the provision of classrooms, textbooks, teacher training, and school
materials.
Sector Constraints
The three main education sector constraints in Nicaragua are: (i) inadequate coverage at the preschool
and primary levels; (ii) low quality of education and teaching; and (iii) institutional weakness of the
MECD. The following paragraphs describe these issues in more detail.

autonomy program.

INADEQUATE COVERAGE
Low Preschool Coverage. As stated before, preschool coverage is low: only about one-third of the
preschool-age children attend some kind of preschool. Public preschools account for 66 percent of
enrollment, followed by private schools (25 percent). To increase preschool coverage, the Government
has created about 3,500 community preschools enrolling 83,000 children, which rely on 4,222 voluntary
educators for their operation.4
Low Coverage in Grades 4-6. At the primary level, about one-fourth of all 7 to 12 year old population
is out of school and in some of the poorest departments, that percentage is as high as 30 percent. After
the 3rd grade, coverage in rural areas becomes even more problematic due to high drop-out rates and lack
of schools for grades 4 and higher. The MECD often lacks funding for creating multi-grade schools for
grades 4 through 6, or for training and retaining good multi-grade teachers in remote or very poor areas of
the country. To increase coverage, the Government has relied on the FISE for the rehabilitation and
expansion of primary school infrastructure, but the problem of low access for grades 4 through 6 in poor
areas remains a formidable challenge.
Low QUALITY
Inadequate and incomplete infrastructure.  Despite substantial gains in the rehabilitation and
expansion of school infrastructure-especially in rural areas-about 35 percent of public primary schools
are still in need of rehabilitation. In 1999, it was estimated that the infrastructure needs amounted to
about US$100 million dollars.
High repetition and dropout.5 Repetition remains high in the 1st and 2nd grades (20 percent and 13
percent respectively) despite MECD's policy of automatic promotion in those grades. Additionally,
repetition in rural areas is higher than in urban areas, particularly in the 1't grade (21 percent compared to
18 percent), and there are more males than females repeating (see Table 1). Dropout rates are also high,
particularly in 1I" grade (24 percent) and 41 grade (16 percent). In rural areas, the problem is even more
serious, with about one-third of the students dropping out in 1st and 4th grades, and one-fifth of them
dropping out in the other primary grades. Reasons for high dropout rates in 4th grade include (i) lack of
4fit through 6'h grade services; (ii) economic factors; and (iii) high repetition in 1' and 2nd grades. As a
result, the internal efficiency of the system is low: less than 40 percent of the students who begin 1"
grade finish 61 grade.

Low Levels of Teaching Quality and Learning. Poor teaching quality is the most visible problem of
education quality in Nicaragua. It stems from: (i) poor quality of pre-service teacher training; (ii)
inadequate in-service training; (iii) high incidence of non-accredited teachers in the system (according to
4Preschool teachers (educadores comunitarios) receive about US$18 dollars a month in incentives for the equivalent of 12
months of work (but no additional salary). This represents less than one-third of the initial salary of primary school
teachers in rural areas.

MECD about 30 percent of them); and (iv) low rates of retention of good teachers due to very low salaries
and, in some cases, lack of housing options in remote areas. In 1998, before the salary increase, the
average salary of a primary school teacher was only about 50 percent of the average salary of the formal
sector, and corresponded to a remuneration of 141 percent of GDP per capita (in other countries of the
region this was in the order of 300 percent). Teachers from private schools have a salary at least three
times higher than that of the public sector, making retention of good teachers in the public sector a
problem. In the last three years, teachers have received a total salary increase of 25 percent. Although
this resulted in an increase of about US$7.0 million in the wage bill which has had a significant impact on
the government's budget, teacher salaries in real terms remain too low relative to salaries in other sectors.
INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS
Lack of Law Regulating Education Autonomy. Nicaragua still does not have a law regulating the
school autonomy process. While the absence of such law has not been an impediment to the autonomy
process, its existence would help ensure the continuance of the process even in the event of a change in
policy resulting from a change in government. As a condition for effectiveness, the Government of
Nicaragua (GoN) would submit to the National Assembly a law regulating the school autonomy process
and, before the start of preparations for the follow-up Adaptable Program Loan (APL) operation, the
Association would require such law to be enacted by the Assembly.
Inadequate Supervision System. The school supervision system neither contributes to the quality of
education nor supports the school autonomy process. Several factors impede the better performance of
supervisors and their contribution to improving school and teaching efficiency. These include: (i)
inadequate supervision mechanisms; (ii) unclear assignment of activities; and (iii) low technical
preparation of supervisors. Currently supervisors have too many demands on and no clear definition of
their role. The problem of inadequate supervision is especially acute in the rural schools, which have the
least experienced teachers, and are most in need of supervision. The capacity of the supervisors to carry
out their assigned responsibilities has been adversely limited by the human resources, physical
infrastructure, transport and communication facilities at the departmental and local levels.
Low Managerial Capacity and Weak Planning, Research, Evaluation, and Statistical Capacity.
Despite significant progress in the recent years, the managerial performance of MECD's Program
Directors remains below acceptable levels because of insufficient training, deficient managerial
information, inadequate statistics, and unclear roles and responsibilities. Most primary school principals
also lack managerial and human resource management training. The MECD has invested in managerial
training, but has suffered above-average personnel turnover because of administrative, budgetary, and
political problems. Aside from the lack of technical personnel, the Ministry has yet to develop the
capacity for policy, strategic and operational planning. Finally, there are no feedback mechanisms of
policy impact on decision making at the central and local levels and, at the same time, there is little
prospect for communicating system performance to decision-makers and parents in ways that promote
accountability and participation. There remains a need for a well-developed and integrated system of
statistics and performance indicators-both academic and non-academic-in order for the MECD to
fulfill its normative, regulatory, and supervisory roles.
Government Strategy6. The Government of Nicaragua's (GoN) educational policy assigns top priority
to an improvement of quality and efficiency of primary education. Key elements of the GoN's strategy
include allocating increased financial resources to primary schools, expanding community-based
preschool services for the poor, with an emphasis on school readiness, improving the primary level
curriculum, improving training of teachers, making textbooks available to all primary school students, and
rehabilitating the physical plant of primary schools. To address the problem of quality in pre-service

training, the MECD is implementing a project aimed at increasing the quality and effectiveness of the
teacher training schools (normales), with funding from Luxembourg, and developing plans to expand its
salary incentives to all teachers in order to increase the retention of good teachers.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Inadequate coverage. The project would support improvement in pre- and primary school coverage by:
*  expanding preschool infrastructure in targeted areas, including the Atlantic Coast regions, and
providing these preschools with necessary inputs;
*  piloting targeted scholarships for poor students in 4th through 6th grades who are at risk for
dropping out of school for economic reasons. Half of these targeted children would be living in
the Atlantic Coast regions.
Low quality. The project would improve educational quality by:
* improving training for voluntary preschool teachers and financing community preschool teacher
incentives;
* equipping community preschools with learning materials;
* improving in-service training for primary school teachers and principals in active teaching
techniques, and training rural teachers in multigrade and participatory methodologies;
* providing textbooks to all primary school students and a package of basic educational materials
for schools in targeted areas, including materials for teachers (reference books, maps and basic
office supplies), and a school library;
* rehabilitating and replacing primary schools in rural areas, including furnishing them, and
providing teacher housing in order to help retain teachers in areas with limited housing options;
* piloting of Fondo Sonrisa, which would give autonomous schools the chance to compete for
additional funding to finance small educational and cultural projects;
* supporting the expansion of the incentive system for teachers and principals linked to their
performance (attendance and drop-out).
Institutional Weakness. The project would support institutional strengthening and modernization by:
*  training school council members in basic management and decision-making processes under the
autonomy regime;
* training school principals in education management practices;
* fostering discussions on school autonomy among education stakeholders (parents, teachers, and
principal) in workshops;
* fostering the development of Escuelas de Padres;
* supporting communications campaigns on the school autonomy program;
* supporting the design and implementation of a National Assessment System;
* improving and consolidating MECD's existing academic and non-academic system so that it
could be used both as a basis for decision-making at the central level and to inform schools and
society on the performance of the system;
* supporting the design and implementation of a supervision system;
* supporting the design of an APL operation to be implemented at the end of this project.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project would support consolidation of the following key policies and institutional reforms:
School autonomy. The project would help improve, consolidate, and expand the school autonomy model
by improving the organization of the community and the managerial capacity both at the central level and
that of local school councils and school principals. Additionally, through fostering and supporting the
escuelas de padres, the project would continue promoting parental participation in the schools.
Curricular improvement. The project would complement current efforts to increase the relevance of the
school curriculum through its in-service teacher training sub-component. The training and training
materials that would be given to teachers working in bilingual schools would be adapted to the different
cultural backgrounds of the indigenous populations. Additionally, through translating and adapting
preschool initiation books and Sth and 6th grade textbooks into local languages, the project would make
textbooks more culturally responsive and pedagogically appropriate to the needs of indigenous
populations.
Education Finance. The project would help the MECD increase per student funding, which is at a
critically low level, and well below the levels of neighboring countries.7 It would also help the MECD
implement innovations in school finance, such as the piloting of a targeted scholarship program for poor
students.
POLICIES
School Autonomy. The project would reinforce school autonomy, which is the cornerstone of education
policy in Nicaragua.
Provision of Textbooks. The project would provide textbooks to all students in Ist through 6th grades in
public and autonomous schools.
3. Benefits and target population:
Program of Targeted Interventions. The project meets both criteria for inclusion in the Program of
Targeted Interventions. First, the project would develop a specific mechanism for targeting the poor 4h
through 6n grade children who are at risk of dropping out of school for economic reasons, and offer them
scholarships as an incentive to remain in school. Second, the population of project beneficiaries-
children attending multi-grade schools in rural areas and children attending community preschools-
represents a significantly larger proportion of poor people than observed in the country's overall
population. Additionally, most of the project's sub-components would specifically provide benefits to
indigenous groups through the targeting of the Atlantic Coast regions, which are among the poorest
regions of Nicaragua, and where most of the indigenous populations live (see Table 2).
Public expenditures in education reached 3.3 percent of GDP in 1998, up from a low of 2.7 percent in 1989, but
practically all resources are used for teacher salaries. Annual expenditures per student in primary schools are estimated at
about US$46, which is extremely low by Latin America standards.

6 bilingual teacher trainers and 158 community educators
Translation and printing of all preschool materials into three native
languages
Scholarships for 4th - 6th graders  About fifty percent of all scholarships would benefit the Atlantic
Coast Population
Support to PEBI Program         Train 673 teachers and principals and all of the technical staff and
municipal delegates working with PEBI schools
Printing of textbooks adapted for each of the ethnic backgrounds-
Miskitos, Mayangna and Creoles
Development of new textbooks for indigenous populations
Training of teachers to teach Spanish as a second language
Rehabilitation and replacement   Rehabilitation and replacement of 73 classrooms in the Atlantic
of infrastructure               Coast regions
Fondo Sonrisa                   Fifty percent of all the funds would benefit the indigenous
populations of the Atlantic Coast regions
School Autonomy                 Materials for Escuelas de Padres would be developed in three native
languages
Development of Communication Campaigns targeted at the Atlantic
Coast regions
Financing of public meetings in the Atlantic Coast regions to discuss
problems with School Autonomy
Development of escuela de padres and dissemination of autonomy-
related information would target the more isolated populations of the
Atlantic Coast regions
Benefits. The project would contribute to improving the efficiency and quality of the education system.
Moreover, by targeting the poorest areas and segments of the population, including indigenous groups, it
would increase equity in human capital investment and help reduce poverty. The project would generate
positive externalities for the community by enhancing the participation of parents in the education of their
children.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                Page 10
Country: Nicaragua                                                Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
The project would also contribute to increased levels of efficiency by improving primary school coverage
and reducing dropout rates and repetition. In addition to the beneficiary effects stemming from overall
higher quality of education, the project would promote efficiency in primary education in two other ways.
First, by expanding community preschool education and training of preschool teachers, children would be
better prepared when entering first grade. Second, through a pilot scholarship program for students in 4b
through 6'h grades from poor households, more children of low-income households would continue their
schooling beyond 3rd grade, and more children would graduate from primary school.
The quality of education would be improved by providing the students with a better learning environment
and better teachers, and by improvements at the organizational level. An improved learning environment
would be achieved by: (i) continuing the rehabilitation of primary schools; (ii) equipping classrooms with
the necessary school furniture; and (iii) supplying schools with textbooks and school materials. The
quality of teaching would be further improved by in-service teacher training and by creating a better work
environment for teachers, with performance-based salary incentives, and housing for teachers in remote
areas. Finally, the project would improve the quality of the school system by strengthening and
modernizing the education system through increased training (both at the central and local level),
improved supervision system, better information systems, improved availability of statistics, and
improved communications.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project would be implemented using the same institutional arrangements that are in place and deemed
to be appropriate for the on-going APRENDE I Project.
Implementation period: Three years (2000-2002)
Executing agencies. The MECD would be the principal executing agency in the GoN responsible for
conducting implementation of the project through its central and local levels. The Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) of APRENDE I would be responsible for overall project management, monitoring, and
coordination of the project. Local school councils (Consejos Escolares) would support the local school
principals in the implementation of most of the activities related to the decentralization component,
including making recommendations to the principals on the Fondo Sonrisa, Fondo Aprende and SIMCEP
activities.
Project Oversight and Policy Setting. Overall responsibility for oversight of the project would be
vested in MECD, which would be supported in the general policy setting and institutional coordination by
a committee composed of the Vice-minister of Education and the directors of the different administrative
units. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would be responsible for assigning counterpart funding.
Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU at APRENDE I would continue to
coordinate the operation of the project, reporting directly to the Office of the National Project Coordinator
in the MECD. The institutional assessment indicates a good coordination capacity and commitment of its
staff to assist in implementation.  Additionally, activities in the PCU would also include the
administration of project funds; procurement of all inputs in the project, with the exception of those to be
carried out under the SIMCEP system, Fondo Sonrisa and Fondo de Becas APRENDE, and preparation of
the periodic progress reports on the Project.8  The MECD, through its line directorates and
regional/municipal offices, would be directly responsible for the technical content of the activities in the
s In the SIMCEP system, established under the first credit, the school council and school principal are responsible for
overseeing school infrastructure maintenance and repair activities, including contracting and supervision of the work,
making the payments, and keeping the documentation related to the allocation of funds in order to submit it to MECD.

Country: Nicaragua                                                Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
project. These technical units would also contribute to the periodic evaluations of project progress and
participate in annual reviews.
Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangements. Credit funds would be disbursed into
a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, which would be managed by the
PCU. The PCU would be responsible for: (i) preparing the quarterly Project Management Reports
(PMRs) that include project financial statements, project progress report on actual physical and financial
progress of agreed implementation monitoring indicators versus planned, and procurement management
reports, reports required by IDA under the Loan Administrative Change Initiative (LACI); (ii) conducting
annual project reviews; (iii) contracting and supervising a Beneficiary Assessment as an input for the
midterm review; and (iv) contracting annual and concurrent audits of the project, conducted by
independent external auditors.  The PCU  is presently designing and implementing a financial
management (FM) system that would enhance the project's financial management and its overall
implementation, and would have the capability for producing PMRs. The FM system would assist the
PCU in monitoring project progress through periodic project financial statements, a project progress
report, and procurement management reports. It is required that any adjustments that need to be made to
ensure the FM system is compatible with IDA's LACI requirements be completed by project
effectiveness. The first PMR would be submitted by the end of the first quarter and subsequent PMRs
would be submitted within 45 days from the end of the preceding quarter. By the end of the second
quarter of the project implementation, the PMRs could serve as disbursement requests if requested by the
borrower.
Financial Management Assessment. The Financial Management Assessment indicates that the PCU
already has in place the staff and most of the internal controls for the management of the project;
however, the administrative procedures need to be updated and the accounting system is not yet adequate
for LACI. It was agreed with the PCU that the financial management system that is being designed to
meet LACI requirements would be in place before effectiveness. The Action Plan agreed during
negotiations includes key actions for the design and implementation of a financial management
system, which includes financial reporting, monitoring of key project implementation indicators,
and the related LACI administrative procedures, all to be complied by effectiveness. For LACI
eligibility, in addition to the design of the FM system required for the operation, the following would be
needed: (i) draft implementation manual and administrative procedures; (ii) design of the monitoring
system for project implementation; (iii) update the Operations Manual in order to include and/or modify terms
and conditions in the procurement agreements foreseen in APRENDE 11; and (iv) preparation of LACI-related
administrative procedures, all reflected in an Action Plan to be carried out by December 1999. Also, to
achieve LACI-compliance (see Table 4) the borrower would (i) have developed PMRs by March 30,
2000, and (ii) by the end of the second quarter, have the capability of producing PMRs that can be used as
disbursement requests.

Auditing Arrangements. Auditors should be appointed by credit effectiveness (Table 3) so they can
make an assessment of the system being implemented. An annual audit report on the financial statements
and special account transactions in the project would be required to be delivered to IDA by no later than
six months after the closing of the GoN's fiscal year. In addition, concurrent quarterly audits would be
conducted to assist MECD authorities in the periodic evaluation of financial progress. The quarterly audit
report should be submitted concurrently to IDA within 90 days after the close of the quarter. Audits
should be performed by a private sector auditor acceptable to IDA. The PCU would use the standard
terms of reference as issued periodically by IDA to contract independent qualified auditors, preferably
hired under multiyear contracts; if multiyear contracts are not feasible, the auditor should be contracted by
no later than December 1st of the year preceding the year to be audited.
Procurement Report. The PCU would be responsible for preparing the Annual Procurement Plan
(PAC), based on an annual action plan for the project to be submitted to IDA by no later than November
30 of each year. The PCU would produce quarterly reports of planed and completed purchases during the
implementation of the PAC. The PAC and the publication of the Annual Procurement Notice (APA)
would be done yearly, no later than November 30 and would be a prerequisite for any procurement
activities in the project.

Project Implementation Report: The MECD would prepare and present to IDA at the end of each
quarter reports of implementation progress.
Counterpart Financing: The GoN would ensure the availability of counterpart funds equivalent to
required pari-passu for each quarter, as per financial projections. Funds would be deposited in a project
account opened for this specific purpose, preferably in the same commercial bank where the Special
Account for funds from the IDA credit is located.
Procurement Assessment. The procurement assessment identified no major weaknesses in the PCU that
could be rated unsatisfactory. The PCU has established, satisfactory to the Association, minimum
requirements to conduct procurement based on level of staffing and internal controls. The PCU operates
its procurement system independently from the central MECD office, allowing full application of IDA's
guidelines and standard documentation. An action plan has been agreed to during negotiations to
ensure that the PCU engages in a proactive approach to making effective changes directed to
strengthen internal controls and accountability, develop the skills of its staff and reduce impact of
political pressures during implementation (see Table 3). Key measures, proposed under the Action
Plan, to enable the PCU to support a heavy program of procurement during the life of the project would
require that: (a) the procurement officer reports directly to the Financial-Administrative Coordinator; (b)
external technical assistance for hands-on training is provided to procurement staff; (c) a system of staff
back-up in the procurement unit is established; and (d) external assistance is provided to technical staff in
the preparation of technical specifications and terms of reference.
During the life of the project, the PCU would also have the responsibility to seek the presence of an
institutional distribution strategy for all inputs, case by case, before any procurement is sought. It is
expected that procurement activities in the PCU would be conducted by a specialist assisted by a
technically qualified staff; this team would be responsible for coordinating and implementing all the
Procurement Plans in the project, and of ensuring quality of procedures and documentation. The size of
the Procurement Unit in the PCU is considered acceptable, based on activities expected in the project.
However, it is expected that the PCU would contract outside specialized technical assistance in the case
of the more cumbersome procurement, or at peak times during execution. A General Procurement Plan
for the project has been prepared to include all relevant activities; this key instrument would be updated
annually, on the basis of the action plan agreed. Success in the performance of procurement in the PCU
would depend on clarity and sufficiency of the information in the Operational Manual, to be adopted as a
condition of effectiveness.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection:
Expansion of Formal Preschools. The expansion of the formal preschool network was rejected over the
development of community preschools because of the lack of certified preschool teachers, the higher per
pupil cost, and the good experience obtained so far with voluntary teachers in community preschool. In
addition, community preschools-because of their voluntary nature-have proven more effective than
formal preschools in ensuring community participation. A community preschool study just completed
confirms that this model has been very effective in terms of expanding preschool coverage in Nicaragua
and recommends the further expansion of the model (Castro, 1999).
Provision of School Infrastructure. In the past FISE has been responsible for a large part of the
rehabilitation of the school infrastructure in the areas targeted by the poverty map and MECD, through
SIMCEP, has been responsible for small maintenance and repair activities. In the implementation of the
current project, FISE's own administrative procedures have proven to be cumbersome and less than
efficient in meeting MECD's needs in a timely manner. So, in this project it was decided to continue

using the SIMCEP system given its ability to successfully undertake smaller projects in a more time
efficient manner and the project's overall goal of promoting school autonomy and parental participation.
Scholarships for Students in 4h through 6tb grades. Providing scholarships for students in 4t - 6th
grades was selected over financing scholarships for earlier grades because the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), through its Safety Net Project, would be financing scholarships for the earlier
grades. In order to complement the IDB's project and to ensure that students in need of financial
assistance would not drop out after 3rd grade, the project would finance the remaining grades of the
primary cycle.
Adaptable Program Lending vs. Sector Investment Credit. The use of the Adaptable Program
Lending (APL) mechanism was rejected for the current operation due to: (i) MECD's lack of a long term
education strategy; (ii) MECD's high turnover of staff; and (iii) the urgency placed by Hurricane Mitch
on the school system. The preparation of the APL project would be supported by this investment credit.
Adult Education. This program was not included because the MECD already has a program in place, the
"Programa de Alfabetizaci6n y Educaci6n Bdsica de Adultos de Nicaragua" (PAEBANIC), which
operates with funding from the Government of Spain.
Financing of In-service vs. Pre-service Teacher Training. In line with the project's support for a
teacher incentive system, in-service teacher training was favored over pre-service training. Additionally,
a large share of the schools being targeted by the project are multi-grade ones with teachers who lack any
training on how to teach in multi-grade settings. Notwithstanding, the in-service teacher training sub-
component would coordinate with the existing pre-service teacher training colleges (normales) to ensure
consistency in the training being received by both groups. Finally, the Government of Luxembourg is
partially supporting pre-service teacher training consistent with the project's training framework.
Support for Increased Teacher Certification. This program was not included because there is a pre-
service program already in operation: Escuela Normal I and II with funding from the Government of
Luxembourg.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Preschool Education. International experience shows that student participation in preschool is associated
with subsequent to enrollment in I't grade at the correct age, reduction in repetition and dropout rates in
primary schools, and better performance. For instance, a 1998 study in Nicaragua concluded that first
grade students who have attended preschool tend to out-perform those students who have not attended
any kind of preschool (Castro, 1999). This project would support the expansion of preschools to targeted
areas.
Multigrade Teaching. The Escuela Nueva model, initiated in Colombia during the late 1970s, has
proved very successful in using the multigrade, interactive approach. Features of the model include (i)
use of special instructional materials, including manuals for teachers and supervisors and students that
promote individual and group work, (ii) use of curriculum and materials that encourage the practical
application of what is learned to life in a rural community, and (iii) a system that supports peer
instruction, with older students coaching younger ones. An evaluation conducted by Psacharopoulos,
Rojas, and Velez (1992) of the Escuela Nueva model shows that it significantly improves student
outcomes and student and community participation, as well as reduces dropout rates.
Teacher Training on the Use of Textbooks. Many teachers have trouble using textbooks and materials
provided by the first phase of this project. As a result, new textbooks provided in the second phase of the
project would be accompanied by "textbook user guide" and teachers would receive in-service teacher
training to assist them in using the pedagogical materials.
Availability of libraries. Farrell and Oliveira (1993) concluded that availability of books, size and use of
school library have a great influence on poor children's performance in reading and writing. This project
would support the provision of a library (including teacher reference materials) to all targeted schools.
Support for the SIMCEP system. In the implementation of APRENDE I, FISE's own administrative
procedures have proven to be cumbersome and less than efficient in meeting MECD's needs in a timely
manner. On the other hand, for small repairs or construction the SIMCEP mechanism proved to be an
agile implementation system. This project would reinforce the autonomous managerial and financial
capacity of the schools through the SIMCEP mechanism for rehabilitation and construction of small
schools.
Need for Training of Members of School Councils, School Principals, Parents, and other
stakeholders. The role of School Councils, principals and parents is essential to the autonomous school
model being implemented by MECD. This project would support training for these groups so that they
could carry out the activities expected of them under the autonomous model.
Need for Communication and Social Marketing. Another problem detected during the first phase of
this project is the lack of information available to parents and the general public about school autonomy
and education policy reforms. Moreover, there is a lot of conflicting information within the central
ministry because of unclear channels of communication. This project would improve the MECD's
capacity to inform and engage their staff and parents and the public through social marketing campaigns.
School Autonomy. The Impact Evaluation of Education Reforms Study, which reviewed school
autonomy in Nicaragua and several other countries, confirmed that school autonomy has a positive impact
on improving student attendance and reducing teacher absenteeism. A good example of this are the
EDUCO schools in El Salvador. Furthermore, the study concluded that, in Nicaragua, defacto autonomy
(i.e. schools where the school principal and school council are in fact jointly running the school and in
charge of decision-making) had a significant and positive impact on student achievement test scores.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Education as the Number One Priority in the Social Sector. The Government has forrnally announced
that investing in human capital is its main policy for reducing poverty. Moreover, the Government has
indicated that improving access and quality in public education are the key elements of its education
strategy.
Increased Teacher Salaries with Domestic Funding. The Government used domestic resources to
increase teacher salaries by 25 percent during the last three years. This salary increase, the only given to
any group of public employees, underscores the Government's interest in improving education. Recently,
the Government announced that it plans on giving another salary increase to teachers.
Increased Per Student Expenditures under FSS. The Government has made a commitment to the
international community to increase per student expenditures above the levels agreed under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustmnent Facility Agreement (ESAF) with the International Monetary Fund. To this end, to
increase recurrent spending in education the Government has created the Fondo Social Suplementario
(FSS) which would increase funding for educational recurrent expenditures with donor resources while
Nicaragua gets debt relief in the year 2000 (IHPC initiative). Afterwards, the Government would use the
gains from debt relief to absorb increased spending in the national budget.
S. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has a long-standing commitment to provide technical and financial support to reduce poverty
and inequity, and has made this a central priority of its Country Assistance Strategy for Nicaragua. To
this end, education remains a cornerstone for developing human capital and protecting the poor. The
Bank assisted in the preparation of the APRENDE I Project in Nicaragua and has been supporting its
implementation. Through this involvement, the Bank has acquired in-depth, hands-on knowledge of the
issues involved in the sector. Likewise, the Bank is able to bring into the planning dialogue the
substantial experience of education development projects with similar objectives, both from other Latin
American Countries and from outside the region. Furthermore, through these and other efforts, the Bank
has successfully fostered dialogue and cooperation among the several donors and stakeholders involved in
the sector in Nicaragua.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$11.6 million (US$32.4 excluding opportunity costs); ERR= 11
percent [13 percent excluding opportunity costs]:
Overall the project is economically viable. If the project's full costs are considered (including capacity
building, institutional strengthening, and the opportunity cost to households of children attending school),
the return of the project as a whole is estimated at 11 percent, with a net present value of US$12.7 million
(taking a discount rate of 10 percent). The economic return is calculated for four separate sub-
components of the project (expansion and improvement of preschool education, infrastructure, provision
of textbooks and other educational materials, and school autonomy). It was found that the rate of return
for the separate components varies between 12 for infrastructure and 22 percent for educational materials
for the baseline scenario.
Benefits include the increase in income due to a better educated population, savings in wastage in
education (which, in turn follow, from reduced repetition and dropout rates), benefits from higher quality
of school infrastructure (lower depreciation rates than in the alternative scenario of not repairing the
schools), and an externality factor from an overall better educated and more productive population. Costs

Country: Nicaragua                                               Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
include both private and public spending on education, the opportunity cost to being in school, and
various other costs generated by the project (e.g. purchase of books arising from the increase in school
population and to replace lost and damaged books).
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
Total project costs (including contingencies) for the project are US$58.4 million, 90 percent of which
(US$52.5 million) would be funded by IDA and the remaining 10 percent (US$5.9 million) by the GoN.
During the lifetime of the project and given the counterpart funding requirements, the overall MECD
budget would jump to nearly US$90 million, an increase of 18.7 percent compared to the baseline or 21.8
percent overall increase (baseline growth plus incremental growth due to the project). After the fourth
year, the year-to-year increase in the budget would stabilize around 4 percent. It is estimated that the
continuation of the project components beyond the three-year horizon of the project would add, yearly, an
additional US$14 million to the budget of the MECD (with yearly impact US$1.9 million in year 1, US$
3.0 million in year 2, and US$1.8 million in the final year of the project). Measured as a percentage of
GDP, the project would increase the education budget from 2.8 percent to about 3.2 percent.
3. Technical.
The project takes into consideration the context of the current education system, and provides appropriate
technical responses. The most important issues of access, equity, and quality are addressed through
project components intended to have an impact on both rural and urban schools. Project preparation had
greatly benefited from the lessons learned from the implementation of the on-going Basic Education
Project (Cr2689-NI), as well as the incorporation of successful technical and administrative practices
within Nicaragua, results from evaluations of the preschool and autonomous component conducted by
MECD, a social assessment carried out by IDA, IDA/Bank's experience with indigenous populations, and
international experience (e.g. multi-grade teaching in Colombia and Guatemala; distribution of textbooks
in Chile; community-based preschool in Panama, Mexico, and Colombia; demand-side financing in
Tanzania and Pakistan; National Evaluation System in Mexico; and MIS system in Peru).
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: MECD, through a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), has demonstrated
reasonably  strong implementation capacity in the APRENDE I project (CR-2689NI); all major
components were implemented on schedule, and some components, notably the school autonomy
program, actually went further than initially expected in terms of numbers of schools requesting and
receiving de jure autonomy.
A number of issues remain, however, with the school autonomy program, which is at the heart of this
project. First, school visits conducted by the appraisal team indicate wide variations in the degree of de
facto autonomy observable in the autonomous schools, with some autonomous schools actually operating
in a more centralized and less participatory manner than some traditional (non-autonomous) schools.
Therefore, a principal thrust of APRENDE II would be to support and monitor the development of de
facto autonomy in the schools, rather than simply to focus on formally granted autonomy. De facto
autonomy would be tracked in a representative sample of schools using the research tools developed by
the Ministry and a Bank research team.
A second issue is the need for corresponding rationalization of MECD's organization and functions to
support and reflect the school autonomy process. There has been virtually no adaptation of the Ministry's
structure or staffing to date in light of the autonomy program; despite the decentralization of a number of
functions to the school councils (for example, oversight of construction and maintenance, teacher hiring
and firing; control over the school budget), there has been no reduction in resources or personnel, nor
redefinition of functions in the central administration, in the departmental offices or municipal offices.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                Page 19
Country: Nicaragua                                                Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
These issues are being addressed by the Ministry at the moment through a reorganization plan and under
APRENDE II, which would provide technical support for MEDC in strengthening its managerial capacity,
support a redefinition of the roles of the Ministry's municipal offices, and introduce modem management
information systems.
A third issue, which affects the two previous ones, is the lack of an autonomy law regulating the school
autonomy process. While the absence of such law has not been an impediment to the autonomy process,
its existence would validate the pilot effort, clarify uncertainties, and ensure the continuance of the
process even in the event of a change in policy resulting from a change in government. As a condition for
effectiveness, GoN would submit to the National Assembly an law regulating the school autonomy
process and, before the start of preparations for the follow-up APL, the Association would require such a
law to be approved by the Assembly.9
In general, the probability of success of this project has been strengthened by the active role MECD
officials have played in designing it and by the fact that this project would continue many activities
already being supported by APRENDE 1 10
b. Project Management: The project's operations would be coordinated by the PCU formed under the
first phase of APRENDE I. The PCU reports to the Office for Project Coordination of MECD. The team
has functioned quite well. Project management should be even stronger for the proposed project due to
the accumulated experience of the PCU. As part of its duties, the PCU would monitor the project's
operational, financial, and procurement performance. The different directorates of the MECD would
help oversee the technical performance of those components affecting their respective directorates.
S. Social:
A social assessment was carried out between February and June of 1999. The main conclusions were:
*  One of the achievements of most autonomous and some non-autonomous schools is the
opportunity offered to parents for participation in monitoring teachers' and students' attendance.
Participation in "administrative matters" is more common in large, wealthier communities, where
schools collect voluntary contributions (cuotas) and donations. It is less likely to occur in poor
communities, where the population is living from subsistence agriculture or suffering from some
degree of geographic isolation, characteristic of smaller schools belonging to NERAs.
*  In many of the autonomous schools there is a lack of accurate information on rules and
regulations governing school autonomy. Absence of clear rules promotes misuse and abuse of
power by some principals, delegates and more influential parents in the Parent Council. For the
communities consulted, it was not clear whether school councils have the right to make such
decisions as the hiring and firing of teachers and principal, approving and rejecting educational
plans. Therefore, final decisions are often left to the school principal and the municipal delegate.
*  Parents and teachers at autonomous schools visited had reservations with regard to autonomy.
They perceived it as a "universal, hierarchical, top-down" policy that does not allow for
flexibility on the part of the teachers and school councils. The PRA shows that out of ten, only a
couple of autonomous schools approximate to the democratic model of decentralization.
9 This law could be a stand-alone one or it could be part of the "Ley General de Educacion."

* Parents and teachers are dissatisfied with the automatic promotion system and perceive it as
having negative long-tern results. Many parents are in favor of repetition for their children if
they did poorly.
6 Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category []A  [ X] B [] C
This project does not involve any re-settlement and is not expected to have any negative impact on the
environment. On the contrary, given the existing natural science curriculum with strong emphasis on
environmental preservation, the project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment.
The infrastructure sub-component would focus on rehabilitating or replacing existing infrastructure that is
not adequate to serve as a school or preschool. The rehabilitated infrastructure would have to meet the
basic sanitation criteria established by the FISE, which should, by itself, improve preservation of the
environment. Also, the construction and rehabilitation of schools would be done in accordance with the
guidelines recommended by the LAC's Environment Department for minor civil works and in
consultation with beneficiaries, particularly indigenous groups. Additionally, environmental preservation
would be reinforced as part of the science curriculum in all public primary schools and all of the
preschool and primary level textbooks and materials that would be distributed to schools under the
proposed project. Finally, the project would finance a fund for small projects proposed by the schools
(Fondo Sonrisa) for activities to be undertaken by the students and the small community. Among the
activities that can be financed by the fund are environmental and cultural ones.

Nicaragua Second Basic Education Project
Project Description
Project Objectives and Components
The overall goal of the Second Basic Education Project is to improve the development of human capital
in Nicaragua. The project would expand and consolidate the actions undertaken under the first Basic
Education Project, APRENDE I, (CR 2689-NI). The project's development objective is to promote a
more equitable and efficient basic education system, with community involvement in school governance.
Its specific objectives are to: (i) increase coverage at the preschool and primary school levels, especially
in rural areas and areas with predominantly indigenous populations; (ii) improve education quality in both
achievement (output) learning environment (education inputs) and efficiency at the preschool and primary
school levels; and (iii) promote continued institutional strengthening and modernization of MECD. In
order to meet these objectives, the project is organized into three interrelated components.  The
organizational structure of this project is similar to that of the on-going project and most of the activities
proposed are already being implemented under APRENDE L. New activities include the pilot scholarship
program for 4h - 6th graders, a National Evaluation System, support to in-service teacher training, and the
Fondo Sonrisa.

PROJECT COMPONENTS
COMPONENT 1- EXPANSION OF ACCESS AND COVERAGE -- US$1.2 million (2.0 percent of
total cost of project)
Objectives. This component would: (i) expand access to community preschools in un-served areas,
including areas with indigenous populations; and (ii) finance a pilot scholarship program targeted at poor
students in the 4th - 6th grades who would are at risk for dropping out of school for economic reasons.
Indicators and Targets. The general indicators for this component are:
(a) the number of new students enrolled in the community preschools; and
(b) the number of students benefiting from the scholarship program.
Sub-Component 1: EXPANDED ACCESS TO COMMUNITY PRESCHOOLS - US$0.57 million
(47.5 percent of total cost of component)
Objective.  This sub-component would promote the expansion of preschools in un-served areas,
particularly remote rural areas and areas with predominantly indigenous populations. Approximately 200
classrooms would be built and 4,000 new students would be enrolled by the end of year 2002.
Enrollment in the Atlantic Coast regions would increase by 1,840 students.
Implementation. The expansion in preschool infrastructure would be based on information from the
"Evaluation of Preschool Demand" study and the 1995 census. Preschools would be installed in existing
primary schools, community centers, churches or other public areas considered adequate by the
community and, in some areas, a preschool classroom would be added to selected primary schools. Part
of the expansion would be targeted at the Atlantic Coast regions, where the majority of the indigenous
populations are located. Six teacher trainers and 98 community educators would be hired to train teachers
for the new schools that would be built in the Atlantic Coast regions. The private sector (including
NGOs) would be responsible for carrying out the infrastructure work.
Sub-Component 2: PILOT SCHOLARSHIP - US$0.60 million (51.6 percent of total cost of
component)
Objective. This sub-component would reduce drop-out rates at the 4th through 6t" grades of primary
education by financing scholarships for students who are at risk for dropping out of school for economic
reasons. It is expected that at least 3,300 4t' through 6' graders would benefit from this program during
its pilot phase (3 years). At the end of the three year pilot, MECD would commission a study and survey
to determine the effectiveness of the program in targeting students and preventing them from dropping-
out.
Targeting. 4t through 6h grade students who are at risk of dropping out of school due to economic
reasons. The eligible municipalities would be pre-selected using the poverty map and drop-out data. It is
expected that 80 percent of the beneficiaries in the Atlantic Coast municipalities would be from
indigenous populations or minority groups. All the schools participating in the scholarship program must
be from one of these municipalities. All 4h through 6h grade students who meet the criteria established
by MECD and are attending schools in those municipalities would be eligible to compete for the
scholarship. The operational manual would establish safeguards to ensure that both girls and boys would
benefit from the program.
Eligibility. The student selection criteria would be based on (i) economic need and (ii) academic
achievement. Students can receive a scholarship for three consecutive years as long as they maintain
good academic standing and do not drop out of school during the school year. Scholarship beneficiaries



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 31
Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
who repeat the academic year or drop out of it would not be eligible to continue receiving the scholarship.
Students benefiting from the program must have a satisfactory performance in school. Each participating
school would receive the equivalent to two full scholarships per year, paid in two installments, for a total
US$150 per year; the School Council would be responsible for identifying the beneficiaries of the
scholarship. Additionally, each school participating in the scholarship program would receive a bonus of
US$15 per full scholarship, which would be used toward the purchase of education materials. The
scholarship must benefit at least two students but no more than six. The School Council would have the
autonomy to decide the number of beneficiaries within this range. Before receiving the funds, the
student's mother/responsible must sign a memorandum of agreement with the School Council agreeing to
keep the child in school during the whole academic year, including allowing the student free time to study
and to do homework.
Implementation. Scholarship applicants must meet the selection criteria that would be established by
MECD. The School Council would be responsible for selecting the beneficiaries of the program and for
ensuring that they meet MECD's criteria, keeping copies of the memorandum of agreement between
mother/responsible and the School Council. Funds for the scholarship would be allocated from MECD to
the school.  The memorandum of agreement would serve as a receipt from mother/responsible
acknowledging that they received the scholarship funds.
PROJECT COMPONENT 2. IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATIONAL QUALITY - US$42.2 million
(72.3 percent of total project cost)
Objectives. This component would improve the quality of primary education by: (i) improving school
readiness among preschool children; (ii) providing in-service teacher training for primary school teachers
and principals; (iii) providing textbooks, school libraries, and educational materials for primary schools;
(iv) rehabilitating the existing school infrastructure and providing teacher housing in very remote rural
areas; (v) a piloting in the Fondo Sonrisa; and (vi) financing a performance-based incentive system for
teachers and principals.
Indicators and Targets. The general indicators for this component are:
(a)  number of preschool students enrolled;
(b)  number of pre and primary school teachers trained;
(c)  number of textbooks and school libraries distributed;
(d)  number of classrooms rehabilitated;
(e)  number of teacher housing units built;
(f)  number of projects approved, to be supported by Fondo Sonrisa; and
(g)  number of teachers and principals benefiting from the performance-based salary incentive
system.
Sub-Component 1: TRAIN COMMUNITY PRESCHOOL TEACHERS - US$1.84 million (4.4
percent of total cost of component)
Objective.  This sub-component would improve school readiness by better preparing community
preschool teachers through in-service teacher training. Additionally, technical staff at the department and
municipal level, as well as the "trainers" themselves, would also receive training. A total of 3,900
community teachers, including 180 teachers working with indigenous populations, would be trained by
2002.
Implementation. Training would take place in two phases, an initial one and a continuous one. Initial
training would take place in the first quarter of the school year. It would cover strategies and
methodologies to work with preschoolers, and themes related to their development. Then, training would
be available to teachers, technical staff, and trainers every quarter. It would concentrate on evaluation



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 32
Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
and exchange of experiences. Department and municipal level technical staff and "trainers" would
receive funds to finance their visits to preschools to assist and supervise the community teachers. In the
Atlantic Coast regions, six bilingual teacher trainers would be hired to deliver the training. Additionally,
a community preschool would be selected in each of 45 municipalities to serve as a model preschool.
These model preschools would receive TVs and VCR equipment and videos about the development of
preschool aged children.
Sub-Component 2: PRESCHOOL TEACHER INCENTIVE SYSTEM - US$3.10 million (7.3
percent of total cost of component)
Objective. The objective of financing incentives for community preschool teachers is to attract more
educators to the program and to retain existing educators by off-setting their opportunity cost of
participating in the program. By 2002, 5,700 community teachers would be receiving incentives.
Implementation. Each community educator would receive a monthly incentive equivalent to US$18 for a
total of US$216 per year (although they would work for 10 months of the year) to be paid every two
months. In order to receive this benefit, and before teaching classes, the educator would register with
MECD's municipal office, which would in turn inform MECD's central office. Municipal offices would
be responsible for informing MECD of any changes in staff.
Sub-Component 3: PRESCHOOL MATERIALS - US$2.08 million (4.9 percent of total cost of
component)
Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to supply all new community preschools with
teaching and learning materials in order to improve the learning process in preschools through enriching
the work with children.
Implementation. Each new community preschool would receive a package of durable materials (one
time) and disposable materials (every year), including materials for the teachers to use with the students
and their parent, inter-alia, and materials for the children themselves to use in the classroom. The
materials would include: didactic materials, art supplies, parent guides, workbooks, and teacher manuals.
MECD's municipal office would be responsible for distributing the materials to the schools. The
workbooks that would be distributed in the Atlantic Coast regions would be translated into three
indigenous languages (Meskito, Creole, and Mayangna).
Sub-Component 4: IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINIG FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL
TEACHERS - US$1.47 million (3.5 percent of total cost of component)
Objective. This sub-component would increase the quality of education by improving the preparation of
primary school teachers and principals through in-service teacher training. It would highlight active
teaching techniques and participatory methodologies. It would focus on multi-grade teachers and it
would have three lines of action: (i) strengthening of in-service teacher training to be delivered at all of
the 660 Microcentros de Capacitacion; (ii) training 3,000 Ilt grade teachers and 40 teachers from
normales in mathematics and Spanish; and (iii) designing and implementing teacher training for 5,900
multigrade teachers and principals.
Implementation. This sub-component would build upon existing teacher training centers and practices.
The first line of action of this sub-component would support improvements in the Microcentros de
Capacitacion by financing: (i) the design of 10 teacher guides that present concrete activities for the
classroom; (ii) a teacher reference library for all of the Microcentros de Capacitacion; (iii) the purchase



Project Appraisal Document                                                                 Page 33
Country: Nicaragua                                                 Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
of a television, video system, and didactic videos for all of the Microcentros de Capacitacion to support
distance teacher training; and (iv) the reproduction and distribution of the four interactive modules
developed by the BASE project for all 5,200 multigrade teachers.
The second line of action would support MECD's project of "Upgrading Spanish and Mathematics"
which is being developed by the Escuelas Normales and aims at improving the skills of all Ist grade
mathematics and Spanish teachers. This approach would reinforce the link between the pre-service
teacher training given by the Normales and the in-service teacher training being provided by MECD. The
training that teachers would receive would be differentiated to accommodate the differences among
certified teachers, non-certified teachers and teachers working with indigenous populations. In addition
to the formal training, teachers would also visit three other schools during the school year to have the
opportunity to observe other teachers in the classroom and share ideas on the strengths and difficulties of
their task. Field visits would provide teachers with the opportunity to reinforce the training received and
would counteract the schools' isolation.
The third line of action includes training teachers and principals of multigrade schools in specific methods
of teaching in multigrade classrooms. MECD's Training Office would be responsible for overseeing this
training and the Escuelas Normales would be responsible for delivering it. In the first year, this activity
would work on a pilot basis and 150 teachers and principals would receive training; by 2002, 5,900
teachers, principals, and MECD's technical staff working directly with these schools would have been
trained. This program would also support training of teachers from Normales so that they could deliver
the training in the subsequent years.
Finally, 673 teachers and principals and all of the technical staff and municipal delegates working with
PEBI schools would receive training on how to use the textbooks that would be distributed to all PEBI
students, including training in participatory methodologies and Spanish as a second language. Training
would take place in Puerto Cabezas, Waspan, Rosita and Bluefields.
Sub-Component 5: TEXTBOOKS, LIBRARIES, AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS - US$14.6
million (34.2 percent of total cost of component)
Objective. This component would increase the quality by making didactic materials available to the
students and teachers. Specifically it would finance: (i) textbooks to all public school students in grades
st- 6th; (ii) bilingual textbooks (Spanish as a second language, mathematics, and mother-tongue
language) for all bilingual students in 1st-3rd grades; (iii) development of bilingual textbooks for 4th - 6th
grades; (iv) a library for all multigrade schools; and (v) a package of basic educational supplies for the
school (i.e. paper, glue, scissors, cardboard paper, masking tape, markers, etc).
Implementation. Textbooks which were developed under APRENDE I would be re-printed. This sub-
component would also include the provision of one libraty with reading and reference books for 3,000
multigrade schools in rural areas. For the bilingual schools in the Atlantic Coast regions, textbooks
adapted for each of the ethnic backgrounds (Miskitos, Mayangna, and Creoles) would be distributed in
the subjects of mathematics, natural sciences, social studies, Spanish as a second language, and the main
text in the different maternal languages. Additionally, all multi-grade schools would receive a package of
educational materials.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Sub-Component 6: REHABILITATION AND REPLACEMENT OF PRIMARY SCHOOL
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION OF TEACHER HOUSING - US$12.02 million
(28.5 percent of total cost of component)
Objectives.  As part of the effort to increase primary coverage and improve the quality of the school
environment, this sub-component would support the: (i) the replacement of 213 classrooms (56 of them
in the Atlantic Coast regions) and rehabilitation of 162 classrooms (17 of them in the Atlantic Coast
regions) in autonomous primary school that are seriously dilapidated and/or do not comply with the
minimum standards established by MECD; (ii) the construction of 32 teacher housing units in very
remote areas, particularly where teacher recruitment and retention is problematic due to lack of housing;
and (iii) the provision of basic water and sanitation to all of the above schools that lack it.
Implementation. The rehabilitation of infrastructure would be undertaken using the SIMCEP system
and/or the private sector, depending on the cost of the work. MECD would establish the minimum
infrastructure standards and would be responsible for selecting the schools to be rehabilitated based on
those standards and the school map. About 20 percent of the rehabilitated schools would be located in
the Atlantic Coast regions, where there is a high concentration of poverty and of indigenous populations.
The use of the SIMCEP mechanism to carry out the work, would help assure that beneficiaries have an
input into the rehabilitation/remodeling of their schools.  This would be particularly relevant among
indigenous communities to ensure that what is being proposed by MECD is in accordance with the
cultural attitudes of these groups.
Sub-Component 7: PILOT FONDO SONRISA - US$0.24 million (0.6 percent of total cost of
component)
Objective. The objective of this sub-component is to establish, on a pilot basis, a special program for
primary level students to foster their interest in extra-curricular school activities, while simultaneously
improving their learning. The program would also encourage community participation through requiring
that the School Council approve the project proposal and encourage parents to participate in project
implementation.
The Fondo Sonrisa is a strategy to make schools a more attractive place for students by financing extra-
curricular projects which, otherwise, would not get financing. Examples of projects that can be financed
through this fund include: school newspaper, soccer field, school play, field trips, school vegetable
garden, science projects, musical bands, etc. Through project preparation, students should have the
opportunity to use their Spanish or native language (write proposal) and mathematics (develop a budget)
skills, work as teams, and develop consensus building skills. Additionally, because School Council
support is a pre-requisite for project submission, the project should foster community participation.
Targeting. Based on the poverty map, the MECD would select which municipalities would receive funds
from the Fondo Sonrisa and the schools applying for these resources must be located within those
municipalities. A total of 750 schools would benefit from this program, of which half of them would be
in the Atlantic Coast regions.
Eligibility. Each school is eligible to have one project funded per year. In case there is more than one
proposal per school, the School Council must determine which one to submit for financing. The Fondo
Sonrisa would finance up to US$150 equivalent per project and each school is eligible to benefit from the
fund no more than once a year. Schools benefiting from the fund for a second time are only eligible to
receive up to total of 50 percent of the total project cost for a maximum of US$75 and the School
Council/communities must finance the other 50 percent.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Implementation. The School Council would be responsible for submitting the proposal in writing to the
municipal delegate (tecnico municipal). Each proposal should include: (i) a description of the project's
goal; (ii) activities to be funded; (iii) a budget; and (iv) time schedule for implementation. All proposals
that comply with the eligibility criteria and that include the four items listed above would receive funding.
The municipal delegate would be responsible for ensuring that the project was implemented. Funds
would be transferred from the MECD to the to the school and principal with the School Council would be
responsible for managing the funds and keeping records of all expenses (for 12 months after receiving the
funds). The Department of Primary Education of the MECD would supervise and monitor the operational
aspects of the Fondo.
Sub-Component 8: INCENTIVE FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS -
US$7.05 million (16.7 percent of total cost of component)
Objective. The objective of this sub-component is to continue supporting the salary incentive system
developed under APRENDE I, whereby teachers who have good school attendance, do not have a
problem with tardiness, and are able to discourage students from dropping out, receive a monetary
incentive.
Program Description. This program would give teachers a monetary incentive if they comply with the
MECD requirements for attendance, and if their students remain in school throughout the year. About
20,800 teachers, principals and sub-principals would receive the performance incentive.
Implementation. This sub-component would use similar criteria to the one being supported by APRENDE
I. Teachers would be expected to teach 5 hours every day of the school year, and they would also be
expected to perform in the classroom well enough to motivate students to remain in school. The program
would give teachers US$0.73 per student per month in case they and their students have perfect
attendance. One half of the incentive would accrue to perfect teacher attendance, and one half to perfect
student attendance. Student attendance would be monitored through normal school roll calls, but verified
through spot checks by parent members of the School Council and by municipal representatives of
MECD. Teacher attendance would be verified directly by School Council members and by municipal
MECD representatives. There would be a system of penalties to pro-rate the incentive received at the end
of each month in those cases of less than perfect attendance. Random supervisions would take place in
selected schools. If a school is found to have provided MECD with incorrect information regarding
teacher absenteeism or student drop-out rates, the school would become ineligible to receive incentives
for the next six months. Since monitoring by School Council members is key to the success of this
program, the MECD would give a small stipend to School Council members to compensate them for the
time they spend verifying attendance and preparing the monthly attendance report to the MECD. This
stipend would be less than 20 percent of the teacher's incentive and would also be subject to perfect
attendance by School Council members to all council work sessions, as determined by MECD normns.
PROJECT COMPONENT 3. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND MODERNIZATION -
US$11.9 million (20.4 percent total cost of project)
Objective. This component would improve MECD's managerial performance by: (i) modemizing and
consolidating MECD's monitoring and evaluation system, including the existing academic and non-
academic systems; (ii) fostering the school autonomy model through financing extensive managerial
training for School Council members and principals; (iii) supporting the design and implementation of a
supervision system; (iv) implementing a national evaluation system to assess student performance; and
(v) disseminating information about the school autonomy model so that it becomes more transparent to all
stakeholders.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Indicators and Targets. Some of the general indicators for this component are:
(a)  The operationalization of the Integrated Management System;
(b) The number of School Council members and supervisors trained in autonomy;
(c)  The number of school principals trained in management; and
(d)  The implementation of student achievement tests to all 3rd and 6h graders.
Sub-Component 1: MANAGERIAL TRAINING FOR SCHOOL COUNCIL MEMBERS AND
PRINCIPALS - US$5.30 million (44.54 percent of total cost of component)
Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to improve managerial and decision-making capacity
of School Council members and school principals. About 35,900 council members and 800 supervisors
would receive training about their roles and responsibilities under the autonomous model, another 1,200
principals would receive training on management skills, and 20,300 teachers and parents would receive
training on various areas through the escuelas de padre.
Implementation. All school principals and council members would receive training on administrative and
managerial areas in order to be able to carry out the functions expected of them under the autonomous
schools.
Sub-Component 2: COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGNS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL AUTONOMY
- US$1.25 million (10.5 percent of total cost of component)
Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to encourage greater stakeholder participation in
support of school autonomy and to foster increased accountability in the sector. Particularly, the
campaigns would inform the communities about the autonomy model being adopted by MECD and about
their rights and responsibilities under this model. The overall goal of the campaigns would be (i) to build
support for these new policies to ensure that they are implemented successfully; (ii) to increase the feeling
of ownership for the schools on the part of the community; and (iii) to increase accountability in the
system. In addition to the campaigns, this component would support the dissemination of autonomy-
related information to the Parent's Schools to ensure that parents are aware of their rights and
responsibilities under this management model. This activity would focus on the Atlantic Coast regions-
which tends to be more isolated than other rural areas in Nicaragua and has a high concentration of
indigenous populations-to ensure that their population are also informed about, involved on, and
benefiting from the school autonomy model. Campaigns would, when appropriate, be conducted in
languages spoken in the community; promotional material would be translated into local languages when
necessary.
Implementation. As part of the design of the communication campaigns, MECD would finance
stakeholders assessment in the form of focus groups to determine what are the needs, information gaps,
and concems of the different groups of beneficiaries. Based on these findings, MECD would contract a
consultancy to assist its communications office to develop a campaign that would respond to the needs
identified during the assessment. The assessment would also determine the best way of reaching its
audience, including the kinds of materials that should be developed to reach them.

Sub-Component 3: NATIONAL EVALUATION SYSTEM - US$1.51 million (12.7 percent of total
cost of component)
Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to lay a solid foundation for the National Evaluation
System, on which it can build over time to include a broad range of tests and analyses. At present, while
the MECD has valuable initial experiences in evaluation, it does not have any systematic tools to evaluate
either student and system performance, nor the factors affecting them.
Implementation. In this initial phase, the sub-component would finance the creation of a system to
measure academic achievement among primary school students. Sub-component activities would
include: (i) training of the technical unit; (ii) designing and piloting of the first tests to be applied; (iii)
defining a sample frame adequate for the analytical requirements of the system and associated factors and
their capture; and (iv) applying initial tests, analyzing and disseminating results. The system would begin
with the application of mathematics and Spanish tests in the 3rd and 6 grades by the end of the second
year of the project. Depending on the initial experience, the sub-component may finance the following
additional activities during the third year of the project: achievement tests for students in their final year
of teacher training, and instruments and training in the application of school self-evaluations.
Sub-Component 4: MONITORING AND EVALUATION, INCLUDING ACADEMIC AND NON-
ACADEMIC INFORMATION SYSTEM - US$2.87 million (24.1 percent of total cost of component)
Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to support informed decision making at different
levels of the education system in order to raise education quality and reduce inequalities in service
provision. This sub-component would finance the consolidation of these initial efforts in a structured
national system of monitoring and evaluation, developing a critical management tool for a modem,
decentralized education system. It would consist of two main parts, the monitoring system and the project
impact evaluation, and it would be linked to the National Evaluation System.
Implementation. The Monitoring Systems would strengthen existing monitoring activities within the
MECD, and provide for specific monitoring of this project. Many data collection activities to monitor the
education system are already underway, but the databases are insufficiently analyzed, and data access,
timeliness and accuracy remain problematic. This sub-component would reinforce the various data bases
within the MECD (e.g. SIEC, SISEF, personnel and microlocalization), to facilitate: (i) communication
across data bases (creation of a common coding system); (ii) data accuracy and analysis (optial readers to
free personnel from data entry for data analysis); (iii) reconciliation of data bases (differences among
teachers captured in human resources versus education statistics); (iv) miscellaneous hardware support
(e.g., zip drives for back up of data bases at central level); and (v) carrying out of feasibility studies to
link with data bases external to MECD (e.g., census, LSMS). The sub-component would also identify the
monitoring indicators for this project, and the means for their collection. Project monitoring indicators
would include input, process and output indicators. Finally, this sub-component would support special
studies such as the an evaluation of the autonomy process.
Sub-Component 5: SUPERVISION - US$0.6 million (5.0 percent of total cost of component)
Objectives. This sub-component would support the revision and implementation of a school supervision
system. Supervision activities would focus on the design and implementation of a system in which
synergy between students' achievement results (academic evaluation of students) and teacher-training
programs, teaching learning process and pedagogical evaluation would be maximized.

Country: Nicaragua                                                   Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Implementation. The proposed project would seek to define clear roles and activities in the supervision
system at the central, departmental and school levels. It would improve the existing supervision system
by: (i) integrating supervision activities with the evaluation and teacher training activities, and (ii)
increasing the amount of time employed in monitoring teaching activities. To support the quality
improvements required by the education system, changes would be made in order to: (i) define clear and
simple structures and procedures for the supervision system at the different levels; (ii) upgrade the skills
of the supervisors and their ability to interact with other staff at the MECD; (iii) establish mechanisms by
which supervisors would be able to disseminate results of education program evaluation; and (iv) give
feedback to correct shortcomings in the education process.
The proposed project would finance the provision of: (a) technical assistance to review the organizational
structure, functions, procedures of the supervision system and legal framework at the central,
departmental, and district levels, and to assess the recruitment and selection system of supervisors,
including the incentive system for supervisors working in remote rural schools; (b) training programs
especially designed for the supervisors; and (c) assessment/evaluation of the revised system.
Sub-Component 6: PREPARATION OF APL - US$0.4 million (3.4 percent of total cost of
component)
This component would finance the preparation of a medium term strategy for the preschool and primary
education sector, including the specific investments and financing requirements to implement the strategy.
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION - US$3.1 million (5.2 percent of total cost of project)
This component would finance: (a) operational costs and (b) equipment, office supplies and vehicles.

Nicaragua Second Basic Education Project
Economic Analysis
Summary of benefits and costs:
The economic benefits would results from: (i) increased coverage; (ii) increased efficiency and quality of the
school system; and (iii) the impact of a better educated population on earnings. Increased coverage would be
achieved through maintaining and expanding community pre-schools and the provision of scholarships to poor
children in 4h to 6h grades. The project would achieve increased efficiency of the school system through the
provision of educational materials, the upgrading in school infrastructure, and the improvement in teacher
quality. Teacher quality would improve as a result of the proposed in-service teacher training, provision of
teacher housing in areas of difficult access, improved didactic materials (including school library), and
incentives to those teachers who perform well. The impact of a better-educated population on earnings is both
direct and indirect. People with more and better schooling are more productive and are more likely to earn
higher wages, and the impact of better schooling creates a positive externality for society as a whole. Finally,
the monitoring and evaluation component and the development of an integrated Management Information
System (SIIG) would provide MECD with the required institutional strengthening to enable it to better plan the
allocation of its resources.
l. Context
The Nicaragua Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), formulated in March 1998, states that in the education
sector priority would be given to improving the quality and relevance of primary education, expanding pre-
school and secondary education services, and strengthening the planning and managerial capacity of the MECD.
It also states that mechanisms to achieve these goals include increasing teacher training, providing textbooks,
reforming the curricula, expanding pre-school education in the poorest areas, providing incentives to teachers
and students in remote areas, and decentralizing the primary school system.
II. Cost-benefit analysis
The economic analysis has calculated costs and benefits for the project and for the following sub-components:
(i) improvement and expansion of community pre-school education; (ii) school autonomy; (iii) infrastructure;
and (iv) provision of educational materials. Taken as a whole, the project yields an internal rate of return of 11
percent (excluding the opportunity costs, the internal rate of return is calculated to be 13 percent). Assuming a
10 percent discount rate, the net present value of the project is found to be US$12.7 million (US$32.4 million
excluding the opportunity costs). Under a pessimistic scenario where yearly personal income grows at only 1
percent instead of the baseline 3 percent, the economic return from the project would be 8 percent (10 percent
excluding opportunity costs).
To calculate these returns, the newly available information from the 1998 LSMS Household Survey was used
whenever possible. This information includes the repetition rates per area and the amounts of private spending
on pre-school and primary school. Information regarding earnings was not available so data extrapolated from
the 1995 Poverty Assessment were used as an approximation. A further complication arose with the impact of
Hurricane Mitch and, in particular, its consequences on education performance. However, it is reasonable to
assume that the impact of the project in the light of the damage caused by Mitch would increase the benefits to



Project Appraisal Document                                                                 Page 41
Country: Nicaragua                                                 Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
education rather than reduce them.12  Combined with a generally conservative approach in calculating the
economic return, the reported results can quite comfortably be interpreted as representing lower bounds to real
returns.
General assumptions
*  Population grows at 3 percent annually. The same growth rate is taken as the growth rate of the children
population.
* Nominal growth of national income is 5.2 percent (in US$ denomination). Government spending per
student and private spending on education grow at the same rate. Personal income is assumed to grow at 3
percent annually, conservatively.
* Yearly earnings of uneducated people is US$300 and for those who complete primary school it is US$500
annually (these figures are expected earnings). These numbers are calculated by extrapolating the numbers
reported in the 1995 Poverty Assessment and then converted into US dollars. A working life of 45 years is
assumed throughout the calculations.
*  The baseline repetition and dropout rates are those found from the analysis of the 1998 LSMS Household
Survey. In particular, different rates were used depending on whether a sub-component applies to the entire
school system (e.g. provision of textbooks), to autonomous public schools (for school autonomy), etc.
•  The net present values are calculated using a 10 percent discount rate.
* The economic returns as calculated for the individual components should be thought of as ceteris paribus
calculations. To calculate the overall economic impact of the project, one cannot simply add the costs and
benefits from the sub-components, since they are neither independent nor additive. For example, in
principle a child can benefit from the project by attending community pre-schools and later on go to a
rehabilitated autonomous school with new textbooks. Or, the impact on school performance of having both
textbooks and school autonomy is not necessarily equal to the sum of the individual (ceteris paribus)
effects. To perform some aggregation and find a reasonable estimate of the overall economic return of the
project, a weighting of the various costs and benefits of the individual sub-components was applied (with
the exception of the direct project costs, that were left unweighted), with the weights determined by the
number of children affected by each sub-component. This methodology provides a correction for the non-
independence of the project (children are not double counted). The non-additivity problem, which may also
be thought of as a question on the existence of returns-to-scale in the education sector, was taken care of by
applying an "externality factor" to the various costs and benefits (other than direct project costs). An
externality factor of I is the case of pure additivity, a factor greater than one implies that the impact of the
project is larger than the sum of the impact of the sub-components individually, etc. For the baseline
scenario we applied a factor of 1.1.
1. Improving and Expanding Pre-school Education
The baseline scenario for this sub-component yields an economic return of 14 percent (24 percent without
opportunity costs): a discount factor of 10 percent yields a net present value of US$ 31.4 million (US$ 69.5
million without opportunity costs). Over a 15 year horizon, this sub-component would lead to an additional
46,500 students graduated from primary school, with 30,100 less repetitors and 89,200 less dropouts. In
addition to the general assumptions, it was assumed that without the project, children entering pre-school are 20
percent less likely to dropout or to repeat their grade, reflecting the better early childhood development results
from attending pre-school. With the project, the improved performance was taken to be 25 percent. The impact
of these improvements are especially important for the first grade, where (for rural areas) the repetition rate is
20.6 percent and the dropout rate is 30.5 percent.
12 For example, the infrastructure component would further contribute to the rebuilding effort that was started with the
emergency credit approved by the World Bank earlier in 1999.



Project Appraisal Document                                                               Page 42
Country: Nicaragua                                               Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
In a pessimistic scenario where personal incomes grow at only 1 percent annually and there are no additional
performance gains (repetition and dropout rates) from the project, the respective rates of return drop to 7 percent
and 11 percent respectively.
2. Provision of Educational Materials
This sub-component includes provision of textbooks (with special attention to indigenous groups and ethnic
minorities), didactic materials, school library, maps for use in the classroom, etc. Under the baseline scenario,
the rate of return is estimated at 22 percent (25 percent excluding opportunity costs), with net present values of
US$68.5 million and US$79.4 million, including and excluding opportunity costs respectively. Under the
baseline scenario, we assume a 10 percent improvement in repetition rates and a 5 percent improvement in the
dropout rates. Contrary to the pre-school component, which affects new pre-school trained entrants in primary
school only, the educational materials sub-component affects both the new entrants and the already enrolled
school population. This helps explain the higher amounts of net present value (additional benefits begin
materializing earlier in the future). Taken over a 15 year horizon, this sub-component would lead to 47,700
extra students graduated, with positive effects on repetition and dropout of 95,800 and 68,400 students
respectively.
In a pessimistic scenario where personal incomes grow at only 1 percent annually and the performance gains are
5 percent for both repetition and dropout rates, the economic returns are measured at 12 percent at 18 percent,
respectively with and without opportunity costs.
3. Improved Infrastructure
The economic return for this sub-component was calculated for both school repair and teacher housing
Construction, and was found to be 12 percent and 16 percent (with and without opportunity costs respectively),
with net present values of US$0.68 million and US$1.9 million. Taken over 15 years, it would lead to an
additional 1,211 students graduated, 529 fewer repetitors and 2,230 fewer dropouts.
To calculate the number of students affected, we applied the same proportion of schools repaired under the
project to the school population. In addition to the general assumptions, we assume that repaired schools require
an additional maintenance cost of 5 percent per year (alternatively interpreted as the depreciation rate).
However, in the alternative scenario of a wait-and-see approach to school rehabilitation, the required repairs
would increase to 20 percent per year. Furthermore it was assumed that postponing the required repairs would
not only affect the value of school infrastructure, but would also have a negative impact on school performance,
which in the baseline scenario was set at a 15 percent increase of both repetition and dropout rates. Under the
project, each of these rates would improve by 10 percent.
Under a pessimistic scenario, with only 1 percent growth in yearly earnings, a 10 percent increase in repetition
and dropout rates without the project, and a 5 percent decrease in those rates with the project, the economic
returns would be 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively with and without opportunity costs.
4. School autonomy
Of the four sub-components, the school autonomy component was the most challenging to calculate an
economic rate of return. The estimation and evaluation of the impact of decentralization on the school system is
subject of ongoing research and, as of now, there is not yet any information known on the economic impact of



Project Appraisal Document                                                                     Page 43
Country: Nicaragua                                                   Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
the school decentralization effort. However, a recent study by King (1998) shows that children in decentralized
schools perform better on tests that involve language and math skills.'3 Clearly, improved performance should
be reflected in lower repetition rates, and also in lower dropout rates.14
The baseline scenario of the impact of school autonomy gives an economic return of 20 percent, with a net
present value of US$55.7 million (when opportunity costs are excluded, the economic return would be 26
percent and the net present value US$68.4 million). This scenario assumes improvements in repetition and
dropout rates of 10 percent, which can be considered fairly conservative. From the LSMS Household Survey
data repetition rates in first grade were found to be equal to 21.3 percent in traditional public schools and 17.7
percent in autonomous public schools. For the second grade, these rates are 15.4 percent and 8.87 percent
respectively, and autonomous public schools do consistently better all the way up to sixth grade (with repetition
rates of 4.2 percent versus 3.6 percent). The baseline scenario implies that over a fifteen year horizon, 36,580
additional children would graduate, and there would be 19,900 less repetitors and 36,570 less dropouts.
Under a pessimistic scenario of only I percent yearly growth in personal incomes and only 5 percent
improvement in repetition and dropout rates, the economic return of this sub-component would be 11 percent
and 13 percent, respectively including and excluding opportunity costs.
13 To be precise, a distinction was made between dejure and defacto autonomy. We assume throughout that decentralized
schools are defacto decentralized.
14 A preliminary look at the 1998 LSMS data shows a fairly large amount of overage children in primary education.
Overage children are more likely to drop out of school.

Total project costs. Total project costs (including contingencies) for the project are US$58.4 million, 90
percent of which (US$52.5 million) would be funded by IDA and the remaining 10 percent (US$5.9
million) by the GoN. Table 7 gives the breakdown of the project funding per project year and also reports
the required funds for the 5 years following completion of the project, assuming that the GoN would
continue to fund the various components of the project. It is estimated that the continuation of the project
components beyond the three-year horizon of the project would add, yearly, an additional US$14 million
to the budget of the MECD.15

Fiscal Impact of the Project on MECD's Budget
Table 8 gives an overview of both GDP and the MECD budget with an 8 year horizon projection.16 These
amounts correspond to the baseline numbers used to evaluate the impact of the proposed project
APRENDE I on the overall budget of the MECD. It is noteworthy that the total baseline MECD budget
15 This amount was obtained by assuming for example that textbook losses and deteriorations would be financed, school
rehabilitation would proceed at the same pace, consultants would still be responsible for the implementation of the
components, etc. Examples of categories that are not taken into account for the cost calculations beyond the project
implementation period of three years include study trips, purchases of office equipment, PCU support staff, and start-up
costs for the project, i.e., translations for textbooks for indigenous population.
16 To convert the budget from C6rdobas to dollars, the IMF projected exchange rate was used. After 2002, it is held
constant at 13.34. The growth rate in the overall budget of MECD is taken to be 13 percent for 1999, 15 percent for 2000,
5.5 percent for 2001, and 5.2 percent for the subsequent years. The latter rate is equal to the growth rate of GDP used
throughout the calculations.

shows a decline between 2000 and 2002, reflecting not only the impact from the depreciating C6rdoba,
but also the impact of the ESAF program in public spending as a consequence of Nicaragua's adjustnent
plan to qualify for the HIPC initiative.

NB: the nominal growth rate of GDP (in US$) is assumed to be constant at 5.2 percent.
The budgetary impact of the proposed project is shown in Table 9. During the lifetime of the project and
given the counterpart funding requirements the overall MECD budget stays constant at a level around
US$74 million. In the fourth year however, the budget would jump to nearly US$90 million, an increase
of 18.7 percent compared to the baseline or 21.8 percent overall increase (baseline growth plus
incremental growth due to the project). After the fourth year, the year-to-year increase in the budget
would stabilize between 4 percent and 5 percent (between 15 percent and 17 percent compared to the
baseline evolution). Measured as a percentage of GDP, the impact of the project would bring the
education budget from 2.76 percent to about 3.2 percent.

Impact of scholarship Fondo APRENDE. The project APRENDE II would introduce a scholarship
program for poor and well perforning children in 4 - 6a grades who are likely to drop out due to lack of
resources. The project would make available scholarships in the amount of US$150 in 550 schools (to be
given to at least two children, plus an additional small incentive for the school to be used to purchase
educational materials). As long as the conditions are met, the student would keep receiving the
scholarship each year for three years. Once the scholarship program operates at full speed, this would
imply that a total of three times 1,100 scholarship packages would be granted, namely 1,100 new ones
and 1,100 for those in their second and third year of recipients (a total of 3,300). This amounts to
US$297,000. The sustainability of the scholarship program is raised along two dimensions. First, in the
second and third year of the project, scholarships would be granted to children who would graduate from
primary school after project completion. This would amount to a cost of US$198,000 in the first year
after the end of APRENDE II and US$99,000 in the following year. The cost of these scholarships would
then be carried by the MECD's budget. Second, if the MECD would continue the program then it needs
to have available funding for 1,650 "scholarship packages" yearly, which corresponds to US$297,000.
Impact of performance-based incentives.  The project would fund teacher incentives in both
community-based preschools and in autonomous primary schools. For the community preschool teachers
this corresponds to an average yearly incentive of US$190, and for the primary school teachers the
average yearly performance-based incentive would be US$140.'7 The total amount of incentives during
the project would be US$2.63 million in the first year, US$3.03 million in the second year and US$4.41
17 Cornmunity preschool teachers receive no salary for their work while primary school teachers receive their regular salary
plus the annual incentive.

million in the final year of the project.18 IDA would fund US$5.3 million, the rest of which would be
counterpart funding. After the end of APRENDE II the MECD would have to pay the full amount of
US$4 million (corresponding to 4.5 percent of its budget). Table 10 gives the impact of the incentive
program on the budget of the MECD with alternative growth scenarios for the incentives. If the yearly
increase is 5 percent, then after the end of the project the total amount of incentives would be US$4.6
million, or US$630,000 more than in the baseline scenario of no increase in the average yearly amount of
incentive.

Financing and sustainability. It was found that the incremental impact of the project on the MECD
budget would be modest during the lifetime of the project and maintain the MECD budget around US$74
million per year (with yearly impact US$1.9 million in year 1, US$3.0 million in year 2, and US$1.8
million in the final year of the project). The education budget would face a challenge starting in the
fourth year, with a jump in the budget by about US$14 million, corresponding to an increase of 18.6
percent. It would probably be a political challenge to reorient this amount of funds from other sectors to
the education budget. As such, much will depend on the outcome of the HPC initiative and the amount
of debt relief/rescheduling that would release debt-service payments for the social sectors. In the positive
event that Nicaragua qualifies for debt relief, this would release between US$50 million and US$120
million per year. Using those bounds as benchmarks, this would imply that between 11 percent and 28
percent of the available extra funding would have to be reserved for the incremental spending from the
project.
18 The increase in the amounts is due largely to the increase in the number of autonomous schools, so that more teachers
will become eligible for performance-based incentives. The project foresees a total of 5,737 community-based preschool
teachers and 20,800 primary school teachers eligible for incentives by the third year of the project.

(h)  Includes cost of diverse information media to support communication campaigns to be contracted in
contracts no larger than US$30,000 under shopping procedures.
(i)  Funds would finance consultants' services to design and implement the school autonomy carnpaign.
(j) Includes incentives for school autonomy and pre-school teachers, up to an aggregate of US$6.7 million
and US$3.0 million, respectively. The incentives component does not involve procurement actions and
would be regulated by the Operational Manual.
(k)  Direct purchase of student works books to be procured from editorial homes whose bids were selected
competitively under the first project. For purposes of financing and disbursemeynts (operational costs),
these materials would be contracted under separate contracts from qualified suppliers.
(I)  Includes cost of Operation and Maintenance of computing, office and audiovisual equipment and
replacement vehicles purchased under the ongoing project and under the supplemental credit 2689-1-NI,
and other operational incremental costs related to the administration of the project. It also includes cost
of salaries of support staff in the PCU.
Key Procurement Activities
The project would finance (under the SIMCEP system) a substantial amount of small works for substitution,
replacement and rehabilitation, including furniture, of school infrastructure and teachers' houses. A key
institutional strengthening procurement activity would be the design and installation of the MECD MIS,
procured under a design and install contract of an integral customized solution. This activity would include
equipping information posts and training end users at central and local levels. The project would also finance
direct purchases of additional quantities of textbooks and teachers' guides and students' workbooks to meet
increments in school enrollment and replenishments (reposiciones). Only editorial homes whose textbooks were
selected competitively would be asked to submit quotations for additional supplies. Other educational materials
such as library books, fungible school and students educational packages and diverse audiovisual materials
would be procured and distributed annually as project advances into school autonomy. QBCS would be used for

all consultant services with firms including two major contracts to evaluate school achievement and design and
implementation of a communication campaign in develop public awareness and community participation mainly
in the school autonomy component. Funds include purchases of media time and materials to support
information activities.
Procedures
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's guidelines on
procurement of goods, works and services -- Guidelines: Procurement under IDA Credits and IDA Credits
(January 1995, as revised Jan./Aug. 1996, and Sept. 1997), and Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised Sept. 1997 and Jan. 1999). When ICB
procedures are used, national preference would apply to goods manufactured in Nicaragua, as specified in
Appendix 2 of Guidelines. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would include in the standard bidding
documents provisions for: (a) awards to lowest evaluated bidder, (b) foreign bidders to be allowed to bid and
not required to be registered in Nicaragua to participate in NCB. MECD would issue a simplified procurement
document for small works to detail procedures and solicit quotations under SIMCEP. This document would be
included in the Operational Manual. Detailed schedules in the Procurement Plan for the Project reflect the
procurement methodologies and thresholds that may apply to other purchases throughout project life. The
Operational Manual would be updated to reflect thresholds and procedures required for all procurement under
the Project.

whose inputs are critical
I to project.
Procurement Thresholds
Thresholds for goods and works shown in Table B above are justified on the basis of the nature of the project
and its development objectives. In the case of small works, thresholds for three quotations and direct
contracting (US$50,000 and US$20,000, respectively) are proposed based on costs obtained in the first project,
executed through FISE and the SIMCEP pilot. Direct contracting would apply only under exceptional
circumstances when there is In contrast to first Education project, where FISE was the executing agency, under
the proposed project the Local School Councils would undertake directly the task of executing the infrastructure
component, with MECD supervision and technical support, expanding the pilot of SIMCEP. The Local School
Councils would be responsible for engaging locally-based contractors under technical and administrative
conditions clearly defined in the Operational Manual for the component. Shopping threshold in goods and
services, proposed at US$30,000, is justified also on the basis of experience during the first project as PCU
demonstrated application of a lower threshold (US$25,000) in a satisfactory manner.
Prior Review Arrangements
Prior review arrangements outlined in Table B above would result in ex-ante review by the IDA of
approximately 60 percent of all IDA-financed contracts by value, since a substantial amount of Project costs
includes small works under SIMCEP, supervision, training stipends, school autonomy scholarships and grants,
incentives, and other incremental operational costs. Concurrent quarterly audits, in addition to the annual
audit, would be carried out during the life of the Project to cover most recurrent costs, including transfers of
scholarships and grants to Local School Councils.
Procurement Documents
Goods and Works. All standard documentation (as published by the IDA), on procurement of goods under
ICB and NCB and evaluation forms, is now in use in MECD under the ongoing Basic Education Project and
the Supplemental Credit. MECD would introduce minor adjustments required for the new operation. Under
SIMCEP, the MECD would issue a model document (to be included in the Operational Manual) to solicit
quotations and contract to be implemented by Local School Councils.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Consultants' Contracts. MECD submitted during negotiations a standard RFP to be used under the new
project. In view of the nature and size of a number of consulting services under the project, MECD would use
simplified forms of contracts for small contracts with national firms costing less than US$100,000, and for all
services contracted with national and international consultants, as agreed with the IDA. A lump sum standard
contract, as issued by IDA, would be used for services costing more than US$100,000 equivalent.
MECD's procurement capacity
For goods and consultants' services contracts: In addition to the findings of the procurement assessment
conducted for the project, MECD's procurement capacity in the PCU has grown substantially under the
ongoing project, especially to conduct ICB procurement for goods and services. Nonetheless, turnover of staff
weakened the procurement function in the PCU especially during 1998. As a result of the strengthening
arrangements made in the PCU under the Supplemental Credit, the PCU now has a procurement professional
who is being groomed to become a specialist in the project. Several actions still need to be taken by the
MECD to strengthen the efficiency, accountability and performance in the PCU. Based on the risk assessment
report, an action plan has been agreed with MECD during negotiations. Compliance with it is a condition for
effectiveness.
For civil works contracts: Civil work contracts, except those under the pilot of SIMCEP, were managed by
FISE under the ongoing project. The infrastructure team in the PCU, however, acquired substantial experience
in coordinating and supervising the implementation of SIMCEP under the ongoing project. In view of the fact
the all civil works in the proposed project would be done under SIMCEP, the team would be strengthened with
external technical assistance to support Local School Councils in supervising infrastructure activities
contracted by Local School Councils. The PCU would be responsible for ensuring the timely provision of
qualified external technical assistance to Local School Councils to prepare feasibility studies under their
subprojects and train them to administer contracts. It would also be expected that the PCU would hire extemal
temporary technical assistance of individual consultants, as required during peak times in the works program.
At no time this unit would engage itself directly in the production of feasibility studies or other engineering
tasks that can be provided by external contractors.
The Operational Manual (OM) would be updated and adopted by the MECD, by effectiveness to ensure
acceptable procedures for procurement, accounting, disbursement and auditing, as agreed for all IDA operations.
The OM would also be updated to include specific operating and control mechanisms agreed under the financial
and physical monitoring system (FMS), and the manuals Fondo Aprende (scholarships) and Fondo Sonrisa
(grants).

ADMINISTRATION OF DISBURSEMENTS
The proposed allocation of proceeds in the credit is shown in Table C above. Disbursements would not be made
for works, goods and services that have been procured from ineligible sources or that do not meet the IDA's
procurement and consultants' guidelines.
During the first two quarters of project implementation, disbursements would be made in accordance with the
guidelines set out in the Disbursement Procedures Handbook. By the end of the second quarter of project
implementation, or earlier if the borrower is LACI compliant and requests it, the PMRs would serve as
disbursement requests.



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 55
Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
Once the borrower becomes LACI compliant, and if requested by the Government, disbursements would be in
accordance with guidelines set forth in the LACI Implementation Handbook. Each application for withdrawal
from the Credit Account would be supported by a Project Management Report (PMR) or such other documents
and evidence as the Association may request. PMRs should be submitted within 45 days of the preceding
quarter. Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal, the Association, on behalf of the Borrower, shall
withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into the Special Account an amount equal to the lesser of the
following: (a) the amount requested; and (b) the arnount the Association has determined, based on the PMR
accompanying the application, is required to be deposited in order to finance eligible expenditures during the six
month period following the date of the report. MECD would be responsible for preparing withdrawal
applications and the related PMRs. All supporting documentation authenticating the expenditures reported in
the PMRs would be maintained by MECD and made available for review by independent auditors and by IDA
supervision missions. Direct Payments and Special Commitments should be clearly identified in the PMRs and
MECD shall include the documentation required for these types of payments. Transfers for the school grants
would be made in accordance with the agreed disbursement mechanisms and auditing requirements included in
the agreements signed by the school principal and the president of the School Council (consejo escolar) with
MECD. MECD would be responsible for the follow-up and accountability of the school grants (Becas
APRENDE and Fondo Sonrisa) and SIMCEP funds.
Special Account (SA). A separate account would be opened by GoN for the credit to ensure
administrative clarity and hence efficient processing of disbursements during the life of the project. This
account would be opened at a commercial bank in Nicaragua, under conditions acceptable to the IDA with an
authorized allocation for non-LACI of US$5.0 million. Disbursement and payments to suppliers would be
processed in MECD or procurement agents in accordance with the Credit requirements, independently of other
internal procedures in MECD in the LACI disbursement Special Account. The authorized initial allocation and
any subsequent disbursements from the credit account would be the estimated eligible expenditures during the
six-month period reported in the PMR, not to exceed US$10.5 million.
Revolving Fund. The MOF would provide sufficient funds for the operation of the project through a
separate revolving fund (fondo rotatorio), to be replenished quarterly. A revolving fund would be opened for
purposes of providing financing for counterpart funds of GoN. Funds in the revolving fund would be deposited
in the same commercial bank selected for IDA's SA and would be managed by the PCU. The initial deposit and
replenishments to this account would be quarterly and to match the requirements for counterpart financing
associated to the disbursement applications or PMR for the period. The initial deposit of US$0.25 million
would be a condition of effectiveness.
Disbursement documentation
(a) Full documentation would be required to disburse all contracts under ICB procedures for
goods and QCBS contracts, regardless of cost, and the first two contracts for works for quotations solicited by
School Councils under SIMCEP. Disbursements for NCB contracts for goods, and contracts with consulting
firms and individuals costing less than $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. IDA would also require full
documentation for contracts and amendments thereof of all consultants (key) on fixed-term in the PCU) and
other consultants providing technical assistance to line managers in MECD, as specifically agreed with IDA.
Full documentation would include terms of reference, contract and curriculum vitae of the proposed service.
(b) IDA would not require documentation for expenditures related to: (i) training activities; (ii)
incentives; (iii) incremental costs of operation and maintenance of office and computing equipment and
vehicles; and (iv) transfers to School Councils for scholarships and grants.

Annex 8
Social Assessment
A Social Assessment was carried out between February and June, 1999 to assist in the preparation and
design of the project. It includes three parts. The first part includes a desk review of the Education
sector in Basic Education in the light of available data on coverage, achievements and other sectoral
issues. A discussion of the Decentralization Pyramid and stakeholder analysis is followed by a review of
studies carried out between 1995-1999 on School Autonomy in Nicaragua. Finally, an ethno-linguistic
profile of Nicaragua discusses six ethnic groups, and the two projects which specialize in bilingual
education for these groups. The second part includes the results and recommendations of the study on
"Assessment of the Supply of Preschools in Nicaragua" carried out between December and April, 1999 as
part of implementation of APRENDE I. The third part discusses the results and recommendations of the
study on Participatory Urban/Rural Appraisal carried out between April and June, 1999. Conclusions and
implications for project design and two Participation Plans for School Autonomy and the
Indigenous/Creole are presented at the end of this Social Assessment. The Indigenous/Creole Strategy is
proposed in compliance with World Bank O.D. 4.20 regarding Indigenous Peoples Development.
Main Issues
Targeting and Coverage. Despite all efforts by the MECD in the past decade, low coverage continues to
be a major issue: only 30 percent of preschool age children, 78 percent of primary school-age, and 27
percent youths are enrolled in school. Most preschools are located in urban and peri-urban areas, leaving
a large deficit of schools in rural areas. In the Central region and the Atlantic Coast regions, the situation
is more acute, especially for Jinotega, the Northern Autonomous Atlantic Region (RAAN), the Southern
Autonomous Atlantic Region (RAAS) and the Rio San Juan department, characterized by geographic
isolation, multi-cultural and multi-lingual population.
Lack of an Educational Evaluation System. The Participatory Urban/Rural Appraisals for preschools
and primary schools highlight a concern previously brought up by studies on School Autonomy between
1995-1999 which underline the need for an institutionalized evaluation system for students and teachers
capable of providing guidelines and direction to the education system.
Repetition, drop-out rates and absenteeism. Preliminary LSMS 1998 data show the main reasons for
not attending school are economic (51 percent), followed by lack of supply of schools (21 percent), and
difficulty in access to a school (20 percent). Previous studies assert the common factors impacting
repetition and drop-out is to live in rural areas, and to have parents with little (2nd grade in rural areas) or
no schooling
Decentralization And School Autonomy: Institutional and stakeholder analysis
Since 1993 one of the major strategies implemented by the MECD to strengthen the school system is
School Autonomy. This Social Assessment analyses the roles of the education stakeholders included in
the five-stage pyramid: (i) the MECD National Council; (ii) the assembly of MECD Department
Councils; (iii) MECD Department Councils and its delegates; (iv) MECD Municipal Councils and its
delegates; and (v) autonomous schools represented by School Councils. Whereas rules and regulations
are set up by the first three levels, the fourth one implements said rules and passes them on to the
beneficiaries (fifth level). Most of the consultations include the last two levels (municipal delegates,
School Councils, parents, teachers, students and communities at large).

Ethno-linguistic profile of Nicaragua
Some of the poorest segments of the population include the indigenous peoples. About 96 percent of the
indigenous and 98 percent of the ethnic minorities live in the Atlantic Coast regions, where together they
account for about 27 percent of the population. The population of the Atlantic Coast regions corresponds
to some 12 percent of the total population of Nicaragua. Although there is no official data on the socio-
economic conditions of the different groups, research done by other World Bank assessments show that
basic services such as education, health, water and sanitation are scarce in these geographic areas. The
59,000 km2 of the autonomous regions of Atlantic North and South are characterized by a population
density of about 6 inhabitants per square kilometer. This together with the difficult access to those areas
make provision of goods and services to this area extremely costly (e.g. according to FISE the cost of
replacing a classroom in this area is at least twice as high as in the Pacific coast). In a different
geographic context, the Sutiaba group of Le6n has undergone the largest process of acculturation and co-
inhabitation with mestizo population.   Project assessments calculate that there are over 270
indigenous/afro-Nicaraguan communities, many of which are still monolingual and continue to keep the
social stratification of their ancestors, e.g. Elders Councils. Some of the characteristics of these groups
include:
* The Miskito is the largest ethnic group; it is spread in the municipalities of Waspan, Puerto
Cabezas, Prinzapolka and several municipalities of Jinotega. Although in smaller numbers,
they also live in the department of RAAS.
* The Mayangna (or Sumu)19 distinguish themselves as belonging to one of three sub-groups
(Panamahka, Itwhka and Ulwa). They live in small linguistic islands mostly in RAAN (but
also Jinotega and RAAS) and speak Mayangna.
* The Rama. As their language-the Rama-is almost extinct, they speak Creole English and
Spanish. They live in the island of Rama Cay, south of Bluefields.
* The Garifuna or Afro-Caribbean, of African origin, are believed to have been brought to
Central America by British colonizers in the XIX century. Their ethnic mix with indigenous
differentiates them from the English Creole. Many Garifunas also speak Creole English.
* The Creole. It is the oldest group on the Atlantic Region. They are believed to have
originated in the survivors of Spanish galleons which failed during Spanish Colonization in the
XVI century. They live mainly in RAAS, in and around Bluefields.
* The Mestizos on the Atlantic Coast regions originate in the Pacific Region of Nicaragua.
Migration from the Pacific started in the XIX century and never stopped. It promoted
settlements of banana plantations and mining. During the 1960's the Agrarian Reform invited
mestizo dwellers to move to the Atlantic Coast regions. During the past two decades the lumber
industry has attracted newcomers.
* There are approximately 36,000 Sutiabas and people of Sutiaba background. In the Pacific
region, the Sutiabas account for 17 percent of the population of the department of Le6n. They
live mostly in the Sutiaba district and in 24 settlements in Western Le6n and in 9 other
settlements, intermingled with mestizos. The Sutiaba language is extinct for the most part, but
Sutiaba social stratification persists in their communities.
19 Although it is common, the use of the word "sumu" to refer to the ethnic group is discouraged as it was used by Miskitos
to mean "lazy, stupid".

Legal Basis for Bilingual Education in Nicaragua. MECD guidelines on Education corroborate the
commitment of the central Government to "the development of bilingual and intercultural programs which
respond to the needs of ethnic groups." Law 162 of the Constitution (1993), Art. 2 states "The Government
would provide the necessary resources for bilingual programs and would dictate norms to ensure no Nicaraguan
is subject of discrimination per language."
The Participatory Urban/Rural Appraisal (PU/RA)
Two PRA exercises were carried out. The purpose of the first one was to analyze the reasons for success or
failure of specific preschools chosen for highest enrollment and highest drop-out rates between 1996 and 1998
(Castro, 1998). The second PRA consisted of a series of consultations (70 focus groups and 120 interviews) in
16 municipalities across 11 departments. The Participatory Urban Rural Assessment looked at 10 autonomous
and 8 non-autonomous schools, 5 in urban areas and 13 in rural areas. It was targeted to urban and rural
municipalities in geographic locations not covered by previous studies (which were carried out mostly in urban
areas). The present Social Assessment capitalizes on some conclusions from previous studies but mainly
explores topics from the point of view of the main stakeholders and beneficiaries, that is: teachers, parents,
councils, school principals, municipal delegates, and students.
Conclusions of the Social Assessment
The following paragraphs summarize the main conclusions of the Social Assessment that are relevant for the
design of this project.
*   Conceptually, the decentralization of education as laid out by the Government was two-fold:
administrative and pedagogical. However, seven years into the process, the results of the assessment
show it is understood and perceived both by central MECD and beneficiaries as almost specifically
"administrative."
* One of the achievements of most autonomous and some non-autonomous schools is the opportunity
offered to parents for "participation" in monitoring teachers' and students' attendance, thus increasing
retention rates. Participation in "administrative matters" is more common in large, wealthier schools
which collect voluntary cuotas and donations from the community. Participation in administrative
matters is less likely to occur in poor communities, living from subsistence agriculture and in some
degree of geographic isolation, characterized by smaller schools belonging to NERAs.
* No clear cases of "pedagogical" participation promoted by autonomy have been found in the
communities participating in this Social Assessment. However, some cases were found in non-
autonomous schools (somewhat similar to community-based schools in other countries) where teachers
have traditionally promoted academic activities involving parents.
*   Another achievement of autonomy often cited is "student retention" due to the teacher incentive
system. Several of the schools visited have put in place mechanisms such as buying shoes for the
students and making home visits to sick children to ensure they would not drop out. However, some
schools were also found to be under-reporting registration at the beginning of the school year.
*   One of the main problems identified in the autonomous schools visited is the lack of accurate
information on rules and regulations goveming school autonomy. Absence of clear rules promotes
misuse and abuse of power by some principals, delegates and more influential parents in the parent
council. For the communities consulted, it is not clear whether School Councils have the right to make
decisions on hiring and firing of teachers and principal, approving and rejecting educational plans, etc.
Therefore, final decisions are often left to the school principal and municipal delegate. The later is often
perceived to be entitled to make unilateral decisions.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
*   Consultations with parents and teachers show discontent with the automatic promotion system
saying that it artificially promotes children and it is perceived as having negative long-term results.
Many parents are in favor of repetition if their children have not learned.
*   The underlying problem of repetition and drop-out in the autonomous and non-autonomous,
mestizo and indigenous/Creole schools in the PRA sample is "poverty," that goes from being deprived
of a minimum diet, shoes, school supplies (for the children) to being illiterate (for the parents). Poverty
causes many children to join the labor force at the age of seven years.
Recommendations for Project Design
On the Evaluation of Decentralization of Education. Given the lack of information and the level of
misinformation about school autonomy, it is recommended that, before the communication campaign starts, the
school autonomy regime be revisited and evaluated by the beneficiaries, that is, teachers, students, parents,
school Councils, principals and municipal delegates. It is recommended this be done in two workshops with
representatives of different schools chosen randomly: (i) one with representatives of the Pacific and Central
Regions; and (ii) one with representatives of the Atlantic and indigenous communities of the Central Regiorn
The purpose of the Workshops would be to (i) evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the decentralized
system for each group of stakeholders and their communities and (ii) to discuss the rules, rights and duties of
each group of stakeholders as agreed on with the MECD. The workshops would provide the information needed
for the design and implementation of the communication campaign. Additionally, it is recommended that copies
of the norms be disseminated to all stakeholders, to avoid misinterpretations.
In order to achieve the democratic aims of decentralization, mechanisms should be created for parents, teachers
and students of the School Councils to hold consultations and interaction with the groups they represent, as a
horizontal mechanism of information dissemination.
On training of School Councils, teachers, municipal delegates and parents. To encourage School Council
accountability (including financial) to the school community, it is recommended that an easy-to-handle
mechanism be incorporated in the operational manual with clear instructions of how to use it.
Training is recommended for municipal delegates on their rights and duties. A special "sensitization module" is
recommended for those delegates dealing with schools in communities experiencing extreme poverty, and
indigenous groups to face problems and find solutions.
It is recommended (on parents request) that the Parents' School program proposed by this project be
implemented in "rural and indigenous schools" as well, since it is those excluded communities which show the
biggest problems.
On "voluntary contributions" by parents. It is recommended that all actors involved in autonomy be aware
of the voluntary nature of the contributions.
Recommendations for Schools with Indigenous/Creole population
National Forum. As schools in extremely poor communities and/or with indigenous/Creole population seem to
either disagree with autonomy or not know enough about it, it is recommended that a national forum be held
with the participation of all ethnic groups, in order to leam more about school autonomy before subscribing to it.

Country: Nicaragua                                             Project Title: Second Basic Education Project
This forum may be organized by PEBI, BASE II, URACCAN and BICU, the Earth Council, NGOs, etc. and
with consultations/presence of the Council of Elders. Another product of the forum may be the creation or
strengthening of a network of Indigenous Academic Councils, which would become the appropriate forum for
discussion of education issues in accordance with their cultural context and values.
Training of "Parents' Schools". In multi-ethnic schools it is recommended School Councils be asked to
identify parents of indigenous children in order to include them in the training of "Schools for Parents."
Training of Indigenous Teachers. It is particularly important that the group of 700 bilingual (mostly
indigenous) teachers be incorporated in Training for Bilingual Education every year and for the life of the
project.
Textbooks and materials in Miskito, Mayangna and Creole. It is suggested teachers and parents be involved
and consulted for the design of ieaching materials in Spanish as well as the indigenous languages so texts may
be used by parents and students alike.
Programs Currently Under Implementation Targeting the Ethnic Minorities and Atlantic Coast
MECD has two projects currently in place that address bilingual education. The first one, the Program of
Bilingual Education (PEBI) being implemented since 1994, covers 117 schools and 18,651 children who are
monolingual (12,687 Miskitos, 1,210 Sumus, and 4,754 Creoles in Il" through 40 grade, and 724 additional
Creoles in 5th through 6h1 grade). Currently it finances textbooks and working books for maternal language,
Mathematics, and Spanish as a second language for indigenous children grades 1 through 4, and for other ethnic
minorities grades 1 through 6. The target is to have bilingual education for all ethnic groups until grade 6.
APRENDE II would finance the production and development of textbooks for bilingual education in
grades 1 through 6. The major issues faced by the PEBI program are (i) lack of bilingual teachers, and (ii) lack
of interactive methodology in primary schools. These two issues are being addressed by BASE II.
The second project is BASE II, funded by a USAID grant amounting to US$18.5 million to be spent in 4
years, and has one component, out of 4, that aims at developing a bilingual curriculum for schools, revising the
Curriculum of Normal Schools in the Atlantic Coast regions, establishing at least 20 escuelas modelo in the
Atlantic Coast regions and providing teacher training in bilingual education. The in-service sub-component of
the APRENDE II project, to be financed by the IDA credit, was designed in coordination with BASE to avoid
any duplication of efforts and maximize the impact of these type of interventions. The BASE project focuses
on multi-grade schools and interactive teaching methodology (Escuela Nueva).

School Autonomy in Nicaragua
Historic Background
Since 1993, Nicaragua/MECD has been implementing a program of school autonomy. School autonomy is seen
as a key instrument to achieve three operational goals: (i) include parents and civil society in school
management-as a way to reinforce democracy and increase social accountability; (ii) give parents more voice
and control over the education of their children; and (iii) increase operational efficiency. By providing financial
and operational autonomy to public schools, the MECD sought coherence with the principles of equity,
efficiency, and accountability. Moreover, school autonomy was viewed as a first step for improving education
quality by nurturing the personal incentives of parents and teachers to work together.
How does School Autonomy work in Nicaragua
School autonomy in Nicaragua is based on three elements: (i) a fiscal transfer to schools based on technical and
equity criteria; (ii) the parental control of the fiscal transfer at the school level; and (iii) the authority of the
School Council over hiring and firing decisions. While school autonomy has been a government policy since
1993, the School Autonomy Law which would regulate this decentralization in the education sector has not yet
been approved by the National Assembly. Thus, to implement the process, MECD, which remains legally
responsible for all public schools, delegates to the principals' of autonomous schools the decision-making power
to run the school as autonomous centers.
To become autonomous and start receiving a monthly transfer of funds,21 a school must sign an agreement with
the MECD and have a School Council established. Each School Council is composed of four parents, the
school's principal, three teachers, and three representatives from the students. The president of the School
Council is always a parent. In order to support schools located in poorer areas, the MECD uses a higher salary
scale for rural areas, plus a lower student/teacher ratio, especially in multi-grade primary schools. In cases
where rural schools are grouped around a magnet school (in an arrangement called Autonomous Rural
Education Centers, NERAs), the group classifies as a large school, which is also favored by the transfer formula.
Once autonomous, the school, through its School Council, has complete control over the use of the funds-
including firing and hiring staff-as long as it complies with some technical requirements, such as the maximum
number of students per class.  The School Council also as the power to establish additional parent
contributions-both in cash and kind-and the use of the budget to reward well performing teachers. This
initial autonomy agreement between the MECD and the school has a escape clause for the school: teachers can
decide to go back to its original status at the end of the initial one-year agreement.
The School Council runs the school, but the school principal has a significant role to play in school governance,
since much of the information presented to the council, and many of the decisions taken by the council, depend
a great deal on the technical capacity, leadership qualities, initiative, and communication skills of the school
principal. The School Council meets at least once a month and most decisions are taken by simple majority. All
agreements and decisions are recorded in writing to make them legally binding. The Council publishes a
20 This Annex draws heavily from the paper "Rebuilding the Social Contract: School Autonomy in Nicaragua" by Arcia
and Belli, 1999.
21 The transfer to the autonomous schools is based on (i) enrollment, (ii) drop-out rate from the previous year, (iii)
student/teacher ratio, (iv) number of administrative and management personnel, (v) average wage for the grade and (vi)
other administrative expenses. The formula also contemplates adjustments for NERA schools. The student unit cost equals
t/(md), where t is the total transfer to the school, m is the total number of students enrolled, and d is the drop-out rate.

monthly report on income and expenditures, posts it where all parents can see it, and forwards a copy of it to the
Municipal Delegation of the MECD.
At the school level, the central role of the MECD is primarily a supervisory one. To fulfill its supervisory and
normative role, the MECD may intervene into the affairs of a local school if, for example, (i) the school refuses
to apply standardized tests to measure student achievement, (ii) the school closes before the minimum number
of school days required by the MECD, (iii) the school does not enforce discipline or is too lax in the application
of sanctions, (iv) the school fails to correctly measure teacher and student attendance, or (v) there is corruption.
In these cases the MECD can impose sanctions to the school or to the principal, or even ask for the principal's
resignation. However, if the school disagrees with the nature or scope of the MECD's intervention, it has full
recourse to an appeal process established at the municipal, departmental and national levels.
Participatory Selection of School Principal
The selection process of the principal was recently changed as follows: the autonomous school posts the
vacancy for the post of principal and informs the municipal delegate of it. The municipal delegate informs
MECD, which, in turn, publishes the vacancy announcement in a newspaper of national circulation and in the
monthly teacher magazine (Revista del Maestro). Additionally, each group in the community-parents,
teachers, and students-advertises the position, reviews the information of interested candidates, and selects a
short list of three candidates, which is then submitted to the municipal delegate. Using technical criteria and the
Law of the Teaching Career (ley de carrera docente), the delegate selects the person for the post. The School
Council has the power to veto the delegate's choice.
Recent achievements
MECD's goal is to have school autonomy cover 100 percent of all enrolled students by the year 2000. So far,
1,612 primary and 169 secondary schools have become autonomous. This corresponds to (i) 52 percent of all
public primary students and 83 percent of all public secondary students, (ii) 35 percent of the public primary
schools and 61 percent of the secondary ones, and (iii) 37 percent of the primary level teachers and 81 percent of
the secondary ones. The teacher incentive system has a total of 8,000 teachers registered and since its
establishment in 1995 has distributed almost US$1.3 million dollars in incentives to teachers. This has resulted
in a reduction of teacher absenteeism and improvement of punctuality.22
Results from Autonomy Studies: Autonomy, Accountability and the Social Contract
There have been several evaluation studies on the results of autonomy in Nicaragua.23 The two main messages
of the different evaluations can be summarized as follows:
22 The program gives teachers a monetary incentive if they comply with the MECD requirements for attendance, and if their
students remain in school throughout the year. Teachers are expected to teach at least 5 hours per day during the school
year and to motivate students to remain in school. The program gives teachers US$0.73 per student per month in case
teachers and students have perfect attendance. Fifty percent of the incentive accrues to perfect teacher attendance and the
remaining 50 percent to perfect student attendance. In cases of less than perfect attendance the incentives payment is pro-
rated. School council members are in charge of monitoring, and for that they are entitled to a small stipend by the MECD.
This stipend is less than 20 percent of the teacher's incentive and is also subject to perfect attendance by School Council
members to all council work sessions, as determined by MECD norms. In addition, in some secondary schools parents
have been contributing to reward teachers on their own.

1. The delegation of powers to the local level needs to be complemented by a well defined role for
MECD's central office. Currently, MECD seems to have little understanding of its role within a
decentralized system. As a result, there is a strong risk that decentralization remains limited to a
fiscal transfer to schools, and an uncertain support from the MoF, unless the Central MECD
reinforces its regulatory and supervisory role; and
2. School autonomy has improved school govemance, but has not yet resulted in a new social contract.
Specific results worth highlighting are:
(a) Interpretations of school autonomy vary widely among teachers, administrators, and parents.
Parents and teachers are more receptive to autonomy when their perceptions of the program closely
match its true characteristics and objectives.
(b) Schools that are already trying to raise education quality and efficiency are much more receptive to
autonomy than schools that are weakly engaged in the provision of public education.
(c) School autonomy has a positive impact on local control in primary schools over budget planning
and implementation, and the choice and remuneration of personnel.
(d) Teachers in autonomous schools feel that they have less influence in school affairs, relative to
parents and the principal.
(e) About 50 percent of respondents in primary and secondary schools think that autonomy has
improved academic performance, and most respondents report an improvement in teacher
attendance.
(f) There is a difference in academic achievement between autonomous schools with only nominal
participation in the autonomy program, and autonomous schools in which parents and teachers took
control over school decisions-schools with defacto autonomy.
(g) Local control over hiring and firing decisions, evaluation, training, and relations with the teacher's
union, have more impact on academic achievement than decisions over pedagogical variables, such
as class size, curricular adaptations, textbooks, and school hours.
(h) The entire framework for the size and frequency of school fees needs significant improvements,
since field interviews reflect an ongoing preoccupation with the financial impact of fees on poor
parents, and the potential for abuse.
(i)  Improvements are urgently needed in the technical capacity of MECD delegates at the department
and municipal levels in school management and communication.

Preliminary Results from the Living Standard Measurement Survey
This annex gives an overview of the education sector in Nicaragua using the results obtained from the 1998
LSMS household survey. The analysis was carried out for the following breakdowns: rural/urban, sex, area
(Managua, Pacific, Central, Atlantic), and by type of institution (public and private). The results along ethnic
lines are presented separately. Furthermore, the reported numbers do not always follow the same methodology
used by the team preparing the poverty assessment using the same data sets. In particular, the reader should be
aware that whenever ages are used in conjunction with education categories (e.g. children aged 7 in first grade,
net enrollment rates for primary school, etc.), the age used was that of the student as of the beginning of the
Nicaraguan school year. This method allowed an appropriate way to put everyone on par, especially since the
survey was conducted over several months. Finally, the reported results were obtained using the appropriate
weighting factors and therefore are representative for the country as a whole.
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
Literacy rates. Nationally, about one-fifth of the population is illiterate, compared to about one-third in rural
areas (see Table 1 1). Managua is the most literate area of the country with 89.3 percent of its population able to
both read and write. These number drop to 80.9 percent for the Pacific region, and to two-thirds for both the
Central and Atlantic regions (see Table 12).

Highest degree attained. Overall, about 38 percent of that population aged 21 and older reported having no
degree, 36 percent reported having primary education, and only 10 percent reported having attended some
secondary school. As expected, these summary statistics conceal big differences among the different parts of
the country. For the rural areas, the proportion reporting no degree is 56 percent, those reporting primary school
amount to 27 percent and those with secondary school constitute only 6 percent. This contrasts with urban
areas, where the respective proportions are 28 percent (no degree), 41 percent (primary school) and 12 percent
(secondary school). The same disparities are reflected in the breakdown along the four regions, with Managua
achieving the best results and the three other regions trailing behind.

PRESCHOOL EDUCATION
Enrollment rates. About one-third of the preschool-aged population (3 to 5 year old) are enrolled in some kind
of preschool. The percentage of children not attending any kind of preschool is slightly higher among boys than
among girls (64 percent versus 59 percent).
The percentage of children not attending any form of education declines with age, from 81 percent for children
aged three to 39.9 percent for children aged five. However, substantial disparities are revealed when we look at
the breakdown along geographic lines. Whereas in urban areas 40.8 percent of the children report attending
preschool, in rural areas only 24.7 percent do. Preschool attendance is higher in the Managua area with 41.5
percent, followed closely by the Pacific region with 38 percent, but drops to 24.9 percent and 21.4 percent for
the Central and Atlantic regions.24
Type of centers. Public preschoots account for about two-thirds of enrollment while private preschools account
for one-fourth of enrollment. In rural areas, community preschools play a larger role in enrollment, accounting
for 16 percent of it. Public preschools are relatively predominant in the Pacific and Central areas (attracting
74.1 percent and 71.9 percent of enrolled children), dropping to roughly half in the Atlantic and Managua areas.

Reasons for not participating. The main reason why children do not attend preschool was that they were
considered too young to participate. This explanation accounts for about half of the answers for both urban and
rural areas, and for about 45 percent in the Managua, Central and Atlantic areas. In the Pacific area, the "too-
young-to-participate" argument accounts for 63.1 percent of the non-attendance.
24 These disparities are also reflected in the percentage of children aged three to five not attending any form of education:
47.8 percent in Managua, 57.6 percent in Pacific, 71.1 percent in Central and 74.7 percent in the Atlantic region.

In urban areas (as well as in Managua and the Pacific regions), lack of money was also frequently cited as a
reason for non-attendance. In the rural areas (as well as the Central and Atlantic regions), the unavailability of
school or the school distance from home were also frequently cited.
Annual spending. Annual spending in preschools is substantially different both across type of preschool and
across areas. Overall average annual spending is US$47, which breaks down into US$65 for urban areas and
US$19 for rural areas.25 There are also differences in spending according to type of preschool: average annual
spending is US$126 for private centers, US$21 for public centers and US$8 for community preschools.
Average spending is also much higher in Managua compared to other regions in the country: US$86 for
Managua versus US$38 in the Pacific region, US$26 in the Central region, and US$24 in the Atlantic region.
The high amount of spending for the Managua region is consistent with the previous finding that about one-third
of the non-participants in Managua report lack of funds as the main reason for not participating in preschool
education.
PRIMARY EDUCATION
Enrollment by age. About 29 percent of the six year old children are not enrolled in school. For ages 7 to 12
this drops to about 10 percent for urban children and to about 20 percent for rural ones. Only about half of the
six year olds in the Atlantic region are enrolled in some type of school, going up to 80 percent at age 8 and
hovering around 70 percent until age 12. The main reason given for not being enrolled for the 6 to 12 year old
group is economic hardship (43 percent in rural areas and up to 70 percent in urban areas). In Managua and the
Pacific regions 66 percent and 71 percent respectively report economic hardship as the main reason for not
attending school, compared to about 43 percent in the Central and Atlantic regions. In rural areas, the second
most important reason given is not having a school nearby (it accounts for nearly one quarter of the total).
25 Reported monthly spending was converted into annual spending by assuming that the school year lasts 10 months.

Gross and net enrollment rates. Enrollment rates are reported for the following categories: children aged 7 to
9 and 10 to 12, and for the first (1st - 3rd grade) and second (4w - 6h' grade) cycles of primary. Overall, gross
enrollment rates for the two cycles are 180 percent and 85 percent. In the first cycle there is little difference
between urban and rural areas; in the second cycle urban areas gross enrollment remains above 100 percent
whereas in rural areas it drops to 65 percent. These statistics reflect the inefficiency of the school system, with a
high proportion of overage children in the early grades of primary education, and high dropout rates later on
(especially in rural areas).
The overall net enrollment rates for the two grade cycles are 67.4 percent and 46.5 percent, with urban areas
recording 67.8 percent and 57.7 percent, and rural areas 67 percent and 34.5 percent. Net enrollment rates are
worst in the Central region, with 63.3 percent and 32.7 percent respectively, although the Atlantic region does
only marginally better with 66.7 percent and 35.3 percent.
Repetition rates. Repetition rates are especially high in the first grade: 19.6 percent overall, 18.2 percent for
urban and 20.6 percent for rural areas. After that, the repetition rates decline to 13.3 percent in the 2" grade, 8.8
percent in the 3rd, 9.7 percent in the 4th grade, 6.4 percent in the 5th and 4.6 percent in the 6h grade of primary
school. Managua and the Atlantic region have lower repetition rates than the national average, whereas the
Pacific and Central regions are generally doing worse. It is also interesting to look at the breakdown across
types of primary schools (traditional public, autonomous public, community public and private schools). For
public schools, the traditionally public schools have the worst performance, followed by community schools,
then by autonomous ones. As more schools gain (de facto) autonomy, it is expected that the efficiency gains in
the primary school system will be reflected in substantial gains in the repetition rates.

Overage children. The impact of high repetition rates is reflected in the statistics for overage children per
grade.2  Overall, 31 percent of students in the first grade are overage. For subsequent grades this proportion
increases to over 40 percent (in 6th grade it is 47 percent). And, as expected, there are wide gaps between the
results per area. For example, in the first grade nearly 40 percent of the children in rural schools are overage. In
their urban counterparts this is only 20.3 percent.
Private spending on primary education. Average annual private spending for primary education has also
been calculated Municipal public schools are the least expensive, with US$17 on average per year. For
traditional public schools, this amount becomes US$25, and autonomous public schools cost US$38 on average
annually. The average personal spending for private schools is US$239.

Multigrade schools. Nationwide, the proportion of children in multigrade schools is 22.3 percent, largely
concentrated in rural areas (44 percent versus only 4.7 percent in urban areas). The Managua region has the
lowest proportion of children in multigrade schools with 9.3 percent, while the Central region has the highest
with 35.5 percent.
LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION
Gross and net enrollment rates in lower secondary. For the country as a whole, gross enrollment rate is 69
percent. In the urban areas it is 93 percent, but it drops to 40 percent in the rural areas. There is a significant
gender discrepancy in secondary enrollment rates: whereas the gross enrollment rate for males is 61 percent, it
is 77 percent for females. The regional differences are even more pronounced. Managua scores highest with a
gross rate of 105 percent, which drops to 66 percent in the Pacific region, 53 percent in the Central part, and a
mere 39 percent in the Atlantic region.
Net enrollment rate for the country is 35.6 percent, with 50 percent and 17.8 percent for urban and rural regions
respectively. Females have higher net enrollment rates than males (41.4 percent versus 29.5 percent), and the
geographic breakdown shows net enrollment rates of 58.1 percent for Managua, 36.6 percent for Pacific, 21.3
percent for Central, and 19.9 percent for Atlantic.
Overage students. The percentage of overage students in lower secondary education is high, due in part
because of the performance while in primary education. Overall, about 21.8 percent of children in lower
secondary are overage, with only slight differences between urban and rural areas (21,2 percent versus 23.4
percent).
Private spending on secondary education. Average annual spending is almost three times higher for
secondary education than for primary. For urban areas, average spending per person is $145, compared to $81
in rural areas. There are also large discrepancies among the various regions: $173 for Managua, $106 for the
Pacific region, $96 in the Central region, and $60 for the Atlantic part.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITIES
According to the results of the 1995 population census the population of Nicaragua comprises 96 percent of
"mestizos", 3 percent of indigenous (Miskitos, Sumus y Ramas), and 1 percent of Afro-Americans (Creoles and
Garifonos). In 1995 the Miskitos were approximately 70,000, the Sumus 10,000, the Ramas 600, the Creoles
25,500 and the Garifonos 1,500. They live mainly in the 59,000 KYm2 of the Autonomous regions of Atlantic

North and South (RAAN and RAAS), yielding a population density of about 6 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The results of the census compare favorably with the results of the 1998 LSMS.27 According to the 1998 LSMS
survey the indigenous population accounts for 2.2 percent of the population of Nicaragua, while the other ethnic
minorities (English-speaking) are less than 1 percent. In Nicaragua it is estimated that 55 percent of the overall
population lives in urban areas while the remaining 45 percent lives in the rural areas.
Figure 1 below describes the urban-rural composition of the population for the different ethnic groups.

Miskitos   Indigenous  Other Ethnic
Minorities
Ninety six percent of the indigenous and 98 percent of the ethnic minorities live in the Atlantic Coast regions,
where together they account for about 27 percent of the population. Demographically speaking they are similar.
Just to give a couple of examples. The average age of the household head is 45 years of age for non-indigenous
and 43 for indigenous; while among non-indigenous 72.4 percent of households are headed by a male among
indigenous7 1.9 percent have a male head.
Demand for Preschool. The indigenous population and those living in the Atlantic Coast regions are less likely
to have their children between the ages of 3 and 6 in preschool. While among the Spanish-speaking population
38.6 percent of the population in preschool age are enrolled, the corresponding figure is 14 percentage points
lower for the indigenous groups. APRENDE I project supported the opening of community-based preschools in
rural and urban marginal areas based on demand. During the second phase-APRENDE II-communication
campaigns would target those areas and groups where coverage is lowest. Nonetheless it is very important to
notice that preschool enrollment rate is very low for all groups. Further analysis of the data reveals that the low
enrollment rate among indigenous population is most likely a problem of providing goods at an affordable rate
rather than discrimination against the indigenous or other ethnic minorities.

27 Please note that this survey did not ask about ethnic group, but has asked the question "Which language have you been
speaking since you were a child". We used this question to identify the indigenous groups and other ethnic minorities. It is
likely that this question underestimates the indigenous population but at least allows the estimation of some averages

It is interesting to analyze why toddlers are not in school. Is it a problem of supply or demand? Are there any
differences among different ethnic groups? Though no supply (no school or too far from school) explains why
nationwide 24 percent of children are not in preschool (33 percent among indigenous and 40 percent among
English-speaking), demand-side factors (e.g. parents perceive children as being too young or lack money)
account for about 67 percent of the remaining children that do not enroll. These results corroborate some of the
findings of the Preschool Participatory Study that was undertaken under the umbrella of APRENDE I project to
help explain why demand for community preschools felt short of the target. This component suffered some
changes on its implementation to address these issues, namely (i) strong focus on communication campaigns
targeted at under-served groups and (ii) construction of classrooms for preschool activities in communities
where no rooms are available for preschool activities.
The LSMS results also indicate that in the past the community preschools had benefited disproportionately the
indigenous and other ethnic minorities. According to the results of those in community preschool 75 percent are
Spanish-speaking, 12 percent indigenous and 18 percent English-speaking.
Human Capital. A key indicator of human capital is the ability to read an write. Indigenous and other ethnic
minority people are less likely to be illiterate (see Figure below). Literacy rates are much lower in the rural
areas.
Another way to measure the stock of human capital is by looking at school achievement. There is no substantial
differences when comparing school achievement among general population and indigenous and other ethnic
minorities. Nonetheless the trend is that school achievement is always slightly higher among indigenous and
English-speaking population than among the general population. (see Figure below). While literacy rates and
attainment levels provide a measure of the current stock of human capital, enrollment rates measure the
investment in human capital and predict the future stock of human capital. The percentage of indigenous
children not enrolled in school is significantly lower than the average for Nicaragua as well as for the Atlantic
Coast regions. The mismatch between age and grade enrolled is also much lower among indigenous children
than any other ethnic group.

MINISTERIO DE EDUCACION, CULTURA Y DEPORTES
Despacho del Ministro
Managua, 21 de julio de 1999
Seunor James Wolfensohn
Presidente,
Banco Mundial
181 8 H Street NW
Washington D. C. 20433
Estimado Sehor Presidente:
Como parte de la preparaci6n para la segunda fase del Proyecto de Educaci6n Basica que
el Gobierno de Nicaragua pretende implementar con financiamiento del Banco Mundial y
de recursos nacionales, le informamos sobre las polfticas del Gobierno para los sectores
sociales y, en particular, aquellas que el Ministerio de Educaci6n pondra en ejecuci6n en la
segunda fase del proyecto.
I.    La politica social del Gobierno
El objetivo primordial de ia politica social del Gobierno es el de reducir la pobreza,
incrementando la productividad de los pobres y dotdndolos de un mejor acceso a
oportunidades econ6micas. Nuestra estrategia principal para alcanzar este objetivo es la
de aumentar el capital humano de los pobres, en tanto que les proporcionamos una red
segura para los grupos mAs vulnerables durante el perfodo de transici6n.  Dentro de
nuestras limitaciones econ6micas, la estrategia para mejorar el capital humano descansa
en la dotaci6n de una educaci6n basica y de servicios de salud dentro de un marco de
igualdad, eficiencia y responsabilidad.  Para complementar nuestras inversiones en
educaci6n basica y salud, estamos tambien modernizando las instituciones y fomentando la
participaci6n de la sociedad civil en la planificaci6n, el financiamiento y la entrega de
dichos servicios sociales.
Por ser nuestro objetivo principal reducir la pobreza, consideramos que la equidad en la
dotaci6n de servicios sociales es de primordial importancia. Por tanto, se esta aumentando
el uso de metodos para ia selecci6n de los objetivos con el fin de lievar los servicios
sociales a los pobres. Como nuestros recursos son limitados, la dotaci6n de estos servicios
debera hacerse con eficiencia. Permitiendo una mayor autonomfa a nivel local, esperamos
mejorar la eficacia operacional de nuestra entrega de servicios. Por otra parte, permitiendo
un mayor control local, aumentamos la responsabilidad y reforzamos nuestra incipiente
democracia.

MIMSTERIO DE EDUCACION, CULTURA Y DEPORTES
Despacho dl Ministro
Como parte del Convenio del Servicio Reforzado de Ajuste Estructural (ESAF) con el Fondo
Monetario Internacional, hemos empezado a reestructurar el marco institucional y reducido
la carga del sector publico sobre la economfa.  No obstante, tambien hemos acordado
mantener y es mas, aumentar, nuestros gastos en educaci6n y salud para garantizar que
nuestras inversiones en capital humano est6n protegidas. Si somos beneficiarios del
programa de reducci6n de la deuda de los Paises Pobres Altamente Endeudados (HIPC), los
gastos del sector social serfan mas sostenibles.
De conformidad con esta politica general del Gobierno, el Ministerio de Educaci6n,
Cultura y Deportes ha establecido polfticas y estrategias dirigidas a los problemas de
cobertura y de calidad que ahora enfrentamos. Esos problemas son analizados brevemente.
en la pr6xima secci6n.
II.    La situaci6n del Sector Educativo
La situaci6n educacional de Nicaragua refleja nuestro perfil de pobreza. Casi un quinto de
nuestra poblaci6n de diez an-os y mayor de diez anios, y cerca de la mitad de aqu6llos en
extrema pobrezarde las zonas rurales, es analfabeta. En promedio, nuestra poblaci6n goza
de 4,5 anos de educacion; pero, entre los de extrema pobreza ia situaci6n es peor: menos
de 3 anos de educaci6n entre los habitantes urbanos en extrema pobreza, y 1,6 arlos en las
zonas rurales. Aproximadamente, el 24 por ciento de los nihos en edad preescolar asiste a
preescolar y 73 por ciento de los ninos en edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 12 anios
asiste a la escuela primaria. Estas tasas son 30 y 18 por ciento respectivamente mds bajas
que en el resto de America Latina. La matrfcula para los colegios de secundaria es 25 por
ciento mas baja que en el resto de America Latina.
La calidad de la educaci6n se mantiene baja, en especial, en la escuela primaria. El acceso
a materiales didacticos esta mejorando, pero es todavfa bajo, y mas de una tercera parte de
los docentes de primaria son empiricos. Cerca de las tres quintas partes de nuestras aulas
escolares necesitan rehabilitaci6n o reconstrucci6n. A pesar de la promoci6n automatica
en primero y segundo grados, la repetici6n es todavfa un problema; cerca del 9,54 por
ciento de los ni6os en zonas rurales y 4,42 por ciento de los nirios en las zonas urbanas
repiten el primer grado debido a que se retiran antes de tiempo. Asimismo, las tasas de
alumnos que no completan sus estudios son muy elevadas, en particular en primero y
cuarto grados, cuando un 22,3 por ciento y un 15,8 por ciento de todos los estudiantes
abandonan la escuela. Ademas, la tasa de deserci6n de los estudiantes en las escuelas de
zonas rurales es el doble de la tasa de deserci6n de los estudiantes en las zonas urbanas.
Cerca del 60 por ciento abandonan las clases debido a la pobreza o por la busqueda
trabajo.
En cuanto a la administraci6n, tenemos serios problemas en las areas de recursos humanos,
supervisi6n educativa, y en sistemas de informaci6n gerencial y de estadistica, do  s
datos son de baja calidad y de diffcil acceso en todos los niveles.

/v \ OaMINISTERIO DE EDUCACION, CULTURA Y DEPORTES
Despacho del Miniistro
l(l.   La politica educativa del Gobierno
La meta principal del Ministerio de Educaci6n, Cultura y Deportes es proporcionar una
educaci6n de buena calidad a todos los ninos en edad escolar. Para alcanzar esta meta, el
Ministerio ha definido una estrategia en la que combina sus modestos recursos para
garantizar que las minorfas pobres y etnicas, en especial en las zonas rurales, tengan acceso
a una buena educaci6n basica.  Esta estrategia tambien busca obtener una fuerza
educacional bien capacitada y motivada, e incorporar a los padres como socios activos en
el proceso del aprendizaje de sus hijos. Para poner en practica la estrategia global antes
mencionada, el Ministerio de Educaci6n, Cultura y Deportes ha definido las siguientes
estrategias especfficas para mejorar la cobertura y la calidad de la educaci6n y el
fortalecimiento institucional del sector:
a. Expansi6n y consolidaci6n de la autonomfa escolar
b. Rehabilitaci6n y reemplazo de la infraestructura escolar
c. Modernizaci6n de la administraci6n central y planificaci6n
d. Ampliaci6n de la cobertura en preescolar
e. Revisi6n del currfculum de las escuelas primarias
f. Amplia dotaci6n de libros de texto y material didActico
g. Incentivos para docentes vinculados con el rendimiento
h. Mejor capacitaci6n para docentes
a.    Expansi6n y consolidaci6n de la autonomia escolar
La descentralizaci6n de la educaci6n se ha venido desarrollando gradualmente,
empezando con un programa de autonomfa administrativa en los colegios de primaria y
secundaria. Los objetivos de la autonomfa escolar son: (i) aumentar la participaci6n de la
comunidad en la gesti6n de las escuelas; (ii) aumentar la participaci6n local en las finanzas
de las escuelas; (iii) aumentar ia eficiencia administrativa y operacional, y (iv) aumentar la
responsabilidad local. Creemos que la autonomfa escolar ilevara a una mejora sostenida
en el rendimiento educativo gracias a una mejor responsabilidad local y a mas apoyo de
los padres, en las actividades de aprendizaje. Esperamos que todos los estudiantes de los
colegios de secundaria y que un 70 por ciento de los estudiantes de las escuelas primarias
esten cubiertos por la autonomfa escolar para el ahio 2000.
Para apoyar los esfuerzos de la autonomfa escolar, que se han puesto en practica seg6n han
ido surgiendo desde 1993, nuestro Ministerio presentara un borrador de una nueva ley de
educaci6n para octubre de 1999. Esta nueva ley legalizara la autonomfa escolar y unificara
la educaci6n bAsica, secundaria y universitaria en virtud de una sola ley. Tambi6n, a nivel
de colegios, el Ministerio probara nuevos procedimientos para la selecci6n de sus
Directores, que serAn observados y evaluados muy de cerca durante el primer anio del
proyecto para garantizar que la autonomfa escolar se implemente tal como se habfa
planificado. Para complementar estos nuevos procedimientos de selecci6n, se aumentaran
y mejoraran tambien la capacitaci6n de los consejos escolares, y se ampliara y r
considerablemente la capacitaci6n de los directores de los colegios.

Despacho del Ministro
b.    Rehabilitaci6n y reemplazo de la infraestructura escolar
En colaboraci6n con el Fondo de Inversi6n Social de Emergencia (FISE), el Ministerio de
Educaci6n, Cultura y Deportes continuara mejorando la calidad de la infraestructura de las
escuelas primarias en Areas rurales. El plan para la expansi6n de la cobertura de dicha
infraestructura incluye la rehabilitaci6n y reemplazo de escuelas primarias en zonas pobres,
asi como la reconstrucci6n de todas las escuelas destruidas o afectadas por el Huracan
Mitch. Con este fin, el FISE rehabilitara las escuelas de conformidad con el mapa de la
pobreza, mientras que el MECD fortalecera el proceso de la autonomfa escolar dando a los
consejos escolares locales en las areas afectadas por Mitch los fondos y Ia responsabilidad
para contratar y supervisar las reparaciones pequenas y la construcci6n de las escuelas.
Segun este sistema, daremos a los consejos escolares que participan hasta US$40.000 para
la rehabilitaci6n y reemplazo de las escuelas. Esperamos que los fondos necesarios para la
rehabilitaci6n y reemplazo de la infraestructura escolar en areas no pobres sean financiados
por otros donantes. Asimismo, el Ministerio empezara a dotar de viviendas a los docentes
en areas remotas5ara aumentar asf la retenci6n de los mismos.
c.    Modernizaci6n de la administraci6n central y planificaci6n
Como primer paso hacia la modernizaci6n de nuestro proceso de planificaci6n, el
Ministerio de Educaci6n, Cultura y Deportes prepara un Plan de Educaci6n Nacional a
largo plazo, con la colaboraci6n directa de todos los participantes en la educaci6n, y en
consulta directa con la sociedad civil en foros abiertos en todo el pais. Esperamos tener un
borrador estrategico del plan para fines de junio de 1999 y un plan completo para Enero
del ano 2000.
Para garantizar una autonomfa escolar efectiva, el Ministerio modernizara la administraci6n
central y la planificaci6n por medio de dos mecanismos: (i) un sistema para medir e
informar sobre los logros de los estudiantes, y (ii) un Sistema de Informaci6n Gerencial
Integrado que contenga las estadisticas de la educaci6n, ia informaci6n sobre la
administraci6n y los presupuestos, y la informaci6n sobre el rendimiento de los
estudiantes. El objetivo de estos componentes es el de informar a los padres, a la sociedad
civil y a la administraci6n del Ministerio sobre el rendimiento escolar, y para relacionar el
rendimiento con los presupuestos y las polfticas. Asimismo, reformaremos el sistema de
supervisi6n educativa actual para aumentar el apoyo pedag6gico y administrativo solicitado
por los docentes. Esperamos que este nuevo sistema de supervisi6n sea visto por ellos
como un recurso valioso, en tanto que le proporcionamos a nuestros administradores la
informaci6n de campo necesaria sobre el rendimiento escolar y el de los docentes.

Despacho del Ministro
d.    Ampliaci6n de la cobertura en preescolar
El MECD esta ampliando el acceso a preescolar de manera rapida con miras a duplicar las
matriculas para el aho 2000. El Ministerio amplia tambi6n su programa de Preescolares
Comunitarios que incluye la capacitaci6n de madres como personas que prestan servicios
en dichos centros, asf como tambien la asistencia alimenticia y los cuidados preventivos de
salud. Ya que los preescolares comunitarios parecen ser mas rentables que los preescolares
formales a cargo de docentes, el Ministerio revisara este sistema de dos niveles y lo
modificara si es necesario.
e.    Revisi6n del curriculum de las escuelas primarias
Desde 1994, nuestro Ministerio ha venido modernizando el curriculum de las escuelas
primarias, implementando los cambios en cada grado cada ano, para hacerlo menos
enciclopddico y mas orientado hacia la matemAtica basica, la lectura y la destreza en la
escritura y hacia la consolidaci6n de los valores morales y sociales, temas criticos para una
democracia joveq como la nuestra. El ano pasado, el MECD desarroll6 nuevos estandares
curriculares para todos los grados de las escuelas primarias, y empezara a evaluar los
resultados del nuevo curriculum este ano.  Para los colegios de secundaria, el Ministerio
tiene programado desarrollar un nuevo currfculum para finales del afno 2000 y poner en
practica los cambios durante los pr6ximos cuatro anos.
f.    Amplia dotaci6n de libros de texto y material didactico
El MECD esta ampliando el acceso a los libros de texto y al material didactico para todos
los grados de primaria y en todas las areas del pais. El Ministerio tambien continuara
distribuyendo libros de texto directamente a todos los municipios y dotard de libros a todos
los estudiantes a un precio m6dico de alquiler para incrementar asf el sentido de propiedad
y promover el cuidado de los mismos. Continuaremos controlando la disponibilidad de los
libros de texto, en especial en las areas rurales de extrema pobreza.
g.    Incentivos para docentes vinculados con el rendimiento
Para fomentar el aumento de la asistencia de los docentes, el Ministerio implementa un
suplemento salarial para ellos, vinculado al ausentismo de estudiantes y docentes. Si la
asistencia de un docente y la de sus alumnos es perfecta, el suplemento podra aumentar el
salario en un 50 por ciento. La mitad del suplemento depende de la asistencia de los
docentes, y la otra mitad de la asistencia de los estudiantes. El suplemento salarial se
aplica s6lo a los docentes en colegios aut6nomos, como medio de promover Ia
incorporaci6n voluntaria de mas colegios al programa de autonomia.

Despacho del Mimistro
h.    Mejor capacitaci6n para los docentes
En el Ministerio se revisa el plan de estudios y los metodos de ensehanza en los colegios de
capacitaci6n educativa y se continuaran mejorando las actividades de los cursos de
capacitaci6n del personal docente. Asimismo, pone en practica metodos de aprendizaje
participativo, reemplazando los metodos de memorizaci6n usados en el pasado, para
fomentar el pensamiento analiftico y 16gico entre docentes y alumnos. Asimismo, el
Ministerio reforzara su sistema de supervisi6n escolar para asistir a los colegios en la
identificaci6n de necesidades adicionales de capacitaci6n. En cuanto a cursos de
capacitaci6n para el personal docente, el Ministerio implementa una estrategia con cuatro
componentes: (i) la formaci6n de circulos de calidad en los cuales los docentes discuten
mejores practicas entre ellos; (ii) el uso de m6dulos interactivos de autoformaci6n, (iii) el
uso de materiales de capacitaci6n para el auto estudio, y (iv) mejorar la supervisi6n en el
aula de clase.
i.    Seguimiento del desempehio del programa
I
Para garantizar la ejecuci6n eficiente y efectiva del proyecto, asignaremos recursos
administrativos a un sistema de seguimiento del desempeno del programa. Con este fin,
usaremos indicadores para medir e informar sobre los indicadores de insumos, los
indicadores de procesos y, cuando sea posible, los indicadores de impacto. Todos los
indicadores del programa de rendimiento seran introducidos en nuestro Sistema de
Informaci6n Gerencial Integrado. El disefno y uso de estos indicadores ayudara tambien al
Ministerio a reconsiderar su papel principal en un sistema de educaci6n descentralizado.
j.    Ejecuci6n del programa
Con base en el exito de la primera fase del proyecto, continuaremos confiando a ia Unidad
Coordinadora del Proyecto la gesti6n y supervisi6n de todos los componentes del
programa. Ademas, algunos mecanismos de la ejecuci6n del programa, tales como la
gesti6n de los incentivos de los docentes y la transferencia de los fondos de infraestructura
a los consejos escolares locales, sera mejorados en apoyo a la autonomfa escolar.
IV.   Colaboraci6n con la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento
Deseamos enfatizar el hecho de que la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento (AIF)
desempen6 un papel clave en la ejecuci6n exitosa de las polfticas mencionadas mas arriba
durante la primera fase del Proyecto de Educaci6n Bdsica, proporcionando asistencia
financiera y tecnica. Durante ia segunda fase del proyecto, esperamos continuar con esta
provechosa relaci6n.
