Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                  Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
Guarantor:                Republic of the Philippines
Beneficiary:               Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)
Amount:                    US$134 million equivalent
Terms:                     Repayable over 20 years,  including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Re1ending Terms:           DBP would relend the funds to a banking syndicate that
in turn would relend the proceeds to PLDT through two
facilities: (a) the first, wherein DBP would subscribe
the entire $35 million to be lent to PLDT for 12
years, including four years of grace, and (b) the
second, wherein each of the other participating banks
would assume the intermediation risk for its subscrib-
ed portion of the remaining $99 million, would be lent
to PLDT for a term of 10 years with four years of
grace. The interest rate applicable to both facilities
would be 3V4 above the Bank's rate. PLDT would assume
the exchange rate risk between the Philippine Peso and
the US dollar for both facilities.   From the 3V4
spread, the Government would receive a fee of 1X for
guaranteeing the loan and a second fee of 1X for
assuming the cross :urrency risk between the US dollar
and the other currencies involved in the Bank's loan.
Secondary Lending:        The float resulting from the differences in maturities
between the Bank loan and the two relending facilities
would be made available to the Government according to
terms that mirror those of the Bank loan, and con-
sequently, would hold DBP free of benefit or loss.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A TELEPHONE SYETEM EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommend-
ation on a proposed loan of the equivalent of US$134 million to the Develop-
ment Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for relending through a banking syndicate
to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) for the equivalent of
US$134.0 million. The proceeds of the loan would help finance the extension
and improvement of telephone facilitiec in the Philippines, mostly in provin-
cial areas. The Bank loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
grace, with interest at the standard variable rate; the Republic of the
Philippines would guarantee the loan.  DBP would onlend the proceeds of the
loan to PLDT in US dollars at a variable rate based on the Bank's stand2rd
variable rate plus a spread of 3Y4Z p.a., which would include a 1X fee for the
Government's guarantee, and a second 1X fee for the Government to cover the
cross currency zr.sk between US dollar and the Bank's basket of currencies.
The onward loan would be split between two facilities: (a) the first, wherein
$35 million would be relent to PLDT for 12 years including four years of
grace; and (b) the second, wherein the remaining $99 million would be relent
to PLDT for 10 years including four years of grace (para. 9).
2.        Background.  Telecommunications is one of the least developed infra-
structure sectors in the Philippines. Services are concentrated in Metro
Manila and other principal cities; some provincial cities, towns and rural
areas have little or no telephone service. At 1.0 line per 100 population,
the nationwide telephone density is among the lowest in ASEAN countries. The
telephone density in Manila of about 9.6 per 100 population is very low for a
southeast Asian capital city, and waiting lists for service average three to
five years. Elsewhere in the country, telephone density is a low 0.3 lines
per 100 people.
3.        Telephone services are provided mainly by the private sector, and
PLDT is the dominant carrier. PLDT also owns most of the long distance net-
works that interconnect with local exchanges, and carries virtually all inter-
national and domestic long distance traffic. Its local service areas consist
of most major cities and some of the larger towns, so that the Company serves
many of the nation's lucrative markets. While PLDT provides the best tele-
phone service available in the country, it is generally below the standard of
other ASEAN countries. This is largely due to aging equipment and overloading
of existing services, factors that are being addressed through the proposed
project and other components of PLDT's expansion program. PLDT is one of the
nation's largest companies; at the end of 1991, its net worth exceeded P 17
billion and its annual revenues were about P 16.6 billion. PLDT provides
service to about 90X of the country's 625,000 working lines. About 50 other
investor and local government owned operators provide a further 82 of tele-
phone connections. Generally, they are small, financially weak, and provide
poor quality service; some are not even interconnected with any other net-
works. The Government's Telecommunications Office (TELOF), responsible to the
Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), provides the remaining
22 of lines. TELOF's efforts to provide service have proven ineffectual, so
that DOTC is planning to divest itself of those activities.
4.        DOTC is the core government agency responsible for administering the
sector and the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), an attached
agency, is responsible for regulating the activities of the operators.



However, because of the low priority accorded the sector, until recently DOTC
has lacked a clear strategy for development of the sector, and a clear policy
regarding sector structure. Consequently, NTC has been left without a clear
direction for its regulatory activities. The resultant lack of effective
regulation has led to operators pursuing parochial interests without any
official authority interceding to ensure that (a) national developmental
priorities would be served, and (b) consumers would receive satisfactory
service quality. Moreover, at 6X per year throughout the 1980s, PLDT's
expansion of its services has been too slow to keep pace with demand growth
and with the development needs of other sectors of the economy.
5.        PLDT's expansion program for the 1990s, which would more than double
the company's working telephone lines, would require borrowing of about $1
billion in foreign loans over and above the $656 million on its balance sheet
as of December 31, 1991. PLDT (a) has a policy of raising only dollar denom-
inated debt; and (b) realizes about 901 of its revenues from local rentals and
international call charges, which are effectively indexed to the US dollar.
Given a strong balance sheet and dollar based revenues, PLDT is well placed to
borrow to finance its growth. However, PLDT's capacity to borrow from com-
mercial sources has been severely restricted because of the country's weak
financial position. DOTC has recently decided that future construction and
operation of telecommunications facilities would rest with the private sector,
and the Government would play the role of facilitator. Consequently, the
Government has agreed to support PLDT's expansion plans by making available
official borrowings.
6.        Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project is a self-contained part
of PLDT's investment program for the period 1992-96. The project aims to
(a) increase telephone penetration and leased line facilities in PLDT's ser-
vice areas, with an emphasis on provincial development; and (b) improve PLDT's
quality of service. Most of the proposed project was designed to provide
improved telephone facilities in areas of major economic importance. In con-
junction with, yet apart from, the proposed project, the Government has agreed
to take action to strengthen sector management and regulation (para. 13).
/
7.        Proiect Description.  The main components of the project are:
(a) provision of new, and expansion of existing telephone services in 128 pro-
vincial municipalities; (b) provision of public calling offices (PCOs) in 97
other unserved municipalities; (c) extension of PLDT's toll network to inter-
connect the remaining isolated exchanges managed by other operators; (d) pro-
vision of outside plant to connect about 41,000 more customers and utilize
more completely exchange equipment becoming available in Metro Manila;
(e) provision of networks, throughout the Philippines, for leasing to busi-
nesses and other operators; (f) provision of equipment to improve PLDT's
operations and maintenance capabilities and training facilities; and (g)
strengthening of PLDT's project management capabilities.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$270 million (ex-
cluding interest during construction), with a foreign exchange component of
US$148 million (55%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. The project, which was developed in close consultation with
IFC, forms only a small part of PLDT's overall development program with which
IFC is heavily committed and involved. As such, the project elements were
selected specifically knowing that PLDT can procure the equipment and services
needed using the Bank's stringent international bidding procedures. Amounts



- 3 -
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in the Philippince are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No.9444-PH dated August 14, 1992 is being distributed separately.
9.        Financing Arrangements.  The Bank loan of $134 million would be made
to DBP which in turn would onlend the proceeds (according to terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank) to PLDT through a banking syndicate. The
onlending would be coursed through two separate facilities: (a) the first,
wherein DBP would subscribe the entire $35 million for onlending to PLDT for
12 years, including four years of grace, and (b) the second, wherein each of
the other participating banks would assume the intermediation risk for its
subscribed portion of the remaining $99 million, would be onlent to PLDT for a
term of 10 years including four years of grace. The interest rate applicable
to both facilities would be 31/4 above the Bank's rate. PLDT would assume the
exchange rate risk between the Philippine Peso and the US dollar for both
operations. From the 3Y4 spread, the Government would receive a fee of 1X for
guaranteeing the loan and a second fee of 1% for assuming the cross currency
risk between the US dollar and the other currencies involved in the Bank's
loan. DBP would earn Y4 on the entire amount for its role as originator and
administrator of the onlending arrangements, and each participating bank
(including DBP) would earn 12 on the amount of the outstanding balance for
which it has taken responsibility. The resultant rate to PLDT of 3Y4X above
the Bank's rate is considered at, or somewhat above, market for US dollar
funds of similar amount and term.
10.       Because the maturities applicable to the relending operations are
shorter than the term of the Bank's loan, DBP will need to manage a float re-
sulting from the excess of the principal repayments made by PLDT over the
amounts that would be due to IBRD. The Government will use this float for gen-
eral macroeconomic purposes, according to a secondary lending arrangement that
would function as though the Government were the Borrower of the Bank loan.
11.       Project Imnlementation.  PLDT will be responsible for project
implementation. With minor assistance from the contractor(s), they will
prepare the necessary detailed designs and provide the technical staff to
install exchanges and transmission systems under the supervision of the
respective equipment suppliers. PLDT will contract out civil works and the
supply and erection of most outside plant cabling. Similar arrangements have
proven effective for PLDT's management of other, larger, expansion projects
and are considered appropriate. Nevertheless, PLDT has agreed to appoint
project management consultants, financed by the Bank, to assist with project
management and strengthen their management capabilities.
12.       Proiect SustainabilitW.  PLDT would operate and maintain the
facilities being financed under the proposed project. The proposed project
will add only a marginal amount to PLDT's aggregate plant and equipment, and
the company has an established track record for operating and maintaining
similar facilities. The cost of operating and maintaining these facilities
would be met from PLDT's operating revenues, which are expected to be more
than sufficient for that purpose.
13.       Lessons Learned.  The Bank has actively supported the sector by pro-
viding finance and technical assistance in the areas of regulation and policy



-4-
development. In 1985, under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2495-PH),
the Bank made a $4 million loan aimed mainly at strengthening NTC. During
project supervision, the Government followed the Bank's advice to constitute a
National Telecommunications Development Committee (NTDC) as a forum for
discussing sector policy issues. Flowing from that initiative the Government
has more clearly defined its sector policy, prepared a National Telecommunica-
tions Development Plan (NTDP) and provided inputs to legislation for strength-
ening NTC. Recognizing the importance of sector strengthening, the Government
obtained through the Bank a Japanese Grant to finance consultancy services to
(a) continue NTC's institutional development efforts; and (b) ensure adequate
operating arrangements for the National Telephone Program (NTP). Separately,
IFC has maintained a long-standing financing relationship with PLDT. Since
1969, IFC has made five investments (for a total of $128.5 million) in the
company; these resulted at one point in IFC's owning some 376,000 shares of
PLDT's stock. Apart from delays in completing assembly of project financing
plans, regulatory clearances, and equipment deliveries, PLDT has usually met
its implementation targets in connection with IFC-financed projects, and its
implementation capability is therefore rated as good. For this project, the
proposed loan would meet all of PLDT's external financing requirements; pre-
financing regulatory clearances have been obtained; and use of ICB and appro-
priate contractual arrangements will help to protect PLDT against late
deliveries.
14.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  To expand telecommunications
services in the Philippines adequately, the sector needs (a) considerable
investments, at a time when country conditions inhibit companies from
accessing commercial investment capital; and (b) greater commitment by the
Government and the major providers of service to improve their effectiveness
in their allotted roles. Because of the trust it enjoys with both the
Government and PLDT, the Bank is ideally positioned to use its involvement in
the project to address these issues: (i) by financing a project that focuses
on developing service in areas accorded a high priority by the Government, the
Bank would lead PLDT to take a more balanced approach toward future expansion;
(ii) the Bank's involvement in the proposed project would enhance PLDT's cred-
ibility in international financial markets, and thereby facilitate the Comp-
any's efforts to obtain the balance of commercial financing for other compo-
nents of its expansion program; (iii) by emphasizing cost optimization and
quality of service as well as a more expansive approach to investment, the
Bank would induce PLDT to become more responsive to its consumers and (iv)
through its continued attention and conditionality related to sector policy
and regulatory issues, the Bank would (a) foster needed institutional
strengthening, thereby enhancing DOTC as the manager and NTC as the regulator
of the sector; and (b) facilitate a constructive dialogue between the
Government and PLDT with the objective of increasing the effectiveness of
PLDT's role in sector development.
15.       Agreed Actions.  PLDT has agreed to: (a) conduct with the Bank an
annual joint review of its (i) investment program for the next five years,
(ii) investment accomplishments for the previous two years and (iii) construc-
tion and operational performance relative to specified targets; (b) adopt the
mutually acceptable recommendations of those annual reviews; (c) realize an 8X
rate of return on revalued assets annually; (d) meet or exceed an annual debt
service coverage ratio of 1.1; (e) furnish to the Bank, by June 30 each year,
(i) its annual financial statements certified by an auditor acceptable to the
Bank, and (ii) the results of an audit of its records in relation to State-



- 5 -
ments of Expenditures; and (f) appoint consultants for project management by
June 30, 1993. The government has agreed to share with the Bank results of
its annual review of implementation of its telecommunications policies and
solicit the Bank's comments with regard to these reviews prior to making any
significant decisions that would change the Government's role in the sector.
Also, in conjunction with the proposed project the Government has sent a
letter to the Bank which in addition indicated that it would develop a policy
framework for reviewing the structure of telecommunications tariffs by 1994.
DBP has agreed to furnish to the Bank, by June 30 each year, (i) a copy of its
annual financial statements audited by an acceptable auditor, and (ii) an
audit report of its records in relation to the project's Special Account. The
execution of (i) satisfactory relending agreements between DBP, the other
banks participating in the banking syndicated, and PLDT; and (ii) guarantee,
cross currency coverage and secondary lending arrangements between the
Government and DBP, are Conditions of Effectiveness of the proposed loan.
16.       Environmental Aspects and Project Objective Categories.  The
disruption to the environment through the project is expected to be minimal.
Nevertheless, during project supervision special attention will be paid to
ensuring that contractors are required to fully reinstate any areas disrupted
by project related works. The project covers areas of major economic import-
ance identified by the Government as having high priority for infrastructure
development. It is not directly linked to the country's antipoverty strategy.
17.       Pro1ect Benefits.  The benefits of the project would accrue to all
sectors of the community through improved access to telephone facilities and
improved network quality. The greatest benefits are likely to accrue to
businesses and the public in the 128 provincial municipalities where new and
expanded facilities will markedly improve existing communication facilities.
Apart from direct benefit to businesses, improved communications will add to
the quality of life by providing voice communication opportunities between
separated family members and improving performance of Government services,
especially medical and emergency relief.
18.       Riskg. There are no maj3c  risks associated with the project.
19.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
