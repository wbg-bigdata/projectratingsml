    IEG Mission:Enhancing developmenteffectivenessthroughexcellenceand independenceinevaluation.


 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
 first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess andto verifythat the Bank's work is producingthe
 expected results, and second,to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough the
 disseminationof lessons drawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGannuallyassessesabout 25 percentof the
 Bank's lendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are innovative,
 large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; those for which Executive
 Directorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generateimportant lessons.
 The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing countryfor onsitediscussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries
       .The PPARtherebyseeks to validateandaugmentthe informationprovidedinthe ICR,as well as examine
 issuesof special interest to broader IEGstudies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer reviewprocess and IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewedby the responsible Bank department and amendedas necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


 About the IEG RatingSystem
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGare suitedto the broad range of the World Bank'swork. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessarylevelof flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoralapproach. IEGevaluators all applythe same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion(more informationis available on the IEGwebsite:
 http:l/worldbank.orgIoed/eta-mainpage.htm1).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extentto which the project'sobjectives are consistentwith the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoralassistancestrategies and corporate
goals (expressed in PovertyReductionStrategy Papers,CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector StrategyPapers,
Operational Policies).Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extentto which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a returnhigherthanthe
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability: The resilienceto riskof net benefitsflows over time. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extentto which a projectimprovesthe abilityof a country or region
to make moreefficient,equitable and sustainable use of its human,financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsandlor (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives fromthese
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopmentImpactincludes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently. Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BankPerformance:The extent to whichservices provided bythe Bank ensuredqualityat entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriatesupervision (including ensuring adequatetransitionarrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownershipand responsibilityto ensure
quality of preparation and implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements,towards the
achievement of developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) on threejunior
secondaryeducationprojects in Indonesia.

        The East Java and East Nusa Tenggara Junior SecondaryEducationProject (Loan
4042) was approved for a US$99 million loan in June 1996.The loan closed on June 30,
2004 after extensionstotaling 24 months; US$11.7 million was canceled.

       The Central IndonesiaJunior SecondaryEducation Project (Loan4062), was
approved for a US$104 million loan in July 1996.The loan closed on June 30,2004 after
extensionstotaling 24 months; US$14.7 million was canceled.
                                                                                             . . .
       The SumatraJunior SecondaryEducationProject (Loan 4095) was approved for a
US$98 million loan in September 1996.The loan closed on June 30,2004 after
extensionstotaling 24 months; US$5.5 millionwas canceled.

       The projects in Indonesia were selected for assessmentin order to studythe
challenges of providing universal lower-secondaryeducation in the remote and rural
areas of a middle-income country.

       The PPAR is based on the following sources:ImplementationCompletion Reports
(ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), Loan Agreements for the projects, and project
files,particularly the supervisionreports. An IEG mission visited Indonesia in February
2006 to interviewofficials and beneficiaries,observe instruction in schools,and collect
other pertinent information. Field visits took place in east and central Java, Lampung, and
West Nusa Tenggara. The authorthanks the government officialswho received the
mission for their extensive cooperation.

       Following standard IEG procedures,copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and comments.No comments
were received.


 Summary

         In the 1990s,Indonesia implemented a series of secondary educationprojects that
 aimed to expand the provision of this educational level to lower-income populations.
 These included:

         TheEast Java and East Nusa Tenggara Junior SecondaryEducationProject (Loan
 4042) was approved for a US$99 million loan in June 1996.The loan closed on June 30,
 2004 after extensions totaling 24 months;US$11.7 million was canceled.

         The CentralIndonesia Junior SecondaryEducation Project (Loan 4062) was
 approvedfor a US$104 million loan in July 1996.The loan closed on June 30,2004 after
 extensionstotaling 24 months; US$14.7 million was canceled.

         The Sumatra Junior SecondaryEducationProject (Loan 4095) was approved for a
US$98 million loan in September 1996.The loan closed on June 30,2004 after
 extensionstotaling 24 months; US$5.5 million was canceled.

         All three projects aimed at improvingaccess,quality, and management ofjunior
secondaryeducation (grades 7-9). Theywere regionalprojects that aimed to support the
governmentalgoal of universalizingnine years of education by 2010. The projects also
supportedthe decentralization of educationalmanagement to local levels and helped
empower communitiesto make decisionsabout expendituresand construction.With the
advent of the 1997economic crisis, the government modified its goal to focus on
sustainingenrollment gains and attainingan 80percent gross enrollmentrate by 2004.
Project componentswere modified accordingly;the school constructionprogram was
reduced, and a multidonor school grantsprogram was established to offer scholarshipsto
the very poor and operation grantsto hard-hit schools.

        Ultimately,most of the planned project activitieswere carried out, and the
government achieved its goal of 80percent enrollmentforjunior secondary educationby
2004. Despite some leakage to the non-poor, the school grantsprogram succeededin
supportingthe poorer students and schools and constituted a safetynet against dropout. In
most areasof the country, citizen committeeswere constituted to help manage schools,
reducing the time needed to build new schools and make them operational fiom two years
to 6 months. Much teacher training took place in order to improve quality, although
achievementtest scores do not show consistent improvements. The expansion and
management objectives were fulfilled, and the qualityobjective was partly fulfilled;
althoughmany training activitieswere carried out, overalltest scores did not show clear
improvementsover time.

        The outcomes of all three projects are rated satisfactory. Institutional
development for all three is rated substantial, because the provincial management and
communitiesexpanded their capacityto match implementationneeds. Sustainabilityis
rated likely; enrollment expansion has proved resilient over time. Bank and borrower
performance are rated satisfactory.

        This assessment confirms a number of IEG lessons fiom the education sector:

It is possible to target successfullypoor areas for interventions aimed at
increasing enrollments,even in times of financial crises. Scholarships
administeredto the poor and disbursed to them promptly may be effective in
sustainingenrollmentsand preventing dropout.

Communityinvolvement may be a cost-effectiveand reliablemeans to build and
support schools,particularlywhen the population has basic education and poverty
is not extreme. Nevertheless,school committeemembers may not be able or
willing to keep school expenditures low, may not have much time-tospend on
school affairs, and may be unable to advise the principal effectivelyon
educationalmatters.

Decentralization promotes effectiveuse of resources. However, not all local
authorities are equally competent or interested in educatingthe poor. A central
government may find it necessary to meet the basic educationalneeds of the
poorest communities directly if national goals for basic education are to be
achieved.

International comparativeassessments of student achievementmay provide
critical feedback to governments interestedin increasingthe competitivenessof
their human capital. They may also provide means to help countriesimprove
their performance.

 1.          Background

 1.1         Investingin educationhas been one of the cornerstones of Indonesia's
 developmentpolicy. This countryof 214.6 million inhabitantsand a per capita income of
 US$1174' has an immenseschoolsystem.In 2001102, therewere 28.9 million primary
 school students and 1.4millionprimary schoolteachers in more than 171,000primary
 schools across some400 districts and municipalities. At thejuziior secondarylevel
 (grades 7 through 9), therewere 9.4 million students and about 680,000teachers in more
 than 31,000public and private school^.^

 1.2         Indonesia's primary-school gross enrollmentrate had grown from 62 percent in
 1973to nearly universal coverageby 1983,and by the mid-1990s two-thirds of
 Indonesianshad completed at least primary ed~cation.~Genderparity was also attained
 in the early 1990s,with girls accounting for 48-50 percent of enrolments (Table                     The
 gross enrollment rate forjunior secondary educationhas also shownmarked increases,
rising from 18percent in the 1970sto 66 percent in 1995.~The dropout rate that was 12
percent in 1988-89decreasedto 3 percent by 1995-96.By 2003,90.4 percent of those
aged 15and abovewere literate and had about 7.1 years of schooling,while 36.2 percent
had completedjunior secondary school or higher.6

1.3        Nevertheless, the country's 57 percent net enrollment rate at thejunior secondary
education level has lagged behmd those of its neighbors (e.g. Malaysia 83percent in
1990,Thailand 63 percent in 1994;Figures B-1and ~ - 2 )Accordingto project. ~
documents, about 25 percent of primary school students in 1994failed to complete
primary and of those who did only 64percent continued their education.

  1.4       This was unfortunate because expansion ofjunior secondary educationhas helped
 reduce disparityof labor incomes in 1976-1992.' Appraisal estimates showed that in 1992
 employeeswithjunior secondaryeducation received 27 percent more than those with
 primary education, and those with senior secondaryeducation earned 56 percent more
 than those ofjunior secondary ed~cation.~Reasons for lower school enrolmentrates have
 included income inequity, a small number of public schools, and considerable tuition
 fees.lo Two-thirds of the secondaryschoolswere private (manyof them religious), and
 entry remained competitive and expensive (about US$150 annually) even after entrance
 exams for 7th grade were abolished in 1994. Thus, childrenin the poorest income
 quintile were least likelyto continue in secondary educationand most likelyto drop out.
 Poverty affected gender equity," and only 80percent of secondary-level studentswere
 female.l2

 1.5       In 1994,the government adopted a policy of universalizing lower secondary
 educationby 2010.l3 The insufficiencyof public schools, particularlyin the poorer and
 rural areas of several provinces constituted an important obstacle. Therefore, the
 governmentrequested donor aid; the World Bank financed provision of lower secondary
 educationin target areas of 11of the 27 provinces while the Asian Development Bank
 (ADB) financed it in 6 others.l4 OECF (OverseasEconomicCooperationFund Japan)                         -
 financed construction ofjunior secondary schools in selected areas. The areas financed
 by each developmentbank were clearlydelineated, and did not overlap. Theproject
 implementationunits at the Ministry of education were closely linked, but there has been
 little direct coordination between these donors.


 Bank Sector Strategy

 1.6       Since 1971,the World Bank has invested at all levels and subsectors of
 Indonesian education through a large number of projects, 43 by 2006. Someof the earlier
projects had limited development impact. A 1991an OED review found that projects
 were overly complex, did not distributebenefits to the poor equitably, and paid little
 attentionto communityinvolvement, institution building, or private education. Extensive

13.World Bank 1998,p. 46. The policy was announced in 1989to be achieved by the end of the eighth five-year
developmentplan (RepelitaVIII). After the 1997financial crisis,the goal was changed to 80 percent gross enrollment
rate by 2008.

14.In 1997,ADB financed secondaryeducation access and qualityimprovement in 49 districts covering 549,000
studentsin 2350 schoolsof South Kalirnantan,East Kalirnantan, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Central Sulawesi, and
Southeast Sulawesi. It built 356 new schoolsand 1032new classrooms in existingschools (Second Junior Secondary
EducationProject, Loans 1573-IN0for US$160million and 1574-IN0 for SDR10.98million). About 62 percent of
the fundswere for public schools, 20 percent private schools and 17percent for madrasah. In 1995it financed a
PrivateJunior SecondaryEducation Project, (Loan 1359for US$49 million, closed in August 2002).

 mismanagementhas undermined the Bank's efforts, and educationprojects often had
 unsatisfactory implementation o~tcomes.'~

 1.7        Subsequent lending has attemptedto target projects more closelytowards the
 needs of the poor and improve governance. Since 1990,the Bank has invested in
 secondaryeducation through two management training projects and a educationteacher
 developmentproject. The first project was completedbefore the establishment of a rating
 system and appears to have performed satisfactorily,but the second and third have been
 rated by IEG moderately satisfactorybecause of failure to meet targets, implementation
 difficulties,and significantaccountingproblems. The Book and Reading Development
Project (Ln. 3887-IND)was to complement the efforts to develop secondaryeducation,
but the project was terminated early due to large-scalemisprocurementthat rendered
many textbook sellersin the country ineligible for Bank-financedcontracts.

 1.8       Despite governanceproblems and modest outcomes, the Bank continued to
supportgovernment effortsto expand what is sometimes called "upper basic education"
grades, which are considered minimum qualifications for manyjobs and thus have a high
poverty-alleviation potential16(TableB-1). The institutionhas also focused on quality
and equityissues in primary education, which are reflected in the late entry, high rates of
repetition,and unsatisfactorycompletionrates. Ultimately, Indonesiareceived for the
secondary education subsectorsix projects amountingto US593.6 million (13.8 percent
canceled, Tables A-4, A-5). Following completion of the threeprojects under review,
lending has focused on earlychildhood, primary education, library development, global
learning, and higher education.Policy dialoguehas focused on decentralization,
improving deliveryof services, governance, increasing the qualityof education."

1.9        The Bank has undertaken extensive sectorwork on Indonesia sincethe 1990s,
includmg a 1998study and a 2004 update focused on decentralization.18 The countryhas
also been the subject of much econometricresearch. Large and detailed datasets are
maintained and analyzed, household and other types of surveys are administered on a
regular basis. These data offer the opporhmity of verifying someproject outcomes
independently or obtainingsupportiveevidence. However, datapoints are often
inconsistent amongvarious datasets,and interpretationor integrationalongmultiple years
isproblematic.Data quality and quantitydeterioratedafter decentralization,and some
figuresarebased on a limited number of schools. Also there is a large differencebetween
gross and net enrollment rates due to repetition and overageenrollments in primary

 2. Project Objectives and Implementation

 2.1       An important lesson of earlier secondary-educationinvestment in this large island
 countrywas the need for locallybased supervision and execution. Therefore,three
 regionaljunior secondaryeducationprojects were appraisedwithin a few months of each
 other. They were negotiated at the national level but implementedthrough a central,as
 well as provincial, project implementationunits within MoNE. They supervisedjointly,
 had a single task manager in the last three years of their implementation, and were
 completed at the sametime.

 2.2      The projects essentiallyhad the same objectives and components(Table2). They
 aimed at improvingaccess and qualityof education in remote and rural areas of 11
 provinces with the lowestjunior secondarygross enrollmentratio and the highest rate of
 'backward' villages. All supported areashad a primary education gross enrollment ratio
 of 111during appraisal, an indicatorof overage enrollments and grade repetition. The
 East Java and East Nusa Tenggara Junior SecondaryEducation (Loan4042) focused on
 the aforementionedtwo provinces, the Central IndonesiaJunior SecondaryEducation
 (Loan 4062) focused on Central Java, West Kalimantan,Central Kalimantan, Central
 Java, and Yogyakarta, while the Sumatra Junior SecondaryEducation (Loan 4095)
 focused on Nangroe Aceh Darussalam, West Sumatra, South Sumatra,Janibi, and
 Lam~ung.~O

 2.3      A generalproject design was adapted to local needs and fostered decentralized
 institutionbuilding through provincialproject implementation units. Schools and
 localitieswere selected for inputs based on low enrollment and transition rates, poverty
indicators,distance, and prospect of increasing studentpopulation.In building new
schools,effort was made to provide a completeschoolapproach.This approach featured
a set of activities (with assigned responsibilities)accordingto an agreed-upon schedule,
before a schoolcould be established and brought on-line as a registered institution.
Rather than a centrally managed school-buildingprogram, block grants were givento
school committeeswhere possible, and local workersbuilt the schoolwith some
communityinput in the design and esthetics.Provincial and district governments
supervised and collaboratedto ensure all inputs were in place by the time the school was
opened: buildings and furniture, teachers appointed, students enrolled,books, supplies,
aids and equipment,provision of operationaland maintenance costs) through additional
block grants.



19.Data used to be collected throughmail-in surveys from schools,but after decentralizationmany of them did not fill
them out. In 2003 a school census was done, and datacollected in this way were not necessarilyconsistentwith earlier
trends. For example, for 2002103,the Unesco Institute of Statisticsreported gross enrollment rate for lower secondary
as 76 percent and net enrollmentrate of 54 percent, lower than datareportedly derived from other sourcesciting
Ministrydata (Unesco Institute of Statistics.2005,p. 780).

20. The ADB financed schools in SouthKalimantan, East Kalimantan,North Sulawesi, Gorontalo,Central Sulawesi,
and Southeast Sulawesi.

 2.4        Monitoring and evaluation. Institutional arrangementswere made to collect data
 early on, but monitoring activitieswere scaled down due to the financial crisis, and a
 specializedmonitoring unit was not set up as expected. At the end of the project,
 multiple private consultant firmswere hired to carry out external evaluationsthat
 involved site inspections, interviews, and questionnaires at stratifiedrandom samplesof
 about 10target and five non-target schoolsin each province. (MoNE 2003a-2003e;
 results are integrated in findings and tables A1-A3.) The multiplereports are of varying
 quality and level of detail; somemerely list conditions in the schoolsvisited with little
 attempt at aggregationwhile othersoffer extensivequestionnaireoutcomes on teacher
 performance. The Implementation CompletionReports use the data of these reports, but
 these were not integrated in a singleproduct. Interviewswith officials suggest a limited
 use of these reports as feedback for improved futureoperations. Also, limited efforts
 have been made to compare the evolutionof various indicators in target- and non-target
 areas in the variousprovinces.

 2.5       Project implementation experienceand results are presentedbelow (Also see
 Tables A1-A3).

2.6        Early supervisionreports show satisfactoryprogress, and execution of agreed
work programs averaged 80-90per~ent.~'The projects were implemented through
province-levelproject implementationunits (PIUs).For district and local-level staff,
they proved very complex to implement District staff in particular had limited formal
education(with Bachelor's degrees as highest qualification), and mimyleft after
obtainingtrainingand experience.Lack of disbursement experience slowed down
implementation,and procurement issues created conflictswith the Bank.The higher pay
of internationalconsultants created resentmentsamong some local staff and forced
rearrangementof some work duties. Mismanagement concerns arose by 1997,at a time
when the second secondary education management trainingproject experienced similar
problems. US$228,150in the Sumatraproject, US$1,128 in the Central Indonesia and
US$3.9 million in the East Java and East Nusa Tenggara project were cancelled due to
misprocurement. In East Nusa Tenggara and Aceh, implementation ended prematurely
in 2003 due to mismanagement and to civil disturbances,respecti~ely.~~The task
managers and the governmentdevoted much time and energypursuing these problems.

2.7       After the first year of the project, the Asia economic crisis started,resulting in a
dramatic increasein the number of poor householdsin Indonesia. Between 1996and
1998,primary and lower secondaryenrolments dropped by 6.2 percentage points in urban
areas, arousingmuch concern (Amex Table B-2).23 Schooloperationsbecame harder as
government funds dried up. By 1998,the value of the rupiah to the US dollardropped
fiom 2,331 to 14,900,and the governmentmodified the project design. The number of
new schoolswas reduced to save on salaries, and additional classroomswere built in
existingschools. Part of the civil works program was reallocated for additional
scholarshipsand grants,partly towards a multidonor Scholarshipand Grants Program to
minimize the dropout of poor students. (SeeAnnex C.) The government alsomodified its
medium-term goal of universal primary educationto attaining at least nine years of basic
education for at least 80percent of the age cohort by 2004. Project objectiveswere not
formallyrevised, but at midtenn review (1999) the components were more specifically
focused on poverty and aimed to: (a) maintain enrollmentsat 1997levels and increase

 secondaryschools especiallyin poor, rural communities;and (c) strengthenthe
 managementof the education system at all levels, especiallyfor district and school
 managers, to retain students in schoolby implementingpro-poor strategies. The projects
 received a two-year extension,duringwhich additionalprovinceswere included: West
 Nusa Tenggara and South Sulawesi (for Ln. 4042), and North Sumatra (for Ln. 4095).

 2.8       In 1999,a Decentralizationlaw and a Fiscal Autonomy Law strengthenedthe role
 of districtgovernmentsand weakened that of the provincial governments. In response to
 these changes, the projects focusedtraining effortson school managers and district staff
 and financedthe provision of proposal-based school grants. In the early stages of
 decentralizationprocess therewas tension between district and provincial governments
 about roles and responsibilities, resource allocations, and monitoring functions. Many
 difficultieshave been resolved, although considerable work remains to be done.

 2.9       By project completion, about 94 percent of project-supported schools had
 received inputs (books, equipment, and training), though inaccurate cost estimates caused
 delays.According to evaluationreports, schoolslargelymade effectiveuse of the inputs
 in teaching and learning. Reportedly77 percent received them on time and 82 percent
used them adequatelyin East Java project; 74percent received them on time and 77
percent used them adequatelyin the Sumatraproject, while in central Indonesia, 85
percent of the target schoolsreceived the inputson time and about 80 percent of the
schoolsused the inputs adequately." Nevertheless, there was often a lag of a year or
more between ordering and receiving books; their level was sometimesunsuitable, and
little importance was placed to selectinginterestingbooks to encourage students' reading
habits.

2.10      The IEG mission visited 40 target and non-target schools.25In two areas,
provincial offices had decidedbeforehand which schoolswere to be visited, and the
missionwas expected in the schools. Target schoolsin West Nusa Tenggarawere
chosen at random fiom a list, and nearby non-target schools\werevisited. All schools
visited were typically near main roads, and might be more fiequently supervised.Subject-

 RESULTSOFTHE JUNIORSECONDARY                        EDUCATION        PROJECTS

 Expansion of access to junior secondary educationin a cost-effective and equitable
 way: Fully achieved

 2.11 Trend data using Susenas sources26indicatethat the shareof the population
 having completedjunior secondaryhas been rising (Figure 1).In 1995gross enrollment
 was 66 percent and by 2002 it was about 80percent. In the sameperiod, the net
 enrollment increased by 10percentage points - fi-om51percent to 62.7 percent. Between
 1997and 2004,junior secondary education enrolmentsincreased nationallyby 3percent
 fiom 2,667,022to 2,815,690, and the numbers completinggrade 9 increased by 35 percent
 fi-om 1,774,681to 2,398,200.~~The rate of increasehas been higher for rural areasthan
 for urban areas, reducing the gap between rural and urbanparticipation injunior
 secondaryeducation. Between 1995and 2002, net enrollmentsin ma1 areas increased
 fiom 42.65 to 54.3percent, and in urban areas fiom 66.51to 71.90percent (Annex Table
B-3). Thus, the government target to maintain enrolmentlevels at 1997figures has been
met and surpassed. According to MoNE data, the country also attained an 80percent
gross enrollment by the target date of 2004 (Table 3).

 2.12      The threeprojects altogetherbuilt 567 new schools and 1121new classrooms in
 existing schools,to accommodatea total of 167,450additional students (Table4). These
 new school seats accounted for 3-21percent of school places existingat the province
 level before project effectiveness. The provinces supportedby the threeprojects showed
 annual increases considerablyabovethe national average. In the East Java project,
 enrollmentsincreased by 74 percent between 1997and 2004, while in the Central
 Indonesiaproject they increasedby 11percent and in Sumatraproject they increased by
 21 percent. Data arenot availableat the district level, and without baseline monitoring
 information and it is not possible to assesswhether areas with increased studentplaces
 have higher enrolments over comparable areas without new studentplaces. Factors other
 than the mere availability of class space may account for the enrolment demand.
 However, occupancyrates of the new facilitieswere high, 99-108percent.28(ADB
reports similarresultswith the provinces whose civil works it financed.29)Furthermore,
research on the school constructionprograms of the 1970salso suggested that
construction increasesaccess and ultimatelyprivate rates of return to ed~cation.~'Thus,
the available schoolplaces seem to have contributed to enrolment increases. The schools
visited by the IEG mission had attractivebuildings and landscaping, in contrast with non-
target schoolsof the area. Principalsreported great eagernessby studentsto attend the
new schools.




28. World Bank 2005a-2005c. For example,West Kalimantan had about 51,300junior secondaryeducation studentsin
1994,and the project built 5960new seats; in Central Kalirnantan there were 17,500studentsbefore the project built
3680more seats(21percent). By contrast, Central Java had about 530,000 students, and the projectsbuilt 17,160new
places (about 3 percent).

29. The ADB project built a total of 690 new schoolsand 1032new classroomsin existing schools.As with the World
Bank projects, "open" schools and life skills programs facilitated entry into secondaryeducation of almost 15,000out -
of-school youth and helpedraise primary-to-secondarytransition rates from 71-95 percent to 75-98percent across
project provinces (actual attendanceand graduationrates are not discussed in the ADB documents).Theproject did not
lower dropout rate to a target of 2.5 percent because of high madrasah dropout rates, but provincial dropoutrates
decreased fiom 6.3 to 5.1 percent (Appendix5). ADB reports that the numbers of studentsenrolled in its project
provinces increasedby 13percentbetween 1999100and 2003104 compared with a national increaseof only 2 percent
(ADB 2005, appendix 4). ADB rated its project as 'highly successful.'

2.14      Overall, only about 70 percent of primary school graduates go on directly to the
junior secondarylevel O;igure 3).32However, the percentage has increased substantially
in many of the provinces that received additional schoolplaces (Annex Table B-5).

 school concept, known as Terbuka (a formaljunior secondaryeducationimplemented
 through afternoontutoring sessions twice a week), that has mainly served girls.
 Appraisalproject documents showedthat sekolah terbuka students had much lower test
 scoresthan regular students,but limitedmeasures have been taken to improve
 perf~rmance.~~IEG mission visits found absenteeism rates approximating50 percent.
 The instruction was limited, andteachers mainly stood by whle students tried to studyin
 groups. This program is unlikelyto have the desired effect in increasing substantially
 access and teachingthe desired skillsto students.

 2.17      Did the School GrantsProgram Succeed in ReducingDropout? The Scholarship
 and Grants Program was launched in September 1998to stem the tide of school closures
 and dropouts that were expectedto result fiom the economic crisisthat began in the
 secondhalf of 1997.35After 1998,it was administeredas a separateprogram and ended at
 the same time as the three projects, in June 2003. A total of US$350 million was
 dedicatedto this program. Evaluation studies showed that it succeeded in softening the
 effect of the crisis, preventing a largedrop in enrolments, and enabled thousands of poor
 childrento remain in school.(Details in Annex C.)

Improvementof teaching atjunior secondaryschools:Partially achieved

2.18       The projects satisfactorilyexecuted a series of activities intended at improving the
quality of educationand increasingstudentperformance. Competency-basedcurricula
were introduced,teaching materials were made availablein schools; and over 35,000
teachers as well as 17,000administrators received training on specificclassroom
behaviors. The external evaluations report that about 75 percent of the teachers have
found the training useful and of good quality. Teachersreported that they had learned
new behaviors (includingcooperative learning), increasedtheir use of teaching media and
class discussions,encouraged studentsto raise questions and use their own language in
replying, and expected that studentshad become more active learners. In East Java, 88
percent of the teachers believed that they had become better prepared, 94 percent thought
that the studentswere more enthusiasticwith new methods, and 70 percent thought the
students asked more questions. In central Indonesia, 65 percent of teachers and 83
percent of students reportedlyexhibitedthe target classroombehavio~-s.36Overall,the
share of formally qualifiedpublic-school teachershas risen fiom 60 percent in 2001 to
about 73 percent in 2004.37But no routine examinations of teacher competencies exist to
assess improvedcompetencies, although such an activity is planned.

2.19      An observationalstudyconducted in East Java suggeststhat training outcomes
may be more limited than self-reports suggest (Table 6). Teachers spent 27 percent of
class time watching students do seatwork, an activity that has often been associated with

case that qualitygives additionalrates of return (SAR for Sumatra, Ln. 4095, p. 65).

 a techniquenecessaryto help students acquire connected knowledgerather than merely
 memorize a series of items. Thoughprincipalshad been trained in classroom
 supervision,evaluatorsrarely found them doing this task in detail or using the required
 format. Facilitators had been hired and trained for more detailed supervision, but at 60-70
 percent of the visits, they &d not observe classes but only gathered the teachers in a room
 and spoke to them.39

 2.20 Although the project made considerableefforts to providetextbooks, practically
 all schools visited by the IEGmission reported a scarcityof textbooks. The situation is
 reflected on a national scale,where the averageratio of books per student in lower
 secondaryeducationis 0.85.Students often shared books after-hours or bought
 inexpensiveexerciseworkbooks, but observationsshowed extensive writing and copying
 of texts on the blackboard, an activitythat does not use classtime well. One problem
 was that many schoolshad not yet adoptedcompetency-basedcurricula and principals
 hesitated to buy textbooksthat might become obsolete.

  materials were used other than textbooks and workbooks; materials such as maps were
  rarely displayed in classroomsand geographylessons were conductedwithout them. In
  the 40 schoolsvisited, the mission observed organized cooperative learning activitiesin
  only six classes. The school guest books showed that inspectors visited about every three
  months, but their notes suggested more concern with cleanlinessthan with instruction.
  They left behind brief notes such as 'good job, continue'. On the other hand, classroom
  time was found to be largelyused for instruction. Earlierreports and a study that had
  documented considerablewastage of instructionaltime in primary school,but therewere
 no prior measurementsof time use in secondaryscho01.~'No differences in instructional
 methods were observablebetween target and non-target schools.

 2.22       Higher qualityinputs, such as textbook availability,teacher educationlevel and
 whetherteachers have secondjobs promote higher test scoresinjunior secondary
                 Not surprisingly,learningoutcomesof the Ebtanas, the gthgrade school-
 leavingexaminationhave been modest and uncertain. The provinces included in the
 Sumatraproject showed increases,while the other two projects showed a pattern of small
 increases and reductions (Table 6).43The reason for the trends is unclear. Nationally, test
 scoreshave been rising (Table 7), but they are not equated from one year to the next or
 acrossprovinces, so the actual direction of student performance is not well documented.
 In the 2005 national examination, about 22 percent of thejunior secondaryeducation
 studentsfailed in the furst administration. Test scoresmay be hard to interpret because
 the increased enrollmentsevery year tend to come fromrural and lower-income
 populations. At thejunior secondarylevel, student absenteeism tends to be higher than in
 other levels.Rural students aremore likely to be absent than urban students (Table B-6)
 may fail more often.

43. Standardizedachievementtests are not systematically used in Indonesia,&d there is 1ittle.hardevidence on
achievementlevelsand trends forthe education system. For primary schools,the tests are developed in eachprovince
or district on the basis of blueprints, so they arenot statisticallycomparable. Thejunior secondaryeducationuses test
items from an item bank developed through the projects. However, the scoring and grading are based on the rank of
the previousnational exam results. The Ebtanas scores have a scale of 0-10,with a graduallyincreasingpassing score,
set at 4.25 (42.5percent correct responses) in 2005. Though scores are low nearly everyonepasses on the second try,
and there are concernsabout some weaknesses in the test administration. The graduationrate in 2000 was 98 percent
(Oey Gardiner 2000).

 2.23      The uncertain learningoutcomes are also consistentwith the modest Indonesian
 performance on the internationally comparative Trends in International Mathematics and
 ScienceStudy for grade 8 (TTMSS; Table 8).44Its scoreswere below average and much
 lowerthan other Asian countries, such as Malaysia. Between 1999and 2003, scoresin
 math improved slightly (fi-om406 to 41I), but in sciencethey deterioratedby 16points,
 and the rankingof Indonesia fell fi-om34thto 36fi,below that of Egypt. In another
 assessment,the 2003 ProgrammeInternational Student Assessment (PISA) for 15-year
 olds, Indonesia ranked 38th out of 41 countriesin natural sciencesand 39th in
 mathematics. By comparison,Korea ranked 6th in natural sciences, 7th in reading, and
 3rd in mathernati~s.~'There may be a tradeoff between the rapid enrolment increases and
 quality,particularly in sciencewhere equipment is needed for the more advanced levels.

2.24      Internationaltest results are to some extent puzzlingbecause the number of hours
that Indonesian students studyis very high. Schools function223 days per year, 7-8 hours
per day, 6 days a week and offer in grades 1-9 a total of 8,836 instructionalhours.
Indonesiareports to UNESCO that it teaches 25 percent more hours than the global
averageand 18percent more hours than high-income OECD countries (Figures4 and 5,
B4).46Thus it will be important to understand better why these hours are not used as
efiiciently as they are in other countries.

46. In some schools, studentsin grades 1-2may only study for 2.5 hours daily (525 hours per year), an issue that
caused lowachievementthat carriedover in secondaryschool (World Bank 1998,p. 30.) However, Indonesiareports to
UNESCOa statutorynumber of instructional hours that is among the highest in the work in primary school (about 1260
vs. 800OECD) and also above in higher secondary (738 vs. about 650; Siniscalco2002).

 Strengthening of the management capacityat all levels of the educationsystem:
 Fully achieved

 2.25     The 1998sectorstudy, carried out as the projects became effective, described an
 overly centralizedmanagement forjunior secondary education by the Ministry of
National Education(MoNE). It hypothesized that decentralization if the publicjunior
 secondarysystem was necessaryif the systemwere to expand for universal coverage,
clear responsibilitiesamongdifferent levels of government and schools, and funding
mechanisms that promote equity and effi~iency.~'The decentralizationfiscal autonomy
laws (nos. 22 and 25 of 1999,subsequentlysuperceded)gave implementersthe
opportunityand obligation to develop schoolsin a decentralized fashion.48

2.26      The projects have carried out many training and organizationalactivitiesdesigned
to strengthenmanagement capacityat all levels of the education system, includingprivate
and religious schools (Tables A1-A3) Though objectivemeasures are unavailable, school
principals interviewedby external evaluatorsreported benefits of the training and greater
ability to manage the schools. A school financingmodel for poor rural areas was based
on awardingblock grants and matching grants on the basis of proposals. Officials
interviewed reported to the IEG mission that in most cases constructionand provision of
physical inputsproved to be more cost-effectivethan the contractors previously utilized
by MoNE. Furthermore, principals and province staff interviewed often reported that
constructionqualityhad improved and better-looking schoolshad been built. Also the
block grant model resulted in making a new school operationalin less than six months
from the start,compared to an earlier minimum of two years. Local governments in
many cases provided supplementaryfunding for additional classrooms to accommodate

 more students,or to provide roads for easier accessto the school location. External
 evaluationsoffer similar conclusions;they also suggest that communityinvolvement may
 have improvedteaching, but some principalsand committees did not clearlyunderstand
 procedures and sometimes submittedpoorly designed proposals to local authorisethat
 required assistance from the district offices. Disbursementof funds afterproject
 completionhas often been late or lower amountshave been approved, and schools have
 been left with few operating h d s . At the provincial level this has limited the abilityof
 staffto carry out training and supervision.

 2.27      Communityinvolvement has been very encouraging,but progresswas slower
 than expected. Communitydecisions on how to spend the money led to the establishment
 of school councils,meetings, and publicity on how much money each schoolreceives and
 how it is spent. However, actual involvement has been sporadic. About 97 percent of
 schools in Indonesia had committeesby 2004, but 80percent of them met only every six
 months and played only a peripheral role in principals' decisionmaking49 (Nearlyall
 committee members are male.) Teachertrainingwas sometimesnot carried out as
 expected, but committeemembers interviewedby the mission did not know details about
 this educationalarea. An ethnographicstudy also found fewermeetingsthan expected
 and limited communityinv~lvement.~~Members oftenrubberstampthe plans presented
 by principal^.^' For example, evaluationreports on school constructionpresented cost
 irregularitiesthat communities were unable to prevent, or may have even caused them.52
 For example, teachers are sometimeshired fiom the community, and committeemembers
 may have conflicts of interest. (Similarly, communityoversight inthe scholarshipaward
 decisions for the very poor resulted in some leakageto those who were better off.53)The
 limited oversightthat has been inherent with decentralizationhas made it difficult to
 monitor communitydecisions about schools.

   3.       Ratings

   Project Outcomes

   3.1      The threejunior secondaryeducationprojects enabled the governmentto
   implementinnovative strategies at this level of education and meet its enrolment goals.
   The decentralizationpolicy, in conjunctionwith the whole-school approachmade it
   possible to expand the system even in a time of financialcrisis. The block grant
   mechanism was an innovative and ambitiousstrategyto increase school effectivenessand
   equity.

   3.2      The outcomes of all threeprojects are rated satisfactorybecause the access and
   management targets were substantiallymet. The strategiesand project designswere
   highly relevant to the country's needs and appropriate for its implementationcapacity,
   despite some doubts duringappraisal. Most activitieswere carried out despitevarious
   difficulties, and eficacy was substantial. The whole-school strategyto ensurethat a full
  package of inputs would be in place before the school opened was to ensure sustainability
  of project inputsthrough communityinvolvement, and th~sstrategy overall proved
  effective. Average constructionunit costs were not available, but officials reported that
  schools cost less to build through community involvement.Eflciency for all three
  projects is rated modest. The degreeto which the interventions resulted in improved
  student learningis uncertain, particularly given the unusually large number of
  instructionalhours that Indonesia offers its students; fiuthermore, all three projects faced
  governanceproblems, and execution had to be terminated earlyin someprovinces
  because of misprocurement.


  InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

  3.3      The projects were implemented within the frameworkof the 1999"big bang"
  decentralizationlaws. The sudden devolution of considerableauthority and responsibility
  to district levelswith fundingmoving fkom direct channelsto a systemof block grantsto
  district budgets forced local-level institutions to operate as never before. The effectwas
  mixed. A studyconductedsix years after the legislation showsconsiderable inefficiencies
  resulting from conksion over roles and responsibilitiesbetween levels of government.54
  Some officialsinterviewed have stated that these are still in flux. Also monitoring
  systems in various ministries have broken down, since ministries no longer have dlrect
  control of district staff. Thus, data quality and quantityin various sectors has declined.

  3.4      However, the situationmay be improving in the medium term. A survey showed
  that 60percent of householdsperceived public education services to have improved since
  2003. The households and individualslivingwithin the districtssurveyed saw significant
- improvement in enrollmentrates of children aged 13-15,from 78 to 81percent. About
  36percent of respondents perceived their own school qualityto be improving; rural
  householdswere more likelyto attest to improvementsin the quality of teachers than
  urban households (23 versus 16percent). By contrast, they were less likely to identify


  54. Pradhan et al. 2006.

 improvementsin academicperformance (7 versus 13percent). On balance, most
 respondentsviewed postdecentralizationtrends in public education (includingjunior
 secondary) to be po~itive.'~This evidence is encouraging,given the large-scale of
 changesthat have been made in the sectorpartly throughproject activities. Overall, the
 institutionaldevelopmentimpact for all projects is rated substantial.


 Sustainability

 3.5      Overall sustainability for all three projects is rated likelj7. Government policies
 and strategiescontinue to target underserved communitiesin rural areas. Many of the
nationalpolicyreform strategiesthat were applied under the project continue to be
 supported. These include the whole school approachand grants for underserved new
 schools.

3.6       Nevertheless, the resilience of some benefits to shocksis uncertain. The Bank's
2004 education sectorreview raises concernsabout the level of financing for schools
after the implementationand the sufficiencyof the grant systemto covering basic
operationscosts, let alone efforts to improve quality. The abilityof district governments
to provide adequate allocations and supervisionsis variable, and the degree to whch
specificareas in the countrywill improve is unpredictable.Manyjunior secondary
education schoolshave been receiving50 percent or less than their pre-decentralization
budgets. Support is particularlyimportant for new schoolsthat must cover start-up costs
as each new grade is added. The central government plans to launch a textbook block
grant that will cover all sclioolsin three years and may stabilize support to schools.


Bank Performance

3.7      Thebank has done extensivesector work and carried out much research in the
education sector,includingjunior secondaryeducation. Project appraisal was detailed
and careful, with much beneficiary participation carried out thanks to a Japan Policy and
Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant for technical assistance. The Bank's
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated project quality at entry as satisfact~ry.~~TheBank
showed flexibilityduring the Asian crisis and made it possible to restructure projects
rapidly as the need arose. Placing the projects under one umbrella simplified project
management, and this helped the governmentfocus on the overall goals forjunior
secondaryeducation.

3.8      In many respects, the Bank became the agent of management change. It
encouraged the countryto adopt in all sectorspolicies such as decentralization and
improved governance. To reduce dependenceon the central government staff it
promoted building through parent associations,autonomy, and accountability. Although
on earlier occasionsthe Bank may not have consideredmismanagement evidence
sufficient for action, in these projects it did. The institutioninsisted on restitution and
follow-up in the corruption casesrelated to these and other education projects (such as


55. World bank 2005d, 2004.

56. World Bank 2005a-c, p. 3.

 the Book and ReadingDevelopmentproject) and now requires anticorruptionplans by
 the government for new lending. In response, MoNE has launched a corruptionresolution
 unit. The Bank's strategyhas given a strongwarning to the public that corruption,at least
 in projects involvingthe Bank, would not be tolerated. Several of the officials
 interviewed praised the Bank for its close monitoring and supervision. Overall, Bank
 performance for the three projects is rated satisfactory.


 Borrower Performance

 3.9      Overall,borrowerperformance is rated satisfactoiy. The central project
 implementationunit was staffedwith qualified employees and was competently
 managed,althoughprovincialunits were less so. It implemented three complexprojects
 and carried out most planned activities, particularly under the difficult circumstances of
 the Asian crisis and in a decentralizationframework.

 3.10     The Borrower has also adopted a number of suggested sectorpolicyreforms5'
 including the use of: (a) block grant funding; (b) scholarshipprograms for poor students;
 (c) contract teachers to provide short-term relief of teacher shortages; (d) direct financing
of grants and scholarshipsto schools and students,respectively; and (e) government-
 financed, community-lednew school constructionand schoolrehabilitation programs.
Theseprocedures were innovations in Indonesiathat were established duringthe projects
and laterbecame national policy. They signal a decisionby the Governmentto manage
the educationsectormore efficientlythan it has in the past.



4.        Issues and Prospects in Sectoral Strategy

4.1       In an effort to recuperate the educational losses,ofthe 1997economiccrisis,the
governmenthas developed a new National Education Development StrategicPlan for
2005-2009.~'The government is proceeding with the implementation of universal basic
education (Educationfor All) and plans to expand gross enrolmentincreases from about
83.3 percent in 2005 to 96.6percent in 2009 and net enrollmentincreses from 63.7
percent in 2005 to 75.5 percent in 2009. (For senior secondary education the enrollment
target would be 69.9 percent or 7.5 million studentspeople in 2009, up fkom 56.0percent
or 5.59million studentsin 2005). Budget allocations for educationhave been low. The
countryin the past has spent2.8 percent of per capita GDP on educationcomparedto 2.2
percent for China, 2.8 percent of Vietnam, 3.1 percent for Singapore, 4.1 percent of India,
and 5.4percent of Thailand, and 7.9 percent of Malay~ia.'~The incremental costs
associatedwith EFA would be 18percent of the 2004 per-pupil cost of primary education
at the district level and 35 percent forjunior secondaryeducation (Table B-5). The
government has committedto increasingexpendituresto the level needed for universal
basic education.To increase expenditures in a decentralizedframework, the government
plans to expandthe schoolgrant subsidypolicy (Financingof OperationalCosts- BOS) to

59. World Bank 2004,p. 69.

 provide gradually freebasic education for all. The operational funds are to be given to
 both public andprivate, general and religious schools so that by 2009 every student in a
 basic educationunit can receive the operational funds in the form of scholarship. New
 schoolswill continue to be built and those in bad conditionwill be refurbished.

 4.2      Universal basic educationis promoted in hopes that it will improve Indonesia's
 competitivenessin the global market. The country's modest performance in international
 assessmentshas received considerableattention. The government has decided that
 studentsmust become better able to analyze and synthesizeknowledge and make
 decisions on the basis of their knowledge. Currentlysalariesaccount for 85-90percent of
the budgets, so the governmentplans to increase expenditureson non-salary budget items
 such as staff development,maintenance and infrastructure, and to support expenditures
 aimed at improving quality. Qualityimprovement will mean identifying those
institutional arrangements (such as standards, structures, and incentives)that will
improveperformance and accountabilityin the context of local autonomy. So, essential
performance standardsmust be set, measured, and monitored throughout the education
system. An important component is better teacher preparation.

4.3       The Indonesianparliament passed a new law about teachers and university
lecturersin December2005, whose implementationis to start in July 2007. Among other
issues, the law declares that futureteachers will be university graduates who will teach
only the subject they have studiedin the university and must be certifiedto teach.
Through a process that is being determinedin 2006, teachers will be certifiedaccording
to their academic, social, and moral competencies.(It is estimated that 80percent of the
2.37 million primary and secondary-level teachers will require someupgrading.) The
country spendsan inordinate amount of time educatingstudents,but the payoff appearsto
be limited.Nearly half of the classrooms observed were engaged in c'passive"tasks that
provide much-needed practice in the reproductionof specificinformation,but may fail to
connect it to other knowledge that will lead to deductivereasoningand use of the
knowledge. There is a risk, therefore, that the certificationprocess under current criteria
will not reinforce the analytical skillsthat the country needs.

4.4      One means to specifythe classroombehavioursteachers should demonstrate
would be to studythe effectsof the most common classroom activitieson the retention of
factual information and creation of complex reasoning. (Some donorshave promoted
"active learning" and group work but without a body of research to show the effects of
these activities on test scores.) Detailed classroomresearch could be conducted in
Indonesia as it has been conductedin Germany, Japan, and other countries.60Such


  60. Class sessionshave been videotaped and procedures coded for activitiesused teach math and science concepts
 (Stigler and Hiebert 1999). In the U.S. that scored low, students were more often taught definitionsand practiced
 routine procedures; they learned specificrules rather than the underlyingrationale. Japanese studentsscored much
 higher. Teachers taught the principlesthat would enable students to solve complexproblems, and they often
 connected abstract math topics to historical discoveries and real-world use. Problems solved in class were linked,
 creatinga coherent knowledgestructure. Teachers also took advantage of students' abilityto memorize, asking them
 to repeat rules that they immediatelyput into practice. Deductivereasoning (math proofs) were used in 53 percent of
 Japaneseclasses and not at all in the U.S. classes. The studymay also demonstrate the effect of distractionson
 consolidation;Japanese classes were never interrupted,while 31percent of U.S. classeswere interrupted for
 extraneousreasons. Seatworkin both countriesaccounted for about 40 percent of class time; but in the low-scoring
 U.S., seatwork consisted of 96 percent practice, 3.5 percent application, and 0.7 percent inventive thinking, whereas

 researchwould provide empiricalevidenceregardingthe activitiesthat improvethe
 likelihood of high scores in TIMSS. Teacher training and certification could proceed on
 that basis. Training and teacher certificationstrategycould then be oriented towards the
 use of more cognitively efficientclassroom activities.

 4.5      An important issue that may undermine governmenteffortsto increase teaching
 effectiveness is the number and salariesofjunior secondaryteachers. Although class
 sizestended to be large (about 38 students), student-teacherratios in schoolsvisited by
 the IEG mission (particularlyin East Java and West Nusa Tenggara)were low; theywere
 15.7,while in other areas schoolswere observed to have student teacher ratios of 2,5,7,
 11,or 16.Teachersreport working about 24 hours per week (TableB-7) and nominally
 they work in Indonesia about as much as in OECD countries (738 vs. 716hours per
 year).61However, in the schoolsvisited by the mission, teachers oftenreported worlung
 15-18 hours per week. Thereason given was that teachers should onlyteach in their
 specialty area, and onlyreligion teachers should teach religion. Thus, many teachers in
 fact work part-time while gettingpaid for full-timejobs.

 4.6      It appears that the government effortsto increaseeducational expendituresmay
have resulted in hiring teachers who are not necessarilyneeded. (Accordingto
government staff, approximately25 percent of teachers are surplus.). Hiring teachers on
temporarycontractsis easy, and communities may support this trend to help employ
residents. However, the largenumbers of teachers keep the salaries low and raise a risk
that the less competentones tend to be attracted to schools.Also, the real per-hour pay of
teachers may be distortingwage data.

4.7      Rather than employmany and poorly paid teachers with limited teaching
competencies, Indonesiamight profit from fewer,better-paid,more versatileteachers
working hll-time. Thus, the govemmentmight considerrevising its policy of keeping
salariesand officialworking hours low as well as the one-subjectrequirement. Instead,
teachers can be trained to teach multiple subjects accordingto their interestand
competency (Thiswas a project activitythat had limited implementation.) It would be
advantageous to use the opportunitypresented by the major expansionof thejunior
secondarysystemto redeploy teachers more flexiblyin order to meet some of the
additional demand.


4.8      Instructionalissuesare also evident in the after-hours"terbuka" schools that in
effect serve fewer studentsthan envisaged due to dropout. Many poor students are
unable to learn the material by themselves while teachers stand by. Active engagement
and improved instructionmay produce higher attendance in this policy instrument of
poverty alleviation. Quality-orientedgrantsmight be given to districtswho rationalize
teacher deployment and demonstrateimprovementsin student grades or test scores.




  in Japan seatwork time consistedof41 percent practice, 15 percent application,and 44 percentthinking (Sigler and
  Hiebert 1999,p. 71).

5. Lessons

5.1 This assessment confirms a number of IEG lessons from the education sector:

    It is possible to target successfullypoor areas for interventions aimed at
    increasingenrollments, even in times of financial crises. Scholarships
    administered to the poor and disbursed to them promptlymay be effective in
    sustainingenrollmentsand preventing dropout (para. 2.17, Annex C)

    Community involvementmay be cost-effective and reliable means to build and
    support schools, particularly when the population has basic education and poverty
    is not extreme. Nevertheless, school committeemembers may not be able or
    willing to keep school expenditureslow, maynot have much time to spend on
    school affairs, and may be unable to advise the principal effectively on
    educational matters (para.2.27)

    Decentralization pronlotes effectiveuse of resources. However, not all local
    authoritiesare equally competent or interestedin educatingthe poor. A central
    government may find it necessaryto meet the basic educationalneeds of the
    poorest communities directly if national goals for basic educationare to be
    achieved (para.2.26)

    International assessmentsmay provide critical feedback to governmentsinterested
    in increasingthe competitiveness of their human capital. They may alsoprovide
    means to help countriesimprovetheirperformance (paras. 2.23,4.3).
