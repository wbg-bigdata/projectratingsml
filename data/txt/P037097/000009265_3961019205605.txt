LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Indonesia
Implementing Agency:      Directorate-General of Primary and Secondary Education,
Ministry of Education and Culture
Beneficiaries:            Approximately 580,000 school children and out-of-school youth in the
provinces of East Java and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), with emphasis
on girls and rural communities.
Poverty:                  Program of Targeted Intervention. The project would target
student scholarships, new and alternative schools, and over 60
percent of quality intervention to poor rural areas.
Amount:                   US$99 million equivalent
Terms:                    Repayable in 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate for currency pool loans.
Commitment Fee:           0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after
signing, less any waiver.
Financing Plan:           See Table 4.3 under para. 4.7.
Economic Rate             The economic rate of return for the project investment ranges from
of Return:                16 percent in East Nusa Tenggara to 18.3 in East Java. High
returns were found for both quality and access components.
Returns on quality enhancements were generally higher (22
percent) than for expansion of access in both provinces.

1. JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION ISSUES IN EAST JAVA AND EAST
NUSA TENGGARA (NTT)
A. BACKGROUND
1.1    Over the past 25 years, the CGovemment of Indonesia (GOI) has demonstrated a strong
commitment to education and as a result, the country has achieved one of the best rates of
primary education enrollment in the developing world. The Govemment led an enrollment
drive and massive school building program in the 1970s (SD INPRES), sharply increasing
primary school services throughout its dispersed territory. The gross enrollment rates stood at
75 percent in the early 1970s and went up to about 90 percent by the end of that decade. By
the mid-1980s, gross enrollment rates exceeded 100 percent and by 1994/95 had reached 112
percent. The effort is not complete because of quality concems and the need to increase
retention rates, but the achievements at this level have been remarkable. Annexes 1, 3 and 4
provide basic data on the educational structure and administration in Indonesia (see also para.
1.12).
1.2   The Government is now looking to future development needs, and has reiterated its
determination to pursue a proactive program of junior secondary education as part of the newly
designed nine--year basic education system. Therefore, while maintaining its concem with
quality primary education for all, the Government aims at universal basic education (grades 1-
9) by 2008-9, as an imperative way to meet the human resource requirements for transforming
the economy from one based on natural resources to one relying more on industry and
technology.
1.3   The decision to expand junior secondary education participation in Indonesia as rapidly
as feasible is justified for several reasons (see Annex I for detailed background). First,
expansion appears to be a precondition for the rapid growth of the economy in the medium
term, and particularly so in a rapidly modernizing province such as East Java (see paras. 1.26-
1.30). Recent research on the development of East Asian economies indicates that with the
achievement of near universal primary education, expanding enrollments at the secondary
(junior and senior) level had a strong impact on economic growth. Secondary education plays
the role of providing more educated entrants to the labor force, enhancing workers' trainability,
and providing qualified inputs into higher levels of education. In this regard, the Indonesian
economy and labor market is in the midst of a structural transformation. Since 1990, there has
been a marked slow-down in employment creation in agriculture and an acceleration in the rate
of growth of job creation in manufacturing, construction, transport and communication, and
services in general. After a period of wage stagnation in the 1980s, there are strong indications
of rising real wage rates throughout the country and a marked decline of employment in
agriculture. If sustained nationally for a decade or so, these trends imply the absorption of
remaining pockets of surplus labor, and as happened in other NICs, the transformation of an
agrarian economy into one relying on the education and productivity of its workers. Social rates
of return to education computed from 1986-92 indicate that retums to junior secondary
education are the highest among the education subsectors. East Java, on a faster and more
advanced economic path, is already reaching this turning point, whereas other regions such as



2               East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT') are not expected to reach it before the end of the decade (see
paras. 1.39-1.41).
1.4    The second justification for significant Government attention to junior secondary
education is that the number of JSE school places is still limited relative to demand, despite
substantial outlays by parents and a significant private sector response (see Annex 1, Sections I
and II). This shortage is highlighted by several factors: the continued strong demand for
generally more costly and often lower quality private junior secondary schools, large numbers
of unsuccessful applicants to schools, the frequency of double shifts and large classes, and the
use of school library and laboratory space for routine classroom teaching.
1.5    A third rationale for Government intervention is to assist in removing barriers of cost
and isolation that keep many of the rural poor out of school, as is the case mainly in NTT. The
total cost to families of educating a child in junior secondary school accounts for 80 percent of
per capita household expenditure of the lowest income quintile. Junior secondary education is
therefore beyond the reach of many of the poor and near poor. The opportunity costs of
keeping children in school further exacerbate the problem (see Annex 1, Section 1).
1.6    A  fourth rationale relates to likely externalities associated with investments in
secondary education. Research from comparable countries has pointed to externalities such as
reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that correlate with female
secondary education (see box on p. 8). For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a mother's
education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of women with
some primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10 percent of women
with junior secondary education. Furthermore, analysis of nutritional status in Indonesia finds a
strong effect of maternal education on children's nutritional status: for women with between
zero and five years of education, an additional year of education has no impact on the child's
nutritional status, while, among women with six to twelve (or more) years of education, an
additional year of schooling improves nutritional status significantly.
1.7   The role of the Govemment would therefore be to: (a) help expand the number of
school places through a combination of direct investment and measures to stimulate further
private sector/community participation in the provision of school places; (b) improve the
teaching-learning quality of the existing and new junior secondary schools; and (c) ensure that
the poor are given increased opportunity to participate in the expansion process of quality
education at the junior secondary level.
1.8    Sector Financing Plan. Achieving universal nine years of education will require
significant additional public resources to be channeled into the education sector overall and into
basic education, in particular. Estimates of the total costs of the junior secondary expansion
program come to approximately $7.6 billion to be phased out over a ten-year period (see
Annex I for details). The cost estimates assume that the private sector will at least maintain its
high current share of about 40 percent of total enrollment. Additional financing of an average
$120 million during the next ten years of expansion (assuming 6 percent per annum growth of
' The Indonesian name for East Nusa Tenggara is Nusa Tenggara Timur, or NTT, and thus, for the sake
of simplicity and comprehension, NTT is the acronym used in this document.

the budget) would be required, implying that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary
education would need to increase from the current 13 percent to approximately 16 percent of
the education budget in the next few years. Overall, Indonesia would need to increase its
allocation to education as a proportion of GDP by approximately 0.2 percent. This does not
take into account, however, increases in other education subsectors, which may equally be
required.
1.9   In order to finance the expansion, the Government has both increased its education
investments and requested help from donors to close the financing gap. In its most recent
budget allocations (1996/97) the education sector budget was increased by 20 percent, one of
the highest increases of all GOI sectors. The corresponding budget for junior secondary
education saw a 24 percent rise over last year's budget allocation (see paras. 6.4-6.6).
1.10   Consistent with the important role it has played in basic education development, the
Government is increasing its education investments and requesting help from donors (see para.
2.1). These efforts include a proposed program of up to eight junior secondary education
projects for which World Bank assistance would be sought over the next four to five fiscal
years. The present project, which encompasses the two provinces of East Java and Nusa Tenggara
Timur (see Table 1.1 and Annex 2 for provincial profile), or about 1/5 of Indonesia's total
population, is one of an initial series of three projects (the other two being the Central Indonesia
project, which covers the provinces of Central Java, Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and
Yogyakarta, and the Sumatra Project, which covers the provinces of Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi,
Lampung and South Sumatra). The 1995 Book and Reading Development Project (Ln. 3887-
IND) and the 1996 Secondary School Teacher Development Project (Ln. 3979-lND) will
complement these efforts, as well as other planned basic education operations in other clusters
of provinces. To promote efficiency and equity in the use of resources, the Government has
recognized that educational development among and within the provinces must be balanced
and appropriate to local conditions; meeting an acceptable standard of quality; and taking
advantage of lessons learned within and outside the country.

1.11   Although the Government can and should promote expansion at the junior secondary
level, it is also aware that Indonesia will not be able to reach universal basic education
enrollment until graduation rates improve at the primary level. Despite high gross enrollment
rates at the primary level overall, about 25 percent of pupils, especially in the more difficult
remote areas, do not complete the full six years of education. Universal nine-year education
thus depends on improving the efficiency of the primary system and producing an expanded
pool of candidates for junior secondary school. The Government has started addressing this
issue through a series of initiatives, including the Primary Education Quality Improvement
Project (Ln. 3448-IND) which is piloting measures for improving education quality. Satisfying
existing unmet demand, even at current primary-to-junior-secondary transition rates during the
project period, is seen as an important objective. This will help satisfy communities that are
lukewarm to primary education because of lack of opportunities for secondary education. The
combined effects of these measures would be to improve the transition rates and the potential
for accelerating the development of junior secondary education in the future.
1.12   Structure of the Education System. The education system in Indonesia (see Annex
3) consists of a six-year primary school cycle, junior and senior secondary school cycles of
three years each, and a post-secondary system ranging from one to six years. Primary education
is largely the domain of Government: nearly five out of six pupils are enrolled in public
schools. Private schooling plays a much greater role in secondary education. Private schools
account for 41 percent of enrollment in junior secondary education and 54 percent in senior
secondary. Junior secondary education is provided through 8,712 public (46 percent) and
10,279 private (54 percent) general junior secondary schools (the Sekolah Menengah Pertama,
or SMP) and a remaining 300 vocational schools that emphasize either technical or home
economics subjects, all of which are administered by the Ministry of Education and Culture
(MOEC). The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) administers the 582 public and 7,547
private Muslim (Madrasah Tsanawiyah, or MTs) junior secondary schools. At the senior
secondary level, 3,241 public and 10,380 private schools enroll a total of 4.2 million students,
for a gross enrollment rate of 34 percent (see Annex 4 for a summary of number of students
and teachers by type of school).

1.13   Challenges in the provision of junior secondary education are common to all provinces
in Indonesia, though not to the same extent. These challenges are to (a) expand equitable
access to junior secondary education; (b) improve the quality of education throughout the
provinces; and (c) make education management more efficient as the provinces assume
increased responsibility. East Java and NTT each face these challenges under specific
educational constraints.  Access is restricted mainly by the lack of places; high direct,
transportation, and opportunity costs; and, in NTr particularly, great distances and lirnited
transportation networks (see paras. 1.31-1.34 for East Java, and 1.42-1.44 for NTT). In
response, the project would help East Java to reach 75 percent of the 13-15 age-group
coverage (up from the current 55 percent), and NTT to reach 60 percent (up from the present
39 percent) by the year 2001 (see Table 1.2). The most important factors affecting quality and
internal efficiency are: teacher skills and deployment; the availability of library and
supplementary books, teaching materials, science education equipment and methodology,
pedagogical supervision; educational assessment system and school management; the role of
private education; and the education of women.
1.14   Teachers. Although there is an excess number of teachers available in aggregate, a
distribution problem exists nevertheless between provinces and, within the same province,
between rural and urban areas. Some provinces like East Java have a large pool of teacher
candidates (in 1994-95 48,000 candidates took the general exam organized to select 2,000
teachers). Others like NTT rely on teachers from other regions to cover a deficit in locally-bom
teachers. Also, urban centers have a surplus of Pancasila teachers, but rural areas (and more
particularly in remote regions) face a chronic shortage of teachers for core subjects such as
Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science and English. This is because most rural teaching
positions are considered undesirable by urban teachers (where the majority of the current stock
is from), and soon after being appointed to rural areas, many manage to be replaced into urban
schools or find excuses to be absent for long periods. To remedy the shortage of teachers in
rural and remote areas, the project would support, on a pilot basis, the hiring of "contract
teachers" in rural schools in key academic areas (see paras. 3.25, 3.45). It would also provide
teacher dormitories (see paras. 3.19 and 3.39). In addition, the Govemment is already
providing some financial compensation for hardship. Over the longer term, the solution planned
to keeping teachers in rural areas is local recruitment and training (see Annex 5).
1.15   The unequal distribution of teachers has different consequences in the urban areas
where many teachers are underutilized, and high levels of absenteeism are observed. Teachers
generally spend only a limited time in school because of the very few hours they are assigned to
teach. This is compounded by the lack of teacher rooms in many schools, and the absence of
an environment which promotes interaction among teachers. The school principal is usually
assisted by four deputies only one of whom is responsible for pedagogical supervision.
Management is therefore focused on purely administrative issues rather than the educational
process. And the opportunity to promote improved teaching in the various subjects is lost.
Teachers recognize this gap and have organized subject matter discussion and leamning groups
(MGMP) as a part of their association effort to foster cooperation and feedback.
1.16   The de-centralization of the PKG and MGMP system (see Annex 5) to the district level
and the systematic involvement of regional MOEC staff, including supervisors and principals
in the training program (both supported by the proposed project, see paras. 3.24 and 3.44)



6               East Java and N17 Junior Secondary Education Project
would help address this issue. Establishment of subject matter groups would be encouraged in
schools, similar to those run by the teacher associations. These groups would gradually be
institutionalized as subject departments in the larger schools. Within these departments
teachers would take collective responsibility for student achievement in a given subject area
and provide systematic support for new and less experienced teachers.
1.17   Providing incentives to teachers to spend more time on teaching and reduce
absenteeism also needs to be considered. The costs of this can be high, however, as a general
salary increase for all educational staff would have large fiscal implications on the overall civil
service wage bill. Hence, specific teaching hour supplements that are phased in and linked to
performance may be introduced if an efficient management system for this can be developed.
1.18   Teacher training would be provided (see paras. 3.24 and 3.44) in the context of the
existing PKG system (see Annex 5), which would be revised so as to (a) revitalize program
activities, which have tended to become routinized through frequent repetition, and (b) give
more attention to student learning issues, since despite the efforts of previous training projects
teachers have operated as a one-way system without carefully checking what students learn and
how they learn in classroom activities. The revised PKG Model C program would include a
consideration of the special problems affecting schools in remote areas.
1.19   Student Performance Assessment. Recent teacher evaluation study (including East
Java) found that teachers very often behave within a supply-side strategy or a one-way
approach; they do not seem to be concerned whether their students are learning or not. The
student performance assessment system would give teachers a tool to assess their classes and
their students individually, and would thus help them adjust their own classroom teaching
plans, strategies and methods. This would also help school principals evaluate what and how
students are learning, their teachers' skills and agree with them on adequate remedial training
courses. Also, it would provide Kanwils and Kandeps with a general evaluation of student
achievements and specific school needs, while giving the provincial and central administration
essential information on the education system (see paras. 3.26, 3.46).
1.20   Library and Supplementary Books. Fifty-eight percent of East Java JSE schools
and 79 percent of NTT do not have a school library, and many of the existing school libraries
range from poor to practically non-functional. Indeed, many books available are not being
used, either because they do not interest the young readers, have little relationship with
classroom activities, or even are in a foreign language. In addition, current school library
facilities and restrictions do not encourage students' attendance, and the librarians lack the
skills and the status to 'bell" the available information to the potential users. In order to help
provide schools with a more diversified source of information, principals and teacher-librarians
will be given the opportunity to select library (reading, supplementary and reference) books
most suitable to their students needs, culture and preferences (see paras. 3.27-28, 3.47-48).
1.21   Science and Technology Education. The following problems currently exist: (a)
science scores are among the lowest in the five key subject matters of the JSE curriculum; (b)
science teachers are those most frequently absent in rural schools; (c) laboratory equipment is
not used by teachers, who instead adopt blackboard writing as a substitute for experiment and



StaffAppraisal Report                              7
hands-on methodology; (d) the technology component of the mandated 'Science and
Technology Education" curriculum has never been adequately integrated in the programs and
textbooks; and (e) a methodological approach has never been defined for JSE science
education as an introductory phase (see Annex 6 and paras. 3.30, 3.50).
1.22   Management. In addition to access and quality, East Java and NTT face new and
existing management issues as a result of the deconcentration of tasks from the center to the
provinces, a process this project will support. For historical and political reasons, public
administration in Indonesia has been highly centralized and decision making is tightly
controlled by central Govemment in Jakarta. The center has traditionally set objectives for
education expansion and development, with few inputs from the provinces. However, the
differences of local conditions in each province and district, accentuated by the great distances
of the outer islands from the administrative centre, make it increasingly difficult for central
administration to devise and implement satisfactory solutions to local problems. Although
central MOEC needs to retain a significant role in providing policy guidelines and promoting
regional equity and overall economic development, the Government has decided gradually to
devolve authority to the provinces and districts. As a result several functions of the Ministry of
Education and Culture are being entrusted to provincial (Kanwil) and district (Kandep/Kanim)
education offices (see paras 3.32-34, 3.52-54).
1.23   The institutional analysis of JSE's administrative system has indicated that: (i) at the
central level, there is growing understanding (increasingly translated into operational terms)
that the deconcentration of functions does not imply a less significant role for central units, but
rather a shift towards a more policy-oriented, monitoring, technically assisting and evaluating
role; (ii) at the provincial and district levels, Kanwil and Kandep/Kanin offices still lack the
managerial and analytical tools required for planning, policy and financial analysis, project
implementation and evaluation; and (iii) at the school level, principals need to improve their
ability to enhance their teachers' motivation and productivity, and learn how to better link the
schools with their catchment communities (see Annex 7). In addition, the management of
information in the administrative system requires strong streamlining. Three times a year the
administration collects from the schools large quantities of data which go up the system (from
sub-districts to the central MOEC), but are rarely analyzed and transformed into information to
be used for decision-making and provided as feedback to the schools (see paras. 3.35, 3.55).
1.24   Private Schools. Over the past ten years, private junior secondary school enrollments
have consistently been above 40 percent (see Annexes 1 and 8). The main reason for the
proliferation of private schools is the insufficient supply from the public sector, either because no
public school is available in the area, or because the existing public schools cannot meet the whole
demand. And since admission into public junior secondary schools is largely determined by the
applicants scholastic aptitude, private schools generally cater to the students with lower academic
scores. Private schools are established and operated mainly by (a) local communities which have
not succeeded in their efforts to have a public school established, (b) associations of teachers, and
(c) local religious groups.
1.25   Private schools, while costing more to parents than public schools, deliver the program at a
lower unit cost than public schools, primarily because of lower teacher salaries. Especially, in
small, poor communities, schools established by religious groups or by the community provide



8East Java and NTTJtinior Secondary Education Project
both for students' access to schooling and for job opportunities for local teachers. Because of
their lower status and opportunities, most schools are of low quality, and examination scores
are routinely below those for public schools. Nevertheless, private J'unior secondary schools
Will continue to be a relevant partner in the overall expansion and quality-driven effort. The
cost implications of three altemative public/private scenarios over the next 15 years are
analyzed in Annex 1, section E.

C. EAST JAVA
1.26.  Socio-economic Framework. East Java, with 32 million inhabitants, stands today at
the forefront of modem Indonesia, its economy spurred by rising industrialization and
modemizing agriculture, a blend not unlike that which occurred in Korea during the 1960s.
Starting from a low level, East Java has been growing steadily in the past decade, above the
national growth rates. Between 1984-1995, per capita GDP grew at about 5.5 percent,
compared to the national average of 4.8 percent, placing the province in the 'high growth, low
income" quadrant. Urbanization has been spreading, with about 32 percent of the population
living in urban areas in 1995, as compared to only 20 percent a decade earlier. Surabaya, the
province capital and the second largest city in the country, has become the leading economic
pole around which the Eastem half of Indonesia gravitates.
1.27   East Java boasts the second largest industrial base of the country in terms of
employment and establishments, and contributes about 22 percent of the national value added
by manufacturing. It also produces the highest non-oil GDP among all provinces. It has a
balanced distribution of economic activities, a distinguishing factor relative to other provinces.
It is the only province which has achieved impressive growth rates and relatively higher per
capita incomes without the advantage of substantial natural resources (oil, timber) or special
stimuli like tourist dollars or a massive influx of extemal capital.
1.28   The regional economy experienced a structural shift during the 1970s and 1980s: the
share of agriculture in the economy declined from 50 percent in 1970 to less than 25 percent in
1987, and agriculture's share of employment went down from 56 percent in 1987 to 43 percent
in 1994. The industrial sector increased from 14 to 25 percent, with the central core region
becoming a center of manufacturing industry growth. Services also grew from 36 to 50
percent. While all sectors grew between 1983 and 1987, the largest growth rate was in
manufacturing (7 percent) and services (6 percent). All these changes are expected to continue
as East Java is becoming the focal point of the transition of Indonesia's economy in the next
decade.
1.29   Given the ongoing structural transformation of its economy, and its expected further
development, East Java will require an increasingly educated labor force, among other factors.
The labor market in East Java is already recruiting senior secondary school graduates even in
semi-skilled assembly jobs in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the service sector, virtually
closing the door to the recruitment of primary school graduates for all but the most basic or
menial jobs in the modem sector and in agriculture. The wage premium for senior secondary
graduates is an additional 60 percent over junior secondary graduates, indicating that the
benefits of junior secondary education are in a way linked to the prospects of continuing to the
senior secondary level.
1.30   This overall picture of East Java prosperity, however, contrasts sharply with the high
levels of poverty still characteristic of some areas of the province -- 16 out of 37 districts have
more than 25 percent of their villages targeted by the IDT program, a 1994 Presidential
initiative providing special assistance to the poorest communities of the country (see Annex
14). The illiteracy rate for people 10-year old and above is 23 percent in East Java, as



10              East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project
compared to 16 percent nationwide. East Java urbanization figures (30 percent) are heavily
biased by eight major urban areas, as half of the 37 districts do not exceed a 19 percent
urbanization rate. If the poor and near-poor are not equipped today with higher levels of
education beyond primary, they will not be able to compete for future jobs and will be a drag
on average productivity (including agriculture productivity) in the long run.
1.31   Specific JSE Issues. Junior secondary education both as the expansion of basic
schooling for the population and the necessary condition to a senior secondary education
diploma addresses the two mentioned East Java issues, the formation of a higher-level labor
force in an equitable fashion. Some problems still hamper the achievement of these goals such
as still low (albeit increasing) JSE enrollments and low quality levels of schooling. These
problems can be analyzed in the context of poverty, economic asymmetries among province
districts, and between rural and urban populations.
1.32   A combination of factors explains the low transition rate from primary to junior
secondary education: i) high, and increasing, direct costs of education which for the poor and
near-poor (who are the groups currently not enrolled) are prohibitive; ii) high indirect costs
from the point of view of wages foregone during schooling and time spent by rural children in
traveling to far-away schools; iii) unavailability of schools in rural areas; and iv) the inability of
poor families to finance the costs (since the possibilities of borrowing for education are
practically non-existent).
1.33   The economic heterogeneity of the province translates into uneven enrollment levels
across the 37 districts. Eight districts have GER under 40 percent, with one -Sampang- as low
as 16 percent (see Annex 14). In contrast, urban areas fare rather well, with 9 districts
boasting GER above 85 percent, and 4 urban districts above 110 percent. The poor in rural
areas live on average much further away from school: children from the bottom income quintile
live at a distance 47 percent greater than children from the top quintile, thus adding an extra
burden to the already heavy junior secondary school costs.
1.34   Private schools play an important and growing role in East Java's JSE system,
accounting for about 45 percent of its total enrollments. It must be noted that private JSE
schools cater to a greater share of the poor population than the public sector, the main reason
being that, in the absence of public schools, many private schools operate in the afternoon, thus
giving poor children the opportunity to work in the morning.
1.35   Project Strategy. East Java's diversified and booming economy will increasingly
need a skilled labor force, and the industrializing urban centers will attract a steady migration
flow from rural and remote districts. Given these conditions, the project would focus more
particularly on the poor and isolated areas of the province, with the goal of providing greater
access to JSE through the construction of small (Kecil) schools (3 classrooms; see Annex 9).
In sparsely populated and remote areas, and also to cater to children who must work to help
support their families (the case of both urban and rural poor) the project would foster the
extension of the SMP Terbuka system (see para. 3.20 and Annex 9). Also, the project would
give support to 30,000 promising but poor students (2 percent of total enrollment) through the
extension of an existing scholarship program (see para 3.21).



Staff Appraisal Report                          11
1.36   To increase the market value of the JSE, the project would focus also on increasing the
quality of the education in East Java junior secondary schools. It would provide training to
about 18,000 teachers, with a specific focus on teachers with low level qualifications (see para.
3.24). To reduce teacher absenteeism in the schools located in remote areas the project would
support the construction of teacher dormitories for 56 schools (see para. 3.19). To help enhance
the classroom performance of teachers, a student assessment system would be progressively
put in place (see para. 3.26). Lastly, to improve the learning environment, the project would
support the construction of 231 libraries in existing and new schools, as well as the provision of
library books and of teaching aids to be used in class (see para. 3.22)
1.37   East Java will need, with 37 districts and a rapidly expanding education system, a
better and more efficient administrative system, and the project would provide for training of
staff at provincial, district, sub-district and school level on technical, managerial and
information processing skills (see paras. 3.31-35).
1.38   Projections. The following graph charts the planned increase in JSE enrollment
during the project lifetime and the demographic evolution of the 13-15 age cohort. It shows
that the growth of enrollment rates sponsored by the proposed project will be significantly
helped by a decrease in the age cohort (a result of East Java's successful family planning).

D. EAST NUSA TENGGARA
1.39   Socio-economic Framework. NTT presents a picture remarkably different from East
Java in terms of social and economic development. Its 3.3 million inhabitants are unevenly
spread over four main islands (and 38 minor ones) characterized by a semi-arid climate and a
mostly mountainous topography. Sixteen percent of the land area is cultivated, and only 10
percent of it can be irrigated. The growing demographic pressure, combined with the use of
slash and burn agriculture and overgrazing, is resulting in the progressive degradation of land.
The province has the lowest per capita regional GDP in the country, and a rate of economic
growth lower than the national average. Urbanization rate is low (11 percent), and
communication infrastructure is under-developed. With the exception of Kupang, the capital,



12              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project
there are only relatively small disparities in the traditional economic profile of the other 12
districts.
1.40   Agriculture remains the predominant activity, employing more than 80 percent of the
work force, but representing only 36 percent of the regional GDP; manufacturing is negligible.
Government is the second most important sector of employment, with 7.5 percent of NTT's
labor force on its payroll (5 percent nationally). In the last five years tourism has emerged as a
growth activity. Out-migration, a key factor in alleviating population pressure, has increased
sharply in the last decade, and in 1990 about 100,000 people left the islands for other provinces
of Indonesia (the negative migration balance reached 1.6 percent of total population in 1990).
There is also a strong but unreported international migration, and it is estimated that about
100,000 people (most of them hailing from Flores) have migrated to Malaysia.
1.41   Poverty is a key concem in NTT, as can be seen in its social indicators: 20 percent of
all villages are listed in the IDT program, 24 percent of the population lives under the poverty
line (the national figure is 15 percent), 69 percent of the population has monthly level of
expenditures below Rp 20,000 (as compared to 45 percent nationally), and lastly the incidence
of moderate and severe protein energy malnutrition is about 16 percent in rural areas. On the
other hand, given the economic conditions, the illiteracy rate is low, and at 22 percent compares
quite well with the 55 percent of East Timor, the 31 percent of Irian Jaya, or even the 23
percent of East Java.
1.42   Specific JSE Issues. Given NTT's lack of natural resources, struggling agriculture
and very weak industrialization, education remains the most important factor to help poor
people find their way out of poverty. Thus, one of GOI's project goals in NTT is to remove the
barriers of costs and distance that keep the children of poor families out of JSE, so as to
provide them with the opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to be competitive on the labor
market, either locally (in particular in the tourism industry, which lacks skilled workers), in
other provinces or abroad. A better education is also required to help improve the choice of
farming techniques.
1.43   In keeping with its overall economic situation, junior secondary education in NTT lags
far behind the national average, although NTT's achievement in that field is better than that of
provinces with a comparable background, thanks to a long tradition of active missionary
schools. Junior secondary education GER stood at 39 percent in 1993-94, or more than 15
points under the national average. There are no wide variations in enrollments between
districts: the lowest GER for 1993-94 was 32 percent in the district of Manggarai (Flores), as
opposed to 54 percent in Kupang, the capital.
1.44   Costs of JSE are comparatively much heavier to carry for poor households in NTT than
they are nationally, as direct costs to the household for junior secondary school are four times
higher than primary school costs (Rp 19,132 for primary and Rp 77,868 for junior secondary).
The difference between rural and urban areas is also much starker in NTT than it is nationally,
with 59 percent of urban children aged 13-15 enrolled in JSE, against only 15 percent for rural
areas.



StaffAppraisal Report                             13
1.45   Project Strategy. NTT's main obstacles to the expansion of JSE are the overall
poverty of the population as well as the isolation and difficulty of access that characterize most
of the province. The project would support the provincial effort to increase access to JSE
through the construction of small (3 to 6 classrooms) schools in the remote areas where the
number of primary graduates would warrant the provision of junior secondary school facilities
(see para. 3.38), and in other areas would promote the extension of the SMP Terbuka system
(see para. 3.40 and Annex 9). The project would also provide support to about 5,000
promising but poor students (3 percent of total enrollment) through the extension and
improvement of an existing scholarship program (see para. 3.41).
1.46   Given the all-present poverty surrounding NTT schools and the lack of learning stimuli
in the families, it is particularly important to enrich the schools with selected instruments to
foster children's learning process. The project would provide for library books and teaching
aids, and in 40 cases would also support the construction of library rooms (see paras. 3.47-49).
To help teachers improve their skills the project would support training for about 4,000 of them
(see para. 3.44-45). Private religious schools have a long tradition in NIT due to the presence
of missionary foundations. The project would allocate quality improvement activities to them
commensurate with their share in JSE enrollments.
1.47   The isolation and the difficulty of communication that characterize most of NTT islands
also call for a strengthening of education administration, including the capacity to plan the
provincial education system and assess school needs, methods and products (see paras. 3.52-
54). The project would thus provide technical and managerial training and equipment
(particularly for information processing) to provincial, district, sub-district and school levels.
1.48   Projections. The following graph charts the planned increase in JSE enrollment
during the project lifetime and the growth of the 13-15 age group. It shows that unlike East
Java (see para. 1.38), cohort sizes in NTT will stabilize only towards the end of the project, and
that some of the growth in enrollments is attributable to demographic gains.

2. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, LESSONS LEARNED
AND BANK INVOLVEMENT
A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
2.1    As part of the Repelita VI (1994/99) program, the Govemment set the important goal
of extending access to high quality junior secondary education. This objective is integral to the
goal of attaining universal coverage of nine-years of basic education by the end of Repelita VIII
(2008/09). To support this ambitious goal, the Govermment has adopted several policy
measures and strategies (see Annex 10): (a) it plans to provide additional resources to basic
education, starting with an increase of 20 percent in the overall budget of education for the
1996/97 fiscal year; (b) it has abolished junior secondary school fees and admission
requirements for primary school graduates; (c) it is providing free textbooks for all primary and
junior secondary schoolchildren; (d) it is supporting private junior secondary schools with
public teachers and other inputs to maintain and even increase their significant enrollment
participation at this school level; (e) it continues to upgrade teachers skills for both public and
private schools through in-service programs; (f) it has started the construction or development
of regular or altemative JSE schools in rural and remote villages; (g) it has phased out all
diploma courses for the pre-service education of secondary school teachers (junior and senior)
so all new teachers at that level now need to have a SI (undergraduate) degree; (h) it is
upgrading existing junior secondary school teachers to D-EH (three-year post-secondary
diploma) at public expense; and (i) it is extending subsidies (scholarships) to capable but poor
students to begin or continue junior secondary education.
B. LESSONS LEARNED
2.2   Integration of the following lessons from previous Bank projects would help build on
the exceptional performance of the Bank in the education sector in Indonesia. All the 22
previous projects (see Annex 12) have been judged satisfactory by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED), and they have set the stage for the more challenging tasks in this sector.
OED Document, No. 9752, Indonesian Education and the World Bank: an Assessment of
Two Decades of Lending, 1991: (a) found that each of the previous projects was successfully
implemented; (b) concluded that Bank support in education projects was timely and gave
valuable encouragement to the Govemment; and (c) pointed out that as the projects were
achievements and successes, they also pointed to shortcomings in the quality of education and
fragmented management --issues being addressed by the present project.
2.3    OED Report. The 1991 report has several conclusions and recommendations that are
relevant for this project:
Issue: Institution building is basic to the long-term goal of increasing the self-
sufficiency of the Indonesian education system (p. 58)
Project response: Increased emphasis is placed on institution building and self-
management at provincial and district levels.



StaffAppraisal Report                         15
Issue: Projects must be discussed within the framework of policy dialogue (p. 65)
Project Response: Regular discussions between MOEC and the Bank on development
priorities and the role of the Bank vis-a-vis other donors have been instrumental in
determining agenda for Bank lending.
Issue: Despite explicit goals, projects have not always achieved equitable distribution
of project benefits to the poor (p. 68)
Project Response: Several project interventions are specifically targeted to the poor:
school construction in rural areas, SMP Terbuka and scholarship program.
Issue: Previous projects (mainly national in scope) were often overly complex or
underestimated absorption constraints, resulting in unsatisfactory implementation (p.
70)
Project Response: The project has been designed with extensive participation from
communities, existing schools, district and provincial MOEC staff
Issue: GOI should spend a greater amount of its budget on education, to achieve the
necessary quality and institutional objectives (p. 78)
Project Response: Indonesia's education expenditures are 14 percent of total
government budget; The 1996/97 budget shows an increase of 20 percent over last
year, of which 72 percent is spent on basic education (primary and junior secondary).
Issue: Despite its role in providing educational opportunities, the private system has
received limited support from GOI and the Bank (p.79)
Project Response: GOI is committed to ensuring that the contribution from the private
sector in junior secondary education is maintained and strengthened. Recent projects
have provided private schools with quality inputs.
2.4   Lessons from  Completed and Ongoing Secondary Education Projects. Other
lessons have been drawn or confirmed by the General Operational Review of Secondary
Education Projects by HDD. Implementation of the 1990 Indonesia Secondary Education and
Management Training Project (Ln. 2472-IND) and the ongoing Second Secondary Education
and Management Project (Ln. 3158-IND) are particularly relevant in this respect.
(a)    Overall Project Design. The completed and ongoing secondary education
projects have demonstrated that the expansion of secondary education should
be addressed through a dual strategy of increasing school places and improving
the quality of education. The proposed project would include both expansion
and quality improvement objectives, to ensure continual demand for education
and to improve repetition and drop-out rates.
(b)   Flexibility in the Design of Components. Attempts to impose standard
solutions to the variety of conditions in Indonesia have not been successful, and
GOI is working to correct this situation. The policy of limiting the size of
government schools to a minimum of nine classrooms has been reviewed, to
allow public schools to be established in small communities with lower
demand, and experimentation has started with JSE alternative models.



16             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
(c)    Ownership and Participation. Local communities contribute significantly to
the development of education in their areas. Stakeholders and clients are well
placed to assess project processes, fully measure project outcomes, and to help
develop appropriate corrective measures.  They know when children are
learning and how investments in schools are being used.  Stakeholder
involvement was emphasized during the preparation process (see Annex 11)
and will be promoted under the project by providing assistance and incentives
for both private and public schools.
C.    BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT
2.5   This project--one of the first in a series of junior secondary education projects--
supports the Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which was
presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS endorses Government's role towards
establishing a regulatory framework and in supporting decentralization and participation. In
addition, the CAS highlights the importance of continued emphasis on human resource
development to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation, and
on a more selective, efficient use of public resources. The design of the proposed project is
also consistent with the Bank's strategy of balanced assistance to the education sector, which
includes ongoing and proposed assistance for (a) improving the quality of primary education,
including possible interventions in early childhood development, (b) expansion and quality
improvement of junior secondary education, (c) quality improvement of senior secondary
education, (d) selective interventions in higher education, and (e) an active policy dialogue
designed to redefine and re-focus the Government's role in the education sector.
2.6   The Bank's comparative advantage in supporting junior secondary education is based
on its long-standing and close working relationship with MOEC. The Bank has engaged in a
comprehensive dialogue with MOEC that reaches far beyond this project itself, since it has
helped: (a) establish a solid conceptual and economic framework for the expansion and
qualification of junior secondary education and basic education in Indonesia over the next 20
years; (b) identify the comparative advantages for Bank's and other donors' role in the planned
expansion and qualification process; and (c) strengthen the decentralizing trends toward sub-
central levels, province-specific projects, and local ownership. As a result of this dialogue, the
previous highly centralized, uniform approach to project design and implementation has been
abandoned and has been replaced by an approach that will rest on province-based projects.
The Govemment has now recognized the need to take into account specific provincial
situations, including economic growth trends and prospects, the existing education needs, labor
market conditions, private sector delivery capacity, levels of poverty, and geographic
conditions. The Bank has also been an active partner in the discussions on the priorities
govering basic education delivery, on the role of the private sector in secondary education and
on the share of Govemment spending that should be allocated to basic education.
2.7   The Bank is a trusted partner in basic education in Indonesia and has substantial
experience working with the Indonesian Govemment in this sector (see Annex 12). Based on
the Bank's worldwide experience, GOI sought the Bank's advice on such issues as lower-cost



StaffAppraisal Report                          17
altematives for junior secondary education, how to improve quality and how to tailor the
proposed increased access programs to local needs. The proposed project represents one in an
overall program of Bank support for expansion and quality improvements in basic education.
Currently, the Bank is actively preparing two other secondary education projects and the
Government has requested that the Bank provide both financial and technical assistance for
future projects. The junior secondary education development program is supported by other
donors, including ADB and OECF. This project complements the assistance to basic education
provided by several ongoing projects
(a)    Second Secondary Education and Management Project. This project (Ln.
3158-IND), approved in 1990, consisted of provision of quality inputs in
secondary schools (teacher training, equipment and books); a review and
redesign of the student assessment system; and a redesign of the information
management system. After initial problems, mainly due to the large national
scope, the project was restructured to operate in five pilot provinces, with
satisfactory results. The implementation experience from this project has
provided the basis for the design of the current project. In addition, the Bank
is now very familiar with the issues and the agencies involved in this subsector.
(b)   The Primary and Secondary School Teacher Development Projects.
These 1992 and 1996 projects (Ln. 3496-lND and 3979-1ND) address pre-
service teacher training and complement the current project in the preparation
and quality improvements of teachers. Substantial coordination between pre-
service and in-service training is achieved through the concurrent
implementation of these projects.  The Bank is also heavily involved in
ensuring that maximum coordination is achieved between Teacher
Development Projects and the in-service training components of the junior
secondary education projects.
(c)    The Primary Education Quality Improvement Project. Approved in 1992,
this project (Ln. 3448-IND) provides quality inputs in primary schools in six
provinces. The issues related to primary schools that impact on transition, to
enrollments and quality in, junior secondary schools are being addressed in this
project on a limited scale. Project impact is now being reviewed, to determine
the further strategies for implementation on a larger scale.
(d)   The Book and Reading Development Project.  (Ln. 3887-IND).  The
project started implementation in September 1995, aiming to provide free
textbooks on a one-to-one basis to all public and private primary and junior
secondary education students in all subjects. The project provides one of the
most essential quality inputs into basic education on a systematic basis, and
complements the proposed junior secondary education Projects.

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1   The project would assist the Government of Indonesia in addressing the quality and
coverage of junior secondary education in the provinces of East Java and NTT. The project's
objectives are to:
(a) expand access to junior secondary education in a cost-effective and equitable way;
(b) improve the teaching of junior secondary education; and
(c) strengthen the management capacity at all levels of the education system.
B. PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
3.2   Project impact will be assessed using the following indicators (see Annex 13):
a) the increase in enrollment in new junior secondary schools and altemative programs as a
percentage of total capacity created in these schools and programs;
b) the increase in enrollment in each subdistrict as a percentage of the expected enrollment in
the new capacity created in the subdistrict schools, by grade;
c) the increase in student examination scores, by province, district, subject, and public and
private schools; and
d) the proportion of the work program implemented as measured by the physical targets and
budget spent annually for project and routine activities in project province.
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS
3.3   The project has been organized into three major components to address the main issues
identified in the junior secondary education system of East Java and NTT:
* Access to Junior Secondary Education: The project would support the efforts to (a)
increase the number of places available at junior secondary level by adding classrooms to
existing schools and building new schools located closer to the potential JSE demand,
particularly in poor and remote areas; (b) provide existing and new Open JSE with
instructional material and training for tutors; (c) help promising but poor students get
access to JSE through the expansion and improvement of the existing scholarship program;
and (d) stimulate demand for JSE through a social marketing effort. At negotiations the
Government gave assurances that it would (i) award scholarships, and (ii) select
locations for the construction of schools in accordance with criteria acceptable to the
Bank (para. 7.1(a)).



StaffAppraisal Report                           19
Education Quality: The project would focus on some key factors of education quality,
principally teachers and instructional materials. It would thus (a) provide training to under-
qualified teachers, with a specific focus on teachers in isolated areas; (b) help insure
teachers' presence in remote areas through the provision of teacher dormitories; (c) support
the construction of library rooms and the provision of library books; (d) support a study of
best teaching methods for science education, and (e) help establish a Student Performance
Assessment to provide teachers and principals with academic feedback. At negotiations
the Government gave assurances that it would (i) employ contract teachers, and (ii) select
locations for the construction of teacher dormitories in accordance with criteria
acceptable to the Bank (para. 7. 1(a)).
*  Education Management: In order to augment the capacity of the administrative system to
provide greater access to, and improve the quality of, JSE the project would help (a)
expand the managerial skills of staff at central, provincial, district, sub-district and school
levels, (b) improve information management and utilization, and (c) augment the
equipment in province and district offices.  At negotiations the Government gave
assurances that it would select candidates for management training in accordance with
criteria acceptable to the Bank (para. 7. 1 (a)).
D. PROJECT TARGETING
3.4    Poverty targeting. The project would target remote and rural areas with the lowest
junior secondary GER and the highest rate of IDT villages, and within these areas priority
would be given to IDT villages (see Annex 14). In that context, a comparatively larger share of
resources (in proportion to population) will be allocated to NT[, as the province significantly
lags behind the rest of the country in terms of education achievements. The project would help
build 55 percent of the classrooms needed in NTT, and 13 percent in East Java. In both
provinces the project would also specifically target promising but poor students through the
extension and improvement of the existing MOEC Scholarship Program.
3.5    Private education. Beside supporting public education, the project would devote a
substantial amount of resources to improve the quality and management of private education,
so as to help reduce the disparity between public and private education and encourage parents
to view private schooling as a worthwhile option. Specifically, private schools would benefit
directly from: (a) teacher in-service training; (b) provision of teaching equipment and materials;
(c) provision of reference and library books; and (d) management training for school principals.
In addition, private schools would benefit indirectly from such project activities as improved
Kanwil management, monitoring, and evaluation of schools and students. These efforts are in
line with Government policy (explicitly stated in Repelita VI) that private schools should
preserve and even increase their share of total junior secondary enrollments. The public sector
already devotes significant amounts of resources to support and improve the quality of private
schools, in particular through the secondment of public sector teachers to private schools,
distribution of approved textbooks free of charge, and operational cost subsidies to private
schools at the lower end of financial viability.



20              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
E. PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.6    The economic analysis conducted for the pr ject consists of (i) analysis of educational
demand and the rationale for public investment in junior secondary education; (ii) fiscal
analysis; (iii) review of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis. Details in Annex 1.
3.7    Demand.  There are both efficiency and equity grounds for additional public
intervention in junior secondary education in Indonesia today. It is primarily the poor and near-
poor (and mostly those in rural areas) who are not enrolling in school and whose participation
declined in the late 1980s to early 1990s. One of the primary factors explaining the low
demand is the high direct costs of education. A second factor is indirect (opportunity) costs
which exacerbated the effect of high direct costs. Coupled with stagnant real wages in the
1 980s and the effects of cuts in public expenditure on basic education in the mid- I 980s (school
construction came to a virtual halt), these factors contributed to faltering demand. The past two
years have seen the reversal of these trends as enrollment rates have risen significantly in all
provinces.
3.8    Budget. Since investment in junior secondary education is desirable on both efficiency
and equity grounds, the key questions for the Government are the budgetary implications of the
expansion and how to expand the system. The budgetary implications of the expansion are
sizable ($7.6 billion; see Annex 1 and para 1.8), but estimation shows that the policy is
attainable if the economy continues to grow at the rate achieved in recent decades, additional
funds are made available to junior secondary including extemal borrowing, and the private
sector retains its current significant share.
3.9    Review of Alternatives. Analysis of altematives considered the role of the private
sector in the expansion program and the fiscal implications of mainly public expansions versus
one which made room for private expansion. The budgetary implications double in the second
scenario ($14.5 billion compared to $7.6 billion). There are additional merits to preserving the
private sector. First, given the current and projected surplus of teacher candidates, a robust
private sector is an effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second,
madrasah schools (religious schools which currently enroll about 20 percent of junior
secondary students) offer access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost
that is significantly lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also
enroll a higher proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattem of some famnilies
for non-secular education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior
secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at
the senior secondary level (54 percent of enrollments in 1993/94).
3.10   Beyond the public/private altematives, the Govemment has experimented with
alternative modes (see Annex 1, section im; and Annex 6) of delivering junior secondary
education (in respect of the regular SMP model). These include: SMP Kecil and SMP
Terbuka. While not entirely substitutes for each other (or to the regular SMPs), and
experimentation to improve their quality is still ongoing, preliminary unit cost comparisons
indicate that gains can be achieved by utilizing these less costly altemative models of junior
secondary education in rural and remote areas.



StaffAppraisal Report                           21
3.11   Economic Rate of Return. The economic rate of return for the project investment is
estimated by province and component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding
the management component -see para. 3.3). The estimates are obtained by solving for the
intemal rate of return that equates a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment
over a thirty year horizon. The benefits of the projects are derived from the increased numbers
of students enrolled in junior secondary in any given year, but also include the additional stream
of students expected to proceed to senior secondary and tertiary education. A monetary value
of the benefits of each stream of beneficiaries is estimated using the difference in wages
between one level of education and the next. Benefits will also accrue from investments in
enhancing quality of junior secondary. A benchmark assumption of a 15 percent additional
wage premium earned by a higher quality graduate is made. High returns were found for both
quality and access components, with returns on quality enhancements generally higher than for
expansion of access, particularly in NTT, as noted in Table 3.2 below.
Table 3.2
Rates of Return to Project Investments
by Component and Province
Comronent        East Java       NTT
Access              16.3         14.0
Quality             21.8         22.0
Total               18.3         16.0
3.12   Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. In all, the main
variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive are those affecting quality. This is
not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are impacted by this investment.
Sensitivity analysis reveals, for example, that the rate of return for quality inputs declines from
16 to 12 percent in East Java if only a 10 percent increase (instead of 15 percent) in additional
wage premium for higher quality graduates is assumed; the rate of return declines from 22 to
20.6 percent if incremental recurrent costs for quality improvements in NTT increases from
US$8 per student to US$10.
3.13   Impact on Poverty. Those not enrolled in junior secondary today are predominantly
from the lowest four income deciles. The project will reach these poor and near-poor through
its poverty-targeted sub-components. Approximately 35,350 scholarships will be awarded to
poor (and capable) students. Approximately 12,000 Kecil and 20,000 Terbuka student places
will be created, implying 8,000 Kecil and Terbuka graduates per year for the next 10 years. In
all, the project will contribute to offset the geographical and financial obstacles barring poorer
children from JSE schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.
3.14   Impact on Women. Female enrollment rates in JSE in East Java and NTT are at par
with male enrollment rates (see box on p. 8). This means that approximately half of those who
will benefit from the proposed project's improvement in JSE access and quality would be
young women (approximately 300,000). In a longer term perspective, opportunities for
women to have access to higher levels of education and better work opportunities would
improve (see para. 1.6). In remote areas, moving to the nearest (but still distant) JSE school
and living in friends' houses is a constraint particularly affecting girls, who thus will benefit the
most from the JSE schools to be built in their neighborhood.



22             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
F. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.15   To meet the three defined objectives (para. 3.1), and specify the components identified
above (para. 3.3), the following activities would be implemented in the public and private
junior secondary school subsystems of East Java and NTT.
East Java
3.16  The project would focus on expanding and improving the human resources required for
the continuing development of East Java's dynamic economy (see paras. 1.26-1.30). The
estimated project baseline costs of US$83.6 million for East Java would complement the
efforts of the Government and other donors in increasing junior secondary education
enrollments (access) and improving its quality, with special emphasis on rural and remote
areas where poverty and lack of schools have hampered the drive for a more balanced
development of the provincial economy. To this end, the project would upgrade the skills
needed for a more efficient school and provincial system management. The five-year project
would create 56,000 additional student places in remote villages of East Java where JSE
enrollments rates have been sluggish (less than 50 percent rural average) or schools too distant
(more than a three-hour walk from home). This would generate approximately 120,000
additional JSE graduates in 15 years.
Access
3.17  Increasing Access to Junior Secondary Education (US$53.3 million equivalent over
five years, excluding contingencies). This component would be targeted to remote areas. It
would include some new school construction, support for Open (Terbuka) junior secondary
education, a scholarship system, and a social marketing scheme to foster junior secondary
education support among stakeholders, particularly parents.
3.18   New Schools Construction (US$40 million equivalent). Using an average ratio of 40
students per classroom, the province's needs in terms of school and classroom construction
were computed on the basis of a projected enrollment rate of 75 percent in year 2000-01. The
proposed project would support the construction of 169 schools in the next five years (124 type
D or 6-classroom schools and 45 type E or 3-classroom schools) representing 13 percent of
total provincial needs. This would increase school capacity by about 35,000 places. IDT
villages (as a strong correlate with poverty and community activities) would be a preferred
place for school construction (see Annex 15). Land for school construction will be acquired by
the Government as part of total project costs. The balance of classroom construction needs
would be covered by the national development budget (APBN), an OECF project, and private
resources.
3.19   The project would support the construction of 56 teacher dormitories.  These
dormitories would be built to accommodate teachers of schools in remote areas (see Annex
15).



Staff Appraisal Report                         23
3.20   Support for Open (Terbuka) JSE (US$ 1.6 million equivalent). By the year 2001
210 Open (Terbuka) JSE are planned to be operating in East Java with GOI resources and
other donors' help. The project would support the distribution of a set of learning material and
reference books and book cases to the local Learning Centers (TKP), where students meet four
aftemoons a week to study. It would also provide for 10-day training sessions for 3,000 of the
local tutors who supervise the Learning Groups. The training program for tutors will be
designed and discussed with the Bank (see Annex 9).
3.21    Scholarship Program (US$11.6 million equivalent). The project would support an
expansion of the existing Kanwil-managed scholarship scheme, after evaluation of its impact
and review of its implementation mechanisms. The scholarship would provide 25,000 Rp. per
month (for 12 months and normally for three years) to each selected student. Eligibility criteria
(see Annex 16) would focus principally on the family's income level and the student's school
performance. The scholarship would be offered to 30,000 (2 percent of total enrollment)
students in East Java
3.22   Social Marketing. (US$0.1 million equivalent). Social marketing would be used to
develop parents' awareness of the benefits to be derived from JSE, and to build up the
commitment of key stakeholders (teachers, local administrative staff, community or religious
leaders) to the goals of the project. The activities to be carried out under the social marketing
program would include the preparation, design, printing and diffusion of posters and pamphlets
(target: communities, schools, Kecamatan, Kandeps); the preparation, production and diffusion
of radio messages (target: parents and teachers); the production and viewing of video tapes
(target: Ministry and Kanwil staff, Governors, Bupati, politicians, journalists); the organization
of two province-wide seminars (target: Kandeps and Kecamatan staff); and the organization of
a national contest for the best song promoting education. The component will be prepared and
managed under CPCU leadership (with funding under the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary
Education Project, including an international consultant) and will be implemented under PIUs
responsibility (with project funding). A national consultant will be hired for five months (both
for East Java and NTT, see para 3.22 and 3.42) for the initial analysis, design of components,
and test of proposals. The production and dissemination phases will be carried out under PPIU
responsibility. Objectives, activities responsibilities and calendar have been discussed with
GOI and will be part of the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).
Quality.
3.23   Improving the Quality of Junior Secondary Education  (US$24.4 million
equivalent over five years, excluding contingencies). It is expected that a higher quality level
of JSE will better equip JSE graduates to meet the needs of East Java's changing labor market,
and thus increase household demand for JSE. This component would include teacher training,
school libraries and teaching aids, provision of science kits and the development of a study on
alternatives for teaching JSE science, and the development of a student performance
assessment system.
3.24  In-service Teacher Training (US$4.2 million equivalent).  About 50 percent of
public school teachers in East Java have qualification under the required minimum level of D-3



24              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
(three-year post-secondary diploma). The project would train these teachers, focusing on the
use of appropriate teaching methods (see Annex 5). The project would train 9,360 teachers
from remote areas schools through the PKG Model C, and would provide support for 37,330
teachers undergoing training with the MGMP system (in both cases including private schools).
This component would be expected to improve teachers' classroom performance, and thus to
have an impact on students' learning and national examination scores (see paras. 1.14-1.18 and
Annex 5).
3.25   On a pilot basis, the project would support the hiring for rural schools of up to 100
"contract teachers" (with an emphasis on female teachers) in core academic areas such as
Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science Education and English, where there is a constant
deficit. Criteria for the new contract modality was discussed with GOI authorities (see Annex
17). Their contracts would be tied to a specific school and would be discontinued if the teacher
leaves that school or does not meet his/her teaching requirements (see para. 1.14).
3.26   Student Performance Assessment (US$0.3 million equivalent). To design and help
implement this Student Performance Assessment System (see para. 1.19) the project would
support an initial thorough assessment of the needs and resource requirements for
implementing the system, especially those related to classroom assessment. A second phase
would include training of teachers on how to design good tests and use their results as a
quality-fostering instrument; and setting up the system for student performance assessment
analysis at Kanwil level, and establishing the feedback system designed to send the information
back to the classrooms. This strategy will benefit from technical expertise (doctors and
masters in education at central and provincial level) and the respective hardware and software
provided by the Second Secondary Education and Management Project. The project would
provide equipment, domestic consultant services and training.
3.27   School Libraries and Teaching Aids (US$19.9 million equivalent). Fifty-eight
percent of schools in East Java lack a proper library, and to correct this deficiency the
proposed project would support the construction of 231 library rooms. To offset the current
paucity of reading material in existing libraries, the project would provide to each library a set
of reading and supplementary books (at the rate of three books per student), and 50 reference
books (including dictionaries) to be used by teachers and students (see para. 1.20).
3.28   To encourage ownership, library attendance and reading promotion, principals will
select reading, supplementary and reference books more suitable to their cultural environment
and students' preferences. Based on the book lists prepared by MOEC, the school principals in
consultation with teachers, students and the teacher-librarian would make the final book
selection and submit their requests to the PPIU, which would, in turn, consolidate the requests
and place the orders. The principals may select books not included in the MOEC book list,
provided that they then be approved by MOEC. Reading books would initiate or support
reading habits; supplementary books would expand curricular and textbook contents; and
reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries would serve as consultation and
research instruments.
3.29   The project would also provide teaching aids such as mathematical games, maps,
globes, videos, and overhead projectors for the additional schools to be built under the projects.



StaffAppraisal Report                           25
One hundred and sixty-nine packages would be provided to the new schools, 350 to existing
schools and 50 to private schools. The use of didactic materials and equipment is expected to
foster: (a) more active leaming in classroom and beyond; (b) more cooperative classroom
work; and (c) more productive use of teachers classroom time. School principals and teachers
would have a word in selecting the didactic materials best fitting their students' needs and
interests.
3.30   Science and Technology Education. The project would: (a) provide simple science
kits to the new schools' science teachers; and (b) in order to identify the best education strategy
to teach JSE science and technology, the project would support a study of different teaching
approaches in a sample of 60 representative (urban, rural, private, public) schools (plus 60
control-group school). The study, coordinated by the CPCU, would be conducted for two
years in East Java (and NTT, see para. 3.51) with the help of qualified specialists on science
education and experienced researchers. The hands-on approach fostered by the 'hew science"
movement would be emphasized. The results of this study would be used by MOEC to revise
the teaching of science education at JSE level and the design of the corresponding textbooks
(See Annex 6 for the Terms of Reference).
Management.
3.31   Strengthening Education Management (US$4.0 million equivalent over five years,
excluding contingencies). This component would help the provincial, district, sub-district and
school administrations build implementation and managerial capacity through professional
training, implementation of an information system, and provision of office equipment.
3.32   Management Training (US$2.7 million equivalent). GOI is de-concentrating the
education management by giving Kanwils and Kandep/Kanin increased responsibilities over
regional and local matters and in project implementation. The project would provide
managerial and technical training to administrative staff at central, provincial, district, sub-
district and school levels. Training would cover about 50 staff from the Kanwil, and 230 staff
from the 37 Kandeps, or an average of 6 by Kandep. At Kanwil and Kandep level the
emphasis would be on planming (including micro-planning), policy analysis, monitoring and
evaluation and education data analysis and dissemination. At sub-district level training would
focus on education data management. At school level training would help principals of all
public, private and religious junior secondary schools enrich their skills in supporting teachers
and students, developing community participation and managing school facilities (Annex 7).
3.33   The development of managerial skills will be further supported by the publication of a
set of approximately ten booklets to be used as education management handbooks by teachers,
managers and supervisors on matters such as strategies of teaching-learning interaction in
classroom, the effective use of school library, test design and uses, school environment, and
community involvement. For distribution to project schools, Kecamatans, Kandeps, Kanwils,
Dikmenum and the other higher instances of the administration, a total of 2,500 sets will be
distributed in East Java (see para. 1.22).
3.34   The expected changes (in skills, processes, efficiency, general behavior and client
orientation) resulting from this professional training will be assessed with technical audits and



26             East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project
user satisfaction surveys (see Annex 7) covering the main stakeholders (from the parent
association up to the higher level of the administrative system).
3.35  Information Management and Utilization (US$1.2 million equivalent for East
Java). The capacity of provincial and district education admninistration to manage and efficiently
use information must be enhanced in light of the intended deconcentration of project
implementation (see para. 1.23). Three information functions would be modemized by the
project: (a) forecasting, planning and monitoring by Kanwil and Kandeps; (b) data processing
(MIS) by Dikmenum and Kanwil; and (c) school education data management by Kandeps.
The project would provide technical assistance for the development of these functions,
analytical and skill training for administrative staff, software and equipment.
NTT (East Nusa Tenggara)
3.36   The purpose of the project in developing junior secondary education in NTT is to help
alleviate poverty-related problems in the province, support incipient modernization efforts in
the economy, and strengthen cooperation with private education. In proportional terms, NTT
has been given a larger (than East Java) share (an estimated baseline cost of US$40.9 million)
of project resources to help the Government and other donors compensate for NTT lower rates
of junior secondary education enrollments and widespread rural poverty. Under the project,
access to junior secondary education would be increased, its quality supported and
management capacity upgraded at schools and in the whole provincial system. In five years,
the project would open access to 39,000 new students in rural and remote areas of NTT where
enrollments rates are low or JSE unavailable. As a result of the project, there would be
102,000 additional JSE graduates in 15 years.
Access.
3.37  Increasing Access to Junior Secondary Education (US$3 1.1 million equivalent over
five years, excluding contingencies). This component would be targeted to remote areas. It
would include some new school construction and extension to increase current capacity,
learning material for Open JSE, a scholarship system, and a social marketing scheme to foster
junior secondary education support among stakeholders, particularly parents.
3.38   Classrooms and New Schools Construction (US$28.1 million equivalent). Using an
average ratio of 40 students per classroom, the province's needs in terms of school and
classroom construction were computed on the basis of a projected enrollment rate of 60 percent
in year 2000-01. The project would support the construction of 763 new classrooms (52 type
D or six-classroom schools, 56 type E or three-classroom schools and 283 additional
classrooms) representing 55 percent of total province needs. This construction component
would increase school capacity by about 30,520. IDT villages (as a strong correlate with
poverty and community activities) would be a preferred place for school construction (see
Annex 15). Land for school construction will be acquired by the Govemment as part of total
project costs. The balance of classroom construction needs would be covered by the national
development budget (APBN), an OECF project, and private resources.



Staff Appraisal Report                        27
3.39   The project would also support the construction of 56 teacher dormitories to be built
alongside every new type E school planned for remote areas (see Annex 15).
3.40   Support for Open JSE Terbuka (US$0.8 million equivalent). By the year 2001 81
Open JSE are planned to be operating in NTT with GOI resources and other donors' help. The
project would support the distribution of a set of learning material and reference books and
book cases to the local Learning Centers (TKP). It would also provide for 10-day training
sessions for 1,050 tutors who supervise the Learning Centers (see Annex 9).
3.41   Scholarship Program (US$2.1 million equivalent). The project would support an
expansion of the existing Kanwil-managed scholarship scheme, after evaluation of its impact
and review of its implementation mechanisms. The scholarship would provide 25,000 Rp. per
month (for 12 months and normally for three years) to each selected student. Eligibility criteria
(see Annex 16) would focus principally on the family's income level and the student's school
performance. It was proposed that the scholarship be offered to 5,350 students or 3 percent of
total JSE enrollment in NTT.
3.42  Social Marketing (US$50,000 equivalent).  Social marketing would be used to
develop parents' awareness of the benefits to be derived from JSE, and to build up the
commitment of key stakeholders (teachers, local administrative staff, community or religious
leaders) to the goals of the project. The activities to be carried out under the social marketing
program would include the preparation, design, printing and diffusion of posters and pamphlets
(target: communities, schools, Kecamatan, Kandeps); the preparation, production and diffusion
of radio messages (target: parents and teachers); the production and viewing of video tapes
(target: Ministry and Kanwil staff, Govemors, Bupati, politicians, joumalists); the organization
of two province-wide seminars (target: Kandeps and Kecamatan staff); and the organization of
a national contest for the best song promoting education. The component will be prepared and
managed under CPCU leadership (with funding under the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary
Education Project, including an intemational consultant) and will be implemented under PPIUs
responsibility (with project funding). A national consultant will be hired for five months (both
for East Java and NTT, see para 3.22 and 3.42) for the initial analysis, design of components,
and test of proposals. The production and dissemination phases will be carried out under PPIU
responsibility. Objectives, activities responsibilities and calendar have been discussed with
GOI and will be part of the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).
Quality.
3.43  Improving the Quality of Junior Secondary Educafion (US$6.8 million equivalent
over five years, excluding contingencies). It is expected that a higher quality level of JSE will
better equip JSE graduates to face poverty-related constraints and meet the incipient needs of
NTT's economy, and thus increase household demand for JSE. This project component would
include teacher training, school libraries and teaching aids, provision of science kits and the
development of a study on alternatives for teaching JSE science, and the development of a
student performance assessment system.
3.44  In-service Teacher Training (US$1.8 million equivalent). About 80 percent of
teachers in NTT have qualification under the required minimum level of D-3 (three-year post-



28              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project
secondary diploma). The project would train these teachers, focusing on the use of appropriate
teaching methods (see Annex 5). The project would traim 2,990 teachers from remote area
schools through the PKG Model C, and would provide support for 4,490 teachers undergoing
training with the MGMP system. This component would be expected to improve teachers'
classroom performance, and thus to have an impact on students' learning and national
examination scores (see paras. 1.14-1.18).
3.45   On a pilot basis, the project will support the hiring of up to 50 "contract teachers" for
rural schools in academic areas such as Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science Education
and English, where teachers are often lacking. Criteria for the new contract modality were
discussed with GOI authorities (see Annex 17). Their contracts would be tied to a specific
school and would be discontinued if the teacher leaves that school or does not meet contractual
requirements (see para 1.14).
3.46   Student Performance Assessment. (US$ 0.1 million equivalent). To design and help
implement this Student Performance Assessment System (see para. 1.19) the project would
support an initial thorough assessment of the needs and resource requirements for
implementing the system, especially those related to classroom assessment. A second phase
would include training of teachers on how to design good tests and use their results as a
quality-fostering instrument; and setting up the system for student performance assessment
analysis at Kanwil level, and establishing the feedback system designed to send the information
back to the classrooms. This strategy will benefit from technical expertise (doctors and
masters in education at central and provincial level) and the respective hardware and software
provided by the Second Secondary Education and Management Project. The project would
provide equipment, domestc consultant services and training.
3.47   School Libraries and Teaching Aids (US$4.9 million equivalent).  Seventy nine
percent of NTT schools lack a proper library, and to correct this deficiency the proposed
project would support the construction of 40 library rooms. To offset the current paucity of
reading material in existing libraries, the project would provide to each library a set of reading
and supplementary books (at the rate of three books per student), 50 reference books (including
dictionaries) to be used by teachers and students (see para 1.20).
3.48   To encourage ownership, library attendance and reading promotion, principals will
select reading, supplementary and reference books more suitable to their cultural environment
and students' preferences. Based on the book lists proposed by MOEC, the school principals
in consultation with teachers, students and the teacher-librarian would make the final book
selection and submit their requests to the PPIU, which would, in turn, consolidate the requests
and place the orders. The principal may select books not included in the MOEC booklist,
provided that they then get MOEC approval. Reading books would initiate or support reading
habits; supplementary books would expand curricular and textbook contents; and reference
books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries would serve as consultation and research
instruments.
3.49   The project would also provide teaching aids such as mathematical games, maps,
globes, videos, and overhead projectors for the additional schools to be built under the projects.
One hundred and eight packages would be provided to the new schools, 55 to existing public



StaffAppraisal Report                           29
schools, and 16 to private schools. The use of didactic materials and equipment is expected to
foster: (a) more active learning in classroom and beyond; (b) more cooperative classroom
work; and (c) more productive use of teachers classroom time. School principals and teachers
would have a word in selecting the didactic materials best fitting their students' needs and
interests.
3.50   Science and Technology Education. The project would: (a) provide simple science
kits to the new schools; and (b) support a study of different teaching approaches in a sample of
20 representative (urban, rural, private, public) schools (plus 20 control-group school). The
study, coordinated by the CPCU, will be conducted for two years in NTT (and East Java, see
para. 3.29) with the help of qualified specialists on science education and experienced
researchers (see para. 1.21). The hands-on approach fostered by the 'hew science" movement
would be emphasized. The results of this study would be used by MOEC to revise the teaching
of science education at JSE level and the design of the corresponding textbooks (See Annex 6
for the Terms of Reference).
Management.
3.51   Strengthening Education Management (US$1.5 million equivalent over five years,
excluding contingencies). This component would help the provincial, district, sub-district and
school administrations build implementation and managerial capacity through the design of
information systems, professional training, and provision of office equipment.
3.52   Management Training (US$1.0 million equivalent). GOI is de-concentrating the
education management by giving Kanwils and Kandep increased responsibilities over regional
and local matters and in project implementation. The project would provide managerial and
technical training to administrative staff at provincial, district, sub-district and school levels.
Training would cover about 40 staff from Kanwil, and 74 staff from the 12 Kandeps. At
Kanwil and Kandep level the emphasis would be on planning (including micro-planning),
financial analysis, and analytical capacity development for evaluation and policy purposes. At
sub-district level training would focus on education data management. At school level training
would help principal of all public, private and religious junior secondary schools enrich their
skills in supporting teachers and students, developing community participation and managing
school facilities (see Annex 7).
3.53   The development of managerial skills will be further supported by the publication of a
set of approximately ten booklets to be used as education management handbooks by teachers,
managers and supervisors on matters such as strategies of teaching-learning interaction in
classroom, the effective use of school library, test design and uses, school environment,
community involvement. For distribution to schools, Kandeps, Kanwils, Dikmenum and the
other higher instances of the administration, a total of 1,000 sets will be published.
3.54   The expected changes (in skills, processes, efficiency, general behavior and client
orientation) resulting from this professional training will be assessed with technical audits and
user satisfaction surveys covering the main stakeholders (from the parent association up to the
higher level of the administrative system).



30             East Java and N7TT Junior Secondary Education Project
3.55  Information Management and Utilization (US$0.5 million equivalent). The capacity
of provincial and district education administration to manage and efficiently use information
must be enhanced in light of the intended deconcentration of project implementation (see para.
1.23). Three information functions would be modemized by the project: (a) forecasting,
planning and monitoring by Kanwils and Kandeps; (b) data processing (MIS) by Dikmenum
and Kanwils; and (c) school education data management by Kandeps. The project would
provide technical assistance for the development of these functions, analytical and skill training
for administrative staff, software and equipment.

4.2    Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at April 1996 prices. Costs of
construction of school facilities are based on the GOI standard unit costs 2 per square meter
for such facilities and on review of costs of comparable facilities under other projects.
Equipment costs have been estimated on the basis of existing equipment lists and specifications
for new classrooms. Costs of educational materials are based on prices currently being paid for
similar items under ongoing education projects.  Costs of  domestic and intemational
consultants are in line with recent education and training projects for appropriately qualified
experts. Costs of in-country training (in-service teacher training, management training,
seminars and workshops) are derived from experiences under the ongoing secondary education
and management project and vary widely depending on the type of training being given and its
duration and location, and they are in line with the govemment guidelines. Scholarship grants
are about US$130 per scholarship-year. Operational costs are based on standard government
allowances for honoraria, travel, per diem and consumable materials.
4.3    Contingency Allowances. The project consists of a large number of items of small
monetary value. As the exact number of these items is not vital to the success of the project, no
physical contingencies have been included. A contingency allowance of US$20.9 million
equivalent represents 17 percent of the baseline costs for estimated price increases. Price
contingencies have been calculated at 8.7 percent per year for local costs and at 2.4 percent for
foreign costs.
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$32.9 million,
representing about 22 percent of total project costs, and are based on a detailed analysis of
expenditures under similar projects in Indonesia. The foreign exchange percentages for the
major expenditure categories are estimated as follows: (a) civil works and furniture - 30
percent; (b) equipment - 70 percent; (c) international consultants - 80 percent; (d) in-country
training, domestic consultants, educational materials and operational costs - 15 percent; and (e)
scholarships and contract teachers - 0 percent.
4.5    Taxes and Duties. Taxes and duties are estimated at Rp 16.9 billion (US$7.3 million
equivalent) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all contracts for civil works,
equipment and other goods and tax exemption of educational books. It would be financed fully
by the Government of Indonesia.
4.6    Recurrent Costs. Under the proposed project additional recurrent costs would be
generated by the recruitment of additional teachers, maintenance of new school facilities and
running of the new schools. The annual additional recurrent costs generated by these items are
estimated at Rp 7.0 billion and Rp 5.6 billion, at January 1996 prices, for East Java and NTr,
respectively, after the project is completed. These represent 1.0% and 4.7% of the education
budgets of East Java and NTT, respectively. Thus, the long-term recurrent cost implications
of the project in East Java are small and manageable, while those for NTT are much higher.
Given the much lower level of JS education enrollments in NTT compared with East Java, a
higher level of resources (relative to current regional budgetary pattems) would need to be
directed to NTT to sustain the investment.
2 GOI issues and updates annually the standard construction unit costs per square meter for every district.

B. FINANCING
4.7    The total project cost of US$146.4 million equivalent would be financed by a proposed
Bank loan of US$99.0 million equivalent, covering 71 percent of total project costs excluding
taxes (99 percent of foreign and 59 percent of local expenditures). The Government would
finance the remaining costs of US$47.4 rmillion equivalent including taxes (32 percent of total
project costs including taxes), as detailed in Table 4.3 below. The provincial budget allocation
would be done through annual provincial-level development budget.

C. PROCUREMENT
4.8    The procurement division of the Kanwil Office in each province would be in charge of
procurement under the general guidance of the designated project leader (Pimpro) in each
province. Whenever necessary (such as in the case of conducting ICB), the procurement
division at the provincial level could request the assistance of specialized expertise from the
MOEC Directorate for General Secondary Education (Dikmenum). The construction activities
for the proposed project would be supervised from Dikmenum by a local consulting
architect/engineer who would be hired under the Project. This person would be a technical
link between local monitors in the procurement division in each Kanwil, the CPCU in MOEC
in Jakarta and the Bank, including in particular its procurement staff in RSI. He/she would
ensure, inter alia, that the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in
accordance with the agreed rules and procedures. Procurement arrangements are summarized
in Table 4.4.

N.B.F. - Not Bank Financed
/a     Includes national shopping, selection of consultants following the Bank guidelines, training,
workshops, scholarships, contract teachers and operating costs, using Governrnent administrative
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.9     The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of works, goods and services
under all project components. All procurement of works and goods would be done in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" (dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996) for the following:



38             East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project
(a)    Civil Works (estimated total value US$67.8 million equivalent). Civil works
would comprise construction of new schools (six- and three-classroom),
extension of classrooms, libraries, teacher dormitories, largely in rural and
remote areas. Individual contracts for specific location, which are expected to
average about US$100,000 equivalent each, are not expected to attract foreign
bidders. Because of the large number of small size contracts in remote areas,
and the need to decentralize management of sub-projects, all works would be
contracted by national competitive bidding (NCB), advertised nationally and
following government's procedures and regulations acceptable to the Bank.
Small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, up
to an amount not to exceed US$25.5 million, may be awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors.
(b)   Equipment and Educational Materials (estimated total value US$14.4
million equivalent). Equipment includes, inter alia, computers and peripheral
for information management and student performance assessment, and office
equipment for provincial and district offices. Educational materials include
teaching aids for math, science, social studies, and science kits for junior
secondary schools, and development and production of booklets, videos,
posters and radio messages under the social marketing sub-component and of
handbooks/manual. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods would be
grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more.
Educational materials and equipment packages valued at or above US$200,000
would be awarded through intemational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures,
and using the Bank's standard bidding documents for procurement of goods,
which have already been used under the ongoing Second Secondary Education
and Management Project (Ln. 31 58-IND). Locally manufactured goods would
be granted a domestic margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or
the import taxes and duties which a non-exempt importer would have to pay,
whichever is lower. Contract packages valued at less than US$200,000
equivalent and up to an aggregate amount of US$4.0 million equivalent would
be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable
to the Bank. Contract packages valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, up
to an aggregate amount of US$2.3 million equivalent, may be purchased
through national shopping on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.
(c)    Library and Reading Books (estimated total value US$10.0 million
equivalent). In view of the wide variety of available books for school libraries
and the relatively small number of copies ordered from each book, contracts for
supply of library and reading books to the schools would be awarded on the
basis of national shopping procedures with at least three price quotations,
following govemment procedures acceptable to the Bank. Books would be
procured by the PIUs, which would inform the JSS principals of the budget
available to each school, and then consolidate the orders from the school
principals.



StaffAppraisal Report                         39
(d)   Furniture (total estimated value US$9.4 rmillion equivalent). Most furniture
contracts are not expected to exceed US$200,000 equivalent. They would be
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Fumiture contracts
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent may be purchased through national
shopping procedures with at least three price quotations up to an aggregate
amount of US$1.5 million equivalent.
(e)   Training (estimated total value US$14.0 million equivalent).  In-service
teacher training (PKG Model C and MGMP), management training for staff of
the Dikmenum, project provinces, districts and subdistrict, and school
principals and deputies, seminars and workshops would be organized and
contracted out in accordance with govemrnment procedures acceptable to the
Bank, using standard forms of contract acceptable to the Bank.
(f)    Scholarships (estimated total value US$16.6 million equivalent). Scholarships
would be awarded in accordance with the criteria agreed with the Bank and the
Government administrative procedures.
(g)   Contract teachers Contract teachers (estimated total value US$0.9 million
equivalent) would be selected in accordance with the procedures and criteria
acceptable to the Bank.
(h)   Technical Assistance (estimated total value US$3.6 million equivalent).
Domestic and intemational consultants for project implementation and
monitoring, development and production of management training and Open
SMP tutor training courses, and a science education study, would be selected
m accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. All training
and consultancy contracts would use the Bank's standard form of contract for
consultants.
(i)    Project operating costs totaling US$1.7 million would be met following
Government adrministrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.
4.10   Procurement Review. The following are the guidelines regarding procurement
review:
(a)    All contracts for works and goods valued at or over US$200,000 equivalent,
and the first three civil works contracts each in East Java and NTT would be
subject to prior review by the Bank, whereas all other contracts would be
subject to random post review.
(b)   All individual consultants' contracts valued at or over US$50,000 equivalent
and contracts with consulting firms valued at or over US$100,000 equivalent
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Other consultants' contracts
would be subject to random post-review. However, all terms of reference and
single-source selection of consultants would be subject to prior review.



40             East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project
(c)    Annual training plans for each year would be submitted to the Bank for review
and discussion. Training contracts would be subject to random post-review.
(d)   Annual implementation plans and budgets would be subject to annual reviews
and discussions between the Government and the Bank.
4.11   There would be no contract exceeding US$5 million under this project. Roughly 47
percent of civil works contracts and 36 percent of goods contracts procured under the project
are estimated to be subject to prior review. The relatively low proportion covered by prior
review is due to the large number of contracts expected to cover small amount as shown in
Annex 19; all these contracts are the responsibility of the PPIUs. The procurement consultant
will help ensure that the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in
accordance with the agreed rules and procedures. For contracts not covered by prior review,
post-review of such contracts would be carried out by RSI staff supported by the procurement
consultant in the CPCU. For new implementing agencies, one out of five such contracts would
be post-reviewed for the first year of implementation, followed by one out of 20 such contracts
in succeeding years (Annex 19).
D. DISBURSEMENTS
4.12  The proposed loan of US$99.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of
five and one-half years (Annex 20). Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30,
2002, the Loan Closing Date. The disbursement schedule is based on the implementation
schedule and the standard disbursement profile for education projects in Indonesia.
Disbursements estimated for FY97 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the project
Special Account and replenishment. Disbursements would be made as follows:

materials and furniture valued at or above US$200,000 equivalent per contract and consultant
firm contracts valued at or above US$100,000 equivalent and individual consultant contracts
valued at or above US$50,000 equivalent per contract would be made against full
documentation. All other disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure
procedures for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies and made
available for review  as requested by visiting Bank missions.  In order to facilitate
disbursements, a Special Account in the amount up to US$5.0 million, which is based on the
need for funds to cover the expenditures on average for four months, would be established at
Bank Indonesia. This account would be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget,
Ministry of Finance. The special account would be used for all eligible foreign and local
expenditures. Replenishment applications to the Special Account will be made on a monthly
basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes first.
E. ACCOUNTs, AuDffs AND REPORTS
4.14   Designated government authorities would establish separate project accounts for all
project expenditures, to be maintained by each of the implementing agencies (Kanwils in East
Java and NTT, and MOEC) for their respective expenditures in accordance with sound
accounting practices. Accounts and documentation supporting the Statement of Expenditures
and Special Account would be maintained separately by DG Budget, MOF. Consolidated
project account statements would be prepared semi-annually as part of the project progress
report by CPCU in MOEC, based on the provincial project accounts statements. The
consolidated project account statements would be audited annually in accordance with Bank
guidelines, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would contain a
separate opinion by the auditors on the statement of expenditures used as a basis for
3 Operating costs include expenditures for travel, per diem, allowances and consumable materials
necessary for project implementation.



42             East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project
disbursement. Certified copies of the consolidated project accounts statements for each fiscal
year, together with the auditor's statement, would be furnished to the Bank as soon as
available, but not later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year. At
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the project accounts including the
special account and SOEs would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank and audit reports would be furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of the
Government 'sfiscal year (para. 7.1(e)).
4.15   The CPCU would monitor progress in project implementation and submit semi-annual
progress reports to the Bank. Within six months after the project completion, the CPCU would
submit an implementation completion report to the Bank.

5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT
5.1   Provincial Project Implementation  Units (PPIU). The project would be
implemented by Provincial Project Implementation Units in Surabaya (East Java) and Kupang
(NTT), and would be overseen by a Central Program Coordination Unit at MOEC's
Directorate General for Secondary Education (Dikmenum) in Jakarta (see Annex 21). East
Java and NTT Kanwils would establish within their administrative structure a Provincial
Project Implementation Unit preferably headed by the provincial Director of Secondary
Education (Kabid Dikmenum), assisted by a Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer and
a Teacher Development Officer. The PPrU would be overseen by a Provincial Project
Advisory Committee which would be chaired by the head of MOEC provincial office
(Kakanwil), and would include the provincial directors of Secondary Education, Planning,
Procurement, and Finance, representatives of Dinas and Public Work, and a representative of
the provincial office of MORA (see Annex 22). At negotiations the Government provided
assurances that it would: (a) establish and staff the two Provincial Project Implementation
Units in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; and (b) establish the two
Provincial Project Advisory Committees with the composition and terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, no later than November 1, 1996, and maintain them until the
completion of the project (para. 7.1(b) & (c)).
5.2   The PPIU would be responsible for managing the implementation of various project
components through the services of Kanwil and Kandep sectors, and would be responsible for
preparing an annual implementation plan and budget to be submitted to the CPCU. The PPIU
would also be in charge of producing annual implementation performance reports. At the
Kandep level, implementation would be insured by a Task Force headed by the Kandep
Director (Kakandep) assisted by the heads of planning and curriculum sections.
5.3    Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU). Dikmenum would establish within
its central structure a Central Program Coordination Unit headed by the Director of
Dikmenum, who would be assisted by a Senior Project Coordinator, an Intemational Advisor, a
Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, and a
project-specific Liaison Officer. The CPCU would insure that the overall and annual project
implementation plans and budgets prepared by the PPIU be in accordance with project
objectives. The CPCU would provide broad technical guidance to the PPIUs of all secondary
education projects, and would prepare the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).
At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would. (a) establish and staff the
Central Program Coordination Unit in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank; and (b) establish the Central Program Advisory Committee with the composition and
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, no later than November 1, 1996, and maintain
them until the completion of the project (para. 7. I (b) & (c)).
5.4    A Central Program Advisory Committee would facilitate CPCU consultation and
coordination on major project implementation issues. It would include senior officials from the
MOEC, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Home



44             East Java and NlT Junior Secondary Education Project
Affairs, State Ministry for Administration Reform (MENPAN), the State Civil Service
Commission (BAKN), and the East Java and NTT Kakanwils.
5.5   Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a
period of five years, the completion date being December 31, 2001. The detailed schedules of
implementation of all project activities (Annex 23), costs by year and components (Annex 18)
procurement (Annex 19), and disbursement (Annex 20) would serve as the basis for project
implementation and would be updated annually by the CPCU and the PPIUs. The closing date
of the project is June 30, 2002.
5.6   Technical Assistance. A total of 1,184 person/month will be required at a cost of
US$3.1 million. In all project components, the technical assistance requirements would be
satisfied largely (95 percent) through the provision of national consultants. International
consultants (5 percent) would be recruited only in areas in which local expertise is limited or
lacking altogether. International expert assistance is designed as institution building particularly
at the province level rather than "substitutive" services directly rendered as part of project
implementation activities (see Annex 24).
5.7   Project Launch Workshop. To facilitate project start-up activities, fanilianrze PPIU
and CPCU staff and Kanwil project-associated staff with project and Bank procedures-
especially bidding documentation- and guarantee thereby an adequate and timely project
implementation, a project launch workshop of a heavily operational nature would be conducted
early during the project implementation process. This workshop has a crucial importance for
project implementation due to the province-based management structure and the incipient
experience with project-related Bank requirements at province level.
5.8   Project Implementation Handbook.  For the day-by-day practice of project
implementation CPCU, PPIU and Kandep staff will rely upon a Project Implementation
Handbook. Written in Bahasa Indonesia, the Handbook will describe in detail and in concrete
terms the methodology, procedures and multiple steps of project implementation and project
monitoring. Its content will draw mostly from the project Staff Appraisal Report and Legal
Documents, GOI and Bank procurement and disbursement guidelines, and will seek to emulate
the best practices in the country. The Handbook is expected to: (a) become the key and
uniform point of reference for all levels of project management; (b) provide users with ready
answer for problem solving; and (c) offset the relatively insufficient lack of experience with
project management at the provincial level. Dikmenum discussed an outline of the handbook
with the appraisal mission. Within the next three months a JGF consultant--in dialogue with
Dikmenum and Kanwils, other government agencies, and RSI--will help GOI prepare a draft
version to be submitted for Bank consideration on July 31, 1996, and then finalized by August
31, 1996.
B. PROJECT SUPERVISION
5.9    Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring of project implementation would be the
responsibility of the PPIUs at the provincial level, and of the CPCU at the central level, which
has a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. The implementation progress of the project would
be assessed through monitoring activities and formative evaluation using the detailed



Staff Appraisal Report                         45
performance indicators. Additionally, outcome indicators have been identified to guide
development impact evaluation. The above indicators would also form the basis of technical
supervision by the Bank. The supervision plan is summarized in Annex 25. Data from the
detailed performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation (Annex 25) would be
incorporated in the semiannual progress reports prepared by the Govemment and subrmitted to
the Bank. At negotiations the Governement provided assurances that it would implement
policies and procedures to enable adequate project monitoring and evaluation in accordance
with agreed indicators (para. 7.  (d)).
5.10   Annual Implementation Reviews. The annual reviews would take place by October
of each project year, starting in 1997, and would: (a) analyze the previous year's performance
and budget execution against project objectives and indicators; (b) analyze the proposed work
plan and budget for the following year; (c) discuss adjustments to be made in project's
implementation schedule; and (d) analyze the results of the project evaluation. The proposed
work plan and budget for the following year would have to be previously defined at the central
and state levels and contain a detailed description of targets and planned activities. Plans for
civil works would specify type and schedule of construction and provide evidence of ownership
or donation of school or dormitory site and of adequate assignment of school teachers and staff
(see Annex 26). At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would. (a)
prepare and present to the Bank annual progress reports on project implementation and
plans for the next year, with targets and budgets in each project component, by July 31 of
each year, starting in 1997; (b) carry out annual reviews of project implementation with the
Bank by October 31, starting with the review of the first 18 months of project implementation;
and (c) carry out annual reviews of the budgets of project provinces to evaluate use of the
previous year's budget as a basis for preparing the DIP for the following year (para. 7. If
(g) & (h))-
5.11   Mid-term  Review.   A comprehensive mid-term review would be conducted in
October 1999 to assess project performance and initial impact in light of project objectives and
expressed in project indicators and Govemment policies in addition to review activities
normally covered under annual implementation reviews (see Annex 26). The mid-term review
would have a strong focus on the formulation and carrying out of sectoral policies, particularly
for institutional strengthening at both province and district levels, and on redefining the
component or element where major problems were positively identified. The PPIUs and the
CPCU would be responsible for hiring consultants and preparing the final terms of reference
for the mid-term review, based on experience accumulated under the project and the final or
preliminary results of studies, satisfactory to the Bank, and for preparing the report with
recommendations. At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would
prepare and present to the Bank a mid-term report on project implementation and plans for
the remaining years of the project, by July 31, 1999; and review the report together with the
Bank by October 31, 1999 (para. 7. 1j)).
5.12   Technical Audits. Dikmenum has the overall responsibility to monitor all project
activities and routine monitoring would be done through annual reviews. However, because a
large number of contracts would be financed under SOE procedures, an independent, qualified
firm with extemal technical assistance would be hired to conduct technical audits of key project
activities. The audits would cover activities in progress and post reviews of completed actions



46              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
to examine whether implementation of the various project components are technically
appropriate and to recommend corrective measures if necessary (see Annex 27). At
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that technical audits would be carried out
every year during the implementation of the project in accordance with terms of reference
and in a manner acceptable to the Bank, and that copies of the technical audit reports will be
furnished to the Bank for comments no later than three months after the end of the Fiscal
Year (para. 7.10).
5.13   Completion Report. A project implementation completion report is due no later than
six months after the Closing Date of the loan or such later date as may be agreed for this
purpose between the Borrower and the Bank. The report to be compiled by MOEC is
expected to provide a critical overview of project inputs, processes and outcomes. More
precisely the completion report will summarize (a) project results and impact on the basis of
indicators; (b) key project activities and management; (c) institutional lessons learned from
project implementation; (d) the project's financial status; (e) implementation issues and
recommendations; and (f) the plan designed to ensure the continued achievement of the
objectives of the project. At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would
furnish to the Bank within six months after the project closing date a plan designed to ensure
the continued effectiveness of the project objectives (para. 7. 1 (k)).

6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. EXPECTED BENEFITS
6.1   The benefits of the proposed project derive from meeting the high demand for junior
secondary education where it exists and stimulating demand where it may be constrained due
to low income and/or credit market failures. The expected outcomes of the investment are: (a)
increased numbers of higher quality junior secondary graduates; (b) more students at higher
levels of education as approximately 80 percent of junior secondary graduates proceed to
senior secondary education and another 30 percent continue to tertiary education; (c) poverty
reduction and greater distribution gains in the economy as a result of focused junior secondary
education improvement for low income and rural students; (d) externalities derived from girls'
education such as lower fertility, increased prenatal care utilization, their families' improved
health and nutrition status and children's higher educational attainment; (e) greater professional
qualification of teaching and managerial staff; and (f) better quality data on students' and
schools' performance for the decision-making process. More specifically, the project will have
a positive impact on women and the poor, which is detailed in para. 3.16-3.17.
6.2    Outcomes (a) and (b) above are generated as a result of the increased access and
enhanced quality that the project investment will ensure. The table below presents the stream of
beneficiaries as a result of access and quality interventions over the next ten years (see Annex
1, Section IV for details).

Total                460,293           119,807         580,100
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
6.3   The proposed project is expected to positively affect the environment through greater
emphasis on environmental concems in teacher training activities, the content of reading,
supplementary and reference books, and the development of a science education approach
more closely linked to daily life interests. This blend of curricular inputs would very likely
generate in the young learners and future citizens the necessary awareness of, and commitment
to, environmental issues. The project would have no direct environmental effects and is
classified as a Category C project.



48              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project
C. SUSTAINABILITY
6.4    Project sustainability hinges on financial and institutional conditions that already exist
in the system and will be strengthened over the five-year project. The financial conditions
needed to keep teachers in classroom, schools well kept and the scholarship program for the
poorest children are existing programs that will be expanded under the project and will rely on
increasing budget resources for basic education. The system is expected to become more
efficient with the efficiency-and productivity-oriented elements sponsored by the project The
institutional conditions involve both the strategy for the development of the nine-year basic
education system, and the improvement of management structure and skills. With the local
ownership and managerial skills supported under the project, the system is expected to
incorporate the required capacity and motivation to maximize the use of available resources
and yield at least the same results as the project itself Fiscal sustainability in the two provinces
is analyzed below.
6.5    East Java. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for East Java
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$103.1 million, would
account for about 6 percent of the East Java education budget, on average, during the project
period (1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first
two years of the project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$2.4 million in the last
year of the project, and stabilize at US$3.1 million after the project is completed, representing
1.0 percent of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the
project are small and manageable.
6.6    NTT. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for NTT (including physical
and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$49 million, would account for about 18
percent of the NTT education budget, on average, during the project period (1996/97-
2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two years of the
project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$1.9 million in the last year of the
project, and stabilize at US$2.5 million after the project is completed, representing 4.7 percent
of the education budget.  The recurrent cost implications of the project in NTT are
approximately 4 times higher than that for East Java. Given the much lower level of JSE
enrollments in NTT compared to East Java, a higher level of resource (relative to current
regional budgetary patterns) need to be directed to NTT to sustain the investment.
D. RISKS
6.7    The main risks associated with the proposed project are:
(a)    Private sector participation in junior secondary may decline in absolute or
relative terms which would have significant budgetary implications for the
public sector. If the share of the private sector in JSE enrollment declines but
remains at its current absolute level of about 328,000 students in East Java and
40,000 in NTT (which means a decline in relative share from the current 40
percent to about 20 percent), the budgetary shortfall in the next five years (see
para. 1.8) would be twice the shortfall if the private sector retains its 40 percent



Staff Appraisal Report                           49
share (see Annex 1, Section II for details). Furthermore, if private enrollment is
phased out (except for enrollment in religious schools), the budgetary shortfall
in the next five years would be three times the level of shortfall if the private
sector continues its significant role. The risk of the decline in the private sector
participation is partly mitigated by the involvement of project advisory
committees at CPCU and PPIUs, with the participation of the MOEC
Directorate for private education.
(b)    The quality improvement component of the project may prove to be costlier
and to take longer than initially planned, thus postponing or reducing its
expected benefits. The risks from the labor market side lie in not rewarding
higher quality graduates with a sufficiently high wage premium to generate the
estimated economic rate of return of the quality component of the project: the
base case estimate of the economic rate of return assumes that higher quality
graduates will reap a 15 percent additional wage premium in the labor market.
This generates a rate of return to quality of 22 percent in NTT and 17 percent
in East Java (see Annex I, Section IV). Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 10
percent (versus 15 percent) quality wage premium will reduce the rate of
return to 12 percent in East Java and 17 percent in NTT.
(c)    Implementation by PPRUs in the provincial and district offices operating in an
institutional environment still in transition to less centralized procedures. The
question is about the possibility of locally managing a centrally allocated
project when all incentive systems, particularly in personnel management, are
under central control.
(d)    The insufficient implementation experience available at the provincial and
district offices to manage all the aspects of the project implementation process
without previous experience with Bank requirements and procedures.
6.8    The proposed project intends to reduce the risks of:
(a)    private decline by reinforcing the mechanisms for school mapping in East Java
and NTT, so as to avoid construction of public schools in the catchment area of
an existing private school, and by providing support to private schools (teacher
training, library books and teaching aids) to improve their role in the system
and including the Directorate of Private Education in the Central Program
Advisory Committee (see para. 5.4);
(b)    slower quality improvement by using training programs which have already a
long, positive track-record and supporting further improvement of these
programs (such as PKG and MGMP for teacher training and the MOEC
program for student performance assessment); providing the PPIUs with
detailed terms of reference (Science and Technology Education Study);
(c)    ongoing deconcentration by confirming assurances from the Govemment that
it is committed towards the deconcentration of responsibilities, and that it will



50             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
set up: (a) two Provincial Project Implementation Units -PPIU- (one in East
Java and another in NTT) to manage the project at provincial level in
coordination with Kandeps (district offices); and (b) a Central Progran
Coordination Unit -CPCU- designed to provide technical assistance and carry
out assessment.
(d)   insufficient implementation experience by providing PPIUs with assistance
(project launch workshop, distribution of Project Implementation Handbooks,
coordination by CPCU, national and international consultants); providing
selection criteria for several components; getting regular feedback from RSI
and World Bank supervision missions.

East Java And NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
AND PROJECT
The economic analysis conducted for the East Java Secondary Education Project
consists of: (i) demand analysis and rationale for public investment in junior secondary; (ii)
fiscal analysis; (iii) analysis of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis.
The economic analysis first aims to understand the determinants of demand for junior
secondary education in Indonesia particularly since there have been variations in the past
decade and there are significant disparities among socio-economic groups (Section I). This
section establishes that the main determinants of demand are household incomes, costs of
schooling and distance to school; the latter two are variables that Government can affect
through this project. The rationale for additional public investment in junior secondary is
investigated subsequently (Section 1), and it is argued that on both efficiency and equity
grounds, there are justifications for additional public intervention in expanding junior
secondary.
The cost implications of the Government's expansion program (Section II) are then
considered. A key element is the future role of the private sector in the provision of junior
secondary education. The conclusions reached are that a sizable budgetary effort will be
required, but that the policy is attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical
rate, additional funds are made available to junior secondary including external borrowing
and the private sector retains its current large share.
The next question that arises is how best to provide junior secondary education. The
Government has at its reach both demand and supply policy instruments and within the latter
several alternative modes of junior secondary exist. These are analyzed in Section 111.
Finally, the costs and benefits of the specific project design are laid out and an
economic rate of return is calculated (Section IV). The financial impact of the project on the
provincial budgets and prospects of sustainability is analyzed in Section II.



54                               Annex 1: Page 2 of 18
I. DEMAND ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN JUNIOR SECONDARY
Enrollment at the junior secondary level expanded rapidly between the late 1960's
and 1980's, reaching 63 percent in gross terms in 1988 (47 percent NER).1 For the next five
years, however, enrollment fell to 52 percent (41 percent NER) by 1993 (declining in
absolute terms from 7.8 million to 7.1 million students). Recent data indicate a resurgence of
demand in the last two years (GER and NER rose to 58 percent and 47 percent respectively
by 1995) almost restoring the pre-decline enrollment rates.
There remain significant differences in enrollments, however, among income groups
and urban-rural residents. In 1994, the net enrollment rate among the top quintile was 66
percent compared to 25 percent for the lowest quintile.2 Significant differences also exist
among urban and rural enrollment rates: 62 percent of urban children aged 13-15 years old
are in junior secondary, compared to 33 percent of rural children. When decomposed by
income and urban-rural levels, enrollments are low for the poor and near-poor children in
both rural and urban areas, and the middle income rural children.3
High direct costs are one of the primary factors explaining the low junior secondary
enrollment rates among the poor and near-poor. Overall, the cost to families of educating a
child in junior secondary comes to an annual average of Rp210,000 (1994). This is more than
two-and-a-half times the cost of primary education (an average Rp8O,000).4 For households
in the lowest quintile, total expenditure per junior secondary student is equivalent to
approximately 80 percent of per capita household expenditure. Particularly significant are the
up-front registration (entrance) fees that parents must pay: in 1994, the average entrance fee
for junior secondary was Rp47,500, which for those in the two lower quintiles was five times
more than the registration fee paid for primary education.
Indirect (opportunity) costs of junior secondary education are significant in rural
areas, and this exacerbates the effect of high direct costs especially among the poor. Schools
are in short supply in rural areas which imposes high travel time and costs. The longer the
travel time, the higher the opportunity cost of schooling, and the more reluctant parents will
be to send their children to school. Though the difference between average travel time to
primary school for urban versus rural residents is insignificant, the national average travel
time to junior secondary schools in rural areas is 50 percent higher than in urban areas.5
Earnings foregone while attending school can also be significant among the poor.
Parents' decisions to send a child to junior secondary education depends on the
aforementioned costs and also on:

Calendar year (i.e. 1988) in this note refers to school year (i.e. 1987/88) in the enrollment statistics.

Education Data, RAND (October 1995)

5 Ibid. Since travel times are reported by parents whose children are enrolled in school, they are likely to
underestimate the travel time families face when making a decision regarding whether or not to enroll their
child. The survey reports average travel time in rural areas of 30 minutes versus 19 for urban areas.



Annex 1: Page 3 of 18                                5
1)    income constraints and credit markets failure. The poor have not only low income but
also greater difficulty to borrow. Particularly in the area of human capital investments, the
possibility of borrowing is practically non-existent even among better off families. This
implies that private demand for junior secondary and, as a result, current enrollment, is lower
than its social optimum.
2)     t  b                se        e    _. A tangible benefit associated with junior
secondary education is the additional labor income that would accrue to the graduate
compared to someone who left school after completion of primary education. Under normal
(steady-state) conditions, the wage differentials between primary and junior secondary
education should reflect the socially optimum amounts of education in the labor force
rendering corrective action by the government unnecessary. However, Indonesia is in a state
of rapid transition. Examining the behavior of the labor market, a conclusion that emerges is
that formal sector employment is growing relatively slowly (compared to education output)
and wage differentials have been compressed (due to fast growth in enrollment among the
better off).6 These patterns give the short-term but false "signal" to poor families that junior
secondary education has neither direct wage rewards nor significant employment prospects
outside agriculture or the informal sector. Indeed, in the period 1988 to 1991 even absolute
enrollments in junior secondary education declined. This disequilibrium phenomena works
against long-term investments, such as those in human capital, and justify Government
support to stabilize short-run variations and to steadily increase junior secondary enrollments.
3)     how farsighted parents are. Parents are making decisions today in light of the fact that
jobs in the formal sector are expanding at a lower pace than education (hence the
aforementioned wage compression and also the higher rates of unemployment among the
educated). However, as the economy approaches the turning point (expected to take place
within the decade) and as has happened in other NICs, the transformation of the economy
from an agrarian one to one that relies heavily on the education and productivity of its
workers would be fast. At that point, corrective action in the form of training is typically
expensive. For example, it is estimated that training requires six times the costs of basic
7
education in order to achieve the same effect on productivity and wages.
4)    the prospects of continuing to senior secondary. Since junior secondary education is
the stepping stone for proceeding to senior secondary (and tertiary) education, families can
give consideration to the costs and benefits of completing senior secondary education. The
cost of senior secondary is more than double that of junior secondary (Rp460,000 per year)
and may in turn deter parents from investing in junior secondary. Also, as with the earnings
of junior secondary graduates, the wage premium of senior secondary education has declined
significantly over time.

World Bank (1996) Chapter 1. The wage premium for urban junior secondary graduates relative to primary
have declined over the past decade (while still positive) from 80 percent to 30 percent for males and 166
percent to 60 percent for females. (Ibid.)

In short, enrollments in junior secondary education can increase if direct costs of
education are reduced (such as through scholarships, fee reductions, etc.) and if indirect costs
are alleviated (e.g. through more and better geographical distribution of schools). On the
benefit side, though little can usually be done with the respect to how the relative supply and
demand of educated/less educated workers operate in the labor market, there are policies that
increase the value of education through improving its quality. Quality also affects the
decision of parents to enroll their children and a child's progress through school. There are
improvements to be made on the input aspects of quality, for example, 30 percent of junior
secondary students still do not have mathematics textbooks. But the more important (and
complex) area of improvement appears to be in the process of how inputs are combined to
educate students and the interactions between teachers and students. Evidence on this for
junior secondary in Indonesia is scant, but findings from research conducted in primary
schools indicates that the problem may lie in the teacher's inability to identify, diagnose and
address student progress in the classroom.8 Another indicator of quality is the relative low
scores in reading competency tests of Indonesian students by international standards.
Externalities. Research from other countries has pointed to the existence of positive
extemaliis such as reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that
correlate with female secondary education.9 For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a
mother's education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of
women with some primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10
percent of women with junior secondary education.10 Furthermore, analysis of nutritional
status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of maternal education on children's nutritional status:
for women with between zero and five years of education, an additional year of education has
no impact on the child's nutritional status, while, among women with six to twelve years of
education (or more), an additional year of education improves nutritional status
significantly. 11
The four reasons given earlier on why private considerations may lead to a social
underinvestment in junior secondary and the externalities from women's education all point
to the need for greater public involvement. Though we do not quantify the extent of market
failure associated with these reasons (e.g., does credit market failure affect 10 or 10,000 poor
children) some additional insight may be gained by looking at social rates of return to
education that have been computed from 1986-1992. The estimates indicate that returns to
junior secondary education are the highest among other education subsectors (Table 1).
Furthermore, while returns for all the subsectors may have declined during this period, those
for junior secondary saw the smallest reduction.
8 'Some Basic Number Skills in Twelve Primary Schools: An Exploratory Study', Tony Somerset (1995)
9 Subbarao and Raney (1993) examine the determinants of desired family size in 72 countries and find that
after controlling for level of economic development and other factors, female secondary education is highly
significant. Secondary education for females reduces fertility and mortality in several ways: (i) by enhancing
the opportunity cost of a woman's time in economic activities relative to child-bearing; (ii) by promoting child
health which in turn affects desired family size; and (iii) by promoting more effective contraceptive use and
willingness to use modern contraceptive methods.

In conclusion, there are both efficiency and equity grounds for public intervention in
junior secondary education. The appropriate public interventions include building school
facilities in rural areas, providing scholarships to poor students, and enhancing quality.

II. FISCAL ANALYSIS
An analysis of the likely costs and implications for the public budget of achieving
universal enrollment in junior secondary education by the year 2010 is presented below. Te
fiscal impact of this project is then estimated.
A. Fiscal Implications of the Junior Secondary Education Expansion Program
The overall education expenditure in Indonesia is currently reasonably balanced
across primary (46%), secondary (13% junior, 15% senior) and tertiary (13%) levels.
However, it has been subject to significant variations in the past and has not always been
protected from budgetary cuts. Indeed, public expenditure on education has declined over
time as the graphs below demonstrate.'2 This is relevant in light ofthe Government's plans to
achieve universal nine years of education, which will require significant additional public
resources to be spent on the junior secondary sub-sector, as well as on primary education.'3

Achieving universal junior secondary enrollment in 15 years is a formidable task as it
requires increasing enrollments by 1.8 times (from 7.5 million to 13.5 million). It is therefore
important to define the role of the public and private sectors. Currently, the ratio of
public/private enrollment is about 60/40. We evaluate the cost implications of three
alternative public/private scenarios, that is, universal junior secondary enrollment is achieved
in year 2010 and:
1)     the public/private share stays at its current 60/40 ratio;
2)      private enrollment stays at its current 3.5 million/year; or
3)      private enrollment is phased out except for enrollment in religious schools which
is assumed to remain at its current level of I million students/year.
Under the 60/40 public/private scenario, enrollments in public schools are assumed to
increase annually by 240,000 students. Under the other two scenarios the annual increase will
12 The last two years are preliminary estimates.
13 The exercise conducted here assumes that the graduation rate from primary school will increase from the current
rate of 75% to 100%. This will require additional investments at the primary level to increase retention.



Annex 1: Page 7 of 18                            59
be 400,000 and 533,000 students. In all scenarios it is assumed that the level of recurrent
funding remains at its present level of $110 per student/year which implies that there would
be no quality gains. Development costs (building new schools) are estimated to be around
$900 per additional student. To address credit market failures and enable expansion among
the poor, it is assumed that 10 percent of additional students in excess of the current 7.5
million will receive a scholarship of $90/year. Students enrolled in private schools are
assumed to receive an average annual subsidy of $40 per student to help raise the quality of
private schools (Appendix Table B).
The results of the scenarios indicate that achieving universal basic education will
have sizable budgetary implications. Even if the current public/private ratio of 60/40 is
preserved, this would imply that public enrollment increases from 4.5 million to 8.1 million.
What is required to finance this expansion (which is desirable on both efficiency and equity
grounds) is a combination of significantly increased allocations to junior secondary
education, a decline in the funding of other education sub-sectors (such as senior secondary
or tertiary education) unless there is an increase in the overall education budget (if
sectoral allocations are to be preserved, especially with respect to primary education), and
large funding from donors.
The estimates below indicate that under all scenarios a significant financing effort
will be required (Table 2). In addition, the difference in enrollments between the three
scenarios point to a substantial increase in total public costs if the private sector ceases to
play the role it does today. More specifically, the total additional public funds that would be
required through year 2010 come to about: $7.6 billion in the public/private scenario; $1 1.1
billion if the current level of private enrollment is maintained; and $14.5 billion under the
pure public scenario (if the private sector is phased out except for religious schools).

How can the expansion be financed? Let us assume that the education budget
increases annually by 6 percent, that is, as much as the historic growth rate of GDP. This will
add nearly $7.5 billion to the junior secondary education budget. Compared to the additional
public funds required for the expansion, this implies a shortfall of $543,000, $4 million and
$7.4 million under the three scenarios (Table 3). The last two scenarios appear unattainable,
but the (60/40) public/private scenario also has a caveat: it is heavily front loaded. More
precisely, additional funding comes to $1.2 billion in the first ten years though no additional
resources will be required thereafter when the system reaches relative maturity (after year
2005 the percentage increases in public enrollments will be significantly less than 6 percent
growth in the budget). The (60/40) public/private scenario though affordable at face value,
will require additional funding of an average $120 million during the first ten years of
expansion (and considerably more, as much as $150-$200 million in the first five years). The
budgetary shortfall (in $ million) is shown graphically in Figure 3.

The three scenarios would require that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary
education increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to approximately 16
percent, 19 percent and 21 percent in the next few years (and in the case of the mainly public
scenario it will have to remain at more than 16 percent in the steady-state compared to the
public/private scenario where the share stabilizes at 11 percent) (Table 4). These figures
amount respectively to increases of 23, 46 and 62 percent of the current allocation.

The cost estimates presented above incorporate estimates of scholarships for poor
students and subsidies paid to private schools. It is legitimate to plan for such public
expenditure because alleviating supply constraints (e.g., building schools in rural areas) will
not alone remove demand constraints (that is, the opportunity cost of attending education).
Assuming that the poorest 10 percent of the additional enrollment each year receives a
scholarship of $)O, the total cost of the scheme over the 15 year period will come to an
annual average of $29 million in all scenarios (increasing from $3.6 million in 1996 to $54
million in 2C 0). In the public/private scenario, scholarships will amount to 6 percent of the
total public cost of expansion (ranging from 1.4 percent in 1996 to 7 percent in 2010). On the
other hand, the budgetary savings from phasing out private schlools and the subsidy they
receive (assumed at $40/student) will be only $1.6 million/year. This saving is small (I
percent of the additional funds) and can prove counterproductive as it will take place at the
expense of the current co-financing of junior secondary education between Government and
families.
What do these estimates imply for the total public budget allocated to education
relative to GDP? Public expenditure on education is today approximately 2.7 percent of
GDP. To fund the expected expansion of junior secondary education this figure should
increase to approximately 3.0 percent and 3.2 percent under the 60/40 public/private and pure
public scenarios, respectively. These figures assume that allocations to other sectors increase
annually by 6 percent (GDP growth).
In conclusion, achieving universal enrollment in junior secondary is desirable on both
equity and efficiency grounds, but will require a sizable budgetary effort. The policy is
attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical rate, additional funds are made
available to junior secondary including external borrowing, and the private sector retains its
share.
B. Fiscal Impact of the Project
Utilizing the results of the above scenarios and assuming the 60/40 public/private
case as the "desirable" scenario, the fiscal impact of the project on the two provinces is
estimated below. The estimates are based on the following assumptions: (i) the education
budget in each province will increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6% per
annum in real terms); and (ii) the share of the junior secondary education budget out of the
total provincial education budget would also have to increase during the capital-intensive
phase (as in the national scenario; see Table 4 above).
East Java: Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for East Java
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$101.5 million, would
account for about 6% of the East Java education budget, on average, during the project period
(1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two
years of the project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$2.4 million in the last
year of the project, and stabilize at US$3.1 million after the project is completed, representing
1.0% of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the project
are small and manageable.

NTT: Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for NTT (including

the education budget. The recurrent cost implications of the project in NIT are
approximately (4 times) higher than thatfor East .Java. Given the much lower level of JS
education enrollmerits in NTT compared to East Java, a higher level of resources (relative to
current regional budgetarY patterns) need to be directed to NTT to sustain the investment.

III. NALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
A. Alternative Modes of Junior Secondary Education
GOI has available to it various alternatives to the regular (9 classroom) SMP school.
These include: SMP Kecil (small schools of 3 classrooms), SMP Terbuka (open/distance
school), and Paket B (non-formal education). An analysis of their unit costs and effectiveness
is presented below. Two words of caution are in order, however: (i) the alternative programs
are not perfect substitutes for each other or even to the regular SMP (see below); and (ii) the
programs are in an early stage of development, particularly the SMP Terbuka and are
undergoing continuous revisions, hence their unit costs and outcomes are expected to change
over time. The analysis below, therefore, is preliminary and will be updated during the course
of the project.
Following is a characterization of the main advantages and disadvantages of each
program:

Following are estimates of unit costs of each alternative program:

1/ including amortization of building
As mentioned above, the three alternatives are not perfect substitutes. SMP Terbuka
needs a 9-classroom regular SMP school within reasonable distance to function as a mother
school, providing subject matter teachers. Thus the program cannot be introduced in very
remote areas where regular SMPs are not available. Paket B is more flexible, but does not
lead to an EBTANAS examination yet; thus it is not well accepted in all areas. An SMP kecil,
always accepted despite some of the draw-backs in terms of teachers' quality, requires a
capital investment (and subsequent maintenance and amortization). In addition, MOEC has to
find regular teachers willing to stay in remote areas.
LearningAchievement It is difficult at present to compare learning achievement
between the three types of schooling. SMP Terbuka is a very recent program; NEM scores
exist for only one year, thus there is limited basis for analysis. Paket B has its own
examination which does not produce any NEM scores; its examination scores are not
comparable with those of the other two programs. So far, only one comparative study of
learning achievements has been conducted.14 Students in the sample, subdivided into two
groups according to whether they had just entered the program (Group I) or they had attended
the program for one year (Group II), were administered the same test, which gave the
following mean test results:
Program                      Group I          Group II
Paket B                         34.0              41.0
Regular SMP                     42.5              51.3
SMP Terbuka                     31.1             34.3
Students of SMP Terbuka scored the lowest grades. The study further calculates the "gain
points average" for each alternative, which shows that the highest gain was obtained by the
regular SMP, followed by Paket B and SMP Terbuka.
The above mentioned study represents one case study and should not be considered as
conclusive. As the three alternative programs are further developed under the project (and
other projects such as the Non-formal Education Project), they will be monitored and
outcomes measured in order to produce more conclusive conclusions.

B. Public versus Private Provision of Junior Secondary Education
A second analysis of alternatives is that covered under Section 11 on the role of the
private sector. The earlier discussion highlighted the budgetary implications of the expansion
program if the role of the private sector declines. There are additional merits to preserving the
private sector. First, given the current and projected surplus of teachers, a robust private
sector is an effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second, madrasah
schools (religious schools which currently enroll about 20% of junior secondary students)
offer access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost that is significantly
lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also enroll a higher
proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattern of some families for non-
conventional education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior
secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at
the senior secondary level (54% of enrollments in 1993/94).

IV. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by
province and component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the
management component). The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return
that equates a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year
horizon.
Table I presents the rates of return for the two project provinces by component.
Overall returns for the two provinces are high and those to quality enhancements are higher
than for expansion of access, particularly in the case of NTT.
Table 1
Rates of Return to Project Investments by Component and Province
Component         East Java        NTT
Access               16.3           14.0
fQuality             21.8           22.0
Total                18.3           16.0
The remainder of the section explains how the estimates were made and provides an
indication of the sensitivity of the estimates to some of the underlying assumptions.
A. Benefits
Increasing Access.   The project investments are expected to lead to an increase in
the number of students enrolled in and graduating from junior secondary in any given year.
Most junior secondary graduates, however, do not stop at this level: nationally about 84
percent proceed to senior secondary and another 30 percent proceed to tertiary. Thus, the
stream of output resulting from the project investments is modeled as a function of the
following five levels of outflows:
1. Junior secondary graduates;
2. Junior secondary graduates who proceed to senior secondary and then drop out;
3. Junior secondary graduates who succeed in graduating from senior secondary;
4. Senior secondary graduates who proceed to university and then drop out; and
5. University graduates.
The total number of the above outflow over a thirty year period amounts to
approximately 945,000 beneficiaries (Table 2).15 The benefits of each of the beneficiaries are
estimated as the difference in wages between one level of education and the next. No
additional wage premiums are assumed to accrue to dropouts (they earn the same wage as
15 These outflows assume that there will not be a capacity constraint at the senior secondary and higher education
levels. Give the rapid growth of the private sector at these levels in the past decade, this assumption is not
unreasonable to make (coupled with some additional public investment).



Annex 1: Page l7 of 18                               69
that of the education level they drop from). Provincial data on wages, drop out rates (by
grade), and transition rates are utilized in the estimation of outflows and benefits.'6
Table 2
Beneficiaries of Project Investments (stream over 30 years)
(million)
Component   East Java               NTT            Total Project
Access             0.69              0.26              0.95
Quality            3.34              0.91              4.25
Total              4.03              1.17              5.20
Enhancing Quality. Investments to enhance quality will extend to (a high
proportion of) existing students as well as the new students generated by the project. Over the
thirty years of the calculation, the total number of quality beneficiaries amount to
approximately 4.3 million. We assume that a 15 percent additional wage premium can be
earned by higher quality graduates (equivalent to about an extra $1.5-2.5 per month,
depending upon provincial wages).
B. Costs
Investment costs are divided into those related to increasing access and those which
enhance quality, for each of the four provinces. They are spread over six years, with very
little investment in the first year of the project, followed by several years of heavy capital
outlays and tapering off in the sixth year. A provincial average annual per student recurrent
cost is imposed throughout the project and subsequently for the remaining twenty-five years
(amounting to about $100). Similarly, annual recurrent costs for senior secondary and
university education are added to total costs since a significant portion of the benefits accrue
as a result of junior secondary students proceeding up the system. On the quality side, an
incremert of $8 is assumed to represent the recurrent cost of additional quality
improvemients. No quality enhancements are factored for senior secondary and tertiary.
16 In cases wbere provincial wage rates are not reliable, national wages were used as an approximation.

C. Sensitivity to Assumptions
Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. Following are
results for several simulations:
Change                                  New rate of return (base case; Table 1)
Only a 10% increase in additional wage
premium for higher quality graduates:
East Java                               12.4% (16.7%)
NTT                                     17.3% (21.8%)
JS/Primary wage differential increases by
20%:
East Java                               17.1% (16.3%)
NTT                                     14.7% (14.0%)
SS/JS wage differential increases by 20%:
East Java                               17.6% (16.3%)
NTT                                     15.4% (14.0%)
Increase in JS recurrent costs by 30%:
East Java                               14.9% (16.3%)
NTT                                     12.9% (14.0%)
Incremental recurrent costs for quality
improvement increase from $8/student to
$1 0/student:
East Java                               20.6% (21.8%)
NTT                                     20.6% (22.0%)
In all, the main variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive are those
affecting quality. This is not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are
impacted by this investment.

INDONESIA
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
GENERAL PROFILE OF EAST JAVA
General Background. East Java, with 32 million inhabitants, stands today at the forefront of
modem Indonesia, its economy spurred by rising industrialization and modernizing agriculture, a
blend not unlike that which occurred in Korea duruig the 1960s. East Java ranks alongside the
Chao Ph_ ya Delta of Thailand, the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, and the Irrawaddy Delta of
Burma as one of the biggest and most fertile agricultural hinterlands of South-East Asia.
Surabaya, the province capital and the second largest city in the country, has become the leading
economic pole around which the Eastern half of Indonesia gravitates.
In the 1960s East Java was considered a backward region with little economic potential,
as its oilfield was depleted, it had no timber or mineral resources to attract foreign investment,
and its road infrastructures was in complete disrepair.  It had, however, a provincial
administration which had maintained a high degree of professionalism, and was headed by a
very charismatic civilian leader, Governor Noer. The province thus made the best of the rice
intensification program launched in 1967, of the family planning program started in 1968, and of
the Village Development Grant Scheme (Inpres Desa Tertinggal --IDT-- "Presidential Program
for Left-behind Villages") introduced in 1969. Thanks to big increases in government spending
in the 1970s, and then to its own dynamism, East Java's economy has been growing steadily
since, at rates above the national average.
Th, province's overall picture of prosperity, however, contrasts sharply with the
relatively hi- lievels of poverty still found in East Java -- 22 percent of the population lives
under the poverty level (20 percent nationally), and the illiteracy rate for people 10-year old and
above is 23 percent in East Java, as compared to 16 percent nationwide. Sixteen out of 37
districts have more than 25 percent of their villages targeted by the IDT program, a 1994
Presidential initiative providing special assistance to the poorest communities of the country.
Physical Environment East Java has a tropical climate, with six months of 'dry' season
(meaning less than 60 millimeters of monthly precipitation), annual rainfall of more than 2,000
millimeters, and constantly warm weather (except at higher altitudes). The province is transected
from East to West by a spine of volcanic mountains with peaks sometimes exceeding 3,000
meters, which feed three main river basins: the Bengawan Solo basin in the north-west, the
Brantas basin running south-west to north-east in the middle of the province and ending in
Surabaya, and the Pekalen-Sampean basin at the eastern end of the province. These lowland
areas constitute the primary areas of intensive irrigated cultivation, with 1,000 kilometers of
primary canals and 10,000 kilometers of drainage canals irrigating about a million hectares.
The highlands represent 14 percent of the total area of East Java, and were not settled
before the mid-nineteenth century, when population pressure in the lowlands and coffee
cultivation made them attractive. The highlands derive specific environmental importance from
their
hydrological role. The cultivation of increasingly steeper slopes, brought out by a growing
demographic pressure in the last two decades, has translated into a greater hydrological
instability, and more frequent destructive flash floods in the lowlands.

The south-west (Pacitan, Ponorogo, Trenggalek and Tulungagung) and northwest coast
(Bojonegoro and Tuban) Kabupatens, as well as the drought-prone Madura Island, are
characterized by low limestone hills. These are the poorest areas in the province, whose
economic activity is limited to rain-fed cultivation without any real prospect for industrialization.
People have been moving out of these areas in search of employment throughout this century.
History Until the 14th century the island of Java was dominated by a series of Hindu-Buddhist
kingdoms, which lasted well into the Dutch occupation. The most successful of them, ruled by
the Majapahit dynasty, established in the 14th century an empire which, for the time of about a
generation, dominated from its base in East Java most of the territory of modem Indonesia. The
islamization of Java, first carried out by Arab traders from the 8th century on, and then more
forcefully by Melaka rulers in the l 5th century, was gradual, and proceeded apace during the
European intervention in the region.
To insure the security of its trade the United East India Company (VOC) gradually
became involved in the Javanese kingdoms' court politics and wars. In the 19th century the
Dutch government took control and turned Java into a fully colonial society, but not until after
the Java War of 1825-30, a fierce guerrilla conflict which killed an estimated 200,000 people.
Starting in 1830 the Dutch government put in place the Cultivation System, which forced
Javanese farmers to grow export crops. From the 1 870s on, government monopolies were
progressively replaced by free trade and the development of plantations. During the last half-
century of colonial rule, which ended with the Japanese occupation, the Dutch plantations of East
Java used to produce 2/3rd of the colony's sugar, nearly all its coffee, and large quantities of
high-quality cigar tobacco.
Culture. Contrary to many other provinces, East Java has an ethnically highly homogeneous
population, with only a small but economically active Chinese minority standing apart from the
Javanese plurality. Ninety five percent of the population counts itself as Muslim.
If many Javanese express pride at the achievements of the court of Surakarta and
Yogyakarta, most tend not to identify with this elite tradition, nor with a specific lineage or clan
as is customary in many regions of Indonesia, but rather with their own villages. These villages
are subdivided into smaller neighborhood associations -rukun tetangga- the Javanese word rukun
describing, according to anthropologist Robert Jay, both a "state of being and a mode of action ...
a state in which all parties are at least overtly at peace with one another"; "[it is] a process of
sharing through collective action." These neighborhoods gather for rituals, organize sports teams
and youth groups, or set up rotating credit associations, and sometimes collaborate on harvesting
rice.
The Javanese language is characterized by its complex rules of etiquette. When
addressing someone, Javanese speakers must choose from several different levels of politeness
In general, a person uses the highest level to speak to high-status people in formal situations and
the lowest
levels to speak to people of lower rank or with whom one is most intimate. Children learn to
speak the lowest level first, but are soon taught to address their father respectfully, using refined
speech, and failure to do so will result in a sharp reprimand. Fro Javanese, learning the proper
degree of shame is a matter of becoming aware of one's vulnerability in interaction.



Annex 2: Page 3 of 8                              73
Population. East Java, like the rest of Java island, is densely populated, with 678 persons per
square kilometer, and population has been growing at a steady but declining pace: 1.6 percent
from 1961 to 1971, but 0.8 percent for the period 1985-90. This abatement of demographic
growth is the result of a voluntarist family planning program started in the early 1970s (this
national program has been more particularly successful in East Java). Cities have been
expanding rapidly in the last two decades, growing annually by 4.5 percent between 1980 and
1990, a.nd as a result the province's urbanization rate reached 27.5 percent in 1990. Still, some
areas ot the province remain extremely rural, and half of the 37 districts do not exceed a 19
percent urbanization rate.
East Java's high population density creates tremendous pressure on the land, pushing the
poorest farmers and the young to migrate to the cities, or to relocate on other islands through the
massive Transmigration Program (between 1971 and 1980, the outmigration rate grew from 2.94
to 5.47 percent). Studies of migration patterns within the province have shown that most
migrants (almost equallyv male and female) first moved between ages 15 and 34, when still
single, leaving a rural area for an urban center where they predominantly took jobs in the
informal sector. Migrants (inter and intra-provincial) are usually better educated: In 1985, among
intra-provincial migrants aged 20 and over, half the males and a third of the females had
completed junior secondary school, a completion rate three times higher than the average for the
total population. Also, migrants to the industrial region were better educated than migrants to
other regions, with 42 percent of males and 23 percent of females having had a senior secondary
education..
Economic Activity. The two major stimulants to East Java's development since the 1960s have
been the Green Revolution in rice production, which has nearly trebled since 1968, and the
growth of the manufacturing industry, particularly in the late 1980s. But the expansion of the
construction and transport sectors, as well as commercial and financial activities more generally,
have been complementary to those achievements and have provided vastly more employment.
The regional economiiy experienced a structural shift during the 1970s and 1980s: the
share of agriculture in the economy declined from 50 percent in 1970 to less than 25 percent in
1987 (and agriculture's share of employment went down from 56 percent in 1987 to 43 percent in
1994), the industrial sector increased from 14 to 25 percent, with the central core region
becoming a center of manufacturing industry growth. (Most of the industrial activity is located
in a corridor that developed along the highways joining Gresik, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, Pasuruan
and Malang to Surabaya.) Services also grew from 36 to 50 percent. While all sectors grew
between 1983 and 1987, the largest growth rate was in manufacturing (7 percent) and services (6
pz, cent).
Today East Java boasts the second largest industrial base of the country in terms of
employment and establishments, and contributes about 22 percent of the national value added by
manufacturing. It is the only province which has achieved impressive growth rates and relatively
higher per capita incomes without the advantage of substantial natural resources (oil, timber) or
special stimuli like tourist dollars or a massive influx of external capital. The two most important
manufacturing activities are the industry of kretek (clove cigaretes) and sugar milling, with kretek
representing in 1985 more than 60 percent of the total value added of the 12 major industries
(which also included weaving, yarn, machinery, metal structure products, fertilizer, cosmetic and
perfume, cement, coconut oil, milk products and beer).

Education and Small Villages. Up until the early 1970s, the rapid economic
development of Java Timur seemed to be all but a foregone conclusion, and socio-economic
indicators depicted a rather backward region. Accordingly, education in rural areas usually did
not exceed a few years of primary school for the children of the wealthiest families. Sending a
child off to a distant secondary school did not appear to parents as an appealing option. Overall,
the village and its traditional culture were still the main frame of reference for poor as well as
rich families, and links with the world at large were often only tenuous.
Starting in the 1970s, several factors went into play which disrupted the self-centeredness
of the villages: the improvement of the road systems, which had been the top priority of the
provincial administration since the mid-1960s; the introduction of new rice varieties, which
doubled yields in the course of 15 years, and helped farmers shift from self-subsistence to market
agriculture; the booming national oil income, which percolated down to the districts through a
program of primary schools construction.
The social treatment of television sets, which started to make their way in the villages in
the mid to late 1970s, presents an exemplary illustration of the transformation of village life
under these new economic conditions. Color television sets, which retailed for about $300-500,
were initially publicly displayed on the verandas of the richest families, allowing the whole
neighborhood to enjoy it. The TV set was still treated as some form of public good, very much
in the tradition of the slametan festivals, which acted as a form of wealth redistribution scheme
within the community.
This attitude, however, quickly evolved, as the wealthiest families started to perceive
themselves less and less as a part of the village community, and more and more as part of the
larger national community. As a result, TV sets gradually retreated within the private sphere of
home, progressively shielded by windows and curtains. And it was for education as it was for
TV: children were increasingly sent off to secondary school, and some to college, as links with
the world at large were perceived as more and more desirable economically and socially.
Progressively the village ceased to be the central reference for the local elite.
For the small farmers and the poor however, the village and its traditional values have
remained the central locus and focus of life, a fact which sometimes translates into the expression
of a distrust of the modem ways adopted by the elit. The actual impact of this attitude upon
education demand however is difficult to evaluate, and could not easily be separated from the
sheer financial burden of education, which for the poor remain a considerable obstacle.

GENERAL PROFILE OF NUSA TENGGARA TIMUR
Nusa Tenggara Timur is at the exact opposite pole from East Java on the scale of social
and economic development. NTT has the lowest RGDP per capita (about 40 percent of national
per capita GDP) of all 27 provinces, and its rate of economic growth from 1983 to 1991 was 5.2
percent, as compared to an average growth rate of 6.6 percent for Indonesia, and 7.4 percent for
Java. Social indicators are below average: 24 percent of the population live under the poverty
line (as compared to 15 percent nationally), and 69 percent of the population has monthly levels
of expenditures below Rp 20,000 (45 percent nationally); incidence of moderate and severe
protein energy malnutrition is about 16 percent in rural areas. One fifth of NTT villages are
listed as IDT villages.
The 1990 census counted 3.3 million inhabitants in NTT, unevenly distributed among
the islands, and mostly rural (89 percent). Ethnically and linguistically, NTT population is
extremely fragmented, with varying social and political traditions. This diversity however is
starting to be slowly erased by the systematic use of Bahasa Indonesia in schools, the
development of national communication technologies and infrastructures, the increasing
marketisation of the economy, and Government's strong promotion of the Pancasila ideology.
There are only a few disparities in economic achievement between the different
Kaoupaten, with Kupang (*)standing out as an island of relative prosperity in the province (see
table). Most of the economic activity in Kupang is concentrated in the tertiary sector (72 percent
in 1991), as the city is the administrative capital of the province.

Physical environment. NTT is comprised of the four main islands of Sumba, Flores, Timor and
Alor, 38 smaller inhabited islands, and 524 uninhabited islands. Communication is therefore a
key constraint, for the people living on the smaller islands as well as for those living on the main



76                                Annex 2: Page 6 of 8
'lands, where many villages are still not connected by all-weather roads to the provincial and
Kabupaten road network.
The islands are mostly mountainous, with only a third of the total land area suitable for
agriculture, and the soils, which are in general volcanic or coralline, are prone to drought during
the dry season. The province is prone to volcanic and seismic activity, the latest manifestation of
which being the disastrous 1992 earthquake in Flores. With a semi-arid climate mostly
influenced by the Australian system, the islands have a 8 to 9 month-long dry season, and
experience very uneven (from 800 to 3,000 mm per year according to location) and variable
rainfall. As a consequence, there is a general lack of close, reliable water supply, which forces
women and children to haul the water from distant sources.
Only 16 percent of the land area is cultivated, mainly through upland and shifting
cultivation (irrigation is possible on less than 10 percent of the cultivable land). The growing
demographic pressure, the use of slash and bum agriculture, and overgrazing are resulting in the
progressive degradation of land.
History. NTT sits at the boundary of two major etbno-cultural realms: the Malay and the
Melanesian worlds, which intermingled in that region before the European intervention starting
from the 15th century (first Portuguese, then Dutch troops and settlers). There has been also a
somewhai marginal Arab influence, through the localized presence of Arab traders as early as the
12th century. As a result, NTT's population is extremely heterogeneous, with, for instance,
Flores' population comprising 5 major ethno-linguistic groups, and Alor's counting up to 40
separate ethno-linguistic groups.
Thanks in part to its poor natural endowment, NTT has long stood on the sidelines of the
colonial history of the region. When in the early 17th century the Dutch ships of the VOC
(United East India Company) started to sail the Indian Ocean, they concentrated most of their
plundering efforts on the Mollucas and the Greater Sunda Islands (Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra).
Except for some trading outposts (in particular for sandalwood and slaves), they largely ignored
the islands of Sumba, Flores and Timor, part of what was then called the Lesser Sunda Islands.
In the mid-nineteen century, however, the Dutch extended and strengthened their control onto the
Eastem islands, a move which aimed at checking the expansion of the British empire from its
base in the Malay peninsula.
A wave of religious prozelitism followed in the wake of the Dutch administrators, with
jesuit and Lutheran missionaries competing in the construction of missions, hospitals and schools
throughout the islands. Unlike in Java, Sumatra or Bali, they did not encounter the resistance of
already strongly established religious systems (Islam or Hinduism), but rather a wide variety of
animistic beliefs. Today the population of NTT is in its great majority catholic or Protestant.
Islam only represents a minority (about 9 percent of the population) to be found mostly in cities
like Kupang.
However, the colonial and world religions' influence constituted only a thin veneer,
under which the traditional culture and social and political organizations have long persisted. In
the islands the indigenous feudal princedoms, the traditional class hierarchies and rules of
behavior (adat), and age-old magico-religious practices still largely inform social life. These
traditional structures sometimes coincide with more modern forms of organization, and it is not

uncommon to find the heir of a royal family in the official role of Bupati (administrative chief of
the district), and drawing a great deal of his local legitimacy from his lineage.
In modern times, because of the policy of national integration, there has been a fairly
important Javanese influence, both through the posting of Javanese in most governmental
positions, and through the education system and the media. Most of inmigrants to NTT today are
from Javanese origin (with 40.4 percent of 1990 46,310 inmigrants coming from Java).
Demography. With 3.3 million in the 1990 census, NTT represents less than 2 percent of
Indonesia's total population. Its rate of population growth -1.78 percent for 1980-90- is lower
than most other regions and than the national average of 1.96 percent. However, NTT fertility
rate is higher than average with 4.5 children per woman (3 on national average), but this is more
than offset by a higher infant mortality rate (77 against 71 at the national level) and a strong
outmigration. Life expectancy has improved considerably since 1970, going from 44.4 to 58.6
years in 1990 (only one year less than tile national average). NTT's average family size is also
larger -5.3 in 1990- than nationally (4.5).
Outmigration, both to other provinces or to other countries, is the main factor alleviating
population pressure. Outmigration towards other provinces has increased sharply in the last
decade, going from 47,534 in 1980 to 99,442 in 1990. When evened with inmigration, which
has only slightly grown during that decade, the overall migration balance is negative, and
represented 1.62 percent of total population in 1990. The main destinations for outmigration are
East Timor, East Java and Jakarta.
International outmigration is not well documented, as most of it occurs outside the legal
channels, which people use to avoid the government's migration fee and the bureaucratic red
tape. One of the main destinations for outmigration is Sabah, where according to a conservative
estimate around 100,000 people from NTT have migrated. This outmigration is to some extent
reflected in demographic statistics, with the 1990 census counting 78 males for 100 females in
East Flores. There is indeed a long tradition of migration from Flores to Sabah, dating back from
the Japanese retreat at the end of World War II, when the imperial army took to Borneo coolies
forcefully drafted from Flores.
Economic activity. Agriculture is the main activity, representing about 36 percent of RGDP
(national average is 20 percent), and employing more than 80 percent of the work force. About
90 percent of farm families cultivate rice or secondary crops, and the wealthiest 40 percent keep
livestock, which is the most significant status symbol in NTT. Cattle is used to some extent for
farm work but mostly as a vector for savings.
Manufacturing is almost negligible, and represented only 2.0 percent of NTT's GDP in
1991. Government is the second most important sector of employment, and has on its payrolls
7.5
percent of NTT labor force (by comparison, at the national level government employees account
for 5 percent of the total labor force).
Tourism is the growth industry of NTT, and has enjoyed an explosion in recent years,
most of it concentrated in Flores. The number of tourists coming to the islands grew from
10,085 in 1985 (4,075 foreign and 6,010 domestic) to 52,060 in 1989 (18,531 foreign), and



78                               Annex 2: Page 8 of 8
187,509 in 1991 (82,806 foreign). The destinations of choice are four Kabupaten of Flores
(Manggarai, Ende, East Flores, Sikka), and Kupang.
Education. Thanks to its tradition of Christian education, the illiteracy level in NTT is not as
high as in Indonesian regions with a similar economic background. NTT's illiteracy rate is 21.9
percent, to be compared with 16 percent at the national level, but 54.9 percent in East Timor and
31.3 percent in Iran Jaya. Illiteracy is mostly concentrated in the older age groups, and gender
differences, which used to be prevalent, have all but disappeared in the younger generations. The
general level of education of the population aged 15 and over has substantially improved since
1971 (the number of males with no schooling went down from 38.2 percent in 1971 to 18.1
percent in 1990), but the lag with the rest of Indonesia has remained the same (with a differential
of 5.9 percentage points).
It must be noted that education carries a great deal of social prestige in NTT, and parents
do not hesitate to sell their cattle and go into debt to finance the education of their children.
Indeed, in the last decade the level of education of one's children has become a sign of social
prominence at least as important as the possession of cattle, and well diplomed children will
allow one into the community's innermost circle.

INDONESIA
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
TEACHER TRAINING
A. Background
The teacher development programs in Indonesia, through their twenty years of history,
have succeeded in developing an extensive group of secondary school teachers into teacher trainers
both at the provincial and district levels, respectively the instructors, who run the Permantapan
Kerja Guru or PKG Model C program, and guru inti, who run the Musywara Guru Mata or
MGMP program, who constitute an invaluable human resource for quality improvement activities.
However, in spite of this achievement, evidence of improved pedagogy in the classroom is hard to
find outside the most favored schools in large urban centers. It can be said that Indonesian junior
secondary education teachers deliver a body of planned curriculum content, but pay insufficient
attention to what and how pupils are learning. Thus, in order to improve teachers' classroom
efficiency, changes in teacher training are suggested in three areas: curriculum content, delivery
mechanisms and training program management, which are outlined in the following sections C &
D. The recommendations for the reform of the teacher training component of the project (content
and delivery) are based on the findings of the JGF-sponsored report 'Secondary Education in
Indonesia: Strengthening Teacher Competency and Student Leaming" produced in the context of
the project's preparation, and available in the files (Annex 27)
B. Project Activities
The teacher training component of the project would consist of two distinct types of
activity: first, reforming the content of existing teacher training programs and, second, providing
support for the reformed delivery of teacher training (for about 18,700 teachers in East Java, and
about 4,100 teachers in NTT). A detailed implementation plan would be prepared and included in
the Project Implementation Handbook to be produced at the onset of the project and distributed to
the PPIUs and CPCU as well as to concemed administrative officers.
C. Training Program Reform
The content of all in-servicing activities are expected to be revitalized, and as a result,
future programs would pay much more attention to promoting student leaming than they do at
present.  Emphasis would be given to the development of effective presenting, explaining,
questioning and probing techniques, so that teachers become skilled in identifying students'
leaming strategies and difficulties. Teachers would leam to construct open-ended formative tests
for use in the classroom, and to use the results to improve learning.
Preparing the first draft of this new training program would be the responsibility of the
Development Team for the relevant subject. They would work in collaboration with national and
intemational consultants.
The Development Teams and the consultants would also be responsible for devising
suitable tests for monitoring pupils' learning during the course of the project. The majority of the



Annex 5: Page 2 of 4                             87
test questions should test higher-order learning skills rather than simple recall, and should be in
open-ended format. Models from best current international practices would be used as a guide in
devising these tests.
National consultants would be drawn from teacher training (IKIPs and FKIPs) and similar
institutions. They would be required to have had recent and relevant experience in Indonesian
schools, involving the application of effective subject-specific pedagogical methods. International
consultants--with working knowledge of Bahasa Indonesia--would likewise be specialists in
subject-specific pedagogy, with recent and relevant school-based expedience.
During the first year, consultants and instructors would monitor the implementation of the
new programs. At the end of the year, the programs would be evaluated, and revised in the light of
implementation experience.
D. Teacher Training Delivery and Management
Training would be delivered through two modes: provincial-level programs for the isolated
schools (PKG Model C), which would have the priority under the project, and cluster-level
programs for the more accessible schools in rural and urban areas (MGMP).
In both programs, the most important change would be the establishment of a regular
schedule of school visits that would replace on-service training. The purpose of these visits would
be not only to provide professional guidance to teachers, but also to monitor their performance.
All teachers - not just those involved in in-service activities - would be observed.
a) PKG Model C
TIhe PKG Model C would address the needs of the isolated schools, and would be managed
by the province. Two major innovations are proposed: a full year program and systematic school
Visits.
Duration. The training program for each batch of teachers should run for a full year.
There would be three in-service training sessions instead of the current two, to ensure that subject
content for the full teaching year is covered.
School visits. Three visits should be made to participating schools each year (where this is
feasible and cost effective). Instructors would visit schools in teams of two, one to observe lessons
in mathematics and science, the other, lessons in Bahasa Indonesia, English, and geography.
Instructors should observe lessons by all teachers in the school, rather than just those currently
engaged in the training program for schools in more difficult areas. Head teachers of the schools
would be given training as part of the in-service training network to provide systematic pedagogical
support (technical supervision) to teachers in their schools.
As this program addresses the training needs of schools in remote areas, it would be fully
financed by the project and would receive priority financing. The coverage area of the program
would first be comprehensively determined, so as to ensure that no school fall into a gray area
between the PKG Model C and the MGMP coverage areas. The kanwil-based management team
would establish for every year a schedule, and would select the teachers to benefit from the
program during that year on the basis of pre-established criteria.

b) MGMP
Schools in cities and easily accessible rural areas would be covered by the revised MGMP
training formula, and would be essentially independent and self-financing, but would be eligible
for Project support under certain conditions (criteria to be defined in the implementation plan).
Management. The program will be managed by Ka Kandep or his representative, working
with a group of headmasters representing the participating schools. The management team will
divide the kabupaten into clusters of appropriate size, and be responsible for finances (particularly
yearly requests for Project funding), the maintenance of records, and arranging the trainers' work
schedules.
Meetings. Cluster-level teachers' meetings will be held on a regular basis, approximately
15 times per year. A cluster level management team consisting of the head teachers of the
participating schools will set the timetable, guru inti will be responsible for arranging and running
the program.
School visits. Guru intl will carry out systematic visits to all junior secondary schools on
a regular basis. During the visit, the guru inti will observe a lesson taught by every teacher in his
specialist subject, provide feedback, and write a report highlighting achievements as well as
identifying areas where there is need for improvement. A file of reports will be maintained.
Visits from the provincial team. Subject specialist pengawas (supervisors) and instructors
will visit the kabupaten on a regular basis to guide and monitor the guru inti's work. They will
review the guru inti's school reports and visit cluster meetings.
Incentives for improvement will be introduced including the display of outstanding
students' work at the cluster center, the presentation of model lessons by outstanding teachers at
special cluster meetings, and opportunities for upgrading and promotion for guru inti.
Funding. The MGMP management teams, established for a cluster of schools, would be
eligible for project funding and would need to present to the PIU a request for the academic year.
Funding would cover only the teachers fitting the pre-established criteria.
Training Fund. The Project would establish a Training Fund that would provide, upon
request by the MGMP management teams, the following inputs:
* An honorarium of Rp. 12,500 per day to LKGI-trained guru inti for each day spent at a
cluster-based in-service meeting as a trainer (including travel allowance).
*  An honorarium of Rp. 15,000 per day to LKGI-trained guru inth for each day spent on school
visits (including travel allowance).

INDONESIA
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE SCIENCE EDUCATION STUDY
A. The Study
1.    Objectives. To evaluate and select an innovative and cost effective approach to teach
JSE school children of Indonesia the basic scientific foundations of everyday life and
environment, and raise their awareness of the scientific understanding of technology. The
selected approach would be recommended to be adopted as a national strategy for science
education at the JSE level in Indonesia.
2.    Specific Issues.  Two models of science teaching at primary JSE level will be
evaluated in order to generate the necessary empirical data to establish their comparative cost-
effectiveness. The specific issues to be evaluated are:
(a)    The impact of the models on students' cognitive achievement in sciences,
problem solving, and attitudes toward self, school, and society;
(b)    The administrative feasibility of each model implementation; and
(c)    The search for the most cost-effective modality.
3.    Structure of the Study. The study will be based on a teaching experiment developed
(under the East Java and NTT Secondary liducation Project) in about 80 classrooms during
two school years. The study would be undertaken over a three-year period by a group with
high qualifications id experience in research and education policy analysis. The final report
is due in October, 2000.
B. Methodology
4.    Research Methodology.  To assess the impact of different models of science
education, a cost-effectiveness analytic framework will be applied. To the extent that cognitive
achievement, problem-solving, and students' attitudes can be measured, a cost-benefit
approach will be implemented. The cost analysis should focus on differences in the cost
between the different modalities of JSE science education. The examination of model
effectiveness will use the educational production function tools.
5.    The following elements must be included in the evaluation proposal:
(a)    The evaluation would look for the following three possible effects of different
models on the student:
(i)    Changes in cognitive achievement;



Annex 6: Page 2 of 5                             91
(ii)    Changes in problem solving skills; and
(iii)   Changes in attitudes toward science and technology, self, school, and
society.
(b)    The evaluation would contemplate three testing points in time for assessing the
possible differential effects of different models:
(i)   A base line, at the beginning of an academic year, measuring attitudes,
problem-solving skills, and knowledge about the learning objectives of
the science curriculum;
(ii)   Effects observable at the end of an academic year, after the students
have experienced the models; and
(iii)  Effects observable at the end of the following year. This requires a
longitudinal panel data gathered from the same cohort of students.
(c)    The sample design should take into account the different types of junior
secondary schools in the two project provinces. Students from schools not
participating in any of the two models will serve as the first control group, but
students in each model will form a control group when compared with students
in other models;
(d)    The unit of observation will be the students. Because students from the same
school will have many characteristics in common, a more aggregate exercise
using the school as a unit of analysis will fail to test the hypothesis we are
interested in, because of masking of individual differences through averaging;
(e)    The dependent variables to be included should be as follows:
(i)    Continuous cognitive and problem solving skills measures; and
(ii)   attitude measures.
(f)    The independent variables will include measures of parents' socioeconomic
background;  student  gender  and  age;  community  socioeconomic
characteristics; school/teachers characteristics, such as school nature and
modality, school expenditure per student, teacher quality, through and index of
quality of school inputs; and
(g)    Hvpothesis testing. Crosstabulation and regression analysis will be used in
order to attempt to detect any significant effects of particular models on
students' achievement and attitudes, as follows:
(1) The regression will be of the general type:Y = f (model, region,
background, individual, and school characteristics), where Y is one of
the dependent variables discussed above; and
(ii) To measure the cost-effectiveness of each model, the study will
require identification of the costs of each model, including supervision
of implementation, teacher training, materials, etc.

C. The Product
6.           Elements of Research Proposal. The final research proposals should include
the following elements:
(a)    Specification of main research (evaluation) questions;
(b)   Design of sample;
(c)    Design of information gathenrng instruments;
(d)   Definition of logistic of field work, including mechanisms to reduce
the attrition rate.
(e)    Definition of schedule of field work;
(f)    Definition of data processing.
(g)   Definition of statistical models and methods of analysis to be used.
(h)   Implementation schedule specifying the tasks to be done and their
respective duration. This element should also include report schedule.
A report should be produced and delivered to Dikmenum and the Bank
after the first two measures. The final report should include the results
from all measures and cost-effective analysis; and
(i)    Detailed budget, including costs by activity and type of expenditure,
i.e., direct (personnel and others) and  indirect costs.   The
implementation schedule and the budget would allow the contract to be
divided into several phases and payments to allow Bank review and
approval on intermediary steps (e.g., questionnaire and test design,
sample selection, review of first report.
7.           Criteria for Proposal Selection. The criteria for proposal selection include
the pertinence between the methodological and technical aspects of the proposal and the
specified research elements; the pertinence of the schedule proposed (adequate relation
between tasks and time proposed for implementation); and experience of the researchers in
education research, particularly in education evaluation.
D. Preparation, Coordination and Monitoring
8.           Study Coordination and Preparation. The PCU, as the agency responsible
for the proposed project, will coordinate the study experiment in conjunction with the PIUs in
East Java and NTT, which will be responsible for the local management.
9.           A specialist will be hired to serve as study coordinator at PCU under terms of
reference agreed upon with the Bank. Resources must be available for easy mobilization and
frequent visits to the study-related activities in East Java. In the East Java PIU, liaison
personnel must be selected and trained in a timely manner, in order to cooperate with the
coordinator in the experiment monitoring process. The coordinator's contract would start in
March, 1997 and end with the final report delivery in October, 2000.
10.   A consultant would be hired in February, 1997 for four months (under terms of
reference agreed upon with the Bank) to lead the preparation process, including curriculum,
materials and teacher training design, and relevant literature. The consultant's activities would



Annex 6: Page 4 of 5                            93
be based on a close dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, the coordinator and other
information-gathenrng strategies.
ll.          The coordinator and the consultant will develop the following activities:
(a)    Teaching Experiment.  The study will be conducted as a step-by-step
assessment of an actual teaching experiment taking place in project schools and
classrooms during the school years of 1998-99 and 1999-2000. A curriculum
will be designed, teachers trained on the selected methodologies, and
instructional materials developed, as follows:
(i)    Curriculum Design
(a)    A curriculum will be developed by Dikmenum for the first and
third grades, and the necessary equipment purchased or made.
Reference has to be made to the best examples of modem or
hands-on science teaching methods available.
(b)   To help Dikmenum design such curriculum, it is necessary to
gather information on the best (even international) experiences
carried out in science teaching at JSE education level.
(c)    Two different approaches to science study teaching at JSE level
would be adopted and tested in the schools. The final report
would recommend (with justification based on cost-
effectiveness) the best one to be later considered by MOEC.
(ii)   Teacher Training
(a)    Current teachers in different types of project schools will be
selected to be adequately and timely trained to play roles as
expected in their respective schools and classrooms.
(b)    Two  two-week (80 hours each) training sessions will take
place in August, 1997 and May, 1998. The program for the
teacher training programs must be agreed upon with the Bank.
(c)    Training must be given by experienced trainers (acceptable to
the Bank) in terms of content and methodology. Each trainer
specializes in one of the two approaches.
(iii)  Instructional Materials and Guides. Grade-related materials (according
to the curriculum) must be developed (made, printed, purchased).
Concrete experience and local experiments must be emphasized over
'bookish" description and formulation. Simple kits must be bought or
locally developed.
(b)    School Selection. A random sample of 160 (80 experiment +80 control)
classrooms will be selected (and confirmed by an agreement) for the study, as follows:
(i)    A set of 180 representative (first and third-graders; urban rural, public
and private) classrooms would be selected.



94                             Annex 6: Page5of5
(ii)   The 80 control classrooms should be either in the same schools as
corresponding experiment classrooms or in comparable schools in the
same district.
(c)    Monitoring and Evaluation
(i)    Each study school and classroom will be monitored either by the state
or the national coordinator. An early visit should be paid to each
selected school to recommend the experiment and support the science
teacher;
(ii)   Supervisors and school principals must be oriented (during their
training programs or during visits to their schools) on the objectives
and strategies of the experiment. Their support is extremely important
for the success of the study in the schools;
(iii)   Periodic progress reports will be submitted to Dikmenum and the
Bank, approximately twice a year, according to the calendar;
(iv)   A mid-term evaluation would be undertaken in July, 1999 to assess the

INDONESIA
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
MANAGEMENT TRAINING
I. Background
Objectives. The management training component aims at improving the junior
secondary education management efficiency and productivity in public, private and religious
schools, so that the access- and quality-related inputs provided by the project, GOI and other
donors yield the expected educational results in the schools. The project would achieve this by
(i) helping the central level shift towards a more policy-oriented, monitoring, technically
assisting and evaluating role; (ii) providing Kanwils, Kandeps and Kecamatans with the
managerial and analytical tools required for planning, policy and financial analysis, project
implementation, data gathering and evaluation; and (iii) improving headmasters' ability to
ameliorate student learning results, enhance the motivation and productivity of their teachers, and
learn ways to link their school with their catchment communities.
Skill-oriented training. The emphasis of the management training component would be
on the acquisition of technical, practical skills that can find an immediate application in the
administrative environment of the trainees. The acquisition of new managerial skills is expected
to be accompanied by long-lasting changes in behaviors and attitudes that could positively affect
the day-by-day processes and outcomes of schools and the system.
Ownership and Efficacy. With the increased emphasis on devolved responsibilities and
local participation and ownership the development of managerial skills at the sub-central levels
becomes a sine qua non condition for success. As the decision-making process for policy and
project implementation is moved from central offices to administrative instances closer to the
schools (Kanwils, Kandeps and Kecamatans), more dynamic skills are required for immediate
response and efficacy in the decision-making process. As a consequence, policy and
implementation plans must be discussed and agreed upon with PIU and Kanwils.
II. Program Development
The overall development of this component will be carried out in three major phases:
program design, program implementation and program evaluation.
A. Program Design
Development Team. The management training program will be designed under
supervision from the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) at Dikmenum by a "Development
Team" comprised of two international and two national consultants. The consultants (all with
recognized expertise in the area) will be hired by PCU for five months each during the first year
of the project..



96                              Annex 7: Page2 of 5
Tasks. The Development Team, drawing in particular on the expertise of PCU's and
Project Implementation Units (PIU)'s staff and of other ad-hoc participants, is expected to:
*  review past and existing training programs and material in Indonesia's education sector
*  asses the types and levels of skills that are required at the various echelons of the
administrative system;
*  design the program curriculum and methodology for each skill area;
*  prepare training materials specific for each skill area, taking into account materials designed
for national or international programs;
*  field test the program curriculum, methodology and material;
*  set criteria for trainer selection in each area;
*  train the trainers in one-week workshops;
*  lay out an implementation schedule;
*  refine a set of output and performance indicators.
Guidelines. As a result, course implementation guidelines will be prepared by the
Development Team. The guidelines will include program and plan (objectives, content,
materials, skills to be developed), methodology, duration, evaluation and self-evaluation forms,
suggested bibliography. The guidelines will be used for trainers' training.
Skill training activities. The skill-training activities would focus on the following
management areas, which were the result of consultation with the provinces and Dikmenum, but
should not be considered exclusive:
-  Educational Planning:   Planning as a form of rational and intentional intervention.
National and provincial educational needs, demands and priorities. Economic retums of
schooling. Educational variables and the forecasting of social and economic development.
-  School Mapping:   Micro-planning technique that consists of much more than simply
placing schools on a map so as to analyze their geographical distribution. The key point is to
detennine if a given population has (or will have) easy access to the required school.
e  Policy Analysis:   National policies and priorities in education. Quality/efficiency and
equity issues. Policies, decentralization and local ownership. Financial issues. Public and
private, urban and rural, and girls education. Conditions for school effectiveness.
*  Monitoring and Evaluation: The establishment of (and agreement on) educational criteria
and standards. The role of performance indicators. Monitoring strategies, instruments and
timing. Quantitative and qualitative assessment. Evaluation and provision of feedback.
*  Information Analysis and Dissemination: What is information for? The development of
analytical capacity at the provincial and district level. Information for the decision-making
process. Simple ways to disseminate results back to information consumers.
*  Education Data Management:    The fundamentals of education data gathering and
analysis. Key concepts of education planning and evaluation. The school as the working
educational management unit. From data to information and the dissemination process.
*  Computer Use: Basics of computer literacy. Basic computer maintenance. Spreadsheet data
management. Wordprocessing.
*  Technical Supervision: From bureaucratic inspection to technical supervision linked to
teaching and teacher development at school level. Observation and communication skills
required from the new supervision. The headmaster as the principal and closer supervisor.
* Student Performance Assessment: Why do students differ in learning conditions and
processes? Teachers and techniques for assessing students' academic performance. Purposes
of macro and micro student performance assessment. Reporting the results.



Annex 7: Page 3 of 5                              97
*  Management of School Facilities: Basics of school architecture. The school as a pleasant
environment that stimulates learning. Physical conditions of classrooms as the habitat for
learning. Users' (student, teachers) satisfaction. Cost-effective school maintenance.
*  Community Participation:  How  to seek inputs from  parents and encourage their
participation in a variety of school endeavors. Survey parents to obtain their views on the
school, its processes, programs and outputs. Include parents on school advisory bodies.
Trainers' Selection and Training
*  Trainers for all areas will be selected by PCU during the design phase among those
professionals with recognized proficiency and experience.
*  Selected trainers will have a one-week training workshop focusing on objectives,
methodology and evaluation.
*  The training workshop will be mostly based on the guidelines designed by the Development
Team.
*  Trainers will be distributed by PCU for central, provincial and district courses.
Ceteris paribus, trainers living in East Java and NTT should be preferred, provided that they meet
the professional quality criteria.
B. Program Implementation
Training Coordination. The program will be implemented on five administrative
levels (see Table 2): the central segment by PCU in Jakarta; the Kanwil segment by Kanwil in
Surabaya (East Java) and Kupang (NTT); the Kandep, Kecamatan and school segments by
Kandeps using local facilities. In every province the PIU plays a coordinating role. The training
implementation timetable is presented in Table 1. Skills to be developed, segments, levels and
number of participants are detailed on Table 2.

Trainees' Selection Criteria
*  Participants at PCU, Kanwil and Kandep levels must be involved with the East Java and
NTT Junior Secondary Educationi Project.
*  All the Kecamatan heads and all (private, public and religious) junior secondary school
headmasters in East Java and NTT qualify to participate in the program.
*  Each individual participant is allowed to take up to three 40-hour courses, or five 20-hour
courses, according to selector's decision.
*  For each traininig session PCU participants will be selected by PCU director; Kanwil
participants by Kakanwil and PIU director; Kandep, Kecamatan and school participants by
Kakandep.



98                               Annex 7: Page 4 of 5
*  The Kandep, Kecamatan and school headmasters training groups will be constituted of
participants hailing from the same Kandep. If any training session needs to involve trainees
from more than one Kandep, the Kanwil assumes a coordinating role.
*  Selectors will define the annual training groups, notifying the participants at least three
months in advance.
C. Program Evaluation
Program processes and results will be assessed through four types of evaluation: (a)
User's Survey; (b) Annual Implementation and Mid-term Reviews (SAR para. 5..9 & 5.10); and
(c) Technical Audits (SAR para. 5.1 1).
User's Survey. The user's survey will be designed by an international consultant, and
will focus more specifically on the skills that the management training program is expected to
develop. The consultant will identify the users to be surveyed, and the periodicity of the survey.
The survey will be pre-tested under the supervision of the consultant. A base-line will have to be
established in the first year of the project. The consultant will be hired for four months, two for
survey design and test, and two for periodical analysis of results.

East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATION
1.    Description of the Private Sector at Junior Secondary Level
The private sector has a large participation in the provision of education services at the
junior secondary level. In 1994/95, the latest academic year for which statistical information is
available, enrollments in public and private schools in the two project provinces were as follows:
Table 1: Public and Private School Enrollment by Province
Enrollments   Public Schools  Private Schools Private/Total
East Java      1,255,219         696,012         559,207      44.6%
NTT             110,866           65,576          45,290       40.9%
Indonesia      7,812,536       4,602,137       3,210,399      41.1%
The important part played by the private sector in the supply of junior secondary
education services is not a recent phenomenon.  Over the past 10 years, private school
enrollments have consistently been above 40 percent of the total for all of Indonesia, although
there has been a gradual reduction from about 46 percent in 1985/86. More specifically, the
share of private school enrollments declined until 1992/93 during a period of significant
reductions in total enrollments from the previous peak of 7.4 million in 1988/89. But it has been
kept constant at about 41 percent during the resurgence of junior secondary school enrollments in
the last two years.
With the exception of schools (Madrasahs) managed by local Islamic groups, whose
establishment is approved, and operation is supervised, by the Ministry of Religious Affairs
(MORA), private school establishment and operation is approved and supervised by the Ministry
of Education and Culture (MOEC). In 1994-95 there were 18,221 private schools in Indonesia,
10,674 of which were under the supervision of MOEC (SLTPs) and 7,547 Madrasahs (MTs).
The number of schools and of students in the project provinces were as follows:
Table 2: Number of SLTP and MT Private Schools with Enrollment Levels

School Establishment and Accreditation. Many private schools are established and
operated by local communities which have not succeeded in their efforts to have a public school
established, or by associations of teachers. In addition, a large number of private secondary



Annex 8: Page 2 of 4                               101
schools in Indonesia are established by various organizations, mostly of a religious character
such as the Mohammadiya and the Catholic Church. It should be noted, however, that in the
large majority of cases where schools are operated by organizations aiming at influencing local
communities, the specific location of the school is determined by whether a public school already
exists and, if so, whether such a school has the capacity to meet existing local demand for
education. It is rare to find cases of private schools in direct competition with public schools.
An organization starts the process of establishing a new private school by seeking a
favorable ruling on the part of the MOEC and local Government officials at the sub-district level.
The ruling is generally favorable if there is a large enough number of primary school graduates
(virtual demand) in the catchment area with no access to a public school to satisfy operation of
the proposed school. Once their approval is secured, the sponsoring group, through a non-profit
association (yayasan), submits an application to the district office of MOEC which eventually
must be approved by the head of the MOEC office at Province level (Kakanwil). It takes about 9
months for the whole process to be completed.
Schools are supervised and accredited by the MOEC Directorate of Private Schools,
through local MOEC officials at the Province and District levels.  Accreditation classifies
schools in one of four categories: "listed" (lowest), "registered", "recognized", and "equivalent"
(highest). A newly established school is classified as "listed", and a review for potential
upgrading of its status takes place three years later, when the school has produced its first
graduates. There are 8 quality criteria applied during review (such as student performance in
national exams, number of graduates, and adequacy of school facilities). Depending on the
results, the school may retain the "listed" status or be promoted to a higher category. In principle
(and also in a few actual cases), a school may be promoted immediately after the first review to
the highest "equivalent" category. But normally there is a more gradual progression following
successive reviews. The distribution by accreditation category and province is given in Table 3.
Table 3: Private Schools (SLTP) by Accreditation Level
Equivalent  %   Recognized   %   Registered   %   Listed   %    Total
East Java       91       5       1,333     79      125       7    142    8    1,691
NTT             11       3       124       37      191      56    13      4     339
Indonesia      987       9       5969      56     2725      26    993    9    10674
Although the Directorate of Private Schools of MOEC does not collect information on
the association between school ownership and accreditation ranking, partial information from a
small number of provinces included in the proposed projects indicates the following:
"Equivalent" schools are in general owned and operated by religious organizations, while a few
of them are operated by teachers' associations; "Recognized" schools are in general owned and
operated by teachers' associations and other non-profit organizations (yayasans) while a few of
them are owned by religious organizations;  "Registered" schools are generally owned and
operated by teachers' associations and other non-profit organizations, while a large number also
belong to small town and village communities; Finally, "listed" schools are in general owned
and operated by small rural communities that do not have a public school in the community itself
or at a nearby location.

2.     Description of Public Support Program for Private Schools
The Government is aware of the benefits of a flourishing private sector in junior
secondary education. Its policy orientations are explicitly stated in Repelita VI (Book IV, pp. 98-
99 and 112-115 and accompanying Tables) indicating GOI's determination that private schools
should preserve and even increase their share in total junior secondary enrollments. More
important from a practical point of view, the public sector devotes significant amounts of
resources, in kind as well as in the form of money grants, to support and improve the quality of
private schools.  Support in kind includes secondment of public sector teachers to private
schools, distribution of textbooks free of charge, provision of equipment, and training of private
school teachers in publicly funded programs. Money grants are provided to about two thirds of
private schools at the lower end of financial viability (i.e., "listed", "registered" and part of
"recognized" schools).
Teachers. For all of Indonesia seconded teachers fill 16.2 percent of teaching posts in
private schools, with 8.7 percent in East Java and 24 percent in NTT (1993/94 figures). There
are however reliable indications that a disproportionately large number of seconded teachers
serve in "equivalent" and "recognized" private schools, while the poorest schools that have the
greatest need for them receive very inadequate allocations.
Textbooks. For private schools, estimated needs amount to 31 million textbooks and 1
million teacher guides. Actual distribution during 1993/94 - 1995/96 amounted to 15.5 million
textbooks and 0.3 million teacher guides. Thus, although large gaps still remain, public sector
contributions are very important in supplying this critical input for raising private school quality.
Teacher Training and Equipment. No tabulated information exists on the magnitude
of public sector funding for training private school teachers and supplying teaching equipment to
private schools. Officials in charge of these activities at MOEC estimate that the public sector
allocates about 20 percent of its training activities to private teachers, and distributes also about
20 percent of purchased school equipment to private schools.
Operational Cost Subsidies. Public sector subsidization of the operational cost of
private schools is granted to both SLTP and Madrasah schools and is in the form of a flat amount
per classroom (uniform for all provinces and subsidized schools). Although data on the total
number of private schools' classrooms are not available for 1995/96 and 1996/97, their numbers
for 1993/94 and 1994/95 indicate that the operational cost support program covers between 50
percent and 55 percent of SLTP classrooms, and between 90 percent and 95 percent of Madrasah
classrooms, for a combined total of about 65 percent of all private school classrooms. The
program targets schools at the lower end of financing capacity.
The overall level of public sector support to private schools is estimated at about US$58
million, or 9 percent of total public spending (development and recurrent) on junior secondary
education. Salaries of seconded teachers make up about two thirds of the total cost, textbooks
and teachers guides 17 percent, operational cost subsidies 12 percent, while teacher training and
distribution of equipment are less important cost items.

3.     Description of Project Support for Private Schools
The project's financing for items such as teacher training and the provision of
instructional tools and library books would therefore complement GOI's own efforts. By raising
the standard of instruction at private schools, project funding for quality inputs would help
reduce the disparity between public and private education and encourage parents to view private
schooling as a worthwhile option. By stimulating demand for private schooling in this way, the
Government would limit the amount of public expenditure required to achieve its enrollment
targets.
Private schools in the project provinces would benefit directly from the following project
activities: (a) teacher in-service training through PKG and MGMP; (b) educational equipment;
(c) library books; (d) management training for headmasters. In addition, private schools would
benefit indirectly from such project activities as improved Kanwil management, monitoring, and
evaluation of schools and students as well as from the construction of public schools, whose
facilities are often used after-hours for private schooling through teacher associations.
4. Criteria For Assistance To Private Schools
a) Support for quality improvement to private schools will be in the form of reference and
library books, equipment, teacher training, and teacher and management upgrading programns.
b) Assistance in the form of in-kind educational inputs is preferable to grant for the following
reasons:
*  the above inputs in-kind can lead directly to the quality improvement sought, and to
the upgrading of the accreditation of the schools;
*  outputs or outcomes of assistance are more tangible;
*  assistance is easily monitored, such as number of teachers trained, books delivered,
equipment supplied, etc.;
*  distribution of assistance is more efficient;
* possible abuse of government assistance will be minimized.
c) Priority will be given to rural, remote, or poor private schools which have the potential to
increase enrollment and quality, especially self-help community private schools. Priority
will be given to viable private schools not receiving any other assistance from government.
d) Assistance will be awarded annually, and maintained if the school satisfies the above criteria.
e) Eligible private schools can apply to the head of MOEC district office (Kakandep) or to the
head of MOEC provincial office (Kakanwil) for government assistance.
f) Selection, review and decision processes will be undertaken by the Private School
Assistance Committee at Kanwil Office.
g) Recipient school will receive assistance annually, and can be extended upon satisfactory
performance.
h) The effectiveness of the private school assistance program would be monitored annually
using basic educational indicators in a structure format.

INNOVATIVE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION MODALITIES
Two Innovative JSE Modalities
1.    Confronting the need to expand the access to JSE and considering that are the poor and
the rural children who are not enrolled, the Government has designed and adopted non-traditional
JSE modalities, planned to deliver JSE education at a relatively low cost for children who have
had no access to schools either because of financial constraints, or lack of schools in their
(mainly rural) areas. Two major experimental programs are now in progress, the "Small (Kecil)
JSE School" and the "Open (Terbuka) JSE," which provide equal opportunities for JSE access to
all children, regardless of their socio-economic status and habitat. Non-traditional JSE strategies
have been used by other countries with low JSE coverage rates such as Thailand (classroom
experience, radio and self-study), Mexico (Telesecundaria, a TV-supported strategy) and
Zimbabwe (study centers). The following table shows how the Indonesian junior secondary
Kecil and Terbuka approaches compare with regular JSE schools:

The "Small JSE" (SMP Kecil)
2.     Concept. This is a reduced version (with 3 or 6 classrooms) of a regular JSE school
The innovation here is the dimension of the school which is made smaller to meet the localized
demand in remote areas. The Kecil modality appears in two dimensions, either with 3 (Type E)
or 6 (Type D) classrooms to fit the demand posed by primary school graduates wherever they do



Annex 9: Page 2 of 3                             105
not exceed 120 (3 classrooms of 40 students each) or they reach approximately 240 (6 classrooms
of 40 students each).
3.     The school name (kecil= small) derives from the fact that so far the Govemment's JSE
facilities are rather large schools categorized as Type A (27 classrooms), Type B (18 classrooms),
and Type C (9 classrooms). Schools with less than nine classrooms were considered wasteful as
the overhead expenses were high, and the student/teacher ratios fall considerably.  However,
with the JSE universalization drive, some compromising was needed on cost effectiveness. The
Government now allows establishment of "Small JSE" (less than nine classrooms) with the
understanding that such schools would eventually grow to reach the minimum standard size of
nine classrooms. It is worth noticing that the vast majority of rural private schools have less than
nine classrooms.
4.     Analysis and Implications.  As a regular JSE school the Kecil conforms to all
administrative and academic regulations and standards of this school level. The only exception
is that, given the small size classes, teachers would be asked to teach more than one subject.
This has been successfully applied in a number of countries with similar socio-economic and
geographical constraints. Considering that at present the majority of JSE teachers are unqualified
(below D3 level), there is hardly any compromise in this proposal. Some classes could be held
in the afternoon, using part-time teachers from the nearest regular JSE. The problem would be
reduced to transportation costs.
5.     Project Strategy. The proposed project supports de construction of 169 Kecil schools in
East Java, 124 of 6-classrooms and 45 of 3 classrooms. In NTT 108 Kecil schools will be built,
being 52 of 6 classrooms, and 56 of 3 classrooms. Criteria have been established for the location
of these schools, each one of them including a library and a multi-purpose room.
The "Open JSE" (SMIP Terbuka)
6.     Concept. The "Open JSE" (Terbuka=- open) program is conceived as a major alternative
for JSE school age children who fail to enter a regular public school because of low grades in
national (Ebtanas) examinations, financial constraints in entering a public or private school, and
lack of schools in the area. The Terbuka model can serve either young workers in urban contexts
or notably children in scattered rural areas. Terbuka students are free in the mornings, so that
they work (most of them help their parents in farming or home chores) and adjust their "school"
schedules to domestic and seasonal peculiarities. Originally (1979), the Terbuka model was
developed by the MOEC's educational technology agency Pustekkom (Center for
Communication Technology for Education and Culture), as an experimental project consisting of
five schools in five different provinces. In 1984, when it was decided that the model should be
expanded, the project was managed by a joint team from Pustekkom and Dikmenum, the
Directorate for General Secondary Education.. Sixty-six percent of the 59 existing SMP Terbuka
were created between 1993 and 1995.
7.     When sufficient demand is posed by primary school graduates in rural communities and
Terbuka is selected as the preferred strategy, a regular JSE in the area is selected to be the base
school responsible for developing a network of (an average of five) satellite "Learning Centers"
(TKB= Tempat Kegiatan Belajar) in the communities where children live. Each local "Learning
Center" comprehends from 5 to 30 students who have two major kinds of learning activities: (a)
tutored sessions (four afternoons in the Week) in the "Learning Center" under the supervision of a



106                              Annex 9: Page 3 of 3
local tutor who normally is a primary school teacher; and (b) afternoon classes twice a week in
the base school with regular teachers. During the tutored sessions students do their home
assignments in a primary school, community center or other premises in the village. Students
and teachers are supplied with specially prepared "modules," or illustrated booklets written to be
self-instructional so that students can learn either individually or in group. They are provided
also with structured distance learning media such as radio, audio cassettes, slides, video-
cassettes etc. There are no attendance fees, but students pay for transportation to the base school
and for the modules. "Learning Centers" are periodically visited by base school's teachers for
remedial or supporting classes.
8.     Analysis and Implications So far there is no systematic evaluation of the Terbuka
experience. There is consensus, however, that specific demand exists, the Terbuka concept is
viable and the modules are well designed.. Girls predominate at Terbuka and student age seems
to parallel the age of those attending regular JSE schools,. The cost of delivering Terbuka is 52
percent of a regular JSE school. Weaknesses lie mainly in the often low qualification of tutors
and the relatively high costs of transportation, which adversely affect attendance. A dropout rate
of almost 50 percent was observed in some cases between the first and second grade. Ways and
means to improve the quality and increase retention rates should be explored.
9.    It seems unrealistic to expect that the Terbuka program as it stands today, can produce
results comparable to the regular JSE schools. The majority of students attending this program
are bound to be those with low achievement in primary schools. Class attendance and contact
with qualified teachers is greatly reduced. Modules need to be complemented by other
instructional materials. Quality and efficiency of the Terbuka program could, however, benefit
from the following initiatives:
(a)    Local tutors should be carefully selected from among primary school teachers
and given special training during at least three weeks. At present; they attend
only a 5-day training course;
(b)   the learning environment of the "Learning Center" should be enriched with
resource materials (reading and reference books, dictionaries, audio-visual aids)
to support students in doing their home assignments and complementing the
modules;
(c)    chief of villages, parents, and community members should be mobilized to
ensure that students do attend regularly tutorial classes. This social network
proved to be a successful approach in expanding access to primary education;
(d)    students' and teachers' transportation costs could be partly subsidized by the
Government; and
(e)   the program length could possibly be extended by one year. Students attending
Terbuka programs have the advantage of being able to work productively during
the school period.
10.   Project Strategy. The proposed project supports the Terbuka model by (a) providing a
set of reading and reference books for each "Learning Center"; and (b) training tutors for the
"Learning Centers." These activities are expected to complement what other donors (mainly the
Asian Development Bank-ADB, UNDP and UNESCO) are doing to support the expansion and
improvement of the Terbuka model.

STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
A. Background
Families in the lower income deciles bear large financial burdens when their
children attend junior secondary school, relative to the total monthly family expenditures
(between 40% and 80%). These costs include school registration fees, tuition, parental
contributions, expenses for unifroms, transport, books and other costs. Furthermore,
children from poor families attending school incur additional costs in the form of foregone
income they could earn within or outside the household.  Simulations, based on
econometric modeling indicate that abolishing school fees would raise the transition rate
from primary schools to junior secondary by 12%; subsidizing all school-related direct
costs would raise the rate by 32%, primarily bringing into school those children, whose
parents value education, but cannot afford to pay.
GOI is currently operating a nationwide scholarship program covering some
27,000 SLTP students. The scholarship consists of financial support amounting to RP
25,000 per month for twelve months, an ample amount to cover all SLTP-related costs.
A new fund distribution mechanism has recently been implemented, with funds being
distributed through the post office. The fund provides scholarships to children of low
economic background and satisfactory academic achievement and personality. Within
these criteria, preference is given to children from remote areas, orphans and girls. The
fund is operating well, and though very limited, is much appreciated.
It is proposed to expand the scholarship program to cover a much larger target
group in the project area, so as to make a greater impact in bringing poor children into
SLTP.  The current program would be augmented along the following lines: (a)
scholarships would be provided to 30,000 students in East Java and 5,350 for NTT; (b)
unit costs would be set at Rp 300,000 per student per year; and (c) a simple monitoring
mechanism will be implemented to make sure that recipients receive their full allocation
and that selection criteria are followed. By project mid-term review, the entire program
will be evaluated for impact.

1. In consultation with teacher or headmaster, eligible students will apply for scholarships
to the head of MOEC district office (Kakandep) or to the head of MOEC provincial
office (Kakanwil).
2. The selection, reviewing, and awarding will be performed by the Scholarship
Committee at the Kanwil Office.
3. The scholarship recipient will receive a monthly stipend for twelve consecutive
months, starting from July until June of the following year. Funds will be made
available through the post office nearest to his/her school.
4. Stipend amount will be defined by MOEC and must be agreed upon by the Bank.
5. Scholarship funds will be disbursed by the Provincial Project's account and sent to the
head of Provincial Giro Office account, who will make them available to the recipients
through the Post Office.
6. Post Offices will report back to the head of the Provincial Giro Office, who will report
back to the Provincial Project Manager.

7. The effectiveness of the above distribution system will be monitored quarterly by
auditing the receipt forms filled out by the scholarship recipients. In addition, the
Scholarship Committee at Kanwil Office will monitor the system in the field by
interviewing a representative sample of scholarship recipients every year.

Terns of Reference
Central Proeram Coordination Unit
Objectives. The Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) will have three
objectives: (a) it will monitor overall progress, and ensure that project implementation (as it
unfolds through the Annual Work Plan and Budget process) is in accordance with project
objectives and agreed project criteria, rules and guidelines; (b) it will guide the provinces and
provide (or locate the sources of) the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the project
implements as planned; and (c) it will cany out central program activities that may affect more
than one project.
Composition Existing staff in Dikmenum, augmented as necessary by project-
financed consultants will be at the core of the management team.
Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities. The Director of Dikmenum will head the Central
Program Coordination Unit and coordinate the overall program of expanding junior secondary
education. An important function of the Central Program Coordination Unit will be to monitor
implementation achievements in the different provinces through progress reports and
monitoring indicators and to keep the Government and the Bank informed in this respect.
Dikmenum's role as the national level program coordination unit will be distinctly
different from the roles of the provincial (Kanwil) offices. As a program coordinator, its role
will be that of oversight and facilitation -- not implementation. Dikmenum will therefore: (a)
ensure that provincial implementation focuses on achieving their agreed project objectives as
measured through the agreed project-specific monitoring indicators; (b) assist the provinces in
establishing appropriate annual work plans and monitor that these are carried out in accordance
with agreed priorities, criteria and procedures; (c) help ensure timely preparation of regional
project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information systems
(both financial and substantive) for use at the Kanwil level as well as at the National level; (e)
disseminate information to the provinces in order to highlight promising regional approaches in
the design of Annual Work Plans and Budgets; and (f) identify or provide technical assistance
to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed project-specific criteria, rules and
regulations.
Linkages to the Provincial Teams. Dikmenum will also help design and implement
national and provincial capacity building plans as the project unfolds. This will include assisting
the provinces establish appropriate project information systems and procedures on the principle
that relevant information from one system will feed into the next system, and that there will be
meaningful back and forth flow of information across administrative levels.



142                           Annex 22: Page 4 of 7
Supervsory Functions. Dikmenum will have a procurement supervisory function to
help ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with the stipulations of the Loan
Agreement and the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The CPCU will appoint procurement
specialists to provide training and technical assistance to PPIUs in the preparation of
procurement documents and to review documents from the provinces to ensure that they are in
line with project procurement guidelines.

Provincial Proiect InWlementation Unit
Objectives. In order to get the project effectively implemented, the projects will be
executed through existing line authorities at the Kanwil level. There will be no expansion of
staff positions: existing positions will be used, and/or converted temporarily for project use as
and when necessary. Similarly, there will be no structural changes in the administrative system.
Team, Organization and Responsibilities. Project-specific task forces,
commensurate with the focus and specificity of each of the provincial projects will be
established as necessary. Each of these task forces will be composed of existing staff at the
Kanwil-level, and -- where appropriate -- at the Kandep level. These task forces will grow and
contract as necessary during project implementation.
KaKanwil in each Province will be responsible for project implementation. To lend a
focal point to the proposed implementation arrangements, a Provincial Project Implementation
Unit (PPIU) under the overall leadership of KaKanwil, will be established in each Province.
This PPIU, managed by the head of the secondary education group (Kabid-Dikmenum) or a
Dikmenum staff memnber working under his/her supervision, will form the core of the proposed
implementation arrangement. The manager of the PPI will be responsible for the day-to-day
management of the project and will report to KaKanwil on all matters pertaining to the project.
He/she will also keep the project authorities in Jakarta (Dikmenum) informed about progress,
including any events that threatened progress, such as the lack of human or financial resources
to resolve emerging problems. If necessary, one full-time monitoring officer and one or two
support staff will assist the manager of the PPIU in keeping track of implementation progress.
The PPIU will be assisted by a technical resource group in each province for the
duration of the project. The duties of this group, including that of consultants, will be to assist
in technical analysis of sector issues, prepare annual plans and detailed project designs,
troubleshoot on an ad-hoc basis, and conduct staff training/guidance. The technical resource
group will have access to other staff resources (including those from IKIPs/Universities) with
specialized project-related skills.
Tasks. Under the PPrU, there will typically be the following five divisions to carry out
the following functions: (a) Procurement and Civil Works; (b) Quality Improvement;
(c) Accounting; (d) Progress Monitoring; and (e) Supervision and Evaluation.
Relationship with the CPCU. Each Provincial Project Implementation Unit will
work in close liaison with the Central Program Coordination Unit in Jakarta. All official
project correspondence with the Bank will be channelled through DGPSE, except as
specifically delegated by the Director-General.
Advisory Committee. A Provincial Project Advisory Committee (see separate terms
of reference) will provide overall implementation guidance to the PPIU.

PROJECT PROGRESS MONITORING AND REPORTING
Introduction
1.    This Annex describes how project progress will be monitored and impact will be
evaluated. Reporting on monitoring and evaluation results will be done within the context of
Bank progress reporting. Project progress reporting will be on a semi-annual cycle. The half-
yearly progress report will cover the project status (physical progress, financial and
performance status) and will include status of the performance indicators. The program report
will be prepared in advance of the half-yearly Bank supervision missions. Details of progress
reporting are described here.
Project Monitoring Indicators
2.    Project status will be monitored through performance and output indicators (see
Annex 13). Project progress and performance will be monitored on the basis of several types
of indicators:
(a) Progress Monitoring Against the Implementation Plan
Annex 23 (Implementation Plan) gives information on the milestones, dates and tasks
to be carried out during the implementation process. At each supervision mission,
these will be reviewed, their status assessed, and the Plan updated to reflect progress.
The updated version of the Implementation Plan would indicate actual versus planned
implementation and show adjustments made accordingly.
(b) Ouantitative Indicators
In each progress report and at each supervision, the indicators as listed in Annex 13
will be reviewed. The actual against planned data will be filled out by the PIUs, and
will be discussed during supervision.
(c) Qualitative Indicators
At each supervision mission, an evaluation will be undertaken by the supervision
team of progress regarding qualitative indicators. The PIUs will mention, in the
progress report, the status of these indicators, which will then form the basis for the
supervision discussion. For each indicators, specific evidence of progress should be
provided.

Format of Progress Report
3.    The half-yearly progress report should be organized in the following way and should
include the following sections:
(a) A narrative section describing progress of each of the components: Issues that
have arisen, problems, delays, suggested changes, decisions made in the last year should be
included for each relevant component.
(b) An update of the indicators: Actual status against planned implementation,
quantitative and qualitative indicators.
(c) A section listing the recommendations and agreements made during the last Bank
supervision mission and actions or present position.
(d) A list of all contract activities expected during the next year and half-year.
(e) A set of tables covering the following:
*  Expenditures to date (SAR plan and current status) shown by category of
expense and by component and status of civil works (number of contracts,
location, type of school covered and cost for each contract);
*  Training activities (SAR plan and current status): number and type of
training courses, number of participants, duration of each course, cost of
each course;
*  Status of Technical Assistance contracts (foreign and local): number of
person/months planned and currently used, costs of contracts and status of
disbursement.
(f) A report from the auditing consultants (whenever available).
Additional Reports and Reviews
4.     A few special reviews will also be carried out during project implementation, to further
support monitoring of progress. These reviews will be carried out by independent external
consultants and will be managed by the Project Coordination Unit in Dikmenum.
(a) Survey, in preparation for mid-term, to evaluated progress in improving management
skills and processes in Kanwils and Kandeps;
(b) Annually, a review of expenditures of government funds by private schools;
(c) Annually, monitoring of the effectiveness of the scholarship fund selection and
distribution; and
(d) At mid term, a review of the effectiveness of the contract teachers program.
Supervision Schedule
5.     Supervision missions will be held twice a year, during the project implementation period.
A planned mission schedule is listed in Annex 25. The mid-term review mission will consist of
a more thorough review; this mission will review overall progress since the beginning of the
implementation period, and will evaluate the need for adjustments or restructuring of the project
for the remainder of the project period.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL AUDITS
Objectives
1.    To ensure the accountability to the Government, the World Bank, the participant
communities and all stakeholders involved, a Technical Audit of the various project components
would be conducted annually (see para. 5.1 1). The goal of the technical audits would be to provide
impartial assessment of quality and efficiency of the methods and procedures employed by PIUs in
the provinces and the PCU at central MOEC in the implementation of the project and the impact of
this at school and administrative levels.
Team Composition, Qualification and Leadership
2.    Independence and Expertise. The technical audit would be carried out by independent
consultants with no association with the project and with qualifications and experience in: (a) the
operations and management of junior secondary schools, including open junior secondary schools;
(b) teacher training strategies and assessment; (c) use of library books and other educational
resources; (d) use of other instructional materials; (e) student examinations and performance
assessment strategies, techniques and dissemination; (f) location and adequacy of school
construction; (g) selection and management of scholarship program; (h) science education at junior
secondary level; (i) development of social marketing instruments; and (j) provincial, district, and
school management practices.
3.    Qualification of Team Members. The Technical Audit Team (TAT) members must
have the academic qualification and demonstrated expertise in one or more of the areas identified
above (para. 2). To this end, they would be required to submit: (a) a signed curriculum vitae, and
a copy of major diplomas; (b) a letter of acceptance to act as member of the TAT; and evidence of
no commitment to other job during the period of the contract.
4.     Team Leadership. Even though characterized by an interdisciplinary approach the
Technical Audit team would be required to have a leader to coordinate the operation, its efficiency
and quality of the final products.
Scope and Procedures
5.    The overall purpose of the technical audit is to identify those processes and outcomes
which are not easily captured by the annual missions or financial audits (which they are not
supposed to replace). The following activities can be mentioned as typical examples of the
concerns addressed by TAT: the educational interaction at classroom level and the best utilization
of teacher's time; what and how students are learning in classroom; how educational resource
materials are being used in everyday school life as a complement to classroom activities; the
development of the science education study in the selected. Their evaluation would be guided by



156                              Annex 27: Page 2 of 3
would be guided by the project's performance indicators. schools of East Java and NTT; how and
with what results the "Open" SMP are working in the rural areas; what instruments (and with
what success) are being developed to implement the social marketing strategy.
Description of Tasks
6.     Regular and Open SMPs. The team would assess how effectively the different sizes of
regular SMPs operate in both the rural and urban areas, especially with reference to the types of
physical facilities and teachers provided to the schools. A detailed study of the open SMPs
would also be made to assess their effectiveness in providing junior secondary education, and to
identify the most appropriate ways of providing this type of education in a cost-effective manner.
7.     Teacher Training Strategies and Assessment. The team needs to assess how PKG
training has changed to incorporate lessons recently learned and new strategies developed to
ensure that delivery strategies are modified appropriately to fit variety of conditions in the project
provinces. These strategies could include the following points: the participation of headmasters
to the training undergone by their teachers as a requirement for better feedback, supervision and
assistance when back in school; the establishment of a follow-up process to make teacher training
a continuum rather than a one-shot operation; inclusion of instruction on textbook use and use of
the new instructional material (including the library) in the new training.
8.     Use of Educational Resources. Three types of books (reading, reference and
supplementary) are to be distributed under the project, and teachers and headmasters are expected
to participate in their selection. The TAT will verify that books distributed matched the
expressed choices of teachers and headmasters. Also, their adequacy in terms of attractiveness
and interest for young readers, as well as their actual uses by students and teachers, need to be
assessed by the TAT. This survey will include the reading material provided to SMP Terbuka,
and particularly their user friendliness. The use of educational technology for reference and
teaching would also be examined carefully to evaluate their potential use in the country.
9.     Use of Instructional Material. The TAT will survey the distribution of instructional
material to insure that teachers and headmasters were consulted prior to purchase, that the
received material met their expectation, and is effectively used in classroom activities. How the
use of this material is positively affecting student learning should be assessed in loco.
10.    Student Assessment System. The TAT will focus its analysis on how student
assessment is conducted in classroom, data reported to provincial level, and feedback provided
back to schools and classrooms for the benefit of each teacher and the corresponding students.
Analytical capacity at Kanwil level to study these data and managerial capacity to disseminate
them are key issues of interest, as well as the use of these assessments by teachers to change and
improve their teaching methods.
11.    Construction Site and Adequacy. For each province, the TAT will verify that schools,
and dormitories for students and teachers built under the project were consistent with the agreed
criteria for site selection. Adequacy of these constructions should be the object of observation
and dialogue with teachers, students and communities. Three- and six-classroom schools in the
rural areas constitute an innovation that deserves careful assessment by the TAT.



Annex 27: Page 3 of 3                             157
12.    Scholarship Program. The team will verify in their visits to schools that students were
awarded scholarships under the program according to agreed criteria and conditions, and
particularly the wide advertisement of the awarding processes. This will be done through a
review of sample award documents, documentation related to the flow of information among
concerned parties, and a spot check of recipients to ensure that the full scholarship is actually
received and used as intended.
13.    Science Education Study. The TAT will verify that the several components necessary
for the success of the study have been organized as specified in the detailed Terms of Reference
provided for the implementation of the study, and that consistency is maintained from year to
year. It will also ensure that the proper methodology is being followed for the analysis of final
data. The TAT will also evaluate the utility of the different packages of equipment provided to
the different categories of schools with respect to their contribution to improvements in science
teaching, cost, and ease of use, maintenance and replacement.
14.    Management Practices and Changes. The TAT will ensure that the proper staff are
receiving the technical and managerial training at provincial, district, and school levels, and that
trained staff receive posting consistent with their newly acquired skills. It will also ensure that
equipment provided under the project is actually used as intended.
Contract and Assistance
15.    A contract will be signed between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at Dikmenum
and the selected audit team for a month a year starting in 1997. The PCU will be responsible for
TAT's schedule and follow-up. In the provinces the two PIUs will provide the assistance
required for a timely and adequate schedule of visits and contacts, including remote project areas.
Duration and Expected Product
16.   The TAT will survey implementation's progress in the second, third and fourth years of
the project, and each survey is expected to be realized in a month. The TAT will provide its
report to the PCU, the PIUs and the World Bank for review and comments before issuing a final
document. The TAT will also ensure that implementation of recommendations issued by PCU or
the Bank after analysis of the progress reports are actually implemented in the following year.
The first audit shall not start before 18 months after the project started.
