MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Togo for SDR 7.6
million (US$9.7 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms and help finance an agricultural extension project.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Togo accounted for 302 of GDP and about 30%
of exports in 1985, and employed 8OX of the labor force. Although there are few
natural constraints on agriculture, real sectoral growth in the past decade (2.7Z
p.a) has been principally due to expansion in area under cultivation, and has just
kept up with population growth.  The productivity of the smallholder subsector
remained stable and markedly below its potential due to: (a) poor price incentives,
particularly for export crops; (b) limited allocation of funds by Government to
support necessary services for the sector; (c) ill-defined strategy for agriculture
which has permitted numerous uncoordinated agricultural projects but which has not
improved extension and research services in aggregate and (d) lack of adequate
technical advice of immediate use to farmers. Agriculture has been allocated only
5Z of Government's annual budget, mostly for salaries, leaving little for
operations. As a consequence, a sustainable delivery system for services has not
been developed. During two structural adjustment programs, Government began to
redress the basic problems of the sector, producing a New Agricultural Strategy for
Rural Development in 1985 which the Bank has actively supported. Government has
also increased budgetary allocation to the sector, raised producer prices of export
crops, liberalised foodcrop export marketing, and begun reform of export crops
marketing institutions. These essential reforms need now to be complemented with
actions to improve agricultural services with extension as a main priority,
followed by support for research, seed production, credit and input supply. IDA
would assist Government in this respect with the present project that would
organize and upgrade extension services, and a further project now in the
preparation stage that would deal with complementary support services.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would strengthen existing
extension services in areas of four of the country's five regional directorates
(DRDRs) where external financing is not presently involved. It would build on
experience acquired in one year of pilot testing of the principles of the Training
and Visit System (T & V) in the Togolese context. The project would improve
extension staff organization, ensure adequate training of personnel and improve the
current weak links between extension and research. The project would also develop
an institutional framework within the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) to better
define extension priorities and programs, guide the work of regional extension
staff and ensure consistency in the approaches adopted by existing projects. It
would support an institutional development process to: (i) improve the ability of
the General Directorate for Rural Development within the Ministry of Rural
Development (DGDR(HDR) to organize and provide technical assistance to its own
field staff and (ii) strengthen the extension system through more effective
mechanisms for setting priorities, allocating resources and managing finances.

4.        Project Description.  The proposed project would introduce the main
elements of the T & V system including: (a) systematic visits to groups of farmers;
(b) regular training of extension staff; (c) improved linkages between extension
and research; td) proper monitoring and evaluation; and (e) efficient financial
management systems at both national and regional levels. The project would also
provide technical assistance to MDR to help in establishing the management systems,
and procedures for continuously upgrading technical messages. IDA financing would
be made available for investments in equipment, transport, civil works,
internationally recruited personnel, training, and part of incremental operating
costs. Government would cover local salaries and an increasing portion of
operating costs. The project is estimated to cost US$12.6 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$7.6 million (60Z). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Togo
are given in Schedules C & D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No.6601-TO dated April 27, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part of
Government's agricultural sector development strategy and is closely related to the
extension efforts of the ongoing Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas
(Cr. 1302-TO) and CocoalCoffee Project (Cr. 945-TO). IDA has assisted in the
formulation of this strategy and continues to support it. It is also related to
two structural adjustment programs which specifically call for a reorganization and
rehabilitation of key agricultural services. Implementation of Government's policy
for seeking agricultural growth will depend on simple well tested research
recommendations reaching Togolese farmers. This can only be done by improving the
current linkages between research and extension as well as the efficiency of the
outreach effort itself. Through its example, the proposed project would also
contribute to Government's objectives of restructuring the various extension
services currently financed in other projects, with the goal of eventually elimina-
ting the current dispersion of efforts. IDA has significant experience in the
agricultural extension field which can be applied effectively in Togo. IDA's
continuous involvement both financially and through the provision of technical
advice is therefore important for the success of Togo's agricultural strategy.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Direction de la Cooperation et de la Vulgarisation (DCV) DGDR would review the
efficiency of the new organization of the DRDRS two years after effectiveness and
that any needed improvements would be made; that the annual adaptive research
program would be implemented on the basis of contracts; that local procurement
methods for equipment and supplies would be subject to some modifications required
to make them acceptable to the Association; that counterpart funds would be made
available in a timely manner; and that an agreed program will be implemented, based
on a study to be completed by December 31, 1988, to improve the integration of
women in extension activities and promote their participation in development.
Conditions of effectiveness include finalizing audits of DRDR accounts, introducing
an improved financial management system and having internationally recruited staff
in post as well as the head of DCV.
7.        Justification.  Benefits under the project would derive from MDR's
improved ability to plan and manage its outreach activities which would make
existing personnel more effective in the field. These benefits have already been
shown in pilot actions in terms of significant increases in agricultural production

and productivity. As the technology to be transfered would focus on simple, low
risk changes in agricultural methods, the project would have direct benefits for
the poorer segments of the population as well as for the better off. Given the
difficulty in attributing a precise level of benefits to an extension project, due
to the large number of other influential factor# involved in crop production, an
ERR has not been calculated. MDR's annual operating costs would increase by 15Z in
constant prices in the post-project period over pre-project expenditure. This is
the minimum deemed necessary to got the extension services to an acceptable level
of efficiency, and repr4sents a cost/ha of cultivated land which is similar to
other extension projects currently being implemented in West Africa. Host of the
post-project expenditure is for non-personnel costs thus fitting in with
Government's structural adjustment program which calls for increasing the
proportion of non-personnel costs in the budget.
8.        Risks.  Possible project risks are the ones usually associated with
extension projects: inadequate budgetary support. ineffective management, low
adoption rates and slow build-up of applicable technology through research. The
project has been designed to focus on these risks: to complement actions Government
has already taken to increase budget allocations to the sector, the Special Account
to be set up would improve the project's cash flow, and the new organization,
training, M & E and financial management would improve overall project management.
Pilot projects have demonstrated that suitable technologies exist and have been
adopted by farmers. In addition, a sizeable body of existing research results is
undergoing pre-extension testing and should continue to supply the project with new
extension messages during the project period.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the articles of agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
