                         The global development objective is to limit land degradation and to safeguard critical ecosystem functions through community-driven SLM activities that improve
                         agrosylvopastoral management and increase vegetation cover while securing livelihoods and global environmental benefits (i.e., reduced sedimentation of waterways,
                         improved interconnectedness and integrity of ecosystems, enhanced carbon storage rates, and increased opportunities for biodiversity conservation).

                         The Disbursement rate of project stands at 79.46%. It was noticed a real improvement in term of investments component and capacity building. A part of the most important activities
                         of project are under implementation. The Watershed Management Plans have been finally validated in the 4 project's sites (Greiguel, Beilouga, Hodh El Gharbi and Tengharada).
                         Those activities are linked to the to the watershed scheme. Given the rainy season, some sites will be not accessible and the investments activities will be delayed for 3 months, and

                         given the approaching closing date of September 30, 2011 the Government requested a extension of the project. The project will be restructured to (i) reallocate the resource of credit
                         proceeds and extend its closing date by at least 6 months to allow the activities to be completed and finalized.

                         In the first Watershed zone (Tengharada), the political issue was solved and consequently, the Watershed Scheme has been validated by the beneficiaries and its implementation

                         started 2 months ago. The project will be restructured to (i) reallocate the resource of credit proceeds and extend its closing date by at least 6 months to complete the activities. With
                         this second and last extension of closing date the PIU will be urged during the next implementation Support mission to complete the activities. The investments funds component is
                         disbursing well and the investments are directly oriented to the beneficiaries.
                         The safeguards measures with the sub-projects have been satisfactory and financial management and procurement have improved and is satisfactory and there is outstanding audit.
