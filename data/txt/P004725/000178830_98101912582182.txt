THAILAND
I.   ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01     Until the initial supplies of natural gas became available to the
domestic market in September 1981, Thailand had been almost completely
dependent on imports for its petroleum requirements. Oil products consumption
at 200,000 barrels/day accounted for about 72% of Thailand's 1980 total energy
requirements and 99% were imported either as crude or products. The oil
import bill at 58,700 million baht ($2,560 million) represented 44% of export
earnings, and left the Thai economy vulnerable to future movements in world
energy prices.
1.02     Despite this heavy dependence on imported oil there are a number of
encouraging developments which give grounds to expect an improvement in
Thailand's energy prospects in the future. On the demand side, the growth of
energy consumption has started to fall in relation to GDP and is now at 1.2:1,
following regular increases in energy prices; demand has (at least
temporarily) levelled off for most major oil products. On the supply side the
series of discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand has resulted in establishing
large natural gas reserves. Exploration activity has increased, and in the
past year modest discoveries of oil have been made.
1.03     The availability of sizeable volumes of natural gas will have an
important structural impact on Thailand's energy situation during the 1980s.
Natural gas not only will replace large quantities of fuel oil consumed in the
generation of thermo-electric power but will also open up the possibility of
expanding and upgrading the market for natural gas to the petrochemical and
fertiliser industries and eventually the consideration of gas export
options. At the same time the displacement of fuel oil will have important
implications for Thailand's future refinery investment program which will need
to be aimed at reducing petroleum product imbalances resulting from the growth
of naturaloas in the domestic market. The extraction of liquified petroleum
gas (LPG) - from the gas stream, the subject of the proposed Bank loan, will
bring further benefits to the economy by substituting for imports, stemming
the consumption of diesel and kerosene through expansion of LPG supply into
the transportation and residential sectors, and by providing valuable
feedstocks upon which to base a petrochemical industry.
Energy Resources
1.04     Indigenous resources have accounted for 25-30% of total energy
1/ Natural gas contains methane, ethane, propane, butane and small amounts of
liquid hydrocarbon products forming natural gasoline. Propane and butane may
be recovered as individual products or mixed together as liquified petroleum
gas (LPG).



-2-
consumption during the second half of the 1970's with fuelwood/charcoal,
hydroelectricity, bagasse and lignite typically forming 13%, 7%, 7% and 3%
respectively. There are minor exports of fuelwood/charcoal and minor imports
of hydro and coal.  Domestic oil production is negligible, but recent
discoveries give hope that significant reserves may be detected. Both hydro
and lignite have significant potential for increase, and as referred to above,
the potential role of natural gas is substantial.
(a) Non-hydrocarbon Resources
1.05     Total hydroelectric potential on Thailand's rivers is about 8,010 MW
of which two-thirds appear to be economic.  Of this 1,341 MW I' are in
operation and 2,000 MW are planned for the 1980s. Development of the
potential on the international rivers (Salween and Mekong), about 25,000 MW,
must await international agreements. The major lignite prospects are at Mae
Moh with reserves of 650 million tons. Mae Moh is being developed through
IBRD/ADB assistance. The other lignite reserves, Krabi and L2 together 120
million tons, are relatively small.  Likewise the geothermal -7 and uranium
reserves appear to be small. Fuelwood/charcoal reserves, although large, are
becoming difficult to exploit because of deforestation.
(b) Hydrocarbon Resources
1.06     Exploration for hydrocarbons is running at a high level (15 to 20
wells per year) and gas reserve figures are frequently being revised
upwards.  Particularly significant are the Union Oil _/ and Texas Pacific4/
gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand, reflecting maturity in the drilling
there. Shell and Esso (Khorat) have onshore licences where the first results
are beginning to be known.  Four 5/ other licences have been awarded in recent
months. In view of the drilling activity there is every reason to expect
known reserves to increase.
1.07     Up to June 1981, 78 exploration and delineation wells had been
drilled in the Gulf of Thailand, of which 41 showed significant accumulations
of natural gas and condensate and 4 have indicated small deposits of crude
oil. Proven and probable gas reserves amount to 20 trillion cubic feet (tcf),
of which 4 tcf are proven, (see Annex 1.01), and could ultimately sustain
production of over 3,000 million cubic feet per day (MMSCFD), equivalent to 27
1/       Excluding Nam Ngum in Laos, which is mainly for Thai needs.
2/       Being investigated with Bank technical assistance.
3/       Union Oil operates in two groups, with Seapec and Moeco.
4/       Texas Pacific, Canadian Superior and Highland.
5/       Esso (Udong), Pecten, Philips, TerraMarine.  Triton's earlier
concession is suspended pending establishment of the joint
Thai/Malaysian authority, and Amoco and Sun concessions are suspended
pendlng resolution of the offshore boundaries with Kampuchea and
Vietnam.



-3-
million tons of oij1equivalent per year, for about 20 years. A group of
twelve gas fields - discovered by Union Oil have estimated reserves of 11 tcf
(2.6 tcf proven), approximately 425km. offshore. The first natural gas came
onshore from Union Oil's Erawan field in September 1981 and is flowing at 160
MMSCFD, equivalent to 1.5 million tons of oil per annum; before the end of
1982 throughput will have reached 250 MMSCFD. Negotiations between PTT and
Union Oil for a second contract have recently been finalised, covering a
further five fields and an additional 300-400 MMSCFD.  The Texas Pacific group
has discovered a further 9 tcf of natural gas some 200 km. south of Union's
discoveries.  Consideration is being given to the possible export of this gas.
1.08     Onshore there are three small oil fields in the Fang 2/ area of
northern Thailand which are yielding about 15,000 tons per year, the 1981
Shell discovery in the northern plains - possibly 300,000 tons by 1985 rising
to 500,000 tons/year by 1990, and some 1 tcf of gas indicated by Esso in the
North East. Ultimate figures could be much higher, but it is premature to
speculate by how much. Oil shale reserves are known to exist at Mae Sot, near
the Burmese border, and amount to 2,500 million tons. They are being
investigated with assistance from the German government. Other known oil
shale reserves are small.
1.09     Given the high success ratio Thailand is reviewing its licensing
arrangements and tax system and is considering changing to a production
sharing basis. The decision on whether to adopt new legislation is expected
during 1982.
Energy Demand Patterns
1.10     Over the last 20 years commercial energy consumption (petroleum,
hydro and lignite) has increased on average by 12% per annum from 1.1 million
tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1960 to 11.0 million toe in 1980. CDP has
increased over the period by 7.5% per annum. The energy/GDP growth
relationship has fallen from 1.85 to 1 in the early period to 1.2 to 1 over
the last five years, attributable primarily to the sharp increases in the
price of energy. Petroleum has provided 60-70% of total energy supply over
the last decade.
1.11     The other major energy source, fuelwood and charcoal, has declined in
importance as people have shifted to other fuels and as wood sources
themselves have become depleted and scarce. The difficulty of gathering
fuelwood has become an important problem, particularly in the northeast.
1.12     Thailand's commercial energy statistics give a reasonable guide to
the use being made of energy, although recent trends are distorted through
mixing of products. Transportation consumes 31% of total consumption, a
figure which makes it a target for conservation. Electricity consumes 22% and

substantial steps are being taken by the power sector towards substituting
fuel oil with lignite, natural gas and hydro power.
1.13     Fuel oil, diesel and gasoline together represent 37% of total
petroleum products consumption. For the time being some 95% of products are
imported, mainly fuel oil, LPG and diesel, whereas other refinery products are
broadly in balance. Over the past ten years demand for fuel oil and LPG has
been growing more strongly than other products. Consumption patterns will
change as natural gas is introduced in large quantities (particularly
replacing fuel oil) and as the Government takes further steps to influence
petroleum demand through pricing and other measures.

Thailand's Energy Future
1.14    The structural transition to a completely different energy economy
started when natural gas came on stream in the third quarter of 1981. The
large gas reserves have opened up the possibility of much greater energy
independence, with gas and gas products being used over time for power
generation, industry and as fuel for motor vehicles and fishing boats, cooking
and lighting; furthermore gas can be used as feedstock for a fertiliser and
petrochemical industry and could possibly be exported. The introduction of
natural gas as a fuel is however bringing potential problems of refinery
imbalances whose resolution will require important investment decisions in the
near term. Sufficient gas has already been found to provide for Thailand's
projected gas needs for the next two decades. In the short term gas will
primarily be used as a substitute for fuel oil in the power sector. Studies
have recently been carried out to investigate new markets such as the LPG-
markets covered by the proposed project. In this fluid environment energy
balance forecasts are inevitably tentative but it is reasonable to assume as
shown below that the availability of natural gaK will result in a leveLing of
oil imports which would have major balance of payments implications.

1.15    One of the important consequences of the development of Thailand's
indigenous energy is the effect on the refinery products balance. Gas,
lignite and hydro all displace fuel oil particularly in power generation and
inrindustry. To a lesser extent gas and LPG will also displace gasoline and
smaller quantities of kerosene and diesel. A Bank-financed study, carried out
by Lummus (consultants, USA) evaluated the implications of natural gas on the
refinery expansion program. The results of the study indicate the need for
enhancing diesel capacity and minimising gasoline production.
1.16    The Bank's latest forecast of refinery balance and imports and exports
is as below:

-6-
The Bank's more detailed supply and demand projections, yPich are set out in
more detail in Annex 1.04, are based on recent PTT, NEA - , Shell and Esso
projections and exclude the possible expansion of the TORC refinery. These
projections take account particularly of the experience of 1980 and 1981 (when
gasoline, kerosene, and diesel consumption fell), and the expected substi-
tution of LPG for various fuels over the next ten years. They are also based
on production of 800 MMSCFD of natural gas by 1990. The projections show that
the most significant imbalance is a deficit of diesel supplies and kerosene.
An appropriate solution could be construction of conversion facilities. An
alternative worth considering is arranging suitable medium-term purchase
contracts.  Other measures such as price incentives, c~7servation and use of
alternative fuels in buses, local trucks and pick-ups - are also desirable to
reduce diesel oil demand and to encourage LPG to substitute for kerosene.
With the refinery configuration indicated, production and consumption of other
refinery products will come close to being in balance. The immediate
decisions are important, as surplus gasoline is already forcing lower refinery
runs which in turn are increasing the importation of diesel and fuel oil; in
the longer term the problems of an unsuitable refinery configuration could
inhibit petroleum substitution. A study on petroleum prices, including the
implications on refinery balances, is to be undertaken as part of the
structural adjustment loan and is referred to further in paragraph 1.24. This
study is expected to recommend price measures, including better refinery
margins for diesel oil, to help ensure that future refinery investments more
closely match the national needs.
Institutional Framework
1.17     The energy sector organization in Thailand is complex.  Although
NESDB (Prime Minister's Office) and NEA have responsibility for overall
planning and investment decisions, they are not in a position to exercise
close coordination. The energy planning and energy policy formulation
functions are scattered among several Government ministries and agencies. In
addition several committees have been set up to deal with energy and petroleum
related policies. This makes it difficult to control and co-ordinate energy
sector activities and policies in a systematic manner, with a consequential
risk that they may not be effectively integrating their plans and policies.
The Government is aware of the problem and has, as a first step selected NEA
to undertake, in consultation with other concerned agencies, the
responsibility of monitoring energy sector studies in progress, evaluating
those which are completed, proposing appropriate recommendations for
implementation and identifying areas for further investigation. The NEA will
complete the initial stock-taking of these studies and prepare, by September
1982, a medium-term energy strategy to achieve the plan objectives and
targets. Subsequently, this mechanism for policy co-ordination will be
retained on a continuous basis so that changes in the energy sector are taken
into account in further strategy formulation and implementation.

1.18     Government departments.  The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) of
the Ministry of Industry handles all technical and legal aspects of all
minerals including oil and gas exploration and exploitation licensing
arrangements and is also responsible for non-power lignite mining. The
Ministry of Industry is also responsible for setting ex-refinery prices and
taxation policy, and for PTT. The Ministry of Commerce sets margins between
ex-refinery and retail prices and sets minimum oil stocks. The Ministry of
Defence has its own energy department and its own energy activities include
management of small oilfields and a small refinery at Fang and ownership and
operation of the BangChak refinery. (According to the PTT Act (as amended)
the remaining Ministry of Defence energy assets will transfer to PTT in 1985).
The Ministry of Science Technology and Energy is responsible for NEA and for
non-conventional energy. The Prime Minister's office and the Cabinet take a
direct interest in determining retail prices of petroleum products. The Prime
Minister's office is also responsible for the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT), the largest state-owned enterprise. In addition to power
generation, EGAT is responsible for exploration and development of lignite for
use in power plants. Retail distribution of electricity under the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA) are controlled by the Ministry of Interior. Other
institutions involved include the Budget Bureau, controlling budgetary aspects
of locally funded costs.
1.19     Petroleum Sector Organization.  The private sector has had a major
role in the exploration, refining and marketing of oil products in Thailand.
The only major state enterprise in the oil and gas sector is PTT which is
responsible for natural gas transmission, LPG and petrochemicals, and is a
major refiner and marketer. (See Chapter 4 for more details on PTT). The
roles of the public and private sectors have historically been complementary,
there being little competition surrounding their respective roles in the
sector, although the division is breaking down rapidly in refining and
marketing. Further discussion of the exploration and production, refining and
marketing activities of the sector is given in Annex 1.06.
1.20     A National Petroleum Policy Committee (NPPC) was appointed in March
1981 by the Cabinet. Its function is to set policies and targets for the
development of the-petroleum industry and the pricing of petroleum products.
The NPPC has the authority to appoint sub-committees as it deems necessary.
It is chaired by the Prime Minister, with the assistance of a Deputy Prime
Minister acting as Deputy Chairman. It has 15 other permanent members,
representing the principal Government departments and public energy
corporations. The various functions of the NPPC subcommittees and other
committees in the sector are described in Annex 1.06.
Government Policies
(i)    Energy Planning
1.21     The Government attaches high priority to formulating an integrated
and consistent strategy for energy development in Thailand. The major goals
of the fifth development plan emphasise the need for a decline in petroleum
imports, both by demand management and conservation measures, reducing
domestic energy use and increasing the domestic supplies of alternative energy
sources like natural gas, lignite, and hydro power. The plan stipulates



-8-
further that the Government will support research and development in new
domestic energy resources, especially renewable resources such as geothermal,
solar, alcohol and wind. However, these are not expected to have much impact
on the structure of domestic energy production before 1986.
1.22     A number of technical and policy related studies, many of them in
connection with various Bank projects, have been undertaken. The Bank's
energy sector review, the gas utilization study and the long-term refinery
expansion study have all been completed. The refinery study has enabled
proposals by the TORC group to be put into the proper context, and is expected
to lead to a satisfactory refinery configuration. The gas utilization study
confirmed the gas separation plant project and outlined the basic
considerations for the petrochemical study which is now in progress and the
recently completed ammonia study. An energy master plan study (UNDP/ADB) is
ex)ected to consolidate much of the above. The Bank has also recently
coripleted an alcohol fuel study. A pipeline strategy study (Italian
Go-ernment) is examining pipeline options for the offshore gas. Policy
studies required include three interrelated pricing studies for natural gas,
petroleum and lignite (the latter two will be undertaken under previous loans,
the former discussed further at para 1.28), a gas purchasing strategy and gas
resources studies (to pass the purchasing choice to the Government rather than
leaving the initiative with the producers) and studies on LNG export and on
the feasibility of gas supplies to small users along the pipeline route.
Other studies required including specific studies on LPG and pre-feasibility
studies for PTT's investment program are outlined more fully in Chapter III
and Annex 3.03.
(ii)   Energy Conservation
1.23     The Government has already taken a number of steps to reduce energy
consumption directly, especially during peak hours. Concerned agencies are
preparing policy and program proposals to induce energy conservation in
transport, industry and households. A program of public education is being
developed to encourage households to save energy. Agencies such as the NEA,
the Ministry of Industry, and the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand
(IFCT), are individually and co-operatively collecting technical information,
operating and expanding pilot schemes, and seeking external assistance for the
design and implementation of energy conservation programs. To strengthen
these efforts further the Government will conduct a study to assess the
existing incentives for industrial energy conservation as provided by various
agencies and will implement appropriate recommendations in 1982. _'.  The
subject cuts across the energy and industrial sectors and involves a large
number of planning and implementing agencies.
(iii) Pricing Policy
1.24     Retail prices of petroleum products except for gasoline and diesel
continue to be subsidised, creating distortions in the market and
inefficiency, as well as financial pressures on the Oil Stabilisation Fund.
The Government, in its letter of development policy, under SAL, has reiterated
1/       Covered under SAL.



-9-
its resolve to continue implementing frequent adjustments in energy prices to
reflect cost changes. The relative price structure of petroleum products has
over-encouraged substitution of gasoline by imported, subsidised LPG in cars
and pick-ups and has been a significant factor in the shift of small trucks to
diesel use. Major changes are needed involving cuts in gasoline taxes and
significant increases for diesel. With a view to correcting the relative
structure of petroleum products prices both at ex-refinery and retail levels,
the Government will (as mentioned above) undertake a study to analyze the
efficiency, revenue, and financial and conservation implications of the
existing and alternative price structures, and plans to initiate appropriate
changes in the price structure in 1982. A second phase of the study will
integrate its findings with those of the lignite and gas pricing studies. The
Ministry of Finance will be the lead agency responsible for co-ordinating and
reviewing the study. The timetable and terms of reference were finalized
during SAL negotiations.
1.25     (a)    Consumer Prices.  Most energy conservation is likely to occur
as a result of appropriate policies on petroleum product prices, which also
serve the purpose of resource mobilization. Since 1979, significant efforts
have been made to adjust domestic prices of petroleum products. By March
1981, petroleum product prices had been increased to 220% of 1973 levels (60%
increase in real terms). Current Thai retail prices are shown below:

/a  Includes contributions to/from the Oil Fund and taxes.  For diesel oil the
contribution to the Oil Fund is negative.
1.26     (b)    Taxes and the Oil Stabilization Fund.  Two taxes, an excise
tax and a business/municipal tax, are levied on petroleum products.  The taxes
are levied primarily on the sale of gasoline and are very much lower for other
products. In 1980, the revenue from both taxes as a percentage of total tax
revenue averaged 16%, derived mainly from gasoline and diesel. The petroleum
products pricing study under SAL will include an examination of both taxation
and the Oil Stabilization Fund (below).
1.27     The Oil Stabilization Fund was set up in 1974 when the Government
collected the oil companies windfall profits arising from higher retail prices
of the "old cost" oil stock, and is levied on retail sales of petroleum



- 10 -
products. In 1975, the Government began to collect money for the Oil
Stabilization Fund from oil users by adding it as a positive or negative
component of the retail price, with a view to using the Fund as a price
stablization mechanism. For most of 1980 and 1981 more was taken from the
Fund than was put in, such that it became heavily in debt. By early 1982 the
Fund was more than $125 million in debt, principally to PTT. The Government
intends, as a short-term solution, to refinance the Fund through borrowing to
pay off the Fund's debts. The medium term financial position of the Fund
seems to be acceptable in view of the recent decline in international
petroleum product prices which are enabling the Fund to make a profit each
month. The future need for the Fund is not obvious. The position will be
carefully monitored and will be reviewed by the pricing study discussed
above. The implications of the Fund's deficit on PTT's financial condition
are discussed in Chapter V.
1.28     (c)    Natural Gas Pricing.  The two gas purchase agreement (Union
and PTT) are satisfactory to both parties and will yield acceptable profits to
each. Both relate gas price to estimated cost and are escalated according to
a number of factors including fuel oil. The present gas sale agreement
between EGAT and PTT bases price on production cost plus a transportation
margin, with a floor price linked to Singapore fuel oil prices. In view of
the uncertainties of the oil market the price basis is fixed for three years
(to 1984 only), although it was EGAT's intention to continue on the same basis
if still appropriate. To determine the appropriate rationale for pricing
natural gas in all uses (such as power generation, petrochemicals and
fertilizers), assurances were obtained that the Government will undertake a
natural gas pricing study, to be completed not later than March 31, 1983.
The Bank will wish to review the study with the Government with a view to
implementation.
Bank participation in the sector.
1.29     The Bank has been associated with Thailand's program to exploit the
natural gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand since mid-1976. At that stage
there were no precedents for a developing country contracting with a foreign
operator for the offshore purchase of gas. The Bank's initial role centered
on identifying and coordinating basic studies and activities necessary for
project preparation, assisting with terms of reference for consultants to
carry out such studies, and advising the Government in setting up a national
gas entity responsible for the construction and operation of a gas pipeline
and distribution system.   The first stage of optimisation, studies and design
was financed through an engineering loan (SIOTH), subsequently a $107 million
loan for financing the gas pipeline was approved in December 1979 (1773TH).
The Bank has since assisted PTT through close supervision of the studies and
the work of a number of consultants, throughout construction of the natural
gas pipeline and the guarantee period into the early stages of operation. The
project became operational on time and within budget.
1.30     Bank staff participated from the early stages of the LPG project
particularly (a) discussions on selecting the optimum plant size; (b) drafting
of terms of reference and reviewing more recent consultants proposals for the
gas separation plant; (c) defining the approach to procurement and supervision
of construction; (d) analysing cost estimates and choices of alternative plant
components; (e) assisting PTT with financial and economic analyses;



- 1 1 -
(f) defining marketing needs and supporting PTT in the necessary research; (g)
the role of private enterprise and co-ordination with their plans and (h)
safety standards. The Bank was instrumental in reviewing earlier consulting
work which led to better plant specification and a saving of $130 million on
the project cost, and has since played a pivotal role in the market
development and safety efforts.
1.31     In relation to the power and lignite subsector, the Bank has made
eleven loans to EGAT and its predecessor totalling $542 million to help
finance power plants and transmission facilities and two loans totalling $100
million to PEA to finance Accelerated Rural Electrification Projects. The
first seven EGAT projects have been completed satisfactorily. Good progress
is being made with the other EGAT loans and the PEA loans. A further loan was
made to EGAT in June 1980 for lignite production. Two project performance
audit reports have been prepared in respect of EGAT's operations, both
favourable.
1.32     Over the last six years, the Bank has built up an effective working
relationship with PTT; and also with the Government ministries and agencies
responsible for the development of Thailand's indigenous energy resources, and
with the two successful oil companies. The loans have been the basis for
substantial cofinancing. In view of the major impact of Thailand's energy and
industry on the medium term balance of payments, and the size of public and
private energy related investment in these sectors (together more than $4
billion this decade, in addition to power) it is important that during the
coming years the Bank and IFC continue to be closely associated with
Thailand's industrial and energy strategies.

II. LPG Market
Background
2.31     Thailand's planned gas separation plant and the proposed Esso
refinery expansion are expected to increase the availability of domestic LPG
supplies starting from mid-1983. An important aspect of the Government's
energy strategy is to reduce the dependence on oil imports by substituting
indigenous fuels. Future indigenous LPG supplies are expected not only to
eliminate LPG imports (which are currently at 35% of LPG consumption) but also
to meet the growing LPG requirements in the domestic sector, and gradually to
su'lstitute for diesel oil impor:s in the industrial and mass transport
sector. After meeting the domestic requirements surplus LPG will be exported,
for which several overseas companies have been expressing strong interest.
Both the import substitution and the export of surplus LPG will help Thailand
contain its net oil import bill.
LPG Consumption
2.02     Historically, LPG consumption in Thailand has, on average, increased
by 14.2% per annum, and the demand rose from less than 50,000 tons in 1970 to
almost 200,000 tons in 1980. Demand for LPG did not show any absolute decline
during 1973-74 despite the 112% increase in prices, and the demand is in
effect constrained by supply rather than price. The following table shows
historical LPG consumption in Thailand between 1971-81.
Table 2.01.

Industry                    -              27       13      44       19        -
Transport                   -              27       13      55       24        -

2.03     In Thailand LPG is primarily used as a cooking fuel in the
'residential' sector, mainly urban households and commercial establishments
such as hotels and restaurants in Bangkok. LPG consumption in the residential
sector expanded from 53,000 tons in 1971 to 156,000 tons in 1980 and then
decreased to 131,000 tons in 1981 because of a shortage of supplies. By 1980
the industrial and transport sectors each formed 13% of total LPG
consumption. In 1981 the transport sector share rose sharply to 24% of total
LPG consumption. Nearly 50% of the increase in transport demand was accounted



- 13 -
for by use of LPG in taxis, with LPG diverted from residential use.
LPG Demand Projections to 1990
2.04     With the B nk's assistance PTT used a local private voluntary
organization, PDA 1 , to undertake an urban/rural household energy survey,
concentrating on LPG use and potential markets and based on present prices.
Based on these results and other information, the basic projections developed
joLntly by PTT and the Bank are given below:
Table 2.02
Projected LPG Demand 1980-1990
('000' tons)
1980     1985      1990     Rate of Growth
Actual                               _
Residential Sector        156       200       325            7.6
Industrial Sector          27        55        85           12.5
Transport Sector           27       210       390           25.0
Total                  210       465       800           14.1
The intersectoral rates of growth will differ and reflect the slower growth in
the residential sector (7.6%) and moderate rates of growth in industrial LPG
consumption (12.5%) and a sharp increase in the transport sector. LPG
consumption in the residential sector is expected to double to 325,000 tons by
1990.
2.05     The Government's objectives in the residential sector are the
substitution of LPG for fueiwood/charcoal and supplying LPG to the rural
population. Although LPG compares favourably with fuelwood/charcoal in cost
per effective BTU, the initial investment required to purchase cylinders and
appliances (about $50 per household) will present difficulties for low income
rural households. In order that this constraint should not present a serious
obstacle to the penetration of LPG in the domestic sector, PTT intends to
conduct pilot marketing studies in semi-urban and rural areas to determine
appropriate cylinder sizes and methods of deposit payment on easy installments
(administered outside of PTT) for both cylinders and appliances. These
studies will also test the accuracy of the market survey conducted by PDA to
plan development of future investments in domestic marketing.
2.06     Thailand's transportation sector currently consumes 31% of total
petroleum products in the form of gasoline and diesel. By 1990 the government
expects a significant surplus in gasoline and a deficit in diesel, and   -
consequently wishes to encourage propane/LPG substitution to reduce the size
of the diesel deficit. Further price incentives may be required and this is
being addressed under the SAL petroleum pricing study. Although the market is
already undergoing conversion of gasoline-engined pick-ups and trucks to LPG,
1/       Population and Community Development Association.



- 14 -
this substitution will stem further acquisition of diesel-engined pick-ups and
trucks in the future. The major penetration in the transport sector will come
from the gradual replacement (during the normal replacement cycle) of diesel-
engined buses and local trucks with vehicles using propane/LPG fuels. About
50% of the diesel consumption in the transport sector is mainly in the metro
and inter-city bus fleets. The Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) is
planning to demonstrate the use of propane/LPG in a number of buses in order
to gain operational and maintenance experience consistent with Thai
environmental conditions. The proposed Bank loan will finance PTT's purchase
of five LPG fueled buses to conduct this demonstration, and a LPG fueled truck
for in-city deliveries.
2.07     The current composition of residential LPG demand is split 60:40
between Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. In the eighties the availability
of LPG from the gas separation plant is expected to satisfy not only Bangkok
demand but will also improve its access to up-country urban, semi-urban and
outlying rural areas of Thailand. In the industrial sector LPG is presently
used mainly in the plateglass, glass bottle and ceramic industries.
Industrial LPG use in these and in new uses such as tobacco curing and tapioca
processing are expected to increase in step with planned annual growth rates
of about 12%. In the transport sector, LPG demand in the eighties is expected
to rise sharply. The high rate of growth in the transport sector reflects the
continuing trend of increasing substitution of gasoline in taxis/cars and
pick-ups to LPG. Strong efforts will be made to introduce LPG to bus fleets,
and the possible financial constraints on the bus companies will be examined
further as the project develops. Depending on pricing policy, LPG use is
expected to substitute for gasoline and diesel in about 35% of pick-ups and
about 80% of the mass transit authority bus fleet and intercity bus fleet,
resulting in transport LPG consumption of about almost 390,000 tons by 1990.
2.08      The composition of LPG demand in the transport sector is given in
Table 2.03 below:

Domestic LPG Supply and Development Prospects
2.09     The projected indigenous LPG supplies from the proposed gas
separation plant, addition of a second gas separation plant and planned local
refineries' expansion in the eighties represent a combined availability of LPG



- 15 -
supplies that will not only substitute for imports of LPG and diesel fuel but
will also generate an export surplus. Current plans for expansion and
debottlenecking of the Esso refinery are expected to increase LPG supplies
from refineries from the present 130,000 tons to 190,000 tons by 1985. When
the planned first gas separation plant has built up to full production, around
1985, it is expected to process 350 million SCFD of natural gas, generating
about 460,000 tons of propane and LPG. In line with Thailand's policy to
substitute its natural gas for imports of petroleum, a second gas separation
plant is planned and, when constructed will generate another 400,000 to
460,000 tons of indigenous LPG supplies by about 1987. A further gas supply
contract may be required if the second LPG plant is the same size as the
first. The following table gives the forecast propane/LPG supply/demand
balance in the eighties.

in 1985 by 185,000 tons. Propane surplus to Thailand's requirements will be
exported. PTT has had discussions with a number of interested LPG importers
and will seek firm bids later in 1982.

2.11     Two marketing companies, Shell and Esso, supplied more than 86% of
the LPG market in 1980, while the remaining market was supplied by Summit (6%)
and the publicly owned government distribution company, PTT's MKT (8%). PTT's
share increased to 4/2t in 1981. PTT's share of the market is forecast to
increase through the growth in public sector sales, particularly the planned
substitution of propane/LPG for diesel oil in the publicly operated metrobus
and inter-city bus companies. Although private companies' aggregate sales
will continue to increase, their relative share will decline, to approximately
64% of the market by the end of the decade. The projected LPG market share is
given below.

2.12     By 1984, after the completion of the gas separation plant, PTT will
emerge as the major supplier of bulk LPG for the Thai market and may also be
the largest distributor. The projected demand resulting from the penetration
of LPG in new markets requires the provision of adequate and reliable
transport, storage and distribution facilities. By end 1984 PTT will have 6
bulk storage installations distributed over the marketing centres in
Thailand. Propane and LPG will be transported in bulk from the terminal in
Laem Chabang to the storage installations by rail, road and barge. All
marketing companies including MKT will purchase propane and LPG from these
installations for further distribution to consumers in the domestic,
industrial and transport sectors. The private marketers are keen to secure
their supplies and expand their markets. Availability of LPG on equal terms
from the proposed bulk storage installations (to be covenanted under this
loan) will encourage them to undertake the required investment in the LPG
market.
LPG Pricing
2.13     Pricing of LPG supplies derived from imported crude oil in local
refineries and from imports is based on import parity. The cost of LPG
distribution and marketing, ranging between 20 and 25% of the ex-refinery
prices, is not fully reflected in the sales price to consumers. Government is
currently subsidizing LPG cost at the rate of 1.54 baht per kg for domestic
supplies and 2.79 baht per kg for imported LPG.
2.14     With the commissioning of the gas separation plant a new source of
domestic LPG supplies will become available.  The most appropriate basis for
pricing LPG from the gas separation plant is its economic value, which at the
margin is the net export price about $315/tonne at present (somewhat lower
than present ex-refinery prices). At the same time LPG from refineries will
continue to supply a significant percentage of domestic LPG consumption (30%
in 1985 declining to 20% in 1990) which should be priced the same as gas
separation plant LPG. On this basis, Thailand will have the opportunity to
eliminate retail subsidies and reduce prices. Tentative prices have been
calculated for the financial projections included in Chapter 5, and fit well
with estimated costs and the present scheme. Costs of transport and bulk
storage are about $40/tonne, giving an ex-bulk price of about $355/tonne.
Future supplies from the proposed bulk storage installations will introduce
common LPG prices thus eliminating differences in various parts of the
country. Prices at this level are competitive with diesel and give a wide
margin compared with gasoline, further encouraging substitution, particularly
gasoline. Higher prices which would discourage gasoline substitution would
also be prohibitive as a diesel substitute and as a charcoal substitute. As



supplies that will not only substitute for imports of LPG and diesel fuel but
will also generate an export surplus. Current plans for expansion and
debottlenecking of the Esso refinery are expected to increase LPG supplies
from refineries from the present 130,000 tons to 190,000 tons by 1985. When
the planned first gas separation plant has built up to full production, around
1985, it is expected to process 350 million SCFD of natural gas, generating
about 460,000 tons of propane and LPG. In line with Thailand's policy to
substitute its natural gas for imports of petroleum, a second gas separation
plant is planned and, when constructed will generate another 400,000 to
460,000 tons of indigenous LPG supplies by about 1987. A further gas supply
contract may be required if the second LPG plant is the same size as the
first. The following table gives the forecast propane/LPG supply/demand
balance in the eighties.

2.10     Assuming that both the planned refinery expansion and the gas

in 1985 by 185,000 tons. Propane surplus to Thailand's requirements will be
exported. PTT has had discussions with a number of interested LPG importers
and will seek firm bids later in 1982.
LPG Market
2.11     Two marketing companies, Shell and Esso, supplied more than 86% of
the LPG market in 1980, while the remaining market was supplied by Summit (6%)
and the publicly owned government distribution company, PTT's MKT (8%). PTT's
share increased to i/51 in 1981. PTT's share of the market is forecast to
increase through the growth in public sector sales, particularly the planned
substitution of propane/LPG for diesel oil in the publicly operated metrobus
and inter-city bus companies. Although private companies' aggregate sales
will continue to increase, their relative share will decline, to approximately
64% of the market by the end of the decade. The projected LPG market share is
given below.

referred to above, LPG prices are already being studied with a view to
rezonciling the conflicting objectives.
Utilization of Ethane and Propane for Petrochemicals
2.15     Gas utilization studies by Davy McKee and Chem Systems (UK and US)
have identified economic uses for 300-350,000 tons p.a. of ethane and propane
from the gas separation plant in the production of ethylene and propylene
known as olefins. The main derivatives of olefins, such as low and high
density polyethylenes (LDPE/HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and ethylene glycol
(EG), would be the nucleus of potential petrochemical industries that would
improve the economic value of the gas separation plant products. The olefin
derivatives are used to manufacture plastic films for general purpose bagging
and sheeting, injection and extrusion moulding for containers and piping, wire
and cable insulation etc. Thailand's demand for these products, growing at an
annual rate of 8%, will absorb the full production of commercial size plants
and will result in substitution of imports. The Government is aware of the
value added benefits of an olefin complex and has decided to undertake a study
of an entire petrochemical complex. This study is expected to be complete by
end-June 1982. PTT expects to undertake a basic engineering study for the
construction of an ethylene plant, to be completed by June 30, 1983.

III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01     The Bank participated in the financing of the natural gas development
project (1773-TH) which became operational in September 1981. The main
objective of the project was to construct a natural gas pipeline from the
offshore Erawan field in the Gulf of Thailand to the Bang Pakong and South
Bangkok power plants. The proposed gas plant is intended to be the first of a
series of major projects which will bring the full benefit of gas to
Thailand. PTT has presented to the Bank a feasibility study for the gas plant
and LPG distribution and has requested Bank involvement in their financing.
The project was appraised during March to November 1981.
Gas Reserves, Supplies and Demand
3.02     Gas supplies for the proposed gas separation plant will come from six
of the Union Oil Group's 12 gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand. Sufficient
gas has already been contracted for a second (smaller) gas separation plant.
Proven reserves of natural gas can support production greater than the
pipeline capacity. The first natural gas supply contract, for Union Oil's
Erawan field will be able to supply an average of 250 MMSCFD from the fourth
quarter of 1982, and the second contract up to 400 MMSCFD, from five other
Union fields from mid 1985. In view of the importance of this second contract
for plant operations, ratification of the second Union Oil contract will be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
3.03     Demand for natural gas will be in excess of supply throughout the
1980's. The second gas purchase contract has been agreed, providing supplies
close to the pipeline carrying capacity, (about 700 MMSCFD with full
compression.) For a third contract PTT will need simultaneously to identify
firmly and receive commitments from new customers, design and commit a new
pipeline, and negotiate and finalize a contract with a gas supplier; this is
likely to take some time. In the meantime a long term pipeline strategy study
for offshore gas is already under way. PTT's overall projections provide for
two gas separation plants operational successively in 1984 and 1987 with
possibly a third plant in the early 1990's.
Project Objectives.
3.04     The efficient use of natural gas is the main objective of the
project. The gas separation plant will extract about 30% of the heat content
of the gas.  Propane/LPG from the gas separation plant will substitute LPG
imports and ensure a reliable supply, as well as meeting future growth. LPG
self sufficiency and export of propane will improve the foreign exchange
balance. Five LPG bulk storage marketing (Map IBRD 16244) installations will
be constructed in Thailand in up-country provincial and rural areas to make it
available to rural and provincial consumers as well as additional storage in
Bangkok and at the plant site in Rayong. Sale of LPG for cooking will reduce
the usage of charcoal and fuelwood which is contributing to deforestation.
The project will make available the country's gas resources to people outside



19 -
the Bangkok area. LPG use as an automotive fuel will significantly reduce
gasoline and diesel consumption and pollution.
3.05     Of the other products extracted, the ethane is a suitable feedstock
for olefin-based petrochemical plants to produce polyethylenes and polyvinyl-
chloride (PVC). Extraction of ethane will also improve propane recovery. The
CO2 in the gas is removed in the process of recovering the LPG which results
in upgrading the heating value of the sales gas and prevents corrosion in the
pipeline network. The natural gasoline can be used as a refinery feedstock.
The residual from the process is a natural gas stream roughly equal in heat
content to the inlet gas, but without the corrosive properties.
Project Description
3.06     The gas from six Union Oil fields will be transported to shore in a
425 km 34" submarine pipeline financed by the Bank under the Second Natural
Gas Development Project (1773-TH). The gas reaching the shore will be treated
in a dew point control unit (DPCU) to remove the condensate by sub-cooling.
The proposed project will separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from the
gas stream and then market these products. The main components are the
following:
(i)     A gas separation plant to recover ethane, propane, LPG and
natural gasoline. The liquid hydrocarbons (propane, LPG and
natural gasoline) will be transported to the Laem Chabang
terminal;
(ii)    Bulk storage and distribution installations to distribute
propane and LPG in the domestic market; and
(iii)   Studies and technical assistance relating to LPG marketing,
petroleum sector investments, energy policy and other aspects
of PTT.
Each of these project components is described below.
1.  The Gas Plant
3.07     The gas separation plant will be located at Rayong and will have a
capacity of 350 MMSCFD. The feed gas will be treated to reduce carbon
dioxide (C02) content to avoid freezing and precipitation of C02 in the
refrigeration section of the plant as well as to upgrade the calorific value
of the gas. The treated gas will be subsequently dehydrated for processing in
the refrigeration and fractionation sections. Ethane, propane and LPG are
separated in the liquid phase at low temperatures attained by turbo-expansion
and recycle refrigeration. The dry gas is then compressed and injected in the
transmission line for distribution to power stations and industrial
consumers. Further details of plant design and related facilities are given
in Annex 3.01.
3.08     The plant site in Rayong will be equipped with storage facilities for
propane, LPG and natural gasoline.  These products will be pumped in three
separate pipelines to the marine and distribution terminal at Laem Chabang
60km north of Rayong, and natural gasoline on to the TORC refinery. The Laem



- 20 -
Chabang terminal has storage facilities and a jetty both for domestic LPG
distribution (small tankers of 5000 DWT) and for exporting propane and LPG in
refrigerated tankers up to 75,000 M3.
II. LPG Bulk Storage and Distribution
3.)9     PTT will construct 5 regional bulk storage installations plus those
at Laem Chabang, Rayong and Bangkok, covering the whole of Thailand's
distribution centres. These installations are planned to be completed
progressively by 1984 PTT will be responsible for LPG transport from the
terminal at Laem Chabang to the regional bulk storage installations. LPG will
be transported by barge, rail and road depending on the available
infrastructure at the bulk storage locations. Marketing companies (including
MKT) will provide operational storage, cylinder filling and transport
facilities to distribute the LPG to domestic consumers, filling stations for
vehicles and industrial users.
III.     Studies and Technical Assistance
3.10     The project includes major technical assistance and studies in
general policy areas and on overall technical issues, assistance in direct
support of this project, both in LPG marketing and use , and in training (the
latter is included in Parts I and II above), in pre-feasibility studies for
the major items in PTT's investment program, and in support of its
administration and planning. The requirements are summarised below.
(i)     Policy and overall technical studies
3.11     As discussed in chapter I, a number of studies are required on
pricing issues. In respect of natural gas, the pricing study and the proposed
study on small scale use will complete the overall studies on gas
utilization. An LNG export study is required as part of the gas strategy in
view of the strong gas reserve position. The Government and PTT have been
responding to proposals by various producers for the sale of gas, but have not
been in a position to take the initiative in deciding from which fields they
wish to purchase gas, or in deciding any priority or strategy among the
various offers. To put itself in a suitable position PTT should obtain
independent studies of the gas reserves in each significant structure and
should update these when new information comes available. The study currently
underway on alternative pipeline systems for offshore gas will need to-be
continued and completed. Drawing on the above and the LNG study, PTT should
prepare a gas purchasing strategy, with the help of consultants, which would
take account of the probable economics of various fields, the pipeline
implications, diversity of supply among producers, fields and pipelines,
flexibility, competition, joint benefits with LNG, and longer term alternative
sources and demands. The policy and strategy studies to be financed by the
Bank will require 250 man months of consultancy assistance. Except for
updates on gas reserves, all will be completed during 1983 and 1984.
(ii)    Project related studies
3.12     Following the completion of the fuel utilization survey carried out
by the Population and Community Development Association (PDA) PTT will conduct
pilot marketing studies in representative samples of semi-urban and rural



- 21 -
areas covered by the survey. The study which will be carried out by local
consultants for a duration of one to three years will be monitored by a
marketing consultant. The consultant will coordinate, analyse and report the
results of the study to plan future marketing requirements. A total of 400
man months input is expected including 10 man months expatriate assistance.
3.13     The proposed loan will finance the purchase of 5 LPG fueled
metrobuses and trucks including spares and the technical assistance to advise
on the safety requirements and operating and maintenance facilities. The
demonstration has started for both urban and inter-urban bus operation and
will be completed by end 1983 during which experience gained will assist in
future replacement of diesel fueled buses by LPG fueled buses. (40 man-
months).
(iii)   Investment related studies
3.14     PTT has a major capital investment program amounting to $2.5 billion
over the next seven years. Pre-feasibility studies are required on a number
of the proposed investments to determine the most appropriate sizing, timing
and configurations. Projects to be studied include the natural gas pipelines,
products pipeline, crude oil storage and the second LPG plant. The studies to
be financed by the Bank will in total require 160 man-months of consultancy
effort and will be undertaken as required from 1983 through 1984.
(iv)    Other assistance
3.15     PTT has need of assistance in introducing the concept of manpower
planning and longer term staff recruitment and development, so that the
various projects in its corporate plans can be evaluated properly. PTT is
also in need of a review of its management information needs and the work flow
within its administrative set-up, with a view (if appropriate) to setting up a
co-ordinated workflow and management information system. Total consultancy
input is estimated at 125 man months and the tasks should be completed in
1984.
Project Implementation and Schedule
(a)     Gas Plant
3.16     PTT has decided to proceed with the execution of the gas separation
plant, pipelines and export facilities on a lump-sum turnkey basis.  Initial
work, including an assessment of alternative plant sizes, was undertaken by
Fluor. Subsequently Linde AG. of West Germany was selected from five
international consulting firms to prepare the technical specifications and
tender documents, assist in prequalifying engineering contractors, analyze
bids and assist in negotiating the contract with the successful bidder,
through until contract award. Important alternatives were examined with Bank
staff during preparation of the specifications. Phase II of Linde's contract
covers the project management which includes reviewing the contractor's
designs and detailed engineering, supervision of construction, training and
takeover until commissioning by the contractor.
3.17     The following schedule represents the important milestones in the
implementation of the gas plant. The schedule is considered reasonable.



- 22 -
(i)     Prequalification of engineering contractors
(completed)                                   October  1981
(ii)    Issue tender documents (completed)               November 1981
(iii)   Bid opening (completed)                          March    1982
(iv)    Bid evaluation, contract negotiations
and award                                     August   1982
(v)     Mechanical completion                             August   1984
(vi)    Start-up and commissioning                       Nov/Dec. 1984
Seven experienced contractors from five countries submitted bids and all are
capable of completing the work on time, (Annex 3.02). When the plant comes
onstream the gas supply will be only 250 MMSCFD. Special measures will be
taken to test the operating capability of the plant at full flow rate. The
expected date for the next gas supply is mid 1985, and until that time the
plant will operate below capacity.
(b)     Bulk Storage and Distribution Centers
3.18     PTT will engage consultants to provide technical services required
(a) for the construction of five new bulk storage and distribution centres and
for reinforcement in Bangkok and distribution from Rayong and Laem Chabang and
(b) for the rail loading facilities. These consultants will carry out:
(i) studies as required for site selection, (ii) prepare basic designs and
tender documents to invite engineering contractors to bid for the detailed
design, supply and construction of these installations, (iii) prequalification
of contractors, and (iv) provide technical assistance for bid evaluation,
project management and supervision, training and start-up. The studies would
be undertaken by consultants whose qualifications, experience and conditions
of employment would be satisfactory to the Bank and PTT. Contractors will
prepare the detailed design. Selection of consultants (covered by a condition
of effectiveness) will be completed by August 1982, although contract
signature may take up to three months longer, and the basic design should be
completed by November and bid openings are expected by March 1983. PTT
proposes to proceed with two (or more) lump sum turnkey contracts covering the
storage and rail facilities respectively. Contract awards should be July.
Operation will coincide with the separation plant in late 1984.
3.19     The Government will need shortly to issue a first notification to all
the distributors of the availability of LPG on equal terms. The issue of such
a notification will be a condition of effectiveness. Subsequent to this
notification a second notification will be issued upon completion of PTT's
consultant's design of LPG storage facilities specifying the location of the
bulk storage centres and the services provided. Subject to the above the
private marketers are expected to play a full role in LPG market
development. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the issuance of
this second notification would be made by February 1, 1983. As a
precautionary measure against possible delays or changes in the private
marketers' plans, assurances were obtained from PTT that it will review the
companies' plans with the Bank by July 1983, with a view to taking such
remedial measures as are necessary.

The gas separation plant complete with the transfer pipelines, distribution
terminal and export facilities is estimated to cost on an all-in basis
(including taxes and interest during construction) US$320 million of which
US$183 million (57%) represents the foreign currency component. The US$320
million includes a 10% physical contingency which was applied to all costs.
The cost estimate for the major part of the work (plant, pipelines and
terminal) is based on the fixed price bids already received and includes an
estimated $27.0 million in bidders provision for price escalation, included in
the table below on a line by line basis as per the bids. Other costs are in
1982 US dollars with the foreign cost element escalated at the rate of 8% for
1982, 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7% for 1985 while local costs were
escalated at the rate of 12% for 1982 and 1983, 10% for 1984 and 9% for
1985. Project engineering management, construction supervision and start-up
technical assistance costs have been estimated at US$12 million which is in
the normal range of costs for this type of contract. The Linde contract
provides for 840 man months at an average direct cost of US$7,700 per man
month and US$11,900 per month including all costs.
3.22     The cost estimate takes into consideration that the contract will be
awarded in August 1982 and mechanical completion will be after 24 months
(August 1984). Liquidated damages for late completion are provided under the
contract at the estimated daily loss to PTT, up to a maximum of about six
months delay. Any delay will not affect greatly the costs, being a lump sum
fixed price contract, but it will reduce the benefits.
3.23     The following table gives the breakdown of the estimated costs for
the gas plant (including transfer pipelines and the marine terminal).

3.24      The marketing and distribution of LPG to meet future consumption in
new areas up to year 1986 will be shared by PTT and the private companies.
The private sector share will be US$145 million and will cover operational
storage, cylinder filling, service stations, transport units and cylinders.
PTT's LPG bulk storage and distribution costs have been estimated in 1982
prices by PTT and the mission at US$115 million using price contingencies at
the rate of 8% for 1982, 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7% for 1985 for
foreign costs and 12% for 1982 and 1983, 10% for 1984 and 9% for 1985 local
costs and physical contingencies of 15%. The cost estimates will be confirmed
by the consultant; until that time the financing plan will be kept flexible.

The gas plant is to be jointly financed from all the sources listed above,
with the exception of the OPEC Fund money. All prequalified bidders for the
gas plant are from countries with strong export credit facilities and the
contractors have ensured the availability of $80 millions in export credits.
The Government and PTT confirmed the acceptability of this practice with the
appropriate export credit organizations, and all bidders responded. Credit
terms will not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. A provisional
fiaancing scheme for the gas plant is at Annex 3.05. It will, however, have
to be kept flexible until the bid amount is finalized and the foreign and
lo2zal components are known with certainty.
3.27    The proposed Bank loan of $90 millions (including $1.3 million front
end fee) would represent 15% of the total project cost and would be used to
finance 25% of the total foreign exchange cost. This would include interest
during construction on the Bank loan estimated at $5 million in order to help
alleviate PTT's short term liquidity problems (para. 5.05). The loan would be
made to PTT on standard country terms.
3.28    The Government has agreed to provide about $110 million in equity, of
which $35 million is for this project and $75 million for general purposes.
$75 million of this has already been agreed by the Cabinet.Satisfactory
progress is being made with all the cofinancing, and meetings have been held
to agree provisional administrative arrangements. The CDC loan has been
approved in principle and is expected to be considered for formal approval in
May. Agreement in principle has been reached with OECF and for the initial
$60 million of commercial loan (yen syndication) and the latter should be



- 29 -
arranged during June. The Japanese Export Credit 1/ was signed in 1979. OPEC
Special Fund have agreed at staff level and the credit will probably be
formalised in June. (PTT will, however, seek OPEC agreement to using the
funds to finance cylinders and vehicles, rather than merging the funds with
those of the Bank). Effectiveness of OECF, export credits, CDC and the first
year's requirement of commercial funds--$60 million of yen syndication (or
equivalent from elsewhere-- will be necessary for effectiveness of the Bank
loan. A further $70 million of commercial credit will need to be raised in
two tranches in 1983 and 1984 and the OPEC Fund money mid 1983. These are
dealt with through dated covenents.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.29    The gas plant contract includes facilities for gas treating, ethane
and heavier hydrocarbon recovery, transfer pipelines and an export terminal
with storage and LPG bulk distribution facilities. In view of the complexity
and the need for the timing of each activity to be coordinated throughout, the
work will be constructed on a turn-key basis where the detailed engineering,
all equipment and materials and the construction of the plant and other
facilities will be provided through a single contract. Likewise the bulk
storage and distribution and rail loading facilities will be handled through
one or more turnkey contracts secured in a similar manner to the gas plant
contract.
3.30    In respect of the gas plant contract the Bank has reviewed (i) the
general format of advertisements, (ii) the prequalification questionnaire and
the method of evaluation, (iii) the selection and prequalification of
contractors, and (iv) the bidding documents, including instructions to
bidders, general conditions of contract and technical specifications. The
Bank has reviewed the bid evaluation procedures, and will review the
evaluation and contract before award. A comparable review will be undertaken
for the LPG storage and distribution contracts.
3.31    Except as below, all works and goods financed from the proceeds of the
proposed loan will be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The borrower will furnish the Bank
with all the documents required prior to the application for withdrawal of
funds to verify their consistency with Bank guidelines. Consulting and
training services would be engaged in accordance with Bank guidelines for use
of consultants. Some local procurement up to $100,000 per contract and $2
million in total will be permitted for miscellaneous supplies and equipment
for the gas plant etc.
3.32    To avoid delay in completion of the project and so as to firm up the
cost estimates some advance contracting was necessary. Consultants (Linde)
were appointed after considerable consultations with the Bank.  Retroactive
financing is expected to be limited to consultant's fees, about US$4
million. Total consultancy contracts awarded prior to Board
1/      The three leading bidders for the gas plant contract are Japanese,(bid
opening was March 1).



- 30 -
consideration amount to about US$11 million.  Contract award for the gas plant
will be shortly after Board presentation.
3.33    The items against which the Bank loan will be disbursed are those
important to the success of the project and to the formulation of a coherent
energy strategy, and, in respect of the plant - to fill the foreign exchange
gaps. The disbursement of the proposed loan will be as follows: (a) 100% of
foreign expenditures for (i) engineering and project management services;
(ii) initial payments for the gas separation plant, and the remaining payments
once export credits for the gas separation plant and OECF funds for the marine
terminal and transfer pipeline have been exhausted (Bank financing would thus
represent about 16% of total costs for this component); (iii) the contract(s)
for construction of PTT's LPG storage and distribution facilities; and
(iv) training; (b) 100% of the cost of studies and technical assistance not
financed from other sources; (c) 100% of foreign costs, 100% of ex-factory
costs or 75% of total costs (representing the estimated foreign exchange
component) of miscellaneous equipment and materials in respect of the gas
plant; (d) amount due against interest and other charges on the loan accrued
on or before July 31, 1984; and (e) the front end fee. The disbursement
profile specifically reflects this and the expected pattern for the various
project components. Further details of the anticipated cofinancing
arrangements are given in Annex 3.05. Disbursement of the loan proceeds is
expected to be completed by the end of 1986 (see Annex 3.04) and the loan
closing date is June 30, 1987. Allocations by category are given below:
US$ million
(a)     Engineering and project management for
gas plant and LPG storage and distribution                13.5
(b)     Construction contract - Gas plant                         25.5
(c)     Construction contract - LPG storage

Reporting Requirements
3.34     In view of the importance of completing the project on schedule PTT
has agreed to institute a system of reviewing the work progress with regular
reports to PTT management. PTT will submit to the Bank technical progress
reports with cost estimates, expenditures and disbursements, and management
and operations at one to three monthly intervals. During negotiations,
agreement was reached on the format and frequency of progress reports to the
Bank, and the implementation of a satisfactory project control system.
Training
3.35     The consultants will prepare by January 1983 a training program
covering the various major options for plant operation according to factors



- 31 -
such as (i) lower capacity due to insufficient feed gas (ii) no ethane
recovery, (iii) normal and emergency shutdowns, and (iv) safety precautions
for purging and start-up. The organization and manpower planning for both the
construction and operating phases will be prepared based on planned numbers
and desired qualifications.  Training will start by July 1983.  In accordance
with the contracts, maintenance personnel will start their training at the
manufacturers of major equipment during fabrication and shop testing. They
will follow up during construction until testing and mechanical completion.
Suppliers of critical materials and equipment will extend their services
beyond the guarantee period as necessary to complete the on-the-job
training. The consultant's technical assistance will involve class-room
training of operating personnel on process flow diagrams and plant scale
models. Process description and design philosophies will be explained and
demonstrated. The training program will be reviewed by the Bank before
implementation.
3.36     The contractor will provide training facilities for senior personnel
at similar process plants already in operation abroad to prepare them for
taking over the plant after completion of construction.
3.37     Although training will progress in line with the construction of the
plant, provision will be made in the contracts for some technical assistance
to be provided by the contractor and consultants in the early days of starting
up. This will continue for sometime thereafter until the plant operation
becomes stable and satisfactory for reliable takeover by PTT personnel.
3.38     Training for marketing operations will include visits to LPG
marketing organisations abroad to study safety rules and regulations,
transport scheduling, cylinder filling and inspection and marketing
techniques. Senior expatriate advisors will be assigned for on the job
training in operational activities until the transfer of technology is well
conceived by MKT personnel.
Ecology and Safety
3.39     The gas separation plant is located away from residential and
agricultural areas. The flue gases from boilers and flare stacks are free of
sulphur.  The only undesirable effluent is carbon dioxide (CO2) which is
disposed of in the atmosphere and it can be controlled by dispersion at
altitude so as to maintain allowable concentrations at ground level. The
quantity involved will not cause a problem and already PTT is studying the
utilization of C02 in other chemical plants such as soda ash.
3.40     Like many industrial plants, gas separation is potentially hazardous
and strict rules and regulations will be implemented to avoid explosion due to
possible leaks. The world-wide safety record is good and no particular danger
is foreseen. Gas detectors with alarms and inert gas purging are standard
design features, to avoid loss of life and damage to property. Where accidents
do occur they are usually related to human error and faulty equipment, which
is being addressed through good training and proper management.
3.41     LPG can be dangerous if handled carelessly.  If the LPG escapes from
storage installations it can both explode and ignite, and could cause loss of
life. Consequently storage installations will be constructed far enough away



- 32 -
from habitations and proper safety and maintenance procedures will be
implemented.
3.42     LPG distribution and use is becoming common in urban areas in
Thailand but less so in rural areas where householders will need to learn to
exercise due care. Safety campaigns and advertising will be frequently
administered both in urban and rural areas using all means of
communications.  Use of LPG in transport units has already been implemented in
the taxi fleet of Bangkok. The Government has issued appropriate safety
regulations.
3.43     A marked environmental improvement will be noticed when electric
power stations convert from presently used high sulphur fuel oil to sweet
(sulphur free) natural gas. The same applies to buses and trucks when LPG
gradually replaces diesel fuel in Bangkok, a factor important for better
living in the metropolis.
Physical Risks
3.44     The project will be subject to the risks generally associated with
gas separation plants and LPG storage and distribution and all practical
measures are being taken to alleviate or minimize them. These risks include
explosion and leaks and the discharge of relatively small quantities of CO9.
Experienced consultants have been appointed for the project and only qualified
contractors with extensive experience will be employed to construct the plant
and the export facilities. As outlined above, safety features to minimise the
risks are a standard part of the design.
3.45     The plant will initially be supplied with gas from one field through
one pipeline. There is a risk of physical interruption of supplies through a
pipeline failure, for which inspection and preventive maintenance will be
implemented. More serious is the risk of damage to the central production
platform, which is a remote possibility. When the second gas supply contract
comes into effect after 12 months operation this becomes a less serious risk.

IV. THE BORROWER
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
4.01      The Bank loan will be made to PTT with the guarantee of the Kingdom
of Thailand. PTT was established in December 1978 by the Petroleum Authority
of Thailand Act, and became operational in July 1979. PTT's objective is to
engage in and promote the petroleum business, including related petroleum and
petrochemical activities. It is under the control of the Ministry of
Industry.
4.02     PTT's Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers.
The Board comprises a chairman (the Prime Minister) and eleven other
directors. The Governor of PTT, who is its chief executive officer, is a
Director and Secretary of the Board. The Ministries of Defense, Finance,
Commerce, Industry and the Juridical Council each appoint one director and
there are five from other sources. PTT also has an executive committee
chaired by a minister of the Prime Minister's office, who is also a member of
the main Board. The executive committee meets frequently and is empowered to
take decisions on certain investments, contracts, staffing and other
operational matters.
4.03     In view of the rapid growth in its activities PTT underwent a major
reorganization mid-1981. Under the Governor it will have seven Deputy
Governors responsible for Technical and Planning, Natural Gas Operations,
Marketing, Logistics and Refining, Finance, Administration and Special
Affairs, three Assistant Governors (Technical and Planning, Finance and
Administration), thirty-three department directors, ninety-two divisional
directors and chiefs, and about three thousand staff (excluding TORC). The
organization chart is set out at Annex 4.01. About two-thirds of the senior
positions have been filled.
4.04     At present, PTT operates as a single legal entity with no
subsidiaries. The three major operational arms of PTT --gas pipelines,
marketing and (to some extent) refining-- have all been transferred from other
organizations, and the gas plant is the first major activity breaking
completely new ground. The natural gas pipeline construction was transferred
to PTT from a state enterprise, the Natural Gas Organization of Thailand,
(NGOT), in July 1979, and PTT has completed the construction and successfully
brought the pipeline into operation. The major part of the oil marketing
operations were tranWferred from another state enterprise, the Oil Fuel
Organization (OFO) - in September 1979, and the balance transferred from the
Summit Corporation early in 1981. PTT,is in the process of overhauling and
rationalizing its products distribution activities. The third major -
operational activity is refining. The Bangchak refinery was formerly leased
to the Summit Corporation and taken back by the Government early in 1981..
Bangchak is owned by the Ministry of Defense and will be operated by it at
least until 1985 with advice from consultants and PTT is responsible for
1/     Part of the Ministry of Defense.



- 34 -
logistics, marketing and finance. The TORC refinery reverted to the
Government in 1981 under the terms of its last expansion permit. It is being
operated by TORC personnel and is planned to be expanded as a joint venture
between TORC and PTT. In addition to the above, PTT has a small exploration
department which continues to seek exploration concessions from the Department
of Mineral Resources (DMR). It is currently negotiating for a share in
developing the onshore Shell oilfield.
4.05     The Natural Gas Operations Unit (ONG) will be responsible for the gas
separation plant and export facilities. ONG was responsible for the
construction of the natural gas pipeline and is now charged with its
operation. The construction went well with few significant hitches and
provided valuable experience for the staff. Many of the staff have now been
assigned to pipeline operations, others will become responsible for the
construction of the gas plant. ONG has almost 200 employees, of whom about
half came from NGOT when it was absorbed into PTT three years ago. The staff
are well-educated, performed competently through the pipeline construction,
and are quickly learning pipeline operations. Given the training program
(para. 3.35) and operating and maintenance arrangements, no particular
difficulties are anticipated for the construction and operation of the gas
separation plant and export facilities.
4.06     The Marketing (Oil Distribution and Supply) unit (MKT) will be
responsible for the bulk distribution of LPG and bulk storage at the up-
country storage centres. It will also be responsible for filling,
distribution and marketing of PTT's LPG sales to transport, industry and
households. The PTT (and MKT) experience of LPG handling is relatively
limited. Its association with the former Summit operations is recent, and LPG
formed only a minor part of the OFO operations. Nevertheless, MKT has handled
the market growth over the last year satisfactorily, and now has 50 staff
engaged solely in LPG marketing. The bulk distribution and storage of LPG
needs care rather than mastering of technical complexities. NKT will engage a
number of new, well-educated staff to strengthen the management of its
expanding responsibilities in LPG activities. Taken together with on-the-job
training from contractors and consultants, MKT is expected to perform
satisfactorily in bulk LPG distribution and storage, as well as retail
marketing.
Experience and Training
4.07     PTT's top management is experienced in business and management but
has only limited petroleum experience. The middle management is generally
young, keen and well educated but in many cases with relatively little
experience. In accordance with the provisions of the Natural Gas Development
Project (1773-TH), theoretical and on-the-job training has been given for the
natural gas operations and in accounting and finance. In addition, training
is planned for the operation of the gas plant and LPG distribution (3.35), as
provided by the proposed LPG project. Apart from specific instances
associated with new projects, PTT's future needs are practical, on-the-job
experiences rather than making much use of further training courses.
Accounts, Audit and Insurance
4.08     PTT maintains separate accounts of each of the major activities,
namely ONG and MKT and separate records in respect of its Bangchak refinery
activities. ONG's financial accounts are modelled on US gas utility



- 35 -
principles and accounts have been satisfactorily prepared for the last three
fiscal years. However, there appears to be inadequacy in the accounting
system at the Marketing (Oil Distribution and Supply) unit (MKT), especially
in regards to accounts receivable, billing and the control system.
4.09     In accordance with the provisions under the Natural Gas Development
Project (1773-TH), competent financial consultants, Sycip, Gorres, Velayo &
Co.(SGV) have been engaged to assist PTT in the maintenance of its accounts
and in internal auditing. Specifically, the consultants have completed a
review of MKT's accounts and implementation of the recommended improvements,
including training, is now in progress. The consultants are also assisting
ONG to strengthen its accounting system in the light of the expanding
operations of natural gas. In addition, the consultants are undertaking the
internal auditing of PTT as an interim step before the company can build up
its own staff for internal control. During negotiations PTT agreed to
continue employing competent financial consultants until completion of the
above.
4.10     In so far as the Bangchak refinery is concerned, PTT manages the
finances on behalf of the Ministry of Defense who owns the refinery. PTT
records all the transactions pertaining to the refinery on a cash basis under
the Bangchak account. Consolidated PTT does not include Banchak's operating
results (which are reported by the Ministry of Defense) but includes all the
liabilities incurred on behalf of the refinery.
4.11     In accordance with the standard practice in Thailand for state
enterprises, external audit is undertaken by the National Audit Office. The
audited accounts of PTT, the Natural Gas Operations unit, MKT and, relevant
records pertaining to Bangchak refinery will be submitted to the Bank within
six months after the end of each financial year.
4.12     PTT will carry adequate third party insurance in respect of its LPG
facilities in line with industry and Thai practice. The contractors will be
responsible under the contracts for contractor's risk and project related
insurance.  PTT already has comprehensive insurance covering its other risks
in line with normal Thai practice. PTT will arrange for safety inspections of
all pipelines, pressure vessels etc.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
5.01     PTT was established to engage in and promote a full range of
petroleum and petrochemical activities. While PTT's major activities are not
organized under separate legal entities, each of them is a separate accounting
unit and is managed on a profit-center basis.
5.02     PTT's operating results have been dominated by the Marketing (Oil
Distribution and Supply) unit (SIKT). At present, the overall financial
position of PTT is weak, especially in regards to liquidity (para. 5.05).
Nonetheless, given appropriate remedial measures, it can improve its present
position substantially. The Natural Gas Operations Unit (ONG), the core
operating arm of PTT, started operation from the beginning of FY82. ONG is
forecast to have a major impact on PTT's overall profitability, while MKT and
Bangchak refinery transactions will continue to have a significant impact on
the turnover and cash flow position. Subject to taking the remedial action
outlined below, PTT is projected to develop and maintain a satisfactory
financial position.
Past and Present Finances
5.03     PTT's consolidated finances over the last two years are summarized
below and shown in detail in Annex 5.01 and 5.02.

Operating Ratio                           0.97          0.99
Current Ratio                             0.99          0.85
Receivables Turnover (days)                 88            96
Debt/Equity Ratio                        67/33          92/8
5.04     In FY80, PTT's operating income was. deTived solely from its
marketing-arm, MKT, which reported net income of $28 million. However, it had
to incur substantial short-term debt to meet the liquidity needs arising from
slow turnover of its receivables. This was mainly due to the delayed payments
by EGAT, and to a lesser extent, the Oil Stabilization Fund. Moreover, the
inadequacy of MKT's accounting, billing and control system hindered effective
management of its accounts receivable (para.4.08). In addition to financing



- 37 -
working capital, short-term debt was incurred to bridlye finance the
construction of the natural gas transmission system._   As a result, the
current ratio was slightly less than 1.0, reflecting the weak cash flow
position of PTT.
5.05     In FY81 consolidated PTT suffered a net loss estimated at $43 million
mainly as a result of a foreign exchange loss on oil trading by MKT and high
interest expenses. MKT continued to draw down substantial credit lines to
finance its receivables. While EGAT had begun to make timely payments to MKT
fo- fuel oil supplies, the receivable from the Oil Stabilization Fund had
accumulated by early 1982 to a high level of $125 million. The Bangchak
refinery also imposed major strains on PTT's cash flow position, including a
permanent working capital requirement in the order of $300 million. The
further weakening of PTT's liquidity position was indicated by the current
ratio which fell to 0.85. PTT's debt/equity ratio increased from 67/33 in
FY80 to 92/8 in FY81, reflecting the drawdown of long-term financing for the
construction of the gas transmission system. Total liabilities, 70% of which
were current, reached $1.1 billion by end FY81, as compared to an equity base
of only $26 million after the net loss.
5.06     Both the Government and PTT are aware of the need to strengthen the
company's financial position, especially its liquidity. A special
subcommittee had been set up to consider various remedial measures. The
proposal of the subcommittee has received Cabinet approval and the principal
terms are outlined as follows:
A.   PTT would seek commercial financing of $200 million, interest
and principal on which would be paid by the Government for PTT
to pay the lenders. Of this amount, $125 million represents the
payment of the Oil Fund's indebtedness to PTT in FY82, while the
balance ($75 million) represents equity injection into PTT. The
$75 million would initially be an interest free loan and would
be converted into equity in line with payments by the Government
to PTT equivalent to the principal.
B.   For purposes of compliance with the regulation for crude and
products reserves, the inventory of MKT and Bangchak refinery
can be consolidated, resulting in a lower level of required
inventory for overall PTT.
The above action plan is satisfactory in alleviating PTT's short-term
liquidity problems. However, it is inadequate to strengthen the company's
finances over the balance of the 1980's. During negotiations the Bank
reviewed and agreed with Government and PTT a comprehensive set of measures
including A and B above and also provision to build up PTT's equity base to

natural gas transmission system, delayed effectiveness of two long-
term loans necessitated bridge financing in excess of $40 million.

cushion unexpected losses by retaining 1/ not less than 90% of its net income,
(par. 5.12), and standards set out below in regards to PTT's liquidity
position (para. 5.09), debt service coverage (para 5.15) and overall debt
position (para 5.15). Policy in respect of margins and agreed action
relating to Bangchak are set out in paragraph 5.08. The $200 million referred
to will be available in May and will therefore be a condition of effectiveness.
Future Finances
5.07     In the light of the steps as outlined above to strengthen the
company's finances, PTT's financial position is projected to be satisfactory
throughout the forecast period at least in respect of the activities currently
in operation or firmly planned. Financial projections over FY82-90 are shown
in Annex 5.05, 5.06 and 5.07, with detailed assumptions in Annex 5.03. During
negotiations Government agreed that it would review with the Bank, from time
to time, natural gas pricing policy, PTT's corporate plans and development
programs and the financial position of PTT. Discussions on petroleum pricing
policy will follow from the SAL process. The longer term corporate and
financial objectives of PTT are already covered by the statement of corporate
and financial objectives agreed under 1773TH, nonetheless, during
negotiations, assurance were sought and given by PTT that the agreed corporate
and financial objectives would also be applied to its transactions in respect
of Bangchak refinery and to joint ventures. (See Annex 5.15 for amended
policy statement).

net income after appropriation for reserves is to be remitted to the
Government.

/a       Includes bulk and retail LPG sales.
(a)   Natural Gas Operations Unit (ONG)
Financial forecast of ONG is shown in detail in Annex 5.08, 5.09 and
5.10. Before the gas plant begins operation end FY84, ONG will only
have two customers, namely EGAT (the major consumer) and Siam
Cement. Satisfactory gas sales contracts have recently been
concluded with both customers, and adequate margins are provided
between the purchase price of Union gas and the selling prices.
However, the gas price to EGAT will have to be renegotiated in FY84
and it has been assumed in the financial forecast that renewal will
be made on comparable terms. The Government has confi med its
intentions to price natural gas on the present basis-1 when the
pricing aspects of the contract are renewed. PTT's first contract
with Union Oil provides for a maximum average daily gas supply of 250
MMSCFD.  At this level of gas sales, ONG is projected to perform
satisfactorily, providing the renegotiated gas price to EGAT
1/       Natural gas to EGAT is presently based on production cost plus an
agreed transportation margin.  Escalation provisions are related to
cost of gas and increased operating costs. There is a fall-back
provision related to Singapore fuel oil movements. The Siam Cement
contract is broadly similar.



- 40 -
maintains an adequate margin. Given the second gas supply contract
which was recently concluded with Union Oil and provides for an
additional gas supply of up to 400 MMSCFD, the revenue position of
ONG is expected to be substantially enhanced by the planned
investments in gas and gas derivative projects (para. 5.11). The
first unit of gas plant (the proposed project) is projected to yield
a DCF financial rate of return of 30% in real terms. The operating
ratio of ONG is forecast to be about 0.8, reflecting the composite
operating efficiency of gas pipelines and gas plants. ONG's annual
return on revalued net fixed assets is expected to increase from 14%
in FY82 to about 19% in FY90, depending on the timing of the next
major gas pipeline. During negotiations, PTT agreed that it will
revalue its fixed assets annually for all its operations for the
purposes of measuring achieved rate of return on revalued fixed
assets (see also the statement of corporate objectives, Annex 5.15).
(b) Marketing (Oil Distribution and Supply) unit and Bangchak refinery
Financial forecast of MKT is shown in detail in Annexes 5.11, 5.12,
5.13 and 5.14. The major factors affecting the revenue positions of
MKT and the Bangchak refinery are the stipulated margins and interest
expenses. Provided that adequate margins are maintained as well as
reduction in interest expenses by decreasing short-term debt (para.
5.09), both MKT and Bangchak refinery should have a satisfactory
financial position. In so far as Bangchak is concerned, PTT acts as
the banker and substantial short-term borrowings will continue to be
incurred on behalf of the refinery. During negotiations, the
Government restated its current policy in respect of products pricing
which includes adequate margins for refining and marketing, and which
are sufficient to enable both MKT and Bangchak refinery to achieve
financial soundness. PTT agreed to put forward proposals by June 30,
1983, recommending solutions to the problems related to its role in
respect of Bangchak, and the Government agreed to cause PTT to come
up with an earlier solution should this be necessary.
Liquidity Position
5.09     Liquidity will remain a major concern for PTT.  To ensure the
financial soundness of the company, it is imperative that the turnover of its
sizeable receivables be monitored closely and maintained at an acceptable
level. Towards this end, PTT has recently engaged financial consultants to
assist in the strengthening of MKT's accounting, billing and control system
(para. 4.09). In addition, the plan to strengthen PTT's finances is expected
to include measures which would alleviate the company's presently weak cash
flow position including refinancing the Oil Stabilization Fund and retention
of a major portion of net income. Furthermore, equity injection is proje-cted
to help finance the project and a portion of the permanent working capital
needs. Based on appropriate remedial measures and receipts of payments at the
contracted trade terms, the liquidity position of PTT is projected to be
reasonably satisfactory. During negotiations PTT agreed to maintain a current
ratio of at least 1.0.

Debt Service Coverage                1.9       1.4        -           1.1
5.11     PTT's total investment program is projected to have reached $3
billion by 1990. The planned investment schedule is presented in detail in
Annex 5.0.  From FY82 through 86, investments include the proposed LPG
project - , second unit of gas separation plant, LPG retail distribution,
natural gas pipelines to transmit additional gas supplies from offshore
fields, a petroleum products pipeline and strategic storage for crude oil.  In
addition, a joint venture arrangement has been planned for the investment in
an ethylene cracking plant, with PTT participating in 48% of the equity. The
investment program from FY87 to FY90 includes LPG distribution, and a natural
gas pipeline to the south. The investment program appears sensible and will
enhance PTT's long-term profitability, although a more prudent financial
approach would suggest slowing down the program. This aspect is being
considered by the Thai authorities.
5.12     Provided that accounts receivable turnover is maintained at the
contracted trade terms, ONG can generate substantial surplus cash which can
meet a reasonable portion of the local currency requirements of investments.
The Government has agreed that PTT should retain no less than 90% of its net
profits as well as the $75 million equity, unless PTT can finance out of its
surplus funds from operation 30% of its capital expenditure, based on a
forecast of average annual investment for the next three years. Cash required
for debt services (both long and short term) including interest during
construction, all taxes and customs duties as well as working capital
1/       ONG will be responsible for the gas plant while MKT will be in charge
of LPG bulk storage and distribution.



- 42 -
requirements have to be covered by internally generated cash before applying
the 90% retention calculation. During negotiations PTT also affirmed that
surplus funds from each of its operational units would be applied for other
purposes only after ensuring sufficient funds for that unit, including the
coverage of operating costs, debt service and contribution to a reasonable
portion of future investments. (A comparable agreement relating to ONG, now
superseded, was included in 1773-TH).
5.13     While PTT is a relatively new company, it has had no difficulty in
raising funds in the foreign capital markets. It is envisaged that PTT will
continue to get access to suppliers' and buyers' credits, and financing from
commercial banks and development institutions to fill the financing gap,
especially in meeting foreign currency requirements.
Capital Structure
5.14     The financial forecast indicates that PTT's debt/equity ratio can be
reduced steadily from the present high level of 92/8 to 74/26 in 1985 and,
51/49 in 1990. PTT's surplus funds from operations are projected to finance
up to 30% of its capital expenditure and, accordingly, 90% of its net profits
are forecast to be retained by PTT throughout the forecast period.
5.15     Reassurances were obtained from PTT that no long-term debt will be
incurred by PTT without prior agreement by the Bank, unless agreed forecasts
show that the debt service coverage of consolidated PTT will be at least 1.2
times for FY82 through FY85 and 1.5 times thereafter, and this will replace
the corresponding agreement relating to ONG in the loan agreement for
1773TH. Furthermore, with the view towards controlling short-term debt, PTT
agreed that total liabilities/equity ratio would be decreased from the present
high level of 98/2 to at most 90/10 for FY83 and 84, 85/15 for FY85 and 86,
and 70/30 thereafter.

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
6.01     The primary justification of the project is the savings which will
accrue to Thailand by upgrading the use of its natural gas from a replacement
for fuel oil, enabling import substitution and exports of LPG/propane, and
providing the basic feedstock for petrochemical industry. Thailand's foreign
exchange position will be enhanced and the benefits of the gas will become
more widely available.
6.02     The LPG will be used in households, hotels, restaurants, and industry
and as an automotive fuel. The gas separation plant will initially displace
imported LPG and will provide exports for a few years, subsequently a further
gas separation plant will be required or Thailand will have to revert to
imports of LPG.
6.03     LPG for motor fuel is planned as a major substitutor for diesel, and
also will be used to substitute for gasoline. The diesel substitution is part
of the overall supply/demand strategy. Natural gasoline from the plant can be
used with little modification as a motor fuel. It will, however, be taken to
the TORC refinery by pipeline for blending.
6.04     In addition to the gas separation plant, Thailand's gas utilization
strategy entails the construction of a steam cracker to produce ethylene and
propylene which are feedstocks for olefin-based petrochemical plants. Ethane
will be produced from the gas separation plant to serve as feedstock for the
steam cracker which is planned to become operational in 1987. Some propane
may also be required as feedstock for petrochemical industries. As a result,
virtually all of the propane production from the proposed project is expected
to be domestically consumed after 1987. A second gas separation plant is
planned for 1987 and a third gas separation plant may be required in the early
1990's.
Economic Benefit Streams
6.05     The benefits of the project are derived from the extraction of
heavier hydrocarbons from the gas stream, including the production of LPG,
propane, ethane and natural gasoline.  In addition, condensate from the dew
point control unit will be stabilized by processing through the gas separation
plant and the recovered natural gasoline will serve as refinery feedstock.
The benefits of import substitution for LPG/propane and diesel are valued at
estimated CIF Bangkok prices with adjustment to the quantities for relative
efficiency, while LPG and propane exports are valued at estimated FOB Bangkok
prices. Stabilized natural gasoline is valued at FOB Bangkok naphtha
prices. As ethane is not traded internationally, its value is estimated by
adjusting upward the value of alternative feedstock for the steam cracker i.e.
naphtha, to reflect the higher value of ethane. Charcoal prices vary
according to season and location, but approximate to LPG prices (PDA study).
For the calculation of economic return on investment, the following prices
have been used:



- 44 -
(1982 prices)
$/ton      $/million Btu
Domestic LPG/Propane
As imported LPG/propane substitute                  350             7.4
As imported diesel substitute                       380            8.8
As charcoal substitute                              350            7.4
Export LPG/propane                                       315            6.6
Ethane                                                   340            6.9
Natural Gasoline (stabilized)                            305            6.6
Cost Streams
6.06     In addition to the capital expenditure for the gas plant, the cost
streams include the value of the feed gas, condensate from the dew point
control unit and operational costs. Up to about 1990, the alternative use of
natural gas is to replace fuel oil and the economic cost of the feed gas is
taken at $5.2/MMBtu ($220/ton) FOB Bangkok, a figure which is slightly high in
view of the continuing fall in world oil prices. From 1991, gas supply will
exceed domestic demand and the value of the gas will fall to LNG netback or
economic production cost. Conservatively, we have taken $3.5/MiBtu thereafter
(1982 prices). Unstablized condensate has been valued at fuel oil equivalent.
Economic Risk
6.07     The major economic risk faced by the project is a permanent reduction
in the premium value of the LPG compared with use as a boiler fuel. The risk
only exists to 1990, beyond that time the value of the gas as a boiler fuel
falls substantially, (see para 6.06) such that there is a wide safety margin
ensuring the plant profitability through the 1990's. Until 1990, however, the
price differential will be sensitive to movements both in fuel oil prices (the
normal comparator for natural gas value) and diesel prices (the normal
comparator for LPG). Given that fuel oil is expected to be in surplus in
South-east Asia through the 1980's and diesel is expected to be in short
supply from time to time, the likely movement in their prices is a tendency to
widen the differential. The two are related over the medium term through
refiners ability to crack fuel oil into diesel and other components, such that
if the prices get too far apart additional cracking facilities will be built,
thus narrowing the gap again. If on the other hand the gap narrows, refiners
will stop cracking fuel oil and the price of fuel oil will fall, thus ensuring
an adequate margin. Short-term fluctuations around these relationships are
inevitable, both for fuel oil/diesel and natural gas/LPG --based on past
relationships the (spot) price of LPG is currently low compared with diesel
prices in South-east Asia. Nevertheless, given that such distortions can last
for a number of years, current fuel oil, LPG and diesel prices have been used
for the economic evaluation. Other economic risks exist but are relatively
minor-- see sensitivity analysis below.

Project Profitability
6.08    (a) Economic Rate of Return.  Based on the assumptions noted above,
the internal rate of return on the project is 29%. The results of sensitivity
analyses performed are summarized as follows:
Economic Rate of Return
Base Case                                                      29
Case I          Value of benefits increased by 10%             47
Case 2          Cost of feed gas increased by 1O%
(i.e. a reduction in the margin by
about one-third)                              13
Case 3          Cost overruns 20%                              25
Case 4          No ethane extraction                           21
The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the economic rate of return
is sensitive primiarily to the price differential between LPG and fuel oil, and
is somewhat less sensitive to other factors, the most important of which is
the value of ethane extraction. It is fairly insensitive to the capital cost
of investment.
6.09     (b)  Net Present Value.  At a discount rate of 12%, the average net
annual savings from the project are estimated at $58 million. The net present
value throughout the project life is $409 million.
6.10     (c)  Payback Period.  On an undiscounted basis the pay-back period
after start-up is three years. At a discount rate of 12%, the pay-back period
is five years which is satisfactory.
Qualitative Benefits
6.11     Bank staff have already assisted PTT in the approach to selecting
consultants, designing studies, costing projects, in bid specification and
evaluation, safety standards and market surveys, with a view to greater self-
reliance in future. Substantial transfer of technology to Thai nationals is
envisaged in view of the project component which provides for engineering
consultancy services, including a training program for PTT's staff, and also
from the pilot LPG marketing efforts. Moreover, the project provides for the
distribution of LPG. thereby bringing the benefits of the natural gas project
directly to the Thai population in both urban and rural areas. In addition,
in promoting the substitution of wood and charcoal by LPG as a cooking fuel,
the project helps to alleviate the problem of deforestation in Thailand.
Furthermore, the use of LPG in vehicles is expected to reduce air pollution in
urban areas, especially in Bangkok, although no attempt has been made to
quantify these benefits.

VII. RECOM4ENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a)  it would provide about $35 million in the form of equity towards
the project, in addition to the $75 million below (para. 3.28);
(b)  it would exempt PTT from contribution of 90% of its net income
unless PTT's self/financing ratio exceeds 30% (para 5.12);
(c)  it would confirm that PTT's renegotiated gas price to EGAT would
be on comparable terms with the provisions of the existing
contract (para 5.08);
(d)  it would review with the Bank, from time to time, the pricing
policy for natural gas, as well as the financial position of PTT
(para. 5.07);
(e)  it will refinance the Oil Stabilization Fund and ensure the Fund
pays its obligations to PTT (para. 5.06);
(f)  it will provide $75 million equity for PTT, (para 5.06) (see (c)
above)
(g)  it will reduce the required inventory for crude oil and products
by consolidating MKT and Bangchak requirements (para. 5.06).
(h)  it will commission a study on natural gas pricing to be
completed in 1983 (para 1.28).
(i)  if necessary it will cause PTT to come forward with
recommendations to deal with Bangchak problems (see 7.02(o) and
para 5.08)
7.02     Assurances were obtained from PTT that:
(a)  Studies would be carried out in accordance with terms of
reference and a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank; as
detailed in Annex 3.03.
b)   consultants will be required to prepare a suitable training
program for LPG operations. PTT will forward this to the Bank
for review. PTT will commence implementation of its training
program by July 1, 1983 (para. 3.35);
(c)  a progress report in an agreed format would be forwarded to the
Bank at agreed intervals and a project control system would be
implemented (para. 3.34);

about one-third)                             13
Case 3         Cost overruns 20%                             25
Case 4         No ethane extraction                          21

after start-up is three years. At a discount rate of 12%, the pay-back period
is five years which is satisfactory.
Qualitative Benefits
6.11     Bank staff have already assisted PTT in the approach to selecting
consultants, designing studies, costing projects, in bid specification and
evaluation, safety standards and market surveys, with a view to greater self-
reliance in future. Substantial transfer of technology to Thai nationals is
envisaged in view of the project component which provides for engineering
consultancy services, including a training program for PTT's staff, and also
from the pilot LPG marketing efforts. Moreover, the project provides for the
distribution of LPG, thereby bringing the benefits of the natural gas project
directly to the Tlai population in both urbaa and rural areas.  In addition,
in promoting the substitution of wood and charcoal by LPG as a cooking fuel,
the project helps to alleviate the problem of deforestation in Thailand.
Furthermore, the use of LPG in vehicles is expected to reduce air pollution in
urban areas, especially in Bangkok, although no attempt has been made to
quantify these benefits.

GLOSSARY
Natural gas                  -    a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, consisting
mainly of methane togetner with ethane, propane,
butane and natural gasolines. The natural gas can
be used as boiler fuel or various components can
be extracted and balance used as fuel.
Liquified natural gas:       -    natural gas cooled to a liquid state as LNG for
economy of sea transport. May consist of all the
typical components of natural gas or may have
some of the natural gas liquids extracted.
Methane:                     -    the lightest component of natural gas. Used for
boiler fuel but may also be used as feedstock for
ammonia, methanol and other products.
Ethane:                      -    normally gaseous, may be liquified or compressed
for pipeline transport. Used as petrochemical
feedstock for polyethylenes, PVC etc. Ethane is
rarely exported.
Propane:                     -    normally gaseous but liquified for pipeline
transport or distribution in bottles. Used for
petrochemicals (eg polypropylene), for industrial
heat or as motor fuel.
Butane:                      -    gaseous but becomes liquid under slight pressure.
Used for cooking, lighting, for industrial heat,
for blending with gasoline or, in hot countries,
as a motor fuel.
Liquified petroleum gas:   -    a mixture of propane and butane, (LPG) typically
ranging from 30/70 to 50/50. Liquid at a lower
pressure than propane and hence safer. Used in
domestic applications and as a motor fuel.
Natural gasoline:            -    a mixture of natural gas liquids heavier than
butane. Used as a gasoline blending feedstock in
refineries.
Ethylene                     i   normally a gas, obtained by cracking ethane or
light hydrocarbons at high temperature. It is a
liquid at -1030C and used as base material for
the production of polyethylenes (plastic films
and containers).
Propylene                    -    normally a gas, obtained by cracking propane or
light hydrocarbons at high temperature. It is a
liquid at -460C and used as base material for the
production of polypropylene (plastics).

Eastern Seaboard Development Plan
The Government of Thailand has decided to encourage the Eastern Seaboard area
(Sattahip, Rayong, Chonburi) as the location of of its major new energy-based
industries, providing a focal point for growth outside of Bangkok. The area
is ideally located with good access to the sea, proximity to the energy
supplies, substantial areas of flat land, sufficient labor, good
communications under construction, and yet within 100 kilometers of Bangkok.
The gas pipeline system financed under Loan 1773TH runs through the area and
has provision for offtakes for industrial, commercial and domestic supplies.
The Bank is also financing a regional planning study of the Eastern Seaboard
(being conducted by Coopers and Lybrand) which will identify the
infrastructure required to support industrial development and associated
urbanization. A technical assistance project being prepared for possible Bank
financing will support the design of infrastucture for the first phase of the
the regional program.
The region is relatively well endowed with infrastructure to support the
proposed industries. Sattahip port will be developed as a commercial harbour
to serve the planned projects. Power supply is available and fresh water will
be piped to the gas separation plant for Dok Drai reservoir with ample
capacity for future water demand.
On behalf of PTT, Davy McKee have recently completed a gas utilization study
recommending appropriate uses for the gas likely to be brought ashore during
the 1980's. The principal options for the decade are
(i)          A gas separation plant complex, probably comprising two units in
the 1980's each processing 350 MMSCFD of gas, with provision for a third unit.
The first of these units is the subject of this project.
(ii)         An olefins complex comprising of a core unit to produce ethylene
and propylene which will feed dowstream low and high density polyethylenes,
polypropylene and ethylene glycol units.
(iii)        A fertilizer complex to produce ammonia and its derivatives
(Urea, NPK) for which a contract award has recently been determined.
(iv)         Methanol and related chemicals with a possibility of using
methanol as a cutter stock in gasoline and diesel vehicles.
Other industries such as soda ash are under study for incorporation in the
overall development program. Total investment would be about US$3 billion.
If all of these industries are developed Thailand will need a major
reinforcement of its offshore pipeline system, or to cut back on supplies to
EGAT. There is sufficient time to delay this decision until after key
decisions have been taken on the major new industrial uses (See also Annex
1.03 for the supply/demand balance.
IFC and PTT are jointly studying the olefins petrochemical complex with a view
to determining the most beneficial products and appropriate configuration,
taking into account wider factors such as the energy balance for olefins
feedstock. One of the key objectives of the study is to determine how best to



ANNEX 1.05
- 55 -                        Page 2 of 2
make the development suitable for private sector investment, both as a joint
venture partner in the ethylene cracker and to undertake the whole of the
downstream investment.
All the possible investments have been studied a number of times over the last
four years. The Davy McKee study is the first independent comprehensive
study. Both IFC and IPD expect to give advice and technical assistance as
part of their normal lending operations for a number of these projects.
In respect of planning and coordinating the overall urban and industrial
infrastuctural needs, the Bank is working closely with the Eastern Seaboard
Committee and is preparing a technical assistance project.

Energy Sector
National Energy Board Committee
The committee was formed under the act establishing the National Energy
Administration. It is comprised of representatives of the principal public
sector agencies in the energy sector (NEA, PTT, EGAT, MEA, PEA, Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Industry, NESDB, Ministry of Defense. It is chaired by a
deputy prime minister. There are thirteen subcommittees, including natural
gas pricing policy, petroleum planning, power and the energy master plan.
National Petroleum Policy Committee (NPPC)
NPPC currently has two sub-committees, chaired by members of the NPPC.
(a)  Sub-Committee on Supply Planning, Pricing and Compensation of
Petroleum Products. Its main functions are to carry out studies
and propose policy measures pertaining to: (i) the supply,
production, import and export of petroleum products to meet
present and future demands; (ii) the pricing of petroleum
products, and (iii) the collection and disbursement of funds
into and out of the Oil Stabilization Fund.
(b)  Sub-Committee on Refinery Expansion.  Its main functions are:
(i) to determine the criteria and conditions for modifying or
expanding existing refineries or establishing new refineries to
increase the refining capacity of the nation; and (ii) to
monitor the technical, economic, financial and legal aspects of
refinery operations, including the conduct of contract
negotiations with oil companies involved in, or requesting to
carry out, refinery operations in Thailand.
(c) Sub-Committee on Oil Procurement and Distribution. Its main
functions are to study the logistics of oil procurement and
distribution and to recommend appropriate policy measures.
Other Committees in the Energy Sector. There are several other committees
playing a salient role in the energy sector:
-    two committees appointed by the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB) (a) to assess the economic benefits of
LPG (now completed); and (b) to assess the proposed liquified
natural gas exports;
-    a power sector policy development committee chaired by a Deputy
Prime Minister, two sub-committees on electricity tariffs and
one on nuclear power.
-    a foreign loan committee
-    a committee to plan development of oil and natural gas
discovered in northeast and north Thailand, including follow up
work. The Committee is to be headed by the Deputy Minister of
Industry and DMR to provide secretarial services.

Sectoral Organisation
Exploration and Production. All exploration and production is by foreign oil
companies (excepting the 300bpd of oil from Ministry of Defense areas at
Fang). Two overseas groups, those headed by Union Oil and Texas Pacific, are
active in the Gulf of Thailand in the search for oil and gas, and have found
substantial gas reserves. Six other foreign oil companies, have licenses
onshore and offshore. The Government has options to take an equity interest
in several of the more promising prospects, but to date has not done so.
Refining. There are three major refineries, each of about the same size
(after the ongoing Esso expansion) and one minor refinery. The Thailand Oil
Refining Company (TORC) is expected to become a joint venture between Shell,
Thai private interests and PTT. The BangChak refinery is owned by the
Government and operated by the Ministry of Defence and PTT. The wholly-owned
Esso refinery will constitute 35% on completion of debottlenecking. Fang
refinery (Ministry of Defence) has 1% of total capacity.
Marketing. Retail oil product marketing is in the hands of essentially the
same organizations as refining, plus Caltex. Shell, Esso and PTT are the
largest retailers supplied respectively by the TORC, Esso and PTT (BangChak)
refineries. All natural gas transmission and marketing is being handled by
PTT.

Project Description
I. Gas Plant
1.1      The gas plant project consists of the following main sections:
-      gas separation plant at Rayong
-      Product transfer and Water Pipelines
-      Marine Terminal at Laem Chabang
The natural gas from different fields in the Gulf of Thailand is transported
through a 34" submarine pipeline to the gas separation plant located at
Rayong, about 30 km east of Sattahip.
The gas passes a slug catcher and is split into two streams. One
stream is treated in a dew point control unit to obtain pipeline quality of
sales gas and then sent to the Power plants.
The other stream will be used as the feed for the gas separation
plant together with the pentane plus condensate from the dew point control
unit.
In the gas separation plant the natural gas streams will be treated
to eliminate C02 and water and subsequently be separated into ethane, propane,
LPG, natural gasoline and sales gas. The ethane will be used as feed stock
for an ethylene plant to be built adjacent to the gas separation plant at a
later date. Until then it will be combined with the sales gas to be used in
the power plants near Bangkok.
The propane, and LPG products will be transported by pipelines over a.
distance of approximately 60 km to the marine terminal at Laem Chabang. The
natural gasoline product pipeline goes via the marine terminal and hasa branch
connection to the TORC refinery.
The propane product is used for local consumption and the surplus for
export. Later, part of propane production will be fed to the ethylene plant.
LPG will be used for domestic consumption either from the truck and
barge loading station of the marine terminal and the truck loading station of
the gas separation plant or from the future railroad loading station on the
way to the terminal. The railroad loading station shall be able to receive
the LPG from both the gas separation plant and the marine terminal.
The natural gasoline will be processed and blended into motor
gasoline in the existing TORC refinery near the marine terminal.
The main characteristics of the overall project are shown on the
block flow diagram (Page 7).
Included in the project are new housing areas to be built near the
gas separation plant and near the Marine Terminal for the accomodation of the

-    Chon Buri
Bangkok, Surat Thani and SongKhla installations will receive
LPG/propane by barge ranging from 500 to 2,000 DWT while the other
installations will be by road tankers and, where the rail sidings are
constructed, at a later date by rail tank wagons.
2.2      The Bulk Storage installations will have the following facilities:
-    receiving headers
-    pressurised spherical tanks
-    pumping stations for transferring LPG/propane to marketing
depots
-    filling headers and loading arms
-    fire fighting system with water supply
-    administration building
-    control and operation building
2.3      PTT will provide marketing depots in the vicinity of the Bulk Storage
installations and at distribution centers. Private marketing companies will
also provide similar facilities for retail marketing. These depots will
receive LPG/propane from the Bulk Storage installations by tank lorries or
short pipelines if distance warrants it. The marketing depots will generally
consist of the following:
-    loading and unloading arms
-    operational storage tanks between 100 and 200 M.tons
-    cylinder filling stations with all their auxiliaries like
cylinder testing and painting, storage sheds and fork lift
trucks
-    pumping stations
-    fire fighting equipment and water supply
-    administration buildings
2.4      LPG/propane production of the gas separation plant amounts to 460,000
tons per year. Additional transport units will be required gradually starting
from 1984. It is foreseen that for every 100,000 m.tons marketed, the
following facilities and transport units would be required by both PTT and the
private sector, assuming that domestic consumption in provincial areas will be
60% of total consumption.

Thailand - LPG Project
Studies and Technical Assistance
A. Policy and Overall Technical Studies
1. Oil and Gas Reserves
The planning and development of future industries based on natural
gas depends on the size of Thailand's discoveries and their estimated
reserves.   PTT and the Department of Mineral Resources have limited
capabilities to interpret and assess such hydrocarbon potential and reserves.
The Bank loan is proposed to finance the services of a consulting
firm (30 man-months) which will review available data and report on the
activities and findings of operating companies. The report will assess
existing reservoirs and review production levels. The consultant will follow
up at regular intervals and update the data on the qualitative and
quantitative behaviour of the reservoirs and recommend any corrective
downstream operations where oil and gas are utilized. The study will start in
1982 and will cost approximately $500,000 including other expenses like lab
work and use of computer models. It is expected to be completed within 8
months.
2.   Gas Pricing Study
The price of gas purchased under the present agreements with Union
Oil is at the production platform and PTT is responsible for its transport
offshore in the Gulf of Thailand and onshore to power stations and industrial
consumers. The cost of gas from PTT should as a minimum reflect the purchase
price from Union Oil plus the return on PTT's investment in the transport
pipeline system. The difference between gas sales price to consumers and gas
cost to PTT represent their profit margin to finance future investment. Gas
sales price is governed by the price of fuel the gas will substitute,
considering any additional expenses in the conversion process of old
installations.
To avoid lengthy negotiations between PTT and consumers basic
criteria should be studied to reach a price level satisfactory to Government,
PTT and its customers and will serve the government to use the pricing study
in the control of the tariff structure and end product prices.
The Government will assign a consultant to carry out the study which
is expected to start in 1982 and will take 25 man-months. The study will be
integrated with the Petroleum Products Pricing study under the structural
adjustment loan.
3. Gas Purchasing Strategy
The government and PTT have been responding to proposals by various
producers for the sale of gas, but have not been in a position to take the
initiative in deciding from which fields it wishes to purchase gas, or in
deciding any priority or strategy among the various offers. To put itself in



- 69 -                          Annex 3.03
Page 2 of 5
a suitable position PTT should obtain independent studies of the gas reserves
in each significant structure and should update these when new information
comes available. The study currently underway on alternative pipel'ne systems
for offshore gas will need to be continued and completed. Drawing on the
above and the LNG study, PTT should prepare a gas purchasing strategy, with
the help of consultants, which would take account of the probable economics of
various fields, the pipeline implications, diversity of supply among
producers, fields and pipelines, flexibility, competition, joint benefits with
LNG, and longer term alternative sources and demands. The policy and strategy
studies to be financed by the Bank will require 250 man months of consultancy
assistance. Except for updates on gas reserves, all will be completed during
1983.
4.   Small Scale Natural Gas Use
All natural gas is currently used for power and major industrial
users, and the gas utilization study also concentrates on large scale use. It
is unlikely that domestic and small scale industrial and commercial use will
be economically feasible in most of Bangkok because of the numerous canals and
the high water table, taken together with low consumption per customer. It
is, however, possible that direct use of gas would be sensible in other places
close to the transmission system where distribution would be easier, e.g. Chon
Buri and Phatthya, and the new housing for the gas-based industries. A study
is required on the technical, economic and financial feasibility of supplying
gas to small scale users in selected parts of Thailand. The study would be
undertaken during 1983 and would require 20 man-months of consultancy.
5.    LNG Exports
NESDB has already studied the possibility of LNG exports as has a
local commercial group interested in promoting them. Given the rapid increase
in proven and probable reserves and the relatively limited domestic uses, it
is now appropriate to study the circumstances and conditions under which LNG
exports should be considered. The results of the study will be fed into the
overall gas purchasing strategy study, and may appropriately be combined into
that study. The study would be undertaken in 1983, and would require 120 man-
months of consultancy.
6.   Gas Pipeline Options
An Italian Government financed study is being undertaken by Snam
Progetti on the pipeline options for gathering and transmitting offshore
gas. The study is looking at alternative possibilities, including land-based
routes, for taking the gas to the market, and is considering the advantages of
diversity in transmission lines. The study will be completed during 1982, and
will be an important source of information for the gas purchasing strategy
study.  [This study is excluded from the legal requirements relating to
approval, completion, etc.].

B. Project Related Studies and Assistance
7.   LPG Pilot Marketing
PTT has completed, with Bank financing, a sample survey of fuel
utilization in a number of semi-urban and outlying rural areas in Thailand.
The Population and Community Development Association (PDA), a local
organization, has carried out the survey and completed their report which
estimates the LPG annual market potential for household use at approximately
150,000 tons by the year 1990 if marketing facilities are made available to
supply and service these areas. This is in addition to the existing household
market in Bangkok and major provincial cities.
To provide storage and distribution facilities for marketing these
quantities, and due to the costly investments which amounts approximately to
US$50.0 million for each 100,000 tons of LPG marketed domestically, it was
necessary that a pilot marketing study be conducted to test the accuracy of
the findings of the PDA report.
The pilot marketing study will start in the second quarter 1982 on a
number of representative samples in the different communities surveyed.
Distribution facilities will be maintained and marketing results will be
recorded for a period of time ranging between one and three years. The
reported findings would cover, (i) the consumption per unit of household, (ii)
the size of cylinder and the type of appliance, (iii) the percentage of
potential LPG users in each community and their income levels, and (iv) the
safety record and the acceptance level.
PTT will engage a number of local consultants for pilot marketing,
estimated at 390 man-months, together with a foreign consultant at 10 man
months to monitor the work, to coordinate, analyze and report the results of
this study which will be the basis for developing the size of the bulk storage
installations and the respective transport and distribution systems.
8. LPG Bus Fleet and Truck Fleet Demonstration and Operational Assistance
Diesel oil consumption in Thailand exceeds production from
refineries. To meet this demand it will be necessary to install expensive
fuel oil conversion units to produce diesel oil. The transport sector
accounts for 50% of the total diesel oil consumption and any fuel savings in
this sector will reflect on the balance of payments. LPG has been
successfully used in bus and truckfleets in some countries and possible LPG
substitution in diesel fueled buses and trucks in Bangkok and elsewhere would
improve Thailand's shortage of diesel fuel. The proposed Bank loan is
expected to finance the purchase of a number of LPG fueled buses and trucks to
demonstrate their use in the Thai environment and study the operational and
maintenance problems. Future conversion to LPG fueled buses and trucks in
Bangkok will depend on the results of this demonstration. This demonstration
will cost approximately $1.0 million to purchase 5 LPG fueled buses and one
truck complete with spares in addition to the technical assistance required to
consult BMTA on the specification, safety features and operating criteria of
the LPG fueled buses. It is expected that full replacement of the existing
diesel driven buses operating in Bangkok would take about seven years.

C. Investment Related Studies
9. Crude Imports and Port Facilities
The crude refining capacity of Thailand will shortly reach 210,000
bbls/day (10 million tons per year). PTT will study imported crude supply in
VLCC's (very large crude carriers) to save on transport. The storage required
to receive crude transported by the VLCC-s would be increased and will
maintain the strategic storage needed to meet supply fluctuations.
A consulting firm will be invited to perform the study and prepare a
feasibility report. The consultants' work will cover the site selection with
the port facilities having sufficient draught to accommodate the VLCC-s and
the comparison of freight charges for crude tankers.
The consultant is expected to prepare the conceptual design with
possible alternatives to estimate investment costs and calculate the economic
and financial rates of return for the project. The work will start in 1982
and will be completed within 6 months. The consultants' fees is estimated to
be $500,000 which includes 40 man-months' remuneration plus additional costs
of drafting, travel expenses and subsistence.
10.   White Products Pipeline Transport
There are two refineries in Laem Chabang (Esso and Torc) with a total
installed capacity of 110,000 bbls/day and planned for expansion (Esso) to
130,000 bbls/day in 1985. If TORC expansion goes ahead the capacity will be
close to 200,000 bbls/day.  The white products from the two refineries are
transported by barges and trucks which in the future will be costly and
inadequate.  It is therefore required to study other modes of transport
particularly by pipelines. The future LPG quantities of PTT can partly be
added to the quantities of white products to be transported using a
multiproduct pipeline system.
PTT will invite a consulting firm to study the feasibility of this
project for possible implementation with the development of the refining
capacity in the area.
The work will start in 1983 and will be completed in 12 months. It
will cost approximately $1.3 million which covers the work of the consultants
in identifying terminals for existing and future products storage, carry out
route survey and prepare the conceptual engineering design for cost estimate.
11.   Petrochemicals
IFC (World Bank Group) are currently assisting in the analysis of the
alternative petrochemical configurations covering the proposed ethylene
cracker and downstream plants. Conclusions from this study willl be available
mid 1982. It will be followed by detailed feasibility studies, the most
urgent of which is that for the PTT/private sector joint venture ethylene
cracker. The work on the detailed feasibility study will start about third
quarter 1982 and will be completed by June 30, 1983.

D. Other Assistance
12.   Manpower Planning
PTT is expanding rapidly in both the scale of its operations and the
areas of activity. Recruitment has been difficult and significant gaps are
beginning to appear both in planning and operations. So that PTT can identify
the needs in good time, plan its recruitment and training, and ensure the flow
of sufficient graduates and experienced personnel, it needs to develop a
manpower planning system based on its immediate and planned operations. The
study should be undertaken and implemented during 1983 and will require 50
man-months of consultancy.
13.   Management Information System
PTT has a good information system on the national petroleum
situation, but is relatively weak at making use of in-house data for
information and control. Much of the data is used for operations without
taking advantage of the wider possibilities of use. a review is now required
of the information flow within PTT with a view to instituting, if appropriate,
a management information system. The work would be undertaken during 1983/84
and will require 75 man-months of consultancy.

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
1.   PTT-s fiscal year runs from October 1 in the year concerned through the
following September.
I. Consolidated PTT
2.   Consolidated PTT includes (i) Natural Gas Operations Unit (ONG); (ii)
Marketing [Oil Distribution and Supply Unit] (MKT); (iii) certain aspects of
Bangchak refinery; and (iv) headquarters and others. In so far as Bangchak
refinery is concerned, PTT does not keep the accounts of fixed assets and
Bangchak-s operating results are not included in consolidated PTT which,
however, includes all liabilities incurred on behalf of the refinery.
3.   Capital expenditure of $250 million per year has been assumed from FY88
to FY90 to provide for unidentified projects.
II. ONG
A. Natural Gas Pipeline Operations
4.       Selling Price ($/MMBtu)
EGAT Contract
FY82     FY83       FY84      FY85      FY86     FY87      FY88      FY89       FY90
4.17     4.17       4.37      4.61     4.86      5.15      5.46      5.79       6.14
The above prices are estimated according to the provisions of PTT's contract
with EGAT. Siam Cement's gas demand is expected to be very low, totalling
only 30 MMSCFD from FY83 to 85 and 40 MMSCFD thereafter and priced above the
EGAT price.
5.       Cost of Gas ($/MMBtu) including escalation
Union Erawan Contract
FY82     FY83       FY84      FY85      FY86     FY87      FY88      FY89      FY90

The above cost of gas is estimated by the existing contract provisions in the
case of Union (both Erawan and Second contracts) while the purchase prices
from Texas Pacific (TP) are based on the proposals by TP. In practice,
further Union Gas or Esso gas may be contracted before Texas Pacific.
6.       Calorific valtues of gas have been estimated as follows:
Btu/MCF
Union Erawan                    1058
Union second contract           1114
Texas Pacific                    899
7.        Gas Availability.  Total gas supply from Union Oil and Texas Pacific
is assumed as follows:
(in M1ISCFD)
FY82     FY83    FY84    FY85    FY86    FY87    FY88    FY89    FY90

8.       Operating Cost
Assumed to be 0.2% of total capital cost of pipelines and escalated
by local inflation rate assumed as follows:
FY82         FY83        FY84           FY85            FY86  and thereafter
12%          12%         10%             9%              8%
9.     Operating Days.  Assumed to be 365 days.
10.    Depreciation.  Assumed 20 years asset life.  Depreciation expenses are
on a revalued assets basis.
11.    Trade Terms
(i)   Accounts receivable - 45 days of sales.
(ii)  Accounts payable -60 days of capital expenditure, 25 days of feed
gas cost and 30 days of operating costs.
12.    Interest Expenses.  Assumed at 16% for commercial borrowings.  Interest
during construction has been capitalized.
13.    Revaluation Rate.  Revaluation of assets is assumed to be at
international rate i.e. 10.5% in FY80, 9% in FY81, 8% in FY82 and FY83, 7.5%
in FY84, 7% in FY85 and 6% thereafter.

The above prices are in 1982 price terms and are escalated annually by the

ANNEX 5.15
CORPORATE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT
(Schedule 6 of Loan Agreement)
1.       In the carrying out of its operations in accordance with Section 4.01
of this Agreement and the provisions of the PTT Act, the Borrower shall earn a
reasonable rate of return on its fixed assets as revalued annually.
2.       The Borrower shall (i) conduct the affairs of each of its operational
units in such manner that financial, pricing and economic policies of each
such unit will be determined independently and (ii) ensure sufficient cash
flow to each such unit to enable it to meet its operating and maintenance
costs and debt service needs.
3.       The Borrower shall restrict its borrowing or increase its profits, as
appropriate, to ensure tha for each fiscal year of the Borrower its financial
cash generation before payment of interest on loans will cover the Borrower's
debt service requirements by a margin comparable to that for industry
generally and will cover capital expenditures to the extent they need to be
financed from income.
4.       The Borrower shall prepare, on an annual basis, a five year corporate
plan including, among others, Borrower's investment program, a forecast of its
profitability, the projected balance sheets and cash flow, a justification for
its major investments, together with the details of its pricing, economic and
financial policies. The Borrower shall upon the Bank's request, promptly
furnish such plan to the Bank for its comments.
5.       The Borrower shall cause such of its subsidiaries (as defined in
Section 5.02 (c) of this Agreement) as may be agreed to between the Bank and
the Borrower to observe the obligations of the Borrower set forth in this
Schedule to the extent to which such obligations shall or can be applicable
thereto, as though such ogligations were binding upon such subsidiary.
