MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Uganda for SDR 13.8 million (US$18.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a third
technical sesistance project. Co-financing in the form of a grant for US$
2.0 million equivalent is expected from the Government of Canada.
2.       Background:  The present Government, which came to power in
January 1986, inherited an economy and a public service in disarray.  The
new Government had considerable success it, restoring peace and stability
and, in May 1987, it formally launched a program of economic reform which
is being supported by the Special African Facility of the IME and an IDA
Economic Recovery Credit. Initial measures were taken to establish a
realistic exchange rate, reduce the budget deficit, introduce expenditure
controls and limit monetary expansion. The sustainability of the reform
process, however, depends, in part, on the Government's capacity to
implement and monitor the agreed program effectively. The development and
maintenance of this capacity will, in turn, depend upon the restoration of
essential administrative and managerial functions within Government which
have collapsed or been seriously weakened over the years of political
turmoil and economic decline.   In the shert term, immediate assistance
will be needed to strengthen the Government's capacity for sound economic
and financial management and to restore financial discipline in the public
sector. At the same time, the Government must begin the process of
rehabilitating the key government institutions which are responsible for
carrying out the fundamental and indispensable functions of Government
necessary to complete the task of recovery and embark on the longer-term
process of economic and social development.
3.       In previous technical assistance projects (Credit 1077-UG, US$ 8.0
million and Credit 1434-UG, US$ 15.0 million), emphasis was placed on
strengthening the Government's capacity to prepare and monitor development
projects and on establishing effective planning mechanisms. In spite of
the setbacks experienced as a result of political turmoil, progress on the
restoration of the Government's planning capacity has continued to be made,
a system for the monitoring of development projects has been established,
and efforts are currently under way to rehabilitate the country's
statistical base.   In the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Uganda,
however, which had not been the focus of the previous credits and which
must play central roles In the recovery process, capacity has been eroded
by the loss of qualified staff, inadequate material and logistical support,
and the collapse of order and discipline. Improvements in the budgetary
process, expenditure control, debt monitoring and management, government
accounts and government procurement are essential for effective financial
management of the recovery process.
4.       The experience gained from the previous technical assistance
projects clearly demonstrates that an intensive and focused effort such as
that devoted to planning assistance can yield sustainable improvements.
The proposed project will build on the positive results achieved in the



- 2 -
development of effective planning mechanisms and initiate programs to
restore the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Uganda to
carry out the administrative and management functions which are
iadispensable for sound financial management and economic recovery.
5.       Proiect Objectives:  The objectives of the project are tot (a)
establish and institutionalize data collection and analysis in the Ministry
of Finance and the Bank of Uganda; (b) improve the budgeting process to
enable it to function as the Government's primary tool for tranalating
policy initiatives into actions and to eliminate wasteful expenditure; (c)
strengthen the capacity for financial and economic policy formulation in
the Ministry tf Finance; (d) rationalize the Government's procurement
process to reduce costs; and (e) provide long and short-term advisory
services for the implementation and monitoring of the Government's Economic
Recovery Program, with a special emphasis on encouraging qualified Ugandans
currently outside the country to return in order to undertake these tasks.
6.       Proiect Descriptions  Under the project, financing would be
provided for the services of national and international consultants,
training activities, upgrading of facilities, equipment and special studies
to achieve the objectives outlined above through the following project
components:
1. Financial Information System.   Restore the computerized
Government accounting system and develop a financial information system to
Mi) monitor the recovery program, (ii) control expenditures, (iii) meet the
information needs of the revenue generating departments, and monitor
external debt. ($4.2 million).
II. Budget Reform. Strengthen and improve the budget process by
(i) establishing a system for determining objectives and priorities for
recurrent and development expenditures; (ii) developing an appropriate
budget structure and expenditure classification system; (iii) ensuring
budget allocations on the basis of priorities and performance rather than
historical trends; (iv) developing a training system which supports the
budget reform exercise. ($2.8 million).
III. Government Procurement Functions. Rationalize procurement by
(i) re-establishment or the authority of the Central Ternder Board, (ii)
establishment of appropriate competitive bidding procedures, and (iii)
centralization of provis'oning, procurement, storage and distribution of
common user items. ($4.3 million).
IV. Manaaement of the Recovery Process. Strengthen the capacity
of the core ministries to plan and monitor economic recovery by financing
(i) logistical and short-term advisory assistance to the Economic Analysis
Unit in the Ministry of Finance $0.9); and (ii) a resettlement program to
encourage the return to government service of highly qualified expatriate
Ugandans and the provision of special advisory services (to the extent
possible by Ugandan nationals currently working abroad) to assist in
implementation of the recovery program ($6.2 million).
V. Statistics Rehabilitation Program. Continue support to the
statistics rehabilitation program initiated under the Second Technical
Assistance Credit which is developing the requisite data base for the
implementation and monitoring of the recovery process and subsequent
development programs ($2.1).
VI. Aaricultural Secretariat. Continue support to the Agricultural
Secretariat which is charged with formulating, coordinating, directing and
reviewing key policies and programs in the agricultural sector ($2.5).

7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Rehabilitation of the GoverrAment's
fundamental administrative and management functions is essential for the
implementation of the economic recovery program and for sustained economic
growth. Although IDA has had considerable success in bringing together
substantial donor resources in support of Uganda's Economic Recovery
Program, the major concern expressed by the donor community has b^en
whether the Government has the capacity to implement the extensive and
complex action programs necessary for success. The project specifically
addresses this concern by providing the resources required to strengthea
the core ministries through technical assistance and a program to attract
expatriate Ugandans back to their country to contribute their skills and
experience to national reconstruction and recovery. The project will
provide the technical and advisory services which are immediately required
for the implementation of the recovery program while, at the same time,
initiating a longer-term program to rehabilitate essential government
administrative and management functions and the development of the
appropriate linkages between them.
8.       Agreed Actions:  The project supports the policy actions which
have been agreed in the context af the IDA Economic Recovery Credit.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to submit to IDA by July 31,
1989 evridence that it had secured the equivalent of not less than $2.0
million for financing the Statistics Rehabilitation Program. Conditions of
Disbursement: a) procurement component: agreement on division of
responsibilities betwee; Central Tender Board and proposed Supplies
Directorate and on detailed work program including extent of centralization
and initial budget for the Directorate; b) financial information system
component: completion of the Requirements Definition and Strategy Study for
the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Uganda and preparat,on of a prioritized
work program.
9.       Justification and Risks:  The Project would help the Ugandan
Government remove major institutional obstacles to effective implementation
of the recovery program and start a process of rehabilitating the
administrative infrastructure and institutional environment essential to
sustain economic recovery. The major risks associated with the project are
the difficulty of sustaining institutional reforms in the face of
inadequate civil service remuneration, and resistance to reform on the part
of those who benefit from the current lack of fiscal discipline and
budgetary control. To offset these risks, the present Government has
initiated a number of measures to reduce the size of the civil service, to
restore discipline, and to increase wages for remaining employees.
Improvement of working conditions through the provision of adequate
supplies and logistical support under the proposed project will also
increase morale and productivity in the units affected.
10.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed project and that the
Association administer the CIDA grant.
