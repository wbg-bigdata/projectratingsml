Project Completion Report
RURAL ACCESS ROADS PROJECT
(Loar 1305/Credit 651-KE
Preface
(i)     Loan 1305/Credit 651-KE for the Kenya Rural Access Roads Project
(RARP) of US$ 8.0 million equivalent was signed on July 9, 1976 and was
made effective on October 7, 1976. The closing date was extended from June
30, 1981 to December 31, 1984 (42 months). Credit 651-KE (US$ 4.0 million)
was fully disbursed while Loan 1305-KE (US$ 4.0 million) was 582 disbursed
and the balance of US$ 1.7 million (42X) was cancelled.
(ii)    The Government's development plan of 1974-1978 gave emphasis to
developing qsrm to market centers access roads and this has received
support from the Bank and other donors. The Government's Rural Ac^ess
Roads Program was initially to construct 14,000 km of rural access roads at
a total cost of US$ 100 million which was later reduced to 9,000 km when it
was realised that the target could not be achieved by June 1985 because of
the slot implementation of RARP due to lack of donors' financial support in
its early stage of implementation, implementation capacity constraints and
lack of experience in labor-based road construction. Finally, it was
decided by Government to close the RAR Program by completing some 7,600 km.
(iii)    The Bank participated in implementing part of the Rural Access
Roads Program by financing: (i) equipment and operations of eight
construction units for three years each, (ii) equipment and training aids
for the training program; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) monitoring and
evaluation of the RAR Program; and (v) RAR Program maintenance vehicles.
(iv)   The Bank, since 1960, has provided US$304.2 million for projects
in the highway sector including improvement, strengthening and upgrading of
trunk and primary roads and construction of agriculture, sugar and tea
roads. The ongoing Second Highway Sector Project, Loan 2409/Special Fund
17-KE, approved on May 8, 1984, became effective on September 26.
(v)     The PCR was prepared by Bank staff based on information contained
in the Loan Application, the Project Appraisal Report, a review of the Bank
files including supervision and progress reports, information obtained from
the Government, and interviews and discussions, during a mission to Kenya
in March 1985, with Kenyan officials and other donors who participated in
the financing of the RARP program.
(vi)    In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower and the cofinanciers for comments. Comments
received are shown as an attachment to the report.

*                                Rural Access Roads Project (RARP)
(Loan 1305/Credit 651-KE)
Highlights
The Government Rural Access Roads Program was initially to
construct 14,000 km of rural access roads which was subsequently reduced,
in agreement with participating donors, to 9,000 km when it was realized
that ',e target could not be achieved by June 1985 because of the slow
Implementation of RARP due to lack of donors' financial support in its
early stage of implementation, implementation capacity constraints and lack
of experience in labor-based road construction. The Bank's participation
was to assist in construction of 1,000 km by financing US$ 8.0 million out
of a total RAR Program cost of US$ 100 million. The RAR Program received
financial assistance from USAID, DANIDA, Netherlands, NORAD, CIDA and ODA
which amounted to a total US$ 51.2 million at the 1975 exchange rates.
The project was closed on December 31, 1984, 42 months after the
appraisal estimated date of June 30, 1981. Credit 651-KE US$ 4.0 million
was fully disbursed while Loan 1305-KE (US$4.0 million) was 58% disbursed
and US$ 1.7 million (42%) was cancelled.
At project completion date 1,590 kms (159% of the planned target)
were constructed to formation level out of which 850 km were gravelled;the
gravelling of 640 km is continuing under the First Highway Sector Project,
Loan 1684-KE, while the remaining 100 km are considered not to require
gravelling because of the good quality of the subgrade material. Annual
production rate per construction unit was estimated at 45 km both for
formation level construction and gravelling. Actual average production
rates were 30 km (67%) for formation level construction and 15 km (33%) for
gravelling. The appraisal estimated operational cost was US$4,300 per km
net of contingencies, in 1975 prices. Applying contingencies as assumed at
appraisal, over the seven years implementation period, the cost amounts to
US$8,200 per km in current prices. Based on MOTC's expenditure report
(Annex 5) the average expenditure, less part of the training component, was
US$ 8,902 per km (109% of appraisal) out of which US$7,313 (82%) was direct
operational cost and US$1,589 per km (18%) was overhead cost.
Under the Training Expansion Program the planned target for the
RAR Program was to train 1,428 staff in 5 years (1976-1980) but in the same
period only 484 staff (34%) were trained. At project closing date,
December 31, 1984, 1,013 RARP staff (71%) had been trained. The apparently
low output is mainly due to the planned training target being very
ambitious and reduction of the planned construction target from 14,000 km
to 9,000 (64%).



-vii-
The Government used only 2% of the funds allocated for technical
assistance under the Bank's Loan/Credit. Nevertheless the RAR Program was
provided with many expatriate staff financed by other donors (their number
reaching a maximum of 19 in 1979). This explains the low utilization of
the technical assistance component under the Bank project.
For the monitoring and evaluation component of the project,
US$0.4 million was allocated out of which Government used US$0.12 million.
Other donors grant-financed most of the M & E program, whose total cost is
estimated at well over a million dollars.
Appraisal estimate of project cost was US$ 10.1 million including
10% physical contingencies and 10% per annum price contingencies (over
3-years). The project expenditure amounted to US$11.7 millionl/ over a
period of 7 years (233 % of the appraisal estimate before adjusting for
exchange rate flictuations) and 1,590 km were constructed to earth
formation out of which 850 km were gravelled. An amount of US$0.85 million
(including contingencies) was provided under the project for purchase of
vehicles for RARP maintenance out of which US$0.02 million was used. At
appraisal, the economic rate of return was evaluated to be in excpss of
12% while at completion the re-evaluated ERR was 16%.
Conclusion
The RAR Program was designed and i-nplemented using
labor-intensive methods of construction except where farm tractor-trailer
combinations were used for hauling of murram-gravel. Considering ~he
institution building requirement, the staffing and related training needed,
administration and supervision required for the size of the program, this
has been one of the most successful donor-financed programs In Kenya and
one of the best organized labor-intensive road construction programs
anywhere. For the Government it constitutes an effective economic
development mechanism for reducing unemployment/underemployment and in
providing much demanded access roads to the rural community. For the
success of the RAR Program credit is to be given to the planning measures
taken to establish the Special Project Branch and the Technology Unit at
MOTC headquarters, the arrangement made to involve the District Development
Committees (DDC), the well designed organizational structure of the
District Offices and Construction Units, the Training Expansion Program,
and the formation of the Joint Donors Review and Evaluation Committee. The
Bank and other donors have made an important contribution in the planning
and organization of the Program.
Under the program, locally recruited work force received training
in lator-based construction techniques. Through a series of short courses,

interspersed with field assignments, some candidates progressed to the
level of foremen. Other programs offered training to technicians and an
annual seminar for the engineers. The M & E program had an institutional
impact that extended beyond MOTC. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS),
whose role had previously been restricted to data collection and
publication, was given responsibility for program evaluation. Since
working on the RARP, CBS has undertaken a number of other evaluation
studies for the Government of Kenya and has created a Project Impact
Evaluation Studies Unit.

(Loan 1305/Credit 651-KE)
I. Introduction
1.01      The transport sector of the Republic of Kenya is served by 52,000
km of classified road network; 2,100 km of railway line; a 425 km oil
pipeline; and two international and several domestic airports. The
corridor from Mombasa port to Uganda via Nairobi has the highest density of
transport facilities. It is the main import and export route for Kenya and
neighbouring Uganda, passing through high agricultural potential areas of
Kenya from Nairobi to the Uganda border. The section of this corridor from
the Mombasa port to Nairobi is served by road, rail, oil pipeline and air
transport; and the section from Nairobi to the Uganda border by road and
railway line. The 52,000 km. road network, which is concentrated in about
30% of the couintry's land area, is composed of 4,300 km of bitumen; 16,000
km of gravel and 31,700 km of murram-grarel and earth surfaced roads.
1.02      The Bank has participated in Kenya's transport sector development
since 19E' when the first Loan 256-KE, (US$ 5.6 million) was provided for
agricultural development which included construction of feeder roads.
Since then a total of eighteen Loan/Credits (Annex 2) have been provided
totaling US$ 507.1 million out of which US$ 160.0 millii iwas provided to
the East African Community (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) from which Kenya
benefited only partly. The share of the road sector amounts to US$304.2
million (60%) of the total Loan/Credit amount . Except for Loan 1684-KE
with an estimated closing date of December 1986 and Loan 2409/Special Fund
17-KE with December 31, 1990 closing date, all the rest were closed at the
time of the preparation of this PCR.
1.03      Since the RAR Program (Ln 1305/Cr 651-KE) became effective, two
major organizational changes have taken place in the transport sector. The
first was the take-over of Kenya's share of railway and harbour
administration from the then East African Harbour and Railway Cooperation
by the Ministry of Works (;he then responsible Ministry).  The second was
the establishment of the Ministry of Transport and Coimunications (MOTC)
which pooled together all transport modes under one Ministry. These
changes have required institution building through development of a new
organizational structure, new legislation, additional staff ead staff
training and development of management systems. The Bank Group has
assisted through training and systems development in this institution
building.

1.04      Up to 1972, Kenya's development plans emphasized the
strengthening, reconstruction and upgrading of the international, national
trunk and primary roads providing access to administrative centers. This
emphasis was based on the need to accommodate the increasing volumes of
traffic and increasing vehicle axle-loads. Significant investment having
been made on trunk and primary roads, an emphasis on rural access road
development became a logical sequence to follow in the development plan and
this strategy received support from external financing agencies.
1.05      The objective of the Rural Access Roads Program was to provide
access from farm to market centers, and thereby to improve agricultural
development and social services in the rural area. Moreover, importance
was placed on providing employment opportunities and cash incomes for the
under-employed rural population. Since the economy of Kenya is based on
agricultural development largely by small farmers, the emphasis given to
develop farm to market centers access roads has made a significant
contribution to the overall economic development of the country.
1.06      To achieve these objectives MOW submitted a first loan
application to the Bank in March 1974. This application later was revised
on the basis of experience gained from the labor-intensive RAR pilot
projects financed by the Government of the United Kingdom in Nyeri District
and USAID in Kakamega District. The revised loan application was submitted
in July 1975 and the Bank appraised the project in September 1975.
1.07      The objectives of the RARP were:
(i)     to stimulate increased cash crop and livestock production
and to bring more persons into the market economy through
provision of   all-weather access to markets;
(ii)    to provide rural employment through use of labor-intensive
constructions and maintenance methods;
(iii)   to improve access to social facilities and services;  and
(iv)    to increase local participation in development planning
through   selection at district level of roads for
improvement.

II. Project Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
A. ProJect Background
2.01      The Kenya Rural Access Roads Program grew out of a common concern
shared by the Government and by several major donors in the early 1970's
over the general direction of Kenya's development policy. This concern was
first articulated In a major study by ILO/UNDP 1/ that focused attention
on Kenya's rapid post-independence population growth and Its consequences
for future employment and levels of living. It was also reflected in a
major country study conducted by the Bank,2/ which recommended that in
Kenya's second decade of development, the country should seek greater
efficiency in resource utilization through a planned shift in the structure
of growth, placing greater emphasis on the development of the agricultural
sector.
2.02      Already in the late sixties the Government and several bilateral
donors had begun a dialogue that resulted in the formulation of a Special
Rural Development Program (SRD?) for Kenya 3/. This program, which
began on a pilot basis in 1967, was explicitly designed to test a number of
alternative intervention strategies in selected districts and divisions
representing a cross-section of the country's rural population. One
outcome of the program was a decision to decentralize development planning
as much as possible to the district level, to permit flexibility in
combining program elements to meet local needs and aspirations.
2.03      In the transport sector, the Bank's strategy in the sixties had
been largely limited to supporting improvements in the country's primary
transport systems (highways, railways, and ports). A significant share of
investment, however, was planned to support specific agricultural or rural
development initiatives (tea roads, sugar roads, settlement roads). In all
cases, road construction had been carried out using equipment based
methods. The ILO/UNDP study, the findings of the Bank's economic mission,
and the experimental programs sponsored by bilateral donors, all suggested
that Kenya would benefit from a reorientation of its transport investment
policy toward the improvement of lower standard rural roads using labor
based methods.
2.04      The urgency of this action was underscored by a government
decision in 1970 that the Ministry of Works should assume responsibility
for rural roads, formerly under the county councils.   Most rural roads had
received little or no maintenance since independence, and many had
virtually disappeared. The Ministry of Works did not have adequate

Employment in Kenya (Geneva: ILO, 1972).

resources to address the vast backlog of rehabilitation work on rural roads
nor to implement a subsequent maintenance system.   Clearly a conventional
approach would not be sufficient to meet the nation's pressing need for
improved communications in rural areas.
2.05      Responding to these political, economic, and social pressures,
the Kenya Government prepared two programs for multi-donor financing. One,
the Gravelling, Bridging and Culverting (GBC) Program, was designed to meet
the most pressing needs for improvement on existing secondary roads serving
rural areas. The second, the Rural Access Road (RAR) Program, was intended
to provide access to rural communities in productive areas previously
unserved by roads. In order to implement both projects, a Special Projects
Branch (SPB) was created within the Ministry of Works. This branch has now
become firmly entrenched as a section of Rural Roads within the present
Ministry of Transport and Communications.
2.06      Despite the political imperative of finding some way to deal with
the country's growing unemployment problem, the Ministry of Works was
initially reluctant to adopt labor-based methods for rural roads. This
attitude was partly based on a study of settlement roads completed in
1968 01D/ which concluded that labor-based methods would be one-third more
expensive than capital-based methods in the Kenya environment.  However,
this conclusion was contradicted by the findings of a labor-based roads
unit set up in Vihiga division (Kakamega District, Western Province) under
the USAID financed portion of the SRDP. M1E/
B.   Project Identification and Preparation
2.07      In March 1974 the Bank through its Resident Mission in Kenya
received a draft loan application from the Kenya Government to finance part
of the RAR Program. The application was submitted at the same time to
SIDA, which had indicated interest in financing staff training and
continued construction activities in Western Province. Other donors who
expressed interest at this time included KfW and ODA. The Government's
proposal was ambitious: it covered the construction of 14,000 km. of roads
in 22 districts over eight years, with four labor-based brigades operating
in each district. A sample district level economic evaluation, based on
data from Kakamega District, was included in the loan application.
2.08      The Bank evaluated the draft loan application and concluded that
the project was not yet ready for Bank appriasal. However, Bank staff
joined a preappraisal mission involving the other potential donors in
September 1974. ODA was the donor with the greatest flexibility in
financing, and it agreed to finance a pilot project to further refine the
quantities and cost estimates used in the loan application. One
construction unit was therefore set up in Nyeri District, financed by ODA,
with technical assistance from ILO. At the same time, ILO and NORAD



-5-
established a Technology Unit to develop new tools and techniques and to
monitor the results of the pilot project. SIDA, which was also
co-financing the gravelling, bridging and culverting (GBC) program, wanted
the Bank's assistance in-appraising MOW's staff training needs for the two
new programs.
2.09      Another issue that arose during this period was the design of a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the program. Since it would
represent the Bank's first major initiative in a new field, monitoring and
evaluation was univeraally seen to be important. Numerous suggestions were
put forward by Bank staff, reflecting the presence within the Bank of
multiple models for rural road impact. The Kenya Government initially
agreed to participate in a fairly elaborate M&E exercise, but their
enthusiasm waned when it became clear that this activity would be
financee out of loan funds rather than on a grant basis.
2.10      At about the same time, the Bank and ILO were also putting
together a multinational study of the Substitution of Labor for Capital in
Construction (SOL Study). Kenya offered a perfect opportunity to conduct
research that would have immediate operational application in a developing
country. In 1975 the SOL Trust Fund managed by the Bank agreed to
contribute $400,000 toward the financing of the Technology Unit. The work
of the unit was periodically reviewed by consultants financed by ODA.
C.  Preparation
2.11      Extensive and sound preparatory work was carried out in designing
the labor-intensive construction and maintenance methods of the RAR
Program.
Administration of the RARP (Annex 3A. 3B. & 3C)
2.12      The preparatory work provided for the administration of the RAR
Program by a Special Project Branch (SPB) headed by an experienced
professional engineer and assisted by two other engineers at the head
office level. The SPB was to be responsible for planning, programming,
coordination, implementation and monitoring of the Program. The SPB was
assisted by the Ministry's Planning Division in the assessment of economic
and social benefits assessment and preparing the annual budget for
presentation to Government for approval. The District Development
Committees (DDC) rere entrusted with the task of making an initial
selection of the rural access roads to be constructed using the selection
criteria developed by the SPB. The SPB, assisted by the Planning Division
and in consultation with the Ministries concerned with rural development,
would assess the recommendations of the DDC. The final decision on roads
to be constructed in each district was then made by Government based on



-6-
SPB's assessment, taking into account the approved budget and the
implementation capacity. A Technology Unit was established at the head
office in Nairobi (a) to assist the SPB in developing an appropriate
organizational and management system for the Program; (b) to advise on the
appropriate mix of labor and equipment and appropriate road design
standards; (c) to evaluate labor supply conditions; and (d) to assist in
promoting the local manufacture of tools and equipment required for the
program. The preparatory work also provided for the assignment of a
professional engineer in each of the districts where the RAR Program was to
be started, including a provision to use expatriate staff through
technical assistance to bridge the shortage of local professional
engineers.
Skilled Manpower Training
2.13      To provide the required skilled manpower a Training Expansion
Program was developed to train some 3,441 persons for the total roads
program out of which 1,428 were for the RAR Program. This was planned to
be achieved through the establishment of a Training Production Unit (TPU)
and the provision of training equipment and training aides for the Staff
Training Department (STD). The training program was targeted for road
supervisors, surveyors, storekeepers, equipment operators, mechanics,
drivers, etc., and was to be carried out over 5 years (1976-1980).
Design Standards
2.14      The program was to construct short (5-10 km) penetration or link
roads serving low traffic volumes (max. 30 ADT). The roads were to be
constructed using the alignment of existing tracks. The formation width
was to be constructed to 4.5 meters of which 4.0 metres was to be surfaced
with 10 - 15 cm murram-gravel.
Construction Method and Composition of Construction Force (Annex 1)
2.15      The RAR Program was designed for a labor-intensive method of
construction except for farm tractor-trailer combinations to be used for
hauling murram-gravel. The rolling and watering requirement originally
included was left out at the implementation stage. The mix of labor to
equipment of the construction units was designed with major input from the
experience gained from the pilot projects. Each construction unit was
sub-divided up to a maximum of 5 sub-units which worked very close to one
another in order to reduce travel time for the Supervisors. Labor was to
be recruited at the village level within walking distance to and from the
site to reduce time-loss.  Each construction unit was to employ about 250
casual laborers who, when the planned 74 construction units were
established, would generate employment for some 18,500 persons. For each
construction unit provision was made for 6 tractors, 8 trailers, 1 truck, 2
water trailers, 1 1/2 land rovers, and 2 waterpumps and at estimated total
cost of Kenyan pounds 42,500 (US$ 105,570). The production rate for each
construction unit was estimated at 45 km per annum.



D. Appraisal
General
2.16      Together with ODA, KfW, and USAID, the Bank appraised the RAR
Program in September 1975. This appraisal was based on a revised loan
application submitted to the Bank in July 1975, reflecting more
conservative cost and capacity estimates derived from the pilot study
carried out in Nyeri district. Since the project was new for the Bank in
many ways, a numher of issues such as composition of construction force,
method of selection of roads to be constructed, implementation capacity,
future maintenance provisions, monitoring and evaluatiou, etc. were raised
and resol-rl at appraisal that helped to set precedents for subsequent Bank
lending ic, rural road programs.
2.17      Donor financing for the entire rural roads program was by no
means secure at the time of appraisal. Rather than risk the uncertainties
and delays involved in co-financing, the Bank agreed to define a portion of
the program to serve as the Bank-financed project. Other donors also
participated in the program through separate bilateral agreements with the
Kenya Government. Thus there was no formal co-financing, although there
was close coordination among the donors throughout the project. In the end
the Kenya Government assumed the main responsibility for donor
coordination, with continuing technical support from ILO.
2.18      The project included a number of new features with respect to
financing. Since the foreign exchange costs of the labor-based program
were expected to be low, the Bank agreed to finance a portion of local cost
expenditures. The Bank also agreed to retroactive financing for the
training component to facilitate the early recruitment of instructors.
Finally, the Bank agreed to finance 80% of the projected cost of a program
for monitoring ard evaluation of RAR Program impacts.
2.19      The Bank agreed to acce.. the evaluation methodology proposed by
the government, which was based on economic evaluation of a package of
roads put together by a local development committee at the district level.
While it was recognized that this methodology might be less than optimal
from a strictly economic point of view, Bank staff felt that it could be
accepted because it supported the country's social objective of increasing
local participation in development decision-making. Provisional acceptance
of this methodology was, however, closely linked to the planned major Bank
role in the monitoring and evaluation program, which was expected to
generate data through which the methodology could be refined.
2.20.     The project consisted of:
(i)   Equipping and operating of eight construction units for
three years each (1977-1979).
(ii)  Equipment and training aids for the training expansion
program.
(iII) Monitoring and evaluation of the RARP.
(iv) RARP maintenance vehicles.



-8-
(v)   Technical assistance.
RAR Construction Units
2.21      Under the project eight labor-intensive construction units were
to be formed, each to be assigned to a different district. The labor to
equipment mix was to be the same as that adopted for the total program
(Annex 1). Based on the project implementation schedule, the eight
Bank-financed construction units were programmed to start operation by
February 1977 while the 74 construction units for the total program were
planned to be phased in over 6 years (1974-1979) as shown in Annex 4.
Economic Evaluation
2.22      The economic evaluation of the project at appraisal consisted of
three steps. First, an overall assessment was made of the 8-year
construction program planned for 22 districts. The evaluation was carried
out over a project life of 21 years and included projected routine
maintenance and regravelling costs as well as construction costs. Wages
were shadow priced at 50% of the market rate, and foreign exchange costs
were valued at 30% above the official exchange rate. Benefits were
restricted to the projected incremental increase in agricultural production
at the district level, estimated at 0.5% per year. The value of
incremental production was reduced by 25% to allow for incremental input
costs, and increased by 12.75% to reflect the foreign exchange contribution
of that portion of incremental production which would be exported. The
resulting figures led to an estimated rate of return exceeding 12%.
2.23      A sample evaluation for one district was also included, based on
data provided by the Government of Kakamega District, where the SRDP pilot
program had taken place. This evaluation illustrated the procedure that
would be followed by the Government in evaluating the district packages it
would propose to the Bank for financing. It suggested a rate of return of
22% for the program in Kakmega District, based on the expected net increase
in agricultural and livestock production. Government efforts to impute
economic benefits to the employment and income distribution effects of the
labor-based program and to improved access to social services were excluded
from the Bank's economic rate of return analysis.
2.24      The third type of economic evaluation undertaken was a comparison
of expected costs using labo -based methods with the costs of carrying out
a rural roads program using capital-intensive methods. The comparison
showed that labor-based methods would be more advantageous on both economic
and financial terms. It was expected that labor-based methods would be 19%
cheaper than capital-based methods, and that, even allowing for a more
rapid realization of benefits with capital-intensive construction, the rate
of return on the program as a whole would be only 8.5% if a capital-based
approach were adopted.

III. Project Implementation and Costs
Start Up
3.01      The project was appraised in September 1975, approved by the
Board July 1, 1976, and became effective on October 7, 1976. There were no
special conditions of effectiveness. Section 3.07 of the Development
Credit Agreement, however, required that the Borrower shall, prior to
commencing construction under RARP in any district, carry out an economic
and social evaluation of the rural access road network on the basis of
criteria mutually acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank. The first
formation level construction unit started working in February 1977, while
the other units were established the following two years, the last one in
April 1979.
3.02      According to the project implementation schedule drawn up the
MOTC, both formation level and gravelling operations were to start in
February 1977. However, there was a time gap between the start of
formation level construction and the gravelling operations. Four
gravelling subunits started six months late and the remaining four started
20-23 months after their respective formation level construction subunits
started work. It was possible to start the formation level construction
units almost at the initially programmed period since the operation did not
involve equipment. The start of the gravelling units was dependent on the
time needed to prepare specifications, contract documents, tendering and
evaluation, delivery, assembly and servicing and mobilization. Assembly,
servicing and mobilization to the site of the equipment ordered for the RAR
Program accounted for the major part of the time lost in starting the
gravelling units.
Physical Accomplishment
3.03      The project was completed on December 31, 1984 while the
appraisal completion date was December 31, 1981. At completion date, 1,590
km (159% of planned) were completed to formation level of which only 850 km
(85% of planned) were gravelled. Out of the 850 km gravelled roads, 110 km
had been done by the contract system introduced in 1983 to help close the
gap between formation level construction and gravelling. Gravelling of 640
kms is continuing both by contract and force account under the First
Highway Sector project Loan 1684-KE, while 100 km are considered not to
require gravelling because of the good quality of subgrade material.
Several factors have contributed to the extremely low performance in the
gravelling operation. The main ones are:
i)   non availability of murram-gravel pits within a short hauling
distance as assumed during the planning period, which in turn is
due to inadequate investigation of the availability of material;
ii) the inappropriateness of the tractor-trailer combination
equipment selected for hauling gravel over a long distance; and
iii) the low availability and utilization of equiprent due to the
shortage of spare parts, qualified technicians, and local funds,
and use of the equipment for operations other than hauling
gravel.



- 10 -
Physical accomplishment varied significantly in the eight RARP districts
mainly due to the varying start-up dates of formation level construction
and gravelling units (Para. 3.02).  Actual accomplishment in each of the
districts for the project is shown below:
District        Formation Level        Gravelling

Kiambu                  152                73
Nakuru                  168                108
Kericho                 193                81

Total            1590               851
During the 7 years construction period annual production rates have varied
between the formation level and gravelling operations as shown below. For
the formation level construction, the average annual production rate was 30
km p.a. while for the gravelling subunits the average annual production
rate was 15 km p.a. as shown below.
Annual production rates per Unit (km/Unit)

gravelling.
a/ includes gravelling by contract.
3.04      The low accomplishment (12 km p.a. per unit) for the formation
level construction in 1983/84 is due to phasing out of this operation
because of the large backlog in gravelling operations. Excluding the
1983/84 production rate, the average for the formation level construction
was 33 km p.a. per unit which is 73X of the appraisal estimate of 45 km
p.a. per unit. The 33 km p.a. per unit accomplishment for this operation
is judged to be reasonable considering the shortage of trained manpower,
the shortage of local funds and difficulty in coordination of a program of
the size of RAR. For the gravelling operation the accomplishment of an
average of 15 km p.a. per unit and even the maximum 19 km p.a. (in 1980/81
and 1981/82) Is very low.



- 11 -
Construction Cost per km
3.05      The appraisal estimated per km. operational cost was US$ 4,300,
net of contingencies.  Including the 107 physical and 107 price
contingencies over the 7 years construction period the operational
cost would amount to US$ 8,200 per km. Based on MOTC's expenditure report,
the actual per km cost was US$8,902 (Table 3.05) including direct overhead
costs. The 8.5% increase in the per km cost is mainly due to the higher
cost in the gravelling operation because of the low production rate.

Disbursements
3.07       A comparison of disbursements between the appraisal estimate and
actual disbursements under the project is shown in Table 3.07.
Disbursement for the construction units' operating costs was 168% of the
appraisal estimate, while only 2% and 5X were disbursed under the technical
assistance and maintenance vehicles categories. Low disbursements under
technical assistance and monitoring and evaluation took place because other
donors took over much of their financing, often on a grant basis.

3.08      There was no disbursement made under the project catagory for
hand tools, but MOTC's expenditure report shows a total of US$162,000 as
expended for tools used in the construction of the project roads. The hand
tools produced, using the specification developed for RARP, have proven to
be appropriate and cost effective, although the purchasing unit cost was
higher than tools normally available in the market. In the early period of
construction the tools to be manufactured under the specifications
developed for RAR Program were not available which necessitated use of
those which existed in the market.
Staff Training and Assignment of Engineers
3.09      Considering the originally optimistic size of the RAR Program,
the staff training output and assignments of engineers have been quite
satisfactory. Out of KOTC's total program to train 3,441 personnel over 5
years (1976-1980) the RARP share was 1,428 staff against which 484 (34%)
were trained by 1980 and 1,013 (71X) were trained by 1984. Assignments of
engineers for the total RARP have gradually increased from 13 in ?.Y.
1976/77 to 32 in 1984/85. The number of Kenyan national engineers
increased from 2 in 1978 to 20 engineers in 1984. The number of expatriate



- 14 -
engineers increased from 14 engineers in 1978 to a maximum of 19 engineers
in 1979 and then gradually declined to 4 engineers in 1984, as the number
of Kenyan engineers increased.
Road Maintenance
3.10      Rural access road maintenance is under the responsibility of the
District Engineers supported by 1 to 2 inspectors and I to 4 overseers
per district depending on the length of the roads under maintenance. The
routine maintenance is being done on the lengthman system and the length of
the road assigned to one contractor varies between 0.5 km and 2.0 km. The
lengthmen are selected from farmers living adjacent to the road section.
They are provided with hand tools and are paid on a monthly basis the
equivalent of 12 days wages for a casual laborer. Except for the variation
of the length of the road assigned for each lengthman, based on the
expected workload, there is no measurement of work done to effect the
payment. Payments are made as long as there is no undone maintenance
activity. Regardless of the amount of work monthly payment is withheld
until all maintenance work is carried out. The decision on the adequacy of
the maintenance work done is left to the judgment of the overseer since he
is not provided with a set guideline.  MOTC has now engaged a consultant to
recommend ways in which the labor-intensive method road maintenance system
can be improved. The level of maintenance on rural access roads is quite
satisfactory mainly because the majority of the roads have been completed
recently.
Labor-Intensive Method of Construction
3.11      The organizational structure for RARP labor-intensive method of
construction is shown in Annexes 3A - 3C.  Each Constracti-n Unit was
headed by an inspector and under him there were seven subunits, namely, a
clerical office, two earthwork, two drainage units, one gravelling and one
quarry subunit, each headed by an overseer, except for the clerical office,
which was headed by a storekeeper. Each unit employed 250 casual laborers
and was provided with six farm tractors and eight trailers for hauling
gravel, while the earthwork and drainage units were labor-intensive. In
the gravelling subunits labor force was used for murram production and
loading, unloading and spreading, while farm tractor/trailers were used for
the hauling of gravel. The labor-intensive method of construction was
first tested on pilot projects from which valuable experience was gained.
The Government's RAR Program objective to construct 14,000 km RAR in eight
years, later reduced to 9,000 kmi, was very ambitious.  Moreover, the plan
to start construction in 22 districts geographically scattered over a great
distance and to establish 74 labor-intensive construction units in four
years was by any standard an extremely heavy undertaking. The program was
also ambitious from the staffing point of view considering the requirement
for 25 professional engineers and 1,430 _.illed workers for the
implementation of the RAR Program.
3.12      The RAR Program, even though extremely ambitious, has been one of
the most successful donor-financed programs in Kenya and one of the best
organized labor-intensive road construction programs anywhere for the
following reasons:



- 15 -
ti)       The organization structure planned for the
headquarters, district and construction units proved to
be effective and was successfully implemented in 26
districts; and 45 labor-intensive construction nnits
were established.
(ii)      Construction units, especially the earthwork subunits,
managed to construct rural access roads in full
compliance with the design standards, even though there
was a low supply of skilled technical staff to provide
continuous guidance in the typical cross-section
layout.
(iii)     Production rates of the exclusively labor-based
construction units (that of formation level
construction units) achieved on average 67% of the
estimated 45 km p.a. per unit and for two years 100%.
The low accomplishment of 33% on average of the planned
production rate in the gravelling operation was mainly
due to inadequate investigation of the availability of
gravel material which led to inappropriate selection of
hauling equipment. Even in the gravelling operation,
the labor-based activities such as quarrying,
loading/unloading, and spreading of gravel were not a
constraint to achieving the planned production rates.
(iv)      Under the program, 7,600 km (84% of the revised plan of
9,000 km) were constructed in seven years. This is an
extremely high achievement, even though it is only 54%
of the original planned target of 14,000 km in eight
years.
The Government of Kenya plans to retain the experience gained in
labor-intensive methods in its upcoming minor roads improvement program,
presently in an advanced stage of preparation.

IV. Economic Re-evaluation
4.01      In re-estimating the rate of return for the RAR program, a
modified version of the revised methodology agreed during project
implementation was used. The revised methodology agreed during project
implementation takes into account only 60% of the value of the incremental
agricultural production in each district attributable under the appraisal
methodology to the road program. In addition, no benefits are counted more
than ten years after construction is completed. The figure of 602 is an
arbitrary assumption made to allow for the fact that the incremental
increase in production results from a package of government investments and
not just from the roads. (On farm investments made by the beneficiaries
were taken into account in the appraisal methodology.) Unfottunately,
information available from the monitoring and evaluation system is not
sufficient to permit a more accurate approximation of the true value of
complementary investments even at the district level, nor does it permit
the disaggregation of costs and benefits to the level of individual roads.
4.02      The re-evaluated rate of return takes into account construction
costs, maintenance costs, and technical assistance costs, as well as
agricultural benefits calculated according to the revised methodology. The
re-evaluation covers the 26 districts in which the program was actually
implemented and a 21-year period beginning in 1975. Agricultural benefits
were calculated using production data bv district and producer prices for
nine crops for the yea,zs 1975-1984.  tuture production was projected by
commodity based on the trends of the past ten years. Details of the
benefit calculation are given in Annex 6.
4.03      The rate of return for the program, using these assumptions, is
estimated to be16%. This evaluation does not include benefits deriving
from increased production of meat, milk, and dairy products. The findings
of the M &,E program suggest, however, that increased livestock production
has also had a significant positive impact in some areas.
4.04      Widely varying rates of return can be calculated for the
program, depending upon the assumptions one chooses to adopt concerning:
(a) the share of Incremental agricultural production in each district which
ought to be attributed to the road program; (b) the share of benefits from
this incremental production which ought to be counted in the evaluation;
(c) whether or not technical assistance costs should be included; and (d)
whether or not to apply shadow costing to labor, foreign e.change, or
agricultural production for export. Annex 6 examines the sensitivity of
the rate of return to some of these assumptions. The rate of return ranges
from 42% using the original appraisal methodology without including
technical assistance costs to 6% using the revised methodology with
a reduced share of benefits corresponding to the reduced accomplishment
under the construction program. It should be further noted that the rate
of return for the program as a whole does not demonstrate the viability of
any particular road improvement since higher rates of return achieved on
some roads may mask unsatisfactory rates of return on other roads.



- 17 -
4.05      Finally, a comparison between the actual costs of the RAR Program
and the costs of capital-based construction of similar roads in Kenya by
force account and by contractors was carried out in collaboration with ILO
staff. This study found that force account construction using equipment
was 60-90% more expensive in financial terms than labor-based methods, and
90%-125X more expensive in economic terms. The costs of construction by
contract are more difficult to determine, but on the basis of the price per
kilometer paid by the government for low standard roads built by
contractors, it would appear that the RAR Program offers a significant
advantage in both economic and financial terms. Unit costs achieved by the
program have averaged about US$8,902 per km. after the start-up years, and
overhead costs have averaged about 18% of total costs. These costs do not,
however, include the cost of technical assistance, estimated at $3,200/km.
Including technical assistance costs would raise the unit cost by about
36%, leading to the conclusion that labor-based methods are cheaper than
equipment-based methods using force account, but may not be cheaper than
equipment-based methods used by contractors. Roads not constructed under
the Program were not visited during the project completion review, so no
assessment can he made regarding the comparative quality of low-standard
roads built by labor-based and by equipment-based methods.



- 18 -
V. Bank Performance and Donor Coordination
5.01      Over time, a large number of donors have been involved in the RAR
Program. The Bank, which had taken a good deal of initiative at the start,
played less of a leading role as the project went on. Over the ten-year
life of the project there were some 16 Bank supervision missinns, often
timed to coincide with donor meetings. The Bank kept careful track of
program output and, together with other donors, assisted Government in
resolving problems which might affect implementation of the project. As
the program went on, Bank staff became increasingly concerned about the
fact that formation construction was proceeding much more rapidly than
gravelling.
5.02      One of the reasons why gravelling proceeded so slowly was the
choice of the type of equipment for material hauling coupled with
unexpected long distance haulage of materials. Moreover, spare parts and
fuel were not available as much as required and capable technicians were in
short supply. As the gravelling backlog grew, the Bank and other donors
urged MOTC to consider using local contractors to execute the gravelling
part of the program. In 1983 after some initial resistance, MOTC started
gravelling by contract which proved to be cheaper and speedier than using
the force account gravelling units; a total of 110 km were gravelled by
contract under the project.
5.O      Another issue on which the donors helped to focus attention
during implementation was the need to establish a capacity for continuing
maintenenance of the roads by force account.  However, it soon became
apparent that MOTC would not be able to carry out effective maintenance of
rural roads by force account because of the varying frequency of
maintenance activities and the inefficient administrative control of force
acLount operation for the extensive network of rural roads geographically
scattered over long distances. Finally, MOTC adopted the lengthman system
of maintenance by contract, whereby a lengthman contractor was assigned 0.5
to 2.0 km of road section depending on the anticipated amount of
maintenance work. The system, although basically sound, did not ensure
payment by production. Based on its assessment of the performance of the
lengthman contract method of maintenance adopted, MOTC is now having a RAR
maintenance study carried out to find ways of making this a more effective
and economical system.
5.04    Bank staff also showed continuing concern about the way in which
roads were selected and evaluated for the program, and ways in which the
methodology could be improved as a reault of the lessons learned from the
monitoring and evaluation program. In response ta pressure from donors, in
1979 MOTC attempted to identify key elements influencing the economic
rate of return through regression analysis on the parameters used in their          
original appraisal methodology. The results were inconclusive but
suggested that the main determinants of feasibility would be the size of
the impact area and the population served.
5.05      Following this analysis, MOTC developed a new screening procedure
which called for more information on the development potential of each
specific road. However, this screening procedure still included important
social and political as well as economic considerations. The Government of
Kenya, with tacit support of some of the donors, successfully resisted



- 19 -
pressures from the Bank and some other donors to conduct an economic
evaluation of each individual road proposed for the program.
5.06      Dealing with so many different donors constituted a significant
drain on the management resources available for the program, particularly
because the parallel financing arrangements meant that each donor had its
own procedures for loan withdrawals and disbursements and its own
requirements for record keeping and report submission. Under the
circumstances, the Government of Kenya coped with the donors remarkably
well. On the technical side, it had strony support from ILO which agreed
to provide the secretariat for the donor meetings. Through effective
management of the donor group, the government was generally able to obtain
the resources it needed to keep the program going and even expanding.
5.07      Some of the other donors feel that the Bank could have taken more
of a leading role during project implementation.   However, they were
generally satisfied with the way the donor coordination process worked.
Some donors expressed concern that the lack of a Bank roads engineer
stationed in the regional mission meant that the Bank could not participate
effectively in decisions taken on a day-to-day basis by donor staff in the
field. Since the Bank did participate regularly in the formal donor
meetings, however, this was not viewed as a major problem.



- 20 -
VI. Monitoring and Evaluation
6.01      During project preparation, the importance of monitoring and
evaluation was stressed by Bank staff and others and some rather elaborate
M&E system designs were suggested to the Government. The Government agreed
in principle to conduct a major study along lines suggested by Bank staff
on the assumption that it would be grant finenced. However, when it became
a matter of borrowing money for this purpose, the government reduced its
proposed expenditure under thc project to Ksh 4 million (U.S. $500,000
equivalent). The Bank proje*t provided financing for 802 of thi.s expected
expenditure (U.S. $400,000). A specific plan for this component,
appropriate to the expected level of expenditure, was not available at
appraisal but was to be provided as a condition of disbursement.
6.02      In fact, it took some considerable time for MOTC and CBS to come
to an agreement on a work program that could be carried out using the
available funds. Meanwhile, USAID concluded its bilateral agreement with
Government to participate in the RAR Program. In response to its mandate,
USAID wished to add to the M&E program some specific concerns such as
environmental Impact, local participation, and effects on women. DANIDA
also agreed to contribute to the M&E effort by financing a technical
assistance position for a program coordinator within MOTC. The Bank agreed
to assist DANIDA In identifying and recruiting a suitable candidate for
this position.
6.03      For various reasons, the Program Coordinator position was not
filled until 1979. Once the program coordinator was in place, however, a
design was drawn up for the study and agreement was reached with CBS to
conduct a baseline survey of 828 households In the impact area of seven
roads located in Western and Nyanza Provinces (the USAID sponsored area).
A program of topical studies was also prepared and agreed by the donors.
6.04      Some of the key findings from the survey include:l/
- Labor-intensive road construction proved to be technically
feasible and cost effective.
- Labor-intensive road construction succeeded in employing
primarily low-income residents, over half of whom earned wages
for the first time.
- RARs contributed to increased production and sales of food
crops, livestock, milk and poultry.
- Production of non food cash crops decreased in the road impact
areas.
- Increased food crop and livestock production were primarily
marketed. On-farm consumption of food crops declined.
I/Abstracted from Box 1, page 2 of Devres, Inc., "Final Report:
Assessment of the Socio-Economic Impacts of the Kenya Rural Access
Roads Programme", submitted to USAID, April 1984.



- 21 -
-  The RARs contributed to increased cash earnings from both farm
and non-farm sources.
- Male headed households increased farm earningn more than female
headed households. In contrast, female headed households showed
a greater increase in both non-farm and total earnings than male
headed households.
- RARs contributed toward reducing the gap between upper and lower
income groups.
These results are based on changes measured over two years (1979 to 1981),
just before and after construction. Data collection was temporarily halted
after 1981, but was resumed in 1983. Results from the second round of
surveys are available in CBS, but no funds have been provided to enable
them to be processed.
6.05      Topical studies were conducted on characteristics of road
workers, impact of roads on the nutritional status of children, on women
and family life, on migration and family formation, on land use patterns,
and on regional integration. An aerial survey, financed by NORAD, was used
to generate baseline data on land use patterns in the impact areas of
selected roads. There were some problems in "ground-truthing" the results
of this survey and so far the donors have not agreed to support its
replication. However, a stronger case may be made a few years in the
future, when enough time will have elapsed so that significant changes in
land use can be detected through aerial survey methods.
6.06      In the end, well over a million dollars were spent on the
monitoring and evaluation program. Though the surveys suffer from some
defects in design (lack of control roads, non-representative sample,
inadequate sample size, excessive detail in data collection leading to
interviewer and respondent fatigue), a large body of data has been
collected and some useful conclusions can be drawn from it. Of particular
interest is the wealth of qualitative data collected through the topical
studies. Unfortunately, these studies have not been prepared for
publication and very few copies remain in circulation.
6.07      There has also been little feedback from the M&E studies to the
selection criteria or the evaluation methodology used by MOTC. The
Ministry is developing its own monitoring and reporting systems to keep
track of progress on the road program. Some donors feel that the
usefulness of the evaluation exercise would have been increased by having
an engineer on the evaluation team, and by focusing evaluation efforts on
the diagnosis and solution of particular problems in program
implementation, along the lines of the work done by the early Technology
Unit. However, this would have defeated the primary purpose of
establishing the socioeconomic impact of rural road construction in Kenya,
wnich was reasonably well accomplished, within the constraints of time,
staffing and funding, by the evaluation team.
6.08      The monitoriug and evaluation system provided relatively little
data that could be used in preparing a post-project evaluation according to



- 22 -
Bank criteria. The MOTC reporting systems also could not provide
disaggregated data on costs for specific roads. Agricultural data at the
district level were obtained by MOTC staff from the Ministry of Agriculture
for the purpose of this evaluation. Data on complementary investments are
essentially unavailable, and even the traffie*. counts carried out under the
M&E program provide only a partlal insight into the possible consequences
of rural road improvements. Furthermore, the M&E program was never
effectively integrated into the planning and programming process of MOTC,
and its activities have lapsed with the departure of the technical
assistance.
6.09      There are a number of reasons why the M&E system was not more
effective from the Bank's point of view. First of all, the Bank sent no
clear message to the Government during project preparation regarding its
M&E requirements. An elaborate research activity was proposed by the Bank
that did not enjoy the unqualified support of all Bank staff. The
Government never made a serious commitment to undertake a study of the
magnitude that would be required to provide reliable answers to the Bank's
questions. A second reason is that the M&E system had to be designed to
meet the needs defined by a large donor group not all of whom shared the
Bank's concerns. More specifically, the M&E program conducted studies
geared to satisfying the concerns .f those donors who were supporting it
through grant financing. While a serious attempt was made to involve local
staff in the definition of the research program and in its successful
execution, this was not perceived as a high priority activity by senior
staff of MOTC.



- 23 -
VII.   Institutional Performance
7.01      The project did not explicitly identify any institutional
development objectives at appraisal.   Nevertheless, the Rural Access Roads
Program has had significant impacts on institutional development in the
country, both within and outside the Ministry of Transport and
Communications.
7.02      Within the ministry, a Special Branch had already been created to
handle the RAR and GBC programs, before the Bank became involved. This
organization was Initially quite separate from the rest of the Ministry's
activities. Problems arose in the early stages of the program due to lack
of a clear definition of relationship between the engineers in charge of
the rural roads units and the provincial engineers. These problems have
gradually been resolved, partly by a general delegation of decision-making
responsibility to lower levels of the system, and partly by a redefinition
of reporting relationships that makes the RAR Program units more responsive
to established local interests.
7.03      The Special Branch, now the Rural Roads Section, has become a key
element in the Ministry. Partly this is due to the enormous popular appeal
of the rural roads programs; partly it is due to the relatively high level
of efficiency with which the program has been planned and carried out. The
program has had high visibility and provides personal rewards for its staff
through its perceived role as a catalyst for the country's economic
development and the generally favorable attention it has received from
donors.  Indeed, one of the current I   itutional problems is that talented
individuals who have shown what they can do in the rural roads program tend
to be reassigned to other parts of the Ministry, resulting in high turrover
rates.
7.04      At the beginning of the program there was an extremely high level
of participation by expatrfates, not only in the actual running of the
program but also in the related studies. Kenyanization of the program was
a goal shared by government and by the donors. Substantial progress has
been made in this area, to the point where almost all the field engineers
and headquarters staff are Kenyans, although expatriate technical
assistance is still being provided by some bilateral donors.
7.05      The project included support to an expanded training program
designed to produce the needed mid-level supervisory staff. The training
program started under this project proved successful. It took promising
candidates from the locally recruited work force and gave them short
courses, focusing on labor-based construction techniques, at a training
school in Kisii. Candidates progressed, through a series of short courses
interspersed with field assignments, to the level of foreman. Other
programs offered training to technicians, who were first-line managers
seconded to the program from the Ministry's permanent staff, and an annual
seminar for the engineers. In the initial years the Ministry had some
problems with retention of trained staff, but a critical mass now appears
to have been achieved and trainees are more likely to stay with the
program.



- 24 -
7.06      In addition to serving the needs of the rural road program, the
Training School in Nairobi provided courses to MOTC staff in
equipment-based construction, including bridging, culverting, bitumization,
and equipment operation. It has also started to offer motorcycle driver
training, and is preparing a course for the training of road maintenance
supervisors. The school now also offers courses in building, electrical
and mechanical trades, and is providing training in these areas to staff of
the Forest Service and the Army as well as to MOTC and the Ministry of
Works. The school maintains close contacts with ILO and with some
bilateral donors; through these contacts it has demonstrated training
methods for labor-based programs to visitors from a number of other African
countries.
7.07      The project's institutional impact has extended well beyond the
boundaries of MOTC. For example, the program initially encountered
difficulties becaise cumbersome central procurement procedures made it
difficult to supply tools and equipment to the field units in a timely
fashion. Also, the desire to favor locally manufactured products and the
principle of awarding contracts to the lowest bidder without regard to
quality led to implementation problems, when productivity suffered as a
result of poor or inappropriate tools. The work of the Technology Unit and
the high visibility of the project were instrumental in bringing about some
changes in these procurement policies.
7.08      The M&E program also had an institutional impact that extended
beyond the Ministry. The program was originally designed to be carried out
by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in close collaboration with the
Ministry of Works. CBS had already started to collect nationwide data on
agricultural production through an integrated rural survey. It developed a
design for more detailed study of a subsample of households in the planned
road impact areas. Data collection and the evaluation of impacts was to be
coordinated with a similar effort to monitor and evaluate the impact of the
Kenya Integrated Agricultural Development Program (IADP), a follow-up to
the SRDP.
7.09    The design that was developed and implemented was technically quite
complex and CBS may have become somewhat over-extended in attempting to
implement its part of the M&E program. During implementation, the MOTC
coordination was able to arrange for short-term technical assistance to CBS
for data processing and timely report preparation. This was the first time
that CBS, whose role had previously been restricted to data collection and
publication, was given responsibility for program evaluation. Since
working on the RARP, CBS has undertaken a number of other evaluation
studies for the Government of Kenya and different donors, and has created a
Project Impact Evaluation Studies Unit. CBS now carries out, in addition
to special studies, a continuing National Sample Survey (successor to the
Integrated Rural Survey and Evaluation Program).
7.10    In addition to periodic surveys of a sample of farm households, the
M&E program included a number of special studies which were carried out
under contract by staff and graduate students of the University of Nairobi,
through its Institute for Development Studies. Thus, the program

contributed to strengthening capacity in a local institution to conduct
development related research. Regrettably, the results of this research
were never widely circulated and did not receive much attention from the
donors. However, the topical studies did contribute to the discussion on
development impact among Kenya's intellectuals, and offered practical
learning opportunities to students from Kenya and other African countries.
7.11    A final illustration of institutional impact has to do with the
process through which roads were selected for inclusion in the RAR
Program. Following the model which was first tested in Kakamega District,
the RAR Program adopted a policy of allowing District Development Councils
(DDCs) to decide, within technical and financial parameters fixed by MOTC,
on the road program for each district. This was the first concrete
planning task set before the District Councils, which were originally made
up largely of local representatives of the different national agencies
providing services in rural areas. Local politicians and tribal chiefs
were also invited to participate. Naturally, many more roads were proposed
for improvements than could be accommodated with the available budget. The
DDC planning process forced local decision makers to articulate the reasons
for their support for specific proposals, and encouraged them to move
toward a consensus that could be accepted on technical and financial
grounds. This planning process, first implemented with respect to rural
roads, later led to the preparation of full-scale District Development
Plans, taking into account the advantages offered by past investments such
as roads, and capitalizing on them through complementary investments in
productive activities and social services.
7.12    Detailed discussion of planned road programs at the local level
also paved the way for the recruitment of labor to carry out the actual
construction work. Local sources of materials and supplies could be
identified, and engineers established personal contact with local
officials. As local authorities gained greater sophistication in planning
for development, it became possible to delegate ever more decision-making
power and responsibility to the local level. The RARP had an important
impact, in the districts where it operated, in preparing local authorities
to assume the expanded powers and responsibilities foreseen under the
current "district focus" for development.

VIII.    Lessons Learned
8.01      The following conclusions can be drawn from the experience of the
Rural Access Roads Project:
- The use of labor-based methods for rural roads construction and
maintenance in Africa can be technically feasible and
financially cost-effective.
-  Labor-based methods can bring significant economic benefits, in
addition to having a positive impact on income distribution and
the quality of life in rural areas.
-  Major donor involvement may be needed at the early stages in
order to convince local decision-makers that labor-based methods
can be successful.
- A heavy initial input of technical assistance and a well
prepared training program can have a high pay off in developing
viable, self-sustaining institutions to manage rural transport
infrastructure.
- The time necessary to achieve this result is, under the best of
circumstances, likely to be longer than the normal Bank project
period of about five years.
- To maximize unit productivity, adequate tools, fuel, and spare
parts for equipment should be procured and made available to
field units in a timely fashion.
- Technical and financial management of a labor-based rural roads
program should be decentralized to as low a level as possible.
- To execute more equipment-intensive tasks such as road
gravelling or structures, small local contractors may be used
more effectively than force account.
- Following the execution of a labor-based program of road
improvements, it is relatively easy to initiate a lengthman
system for rural road routine maintenance.
- Local involvement in planning for a rural roads program will
facilitate its execution and will strengthen local capacity for
development planning more generally.
- A monitoring and evaluation program, though expensive, offers
additional opportunities to support the development of local
institutions for more effective planning in the future.
- The Bank can play an important role as a catalyst for innovative
programs, but the active participation of several different
donors may be needed to sustain such a program over time.

Economic Re-Evaluation
This annex describes in detail the process followed in arriving
at a re-estimated rate of return for the program. The attached tables give
details on the calculations involved. The economic evaluation takes into
account only benefits measured by and increase in the value of marketed
agricultural production in the program districts. It does not take account
of benefits due to improved access to social services or to improved equity
in the distribution of rural incomes. Further, it does not take into
account those benefits which may be attributable to the
institution-building components of the program (nor does it count the cost
of those components except for technical assistance). The recalculated
rate of return should therefore he considered as only a partial measure of
the program's contribution to development in Kenya.
Construction Costs
At appraisal it was estimated that the size of the program would
grow from 5 units in 1976/76 to a total of 74 units in 1981/82, expected to
be the last year of the program. Based on the expected average cost of
KE64,000 per unit in 1975 prices, and the expected output of 45 km per year
(except for the startup year of each unit, when only half this output was
expected to be achieve), the appraisal report forecast that 13,674 km of
roads would be completed by the end of the program for a total financial
cot of KE21,830,000 in 1975 prices.
Economic costs were estimated by assuming (based on the Nyeri
pilot program) that 40% of construction costs represented unskilled labor,
which could be shadow priced at 50% of its financial cost, and 27% of
construction costs would be in foreign exchange which was valued at 130% of
actual costs. Taxes and import duties were also taken into account in
calculating economic costs. The result indicated that the economic cost of
the program would correspond to about 82% of financial costs, giving a
total economic cost of KE17,826,100 in 1975 prices.
At the end of 1984 there were 44 units in operation. These units
had produced a total of 7,641 km of earth road formation, of which 4410 km
had been gravelled. Financial costs of construction to date amounted to
KE21,778,000. When deflated to 1975 prices, the total cost of the program
through 1984 represents KE11,121,000 or about 62% of the amount originally
prolected for about 56% of the projected output.



Annex 6
-41-                             Page 2 of 7
The percentage of construction costs actually spent on unskilled
labor was 35% compared to the 40% estimate,l/ and the percentage of costs
incurred in foreign exchange was 26%, as compared to the 27% estimate.  It
was assumed in the appraisal report that 5% of costs would represent taxes
and import duties. Accepting the assumption that unskilled labor can be
shadow priced at 50% of actual costs and that foreign exchange can be
shadow priced at 130% of actual costs, the actual adjustment factor for
economic costs is 83% of financial costs, quite close to the original
estimate of 82%.
Maintenance Costs
It was assumed in the appraisal report that routine maintenance
on newly completed rural access roads would begin in year 3 (1976/77) and
would build up to a level of K1,093,900 per year when the program was
completed. Regravelling was expected to start in 1985/86 and to be carried
out at ten-year intervals following construction. Maintenance costs were
estimated based on a unit cost of KE80 per km for routine maintenance and
KE400 for regravelling (in 1975 prices). Assuming that unskilled labor
would represent 75% of costs and foreign exchange costs only 10%, it was
determined that the economic cost of routine maintenance would be 60% of
financial costs, while the economic cost of periodic maintenance was taken
to be 80% of financial costs.
At the end of 1984, Kenya had 7,269 km of rural access roads
under routine maintenance using the lengthman system. The annual cost in
1984/85 is estimated at K756,400 or about KX104 per km (corresponding to
KE45/km in 1975 prices).  The current cost of periodic maintenance is
estimated following the appraisal methodology at KE520 per km (KE225 in
1975 prices). In the absence of detailed data, it will be assumed that the
appraisal estimates of the percentage of economic to financial costs for
routine and periodic maintenance remain valid.
Technical Assistance Costs
The appraisal report did not include technical assistance costs
in its evaluation of the expected rate of return for the project. In the
absence of actual data on technical assistance costs (since most of these
costs were grant financed by other donors to the program), technical
assistance costs have been estimated based on the staff years of expatriate
1/ Annex 6A of the Appraisal Report shows that casual labor costs were
expected to represent 35.5% of construction unit costs, although 40%
was used in the economic evaluation.

assistance provided and an assumed market value of $50,000 per staff year
in 1976 prices.
Benefits
The appraisal report assumed that the value of marketed
agricultural production in the 22 districts to be served by rural access
roads would grow by 5% per year in the absence of the roads and 5.5% with
the roads. The 0.5% incremental increase was expected to be fully
realized in the first year following the completion of construction. The
value of the expected incremental production was reduced by 25% to allow
for the cost of inputs, including the economic cost of labor. It was then
adjusted upward by 12.75% to allow for the contribution of this increased
production to the country's foreign exchange position, assuming that 50% of
the value of production would be in export crops.
Ultimately, some 26 districts participated in the program, and
far fewer roads than originally planned were constructed in each district.
The value of marketed agricultural production in the country as a whole
increased sharply in the early years of the program, declined from 1977/78
to 1979/80, and then began to increase again, yielding an average growth
rate from 1976 to 1982 of about 9% per year in real terms.3/ During the
same period, the value of marketed agricultural production in the 26
program districts grew by about 7% per year in real terms4/. However,
production fell sharply in 1983/84, and the average growtW rate in the
program districts calculated over the whole life of the program was only
about 3% per year in real terms.
To calculate the agricultural benefits attributable to the
program, it was assumed that benefits would begin in the first year
following completion of the roads and that 10% of the incremental growth
3/ Based on data from Table 5.3, Volume II ("Statistical Appendix"), Kenya
Agricultural Sector Report, January 13, 1984.
4/ A comparison between these two figures is not very meaningful, however,
since the RARP districts accounted for 89% of total production in 1976
and 81% of total production in 1982. The apparently rapid increase in
the value of marketed production in the non-RARP districts is partly
due to the low base on which this increase is calculated, partly due to
the extension of marketing services to non-RARP distrticts during the
project period, and partly due to the fact that the national
calculations take into account a different product mix, notably
including livestock and dairy products.

(over the value of production in the year immediately prior to the start of
the program in each district) could be attributed to the program. To
forecast future benefits, a constant growth rate of 3% per year in real
terms in the value of marketed agricultural production was assumed, and 10%
of this growth or 0.3% of the incremental value of production was counted
as a benefit.  Following the appraisal methodology, 87.5% of these benefits
are counted in the economic analysis to adjust for the cost of inputs and
for the foreigh exchange value of outputs.
During implementation, the Government of Kenya agreed to adopt a
revised method of evaluating district level road programs. In this method,
only 60% of the previously-counted benefits would be included in order to
allow for the costs of other government services (apart from the direct
farm inputs for which allowance had already been made) that might be
contributing to the increase in agricultural production. In addition, no
benefits would be counted after ten years following completion of the
roads. The re-estimated rate of return using the revised methodology, and
taking account of technical assistance costs, is 16%.
Sensitivity Analysis
Applying the appraisal methodology without change would yield a
rate of return of 42%, considerably higher than foreseen at appraisal. This
favorable rate is largely due to the lower than anticipated cost for the
program, since agricultural production, although increasing, failed to in-
crease as fast as expected. The revised methodology, applied without taking
into account technical assistance costs, yields a rate of return of 22%.
A second type of sensitivity analysis can be made by eliminating
the shadow costing of wages and foreign exchange. Under these assumptions,
the rate of return for the RAR program would be 32%. However, when they are
combined with the revised evaluarion methodology, the rate of return for the
program becomes a marginal 13%.
It might be argued that since the appraisal assumed that a
program to build nearly 14,000 kilometers of road would increase the growth
rate of agricultural production in the affected districts by 10%, and since
only 56% of the construction target was achieved, it would be appropriate
to reduce the estimated benefits by a corresponding amount. Using the
appraisal methodology, this approach yields an estimated IRR of 24.5%, while
the 1979 revisAd methodology would reduce the rate of return with this
approach to only 6%.

Conclusions and Caveats
Evaluation of the economic impact of the RaR program depends
critically on the assumptions made concerning the relationship of the
program to distrlct agricultural production. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to provide an empirical test of this relationship in the Kenya
setting. The RAR program embraces most of the country's agriculturally
productive districts, so that no meaningful comparison can be made with
growth rates in districts that did not participate in the program.
Furthermore, since it is not possible to disaggregate the cost data to the
district level, there is no way of comparing the rate of return of the
program in different districts.
If one accepts that the RAR program, as carried out, may have
induced a 'O% increase in the rate of growth of agricultural production in
each participating district (compared to what this rate would have been
without the roads), then the program appears to have been a well justified
investment. If, however, one assumes that the program achieved only half
of this impact, and otherwise adopts the more conservative criteria of the
1979 methodology, then the investment turns out not to have been
justified. The ambiguity of this finding illustrates the need for more
focused impact studies that can determine with some degree of precision the
observed relationship between rural road investment and changes in
agricultural production.
There are a number of caveats to be taken into account in
interpreting these findings:
1. The economic evaluation methodology assumes that roads will
begin to have an effect as soon as they are constructed, and that this
effect will continue regardless of whether or not they are gravelled. It
further assumes that maintenance expenditure will be made as scheduled.
In fact, there remains a backlog of gravelling to be completed and this
will incur extra costs not Included in the economic evaluation. There
seems to be good reason to suorose that the routine maintenance which is
necessaryfor the preservation of the roads will be carried out, since the
systemis largely in place and is adequately funded. The timely execution
of regravelling (periodic maintenance) is assured under the IDA-financed
Second Highway Sector Project. Realization of the expected future benefits
depends on completing the gravelling program and on continued maintenance
of the completed roads.
2. The benefit calculation takes into account only the value of
marketed production for nine major crops. It does not account for any
increases (or decreases) in the marketing of minor or subsistence crops,
nor for any increase (or decrease) in on-farm consumption of food crops.
Crops of some significance in the RAR program districts whose recorded
production was not counted in the analysis include tobacco, wattle, and
sunflower seeds.

Annex 6
ajge 6of 7
3. In addition, the methodology takes no account of increases in
livestock or dairy production. Evidence from the impact study suggests,
however, that increased milk marketing was a significant consequence of the
RAP program iu some areas.  Milk, meat, fish, and eggs, as well as
vegetables and fruits, are perishable products which can be observed to
respond quickly to access improvements in rural areas which are reasonably
close to urban markets. In the light of the traffic data, it may be worth
noting that milk collection has heen observed to be carried out by bicycle
:n some of the impact zones.
4. The traffic data generated by the impact study are not
encouraging regaraing the extent to which the presumed agricultural
benefits are being translated into vehicle traffic on the road. Farmers
still deliver their coffee and tea, sisal and cotton to collection centers
by headloading. Maize, rice and wheat are sold to the Produce Marketing
Boards or to traders at the village market or the roadside. (Much of the
maize traffic may be evading the traffic counters, given the legal
prohibition of private transportation of maize across district lines).
Sugar cane is collected by trucks from the factory and transported over
short distances d rLng a peak harvest season. Pyrethum has a very high
value-to-volume ratio and would account for little traffic, despite its
high economic value.  It can be concluded from the foregoing that levels of
vehicle traffic may not always provide a good measure of the economic
impact of rural road investments.
5. Though vehicle traffic volumes are low, the kind of
transportation that is taking place on the newly opened roads may be of
great significant for future development in the RAR program districts. The
roads were selected partly to provide access for schools and heatlh
services, as well as the administrative centers where agricultural advice
is given, seeds and fertilizer are distributed, and crops are purchased.
The extension of sdch services into formerly isolated areas surely has
something to do with the steady, if not remarkable, growth of agricultural
production in these areas.
6. It may be noted that the estimated average growth rate in
agriculture, of 3% per year, is not sufficient to offset the effects of
Kenya's extremely high population growth rate. Thus, although the value of
agricultural production may be growing in response to rural roads, the
level of living in these areas as expressed in GDP/capita is declining in
real terms. It could be argued that if a rural road facilitated access to
family planning services that could reduce the birth rate by even one-tenth
of one percent, the impact on rural welfare might well be greater than any
consumption increase resulting from the road's effect on agricultural
production.
7. The economic evaluatioa methodology used by the Government
does not take into account the costs of the technical assistance, training,
and impact studycomponents of the RAR Program, although these elements were
critical to its success. The cost of these components was estimated in the
appraisal report at KE 1.2 million, excluding other donor contributions.
The cost of providing maintenance vehicles (KE 300,000) was also included



-46-
Annex 6
Page 7 of 7
in the project but not in the economic evaluation. Taken together, these
cost elements added an "overhead" of about 50% to the expected construction
costs of the program. If these costs had been added in at appraisal, the
project would certainly not have been considered a viable investments
Actual costs in these categories were not available, since most of these
expenditures were grant financed. However, these components have had an
institution-building impact that goes beyond the value which can be
measured by an increase in agricultural production along RAR roads. They
have become a source of institutional strength for the entire Ministry and
for other institutions in the Kenya Government, and their impact may even
extend to other developing countries.

Dear Mr. Watanabe:
Thank you for sentding us a copy of the Project Completion Report for the
Kenya Rural Access Roads Project. Since CIDA has entered the RAR
Program only within the last two years, the report provided an excellent
historical overview for the Kenya desk.
The impact of the program on institutional development in Kenya, while
not established as an objective in 1976, is well wc th documenting.
Donors, now planning for the minor roads program, are giving careful
consideration to the institutional capacity and needs of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications before implementing this program.
Difficulties in the gravelling component seemed to prevail throughout
the program. Recent improvements in the design of trailers may increase
the rate of gravelling. More careful analysis of gravelling sources, as
you recommended, and planning to include funds in the budget for hiring
contractors should prevent the development of severe gravelling
backlogs.
We would raise only one minor point in the section on Road Maintenance
(page 14). Lengthmen are normally selected from people who performed
well in the road construction stage. It is worth noting that in some
districts, a minority of these "lengthmen" are women.
Your report is very thorough and concludes that the RAR Program "has
been one of the most successful donor-financed programs In Kenya and one
of the best organized labour-intensive road construction programs
anywhere". The Interest shown in the program by a number of other
African countries may result in it serving as an appropriate model
beyond Kenya's national borders.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Watanabe,
Re: Project Completion Report
Kenya Rural Access Roads Project (RARP)
(K Loan 1305/Credit 561-KE)
Referring to your letter of March 7, 1986 inviting
comments to your first draft of the project comple-
tion report on the Kenya Rural Access Roads Project
(RARP) I take pleasure in informing you that a
Danish/Kenyan evaluation took place in March 1986.
In the light of the draft report from this Danida
evaluation mission Danida has the following remarks
to the draft of the World Bank completion report of
a general and more specific character.
1. The World Bank report is very positive with
regard to some aspects of the programme where
the Danida evaluation is more reserved. on the
other hand the Danida mission emphasizes aspects
of the RARP which are not touched upon by the
World Bank. In Danida we see it as something
very positive, that the Ministry of Transport
and Communications has established ;nstitutional
capacity for labour-intensive maintenance which
has resulted in a wish to expand this capacity
in the new Minor Roads Programme. We con-
sequently emphasize the 'institutional impact'
of the RARP on the MOTC as something very
remarkable.
2. The Danida evaluation mission does not agree
with the statement in para 5.02 (page 18) that
gravelling done by local contractors is 'cheaper
and speedier' than the gravelling method used by
-the RARP. The World Bank report does not sub-
stantiate this statement by any documentation.

ATTACHMENT
Page 4 of 7
In the statement no distinction is made between
the site of the gravel deposits and the trans-
portation distance. In the opinion of the Danida
evaluation mission it has been 'cheaper and
speedier' to use local contractors only if the
transportation distance exceeds approximately 10
km. In that case a lorry will represent the
cheapest method of transportation.
3. Danida is not in agreement with the statements
made in para 5.05, 5.06 and 5.07.

Appended please find the t.inistry's comments on the
above report.
Delay in submitting these comments earlier are highly
i resretted.
1.  Preface Paae (i)  ParacLraph (ii):   Add after reduced4
to 9000 kms I.hen it was realised that the target
cannot be realised by June 1985 because of the slow
implementation of RARP due to lack of donors financial
support in its early stage of implementation,
implementation capacity constraints and lack of
experience in labour-based road construction.*
2.  Iiighlirhts Page - VI  1st paragraph:
a) Add after 9000 kms wi.hen it was realised that the
target cannot be realised by Oune 1985 because of
the slow implementation of RARP due to lack of
donors financial support in its early stage of
implementation, implementation capacity constraints

b)  Same paragraph:                               page 6 of 7
Delete "SIDA" amongst the list of donre for RARP.
3. Chapter 2.05 on pane 4:
Last sentence delete 'Department" and then insert
"Section" so that the sentence reads 'The branch has
now become firmly entrenched as a section of Rural
Road. within the present Ministry of Transport and
Communications".
4. Ghapter 2.08 on Baoe 5:
The last but one sentence starting from "SIDA which
was                  is" is incorrect,  Please be informed
that SIDA has never been involved in financing of GBC
nor RARP. It is CIOA which has been financing the
two programmes.
S.  Ghapter 2.14 on page 6:
In the last sentence delete 6 and then insert "4.6" so
that the sentence becomes "The formation width was to
be constructed to 4.5 metres of which 4.0 metres was
to be surfaced with 10 - 15 cm murram - gravel".
6. chapter 2.15 on page 6:
a) The third sentence which starts with "To reduce
travel ........." can perhaps be re-phrased
as follows:-
"Each construction unit was sub-divided up to a
maximum of 5 sub-units which worked very close to
one another in order to reduce travel time for the
Supervisors".
b)   4th sentence which starts with "Casual labour  was
recruited .........." delete the words ",ost of
transport" since labour in RARP is not provided with
transport. The sentence should then read "Labour
was to be recuited at the village level within
walkinC distance to and from site to reduce tine-
loss".

c) 6th sentence which starts with *For each construction...."
delete "1 light mechanical roller' from the list of
equipment since none was used in the programme.
7. Chaeter 3,11 on page 14:
2nd sentence which starts with "Each unit employed .........
insert "six" for"four" since each unit was provided
with six tractors.
8. Chapter 3.12 on page 15:
In the sentence which reads "the organization structure
......... "   delete "23" and then insert "26".
delete 44 and then insert 45 since finally the programme
had 45 units operating in 26 districts.
9. Chapter 7.03 on page 23
let sentence which starts with "The Special Branch,
now .......   "  delete "Department' and then insert
"Section".
