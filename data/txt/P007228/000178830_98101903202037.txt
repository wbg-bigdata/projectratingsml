BEEF CATTLE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report is on the appraisal of a Project for a first
stage in the planned development of Guyana's beef cattle industry.
Guyana had a small beef export trade, but the industry has been
declining, largely because of poor management and the slaughter of
young stock, and Guyana now imports beef. It has been hampered also
by absence of long term land title, shortage of long term credit, and
lack of experience in modern ranching methods. Local cattle are
available for ranch development, if they can be mobilized; and large
areas are suitable for ranching. Some of these areas could be used
for sugar or rice, the two principal agricultural products; but
market prospects for these products are doubtful and large sums would
need to be spent on drainage and irrigation to prepare the land for
them.  Ranch development is the more attractive immediate use.
ii.       About 70% of Guyana's 260,000 cattle are in the Coastal Savanna.
A special and important feature of the Project is the mobilizing of coastal
cattle owners and their stock into commercial ranching enterprises on new
land under skilled management. At least 10 coastal groups, each comprising
10-50 cattle owners, say they would definitely participate and many others
are interested. Without the Project, it is very unlikely that they would
come together, and the cattle industry would not progress. A cautious
approach is proposed, however, and only an estimated 25 private ranches, 15
coastal and 10 elsewhere, would be included in this first phase. They
would be owned by individuals, partnerships, companies or cooperatives. In
addition, two ranches owned by the newly formed Livestock Development Co
Ltd (LDCo - Government and commercial partners) would be included.
iii.      The proposed IDA credit of US$2.2 million would be about 50% of
the estimated US$4.4 million equivalent project cost. US$1.8 million,
or about 82% of the credit, would finance the foreign exchange component
(40% of total cost). The balance of US$0.4 million, 18% of the credit,
would finance local currency expenditures. Government would contribute
about 14%; ranches (and land clearing contractors) and commercial banks
about 18% each. This would be the Bank Group's first direct lending for
Guyana agriculture though a Bank loan was made to the Credit Corporation
(which does some agricultural lending) in 1961 and repaid in 1969, and a
US$5 million loan was approved in 1968 for Sea Defense, which essentially
protects agricultural production.



ii
iv.       The credit would be made to the Government of Guyana, which
would bear the foreign exchange risk.  Government would set up a Livestock
Development Fund (LDF), Lo be administered by the Bank of Guyana as Trustee,
and transfer to it the funds needed to rediscount commercial bank loans and
run the project.
v.         Commercial banks would lend to project ranches for 12 years,
including 4 years' grace, at 9 1/2% per year, of which 1/2% would he
passed on as service fee to the Bonk of Guyana by way of contribution to
the costs of its Livestock Projects Division (LPD). They woulld also lend
to clearing contractors (for purchase of imported machinery) for 5 years,
including 1 year's grace, at 9%. These rates compare with the 1969 average
for all lending in Guyana, mostly short term, of 8 1/2%.  Commercial
banks would rediscount 75% of their project loans with LDF at 6%; and IDA
would reimburse to LDF the amounts so rediscounted (82% of the proposed
credit). IDA would also finance the foreign exchange cost of LPD (13% of
the credit) and of studies for further development of the livestock
industry (5%).
vi.        Loans to project ranches would be used to finance fencing, water,
pasture establishment-, agricultural. machinery, ranch buildings and other
investment items, wheld  would  nost 1-7 'e bought through existing commercial
channels.  Internatiornal competltive bidding would not be appropriate
because the scale cf-i individual investmenit is too small, and the variety
too great, for bhilk procurement.
vii.       The Project would lead to improvenment and upgrading of Guyana's
beef cattle industry and ;give it important stimulus, both by example
and through the supply of surplus breeding and fattening stock.  It would
involve the commercial banks for the first time in long term lending for
agriculture. It would increase net beef production after about three years,
saving imports and possibly leading to exports.
viii.      Returns on incremental investment would be satisfactory, both
to ranching enterprises (13% to 21% depending on location and type) and
to the economy of Guyana (21%). Subject to assurances, the Project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$2.2 million.

BEEF CATILE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governmenxt of Guyana seeks IDA finance for a beef cattle
project, a first stage in the planned development of the industry.
Prospects for beef cattle development were recognized by a Bank economic
mission in October/Navew)er 1966. 1/ An FAO livestock reconnaissance
mission visited Guyana in June/July 1968. The Project was prepared in
July/December 1969 by a Government Livestock Prepaiation Coamission
headed by Mr. C. Chisholm, an international consultant, assisted from
time to time by Bank staff. This report is based 6tt the findings of an
IDA appraisal mission to Guyana in February/Marcb 1970, composed of Messrs
P.G. Nelson, R. Milford (IDA), C. Arnorin (Consultant Economist) and H. Kelly
(Cooperative and Marketing Consultant).
1.02      Government sought an IDA credit of US$4 million to finance
a project estimated to cost US$7  iil1ion.  The nroject  ut.bmitted included
investment in 24 coastal ranches averaging 10,000 ac, 3 Ititermedliate
Savanna ranches, and a coastal ranch of 20,('100 ac to bp owned by a newly
formed Livestock Development %oQmpany (LDCo), together with initial herds.
It was agreed with Government that the equilent of about 15 coastal ranches
of 10,000 ac, of which 7,500 ac (average) would be developed initially, would
be a more realistic first phase target and that, in general, the Intermediate
Savanna is not yet ready for development. It was also igreed that 10 private
ranches (average 64,000 ac) and one LDCo ranch of 200,000 ac in the Rupununi
Savanna (see Map) be included.  The revised project is astimated to cost
US$4.4 million.

British Commonwealth In February 1970.  Bounded by Veaezuela, Brazil and
Surinam, its 83,000 sq mi. (about the same as UVi) divides Into foiur natural
regions:
(a)  Coastal Savanna:  270 mi of narrow fertile coastal plain,
mostly below sea level and seasonally flooded. Soils range
from heavy black clay in lower areas to sandy loam in Islands
of forest.  About 95% of the population lives in this 2,500
sq mi (3% of the land area) producing 80% of Gross Domestic
Produtct (GDP). The region has about 70% of the country's
cattle;
(b)  Intermediate Savanna:  a sandy clay belt, southwest of the
coastal plain; of low fertility and sparsely populated;
(c) The Guyana Mountains: a high range that runs NW/SE and
extends into Surinam and French Guiana; and
(d) Rupununi Savanna: in the southwest interior, with soils of
generally low fertility and poor moisture retention. Ranch-
ing is the main industry in this region and it has about 25%
of the country's cattle.
Climate
2.02      Coastal rainfall averages 80 in per year, is heavy from May to
mid-August and light from November to February; temperature ranges from
750 to 80 F. Rupuntiunl Savanna rainfa.l averages from 50 to 60 in, almost
all between May and Augulst; temperature ranges from 70° to 80° F.
Population
2.03      Guyana's English speaking multi-racial population of about
700,000 is growing at a rate of 2.8% per year. Approximately 35% of the
1968 labor force of about 245,000 was employed in agriculture, mostly
rice production; 2% in mining; 43% in Government, commerce, industry and
services. 20% were officially unemployed. 1/ Annual per capita rural
income in 1969 was about US$160.
Foreign Trade
2.04      Guyana's trade balance showed an average annual surplus of
US$29 million from 1961-64, a small deficit between 1965-67, and small
surpluses again in 1968 and 1969.

2.05      Of total 1969 exports worth US$130 million, 47% came from agriculture
(sugar 35%; rice 7%; others 5%); 46% from mining, mainly bauxite and
alumina; and 7% from the rest. Of total 1969 imports costing US$120
million, agricultural products made up approximately 17%; vehicles,
cigarettes, beverages and other consumer goods 16%; fuels, lubricants,
chemicals and machinery 39%; and semi-manufactures 28%.l/
B. The Agricultural Sector
Contribution to the Economy
2.06      Guyana agriculture contributed about 21% of CDP in 1969.  While
GDP grew at 4% per year from 1955-69, agricultural product grew only 3% per
year, with a marked slowing in the rate towards the end, mainly due to rice
production problems. Of the total 1969 value of agricultural production,
cane sugar contributed 47% and rice 12%. All crops together contributed
70%, livestock 14%, fishing and forestry 8% each.
Agricultural Services
2.07      Agricultural Extension is organized into six districts with a
staff of 65. Most work on sugar, rice, and general farming; none specif-
ically on beef cattle.
2.08      Agricultural education is centered on Government's principal
agricultural research station at Mon Repos, near Georgetown. Two-year
diploma and certificate courses are offered together with regular 3 to 4
week courses for farmers. Advanced agricultural training is available at the
Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, where Guyana has a
student quota.
2.09      Rice and coconut research is conducted at Mon Repos, with some
attention to livestock, mainly dairy cattle, pigs and poultry. Beef cattle
and pasture research is conducted mainly at Ebini in the Intermediate
Savanna. Work here and at St. Ignatius in the Rupununi (now closed), though
of long standing, has had little impact because it lacked an economic approach.
Production-oriented research has begun at Ebini, and USAID has a program
there for cattle cross-breeding and study of the nutritional value of pastures
and supplements.

2.10      The Government Veteritary Service comprises a Senior Officer and
six District Officers with supporting technical staff. District Officers
have wide powers to control disease and also advise on animal husbandry and
nutrition. They are now too few for a full service, though improvement is
expected as gradua tes return from overseas.
Credit
2.11      There are six commercial banks in Guyana. 1/  Five are branches
of international banks and the sixth is the new National Cooperative
Bank.  About 80% of their loans to the private sector are for one year
or less. They provide some long term credit, as do the Guyana Credit
Corporation, life insurance companies, and a building (savings and loan)
society. Most long term lending is for real estate. About 10% of total
credit is devoted to agriculture, though between 1966 and 1969 the amount
increased from G$2.5 to 5 million (US$1.3 to 2.5 million) in line with
growth in other lending. Between 4% and 10X was for livestock.
2.12      The average interest rate in 1969 was about 8-1/2% per year; in
1968 it was just over 8%. Prime lending rate has been 7-1/2% since
July 1966. The rate for agriculture is now generally 8-1/2% to 9-1/2%,
with 10% for some personal loans. Banking and credit are discussed more
fully in Annex J.
2.13      Agricultural enterprises witL good collateral are well supplied
with short term credit, but very little long term credit has been available.
Small farmers get limited short term credit from the Guyana Marketing Corpo-
ration, and the National Cooperative Bank is intended to help them further.
Bank Group Lending for Agriculture
2.14      The Bank Group has made two loans related to Guyana agriculture.
Loan 285 BG was made to the Credit Corporation in 1961 and repaid in 1969.
US$5 million loan 559 GUA for Sea Defense, which essentially protects
agricultural production, was approved in September 1968 (US$161,000
disbursed by August 31, 1970).
C. The Beef Cattle Sub-Sector
2.15      The national beef herd of about 260,000 is almost entirely
Creole and Creole-Zebu cross. About 180,000 are in the coastal strip and
60,000 in the Rupununi. The cattle population had risen between 1960 and

Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia; Guyana National Cooperative Bank.

1965 to perhaps more than 300,000, though figures are not very reliable.
The number is now dwindling because of poor management, reduction of grazing
areas due to agricultural development, and premature slaughter of young
stock and breeding cattle. Cattle generally run freely to graze where they
can - often, in the coastal areas, on public domain or communal pastures
(which are badly mismanaged). Output is consequently low and losses high.
About 45,000 coastal families are in rice farming and half of them own
cattle. Less than 1,000 owners have more than 25 cattle; about 200 have
more than 50; very few more than 1,000.
2.16      There is little experience of modern cattle ranching.  Average
annual offtake is 10%; by comparison, an average of 15% is quite common
in South America. Average carcass weight is low and has been declining;
it was 320 lb in 1965 and 280 lb in 1969. On the few well managed
ranches, steers reach a carcass weight of 400-420 lb in 3 to 4 years in
the Coastal Savanna, and in 5 to 7 years in the Rupununi.
Animal Health
2.17      Calving percentages are low (about 40%) and calf mortalities
sometimes as high as 35%. General causes are poor nutrition and parasitic
infection. In the Coastal Savanna, a common cause is drowning, for most coastal
pastures are low-lying, flood for 3 to 8 months every year, and rarely have
high ground on which cows can calve. Adult cattle mortality is also high
(6 to 7%), due partly to mineral deficiencies; stealing may be a contributory
factor on the coast.
2.18      Foot and mouth disease (FMD) occurs spasmodically in the Rupununi
but not on the coast, though it is a potential threat there. Paralytic
rabies occurs countrywide. These and other diseases are controlled by the
veterinary service through regular vaccination programs.
Problem of Increasing Beef Production from Coastal Area
2.19      The key to development of the Guyana beef industry is increased
production from the coastal area. Most owners there realize their cattle
would do better if properly handled in herds under controlled management,
instead of wandering at will; but they are not very willing to give up
individual ownership to form such herds. It would be technically feasible
to increase production from small units, but it would be difficult, take a
long time and be costly in relation to achievable benefit. Further details
of the industry are in Annex 2.
!arkets
2. 20     Annual per capita beef consumption at 16 lb is one of the
lowest in South America. 1/ To reverse the declining production trend,
'I   Bolivia 18, Argentina 190 lb; also cf Jamaica 21, USA 110, UK S0 lb.



-^ 6 -
without importing large numbers of breeding cattle (which are hard to find,
and would be costly), immature stock and breeding cows must be retained.
This would initially reduce beef production still further, requiring increased
imports to maintain consumption at present levels.
2.21      Georgetown and New Amsterdam are the two principal markets (see
Map) and cattle move there by boat, truck, train or on foot. Georgetown
has one major municipal abattoir but this has no facilities for recovery of
by-products and its cold storage is not used. Private cold stores in
Georgetown, however, have sufficient capacity for immediate needs. Lethem,
in the Rupununi, has a modern abattoir with spare capacity for near-term
expansion.
2.22      Coastal cattle are generally sold through dealers, while those
from the Rupununi are sold almrost entirely through Meat Marketing Ltd (a
company organized by 22 producers). The average retail price of beef in
1969 was G$0.67 (US$0.38) per lb. Average farmgate price is about 75% of
retail. Guyana has exported small quantities of beef, but tight supply
and uncertainties about FMD have now almost eliminated exports. During
the last five years, beef imports varied between about 10% and 20% of
consumption. Further details are in Annex 3.
ItI. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The Project is the development of selected beef cattle ranches
in Guyana. It includes a 5-year program of long term loans for ranch
development (12 years) and land clearing equipment (5 years) through
commercial banks. These would finance the equivalent of 15 coastal ranches,
(including one in the Intermediate Savanna and the cattle operations of
some small coastal mixed farms), 10 commercial and Amerindian tribal
ranches in the Rupununi, 1 LDCo coastal ranch (20,000 ac), and 1 LDCo Rupununi
ranch (200,000 ac). Phasing of the entry of ranches into the Project,
each borrowing by three annual instalments, would be approximately:

3.02      Technical services would be provided through a Livestock Projects
Division (LPD) which, together with a Livestock Development Fund (LDF),
formed by Government for rediscount of loans under the program, would be
administered by the Bank of Guyana as Trustee for Government (see Section
D). The Project would also provide training of ranch managers and studies
for further development of the livestock industry.
B. Project Areas and Land Tenure
Coastal Project Area
3.03      Fourteen of the fifteen coastal ranches, would be in the low
lying flood plain within 30 miles of New Amsterdam (see Map). The fifteenth
would be a partially developed private ranch in the Intermediate Savanna.
Native pastures are generally good, though improvable, an(d high rainfall
would make for relatively easy pasture establishment on cleared forest
land. Commercial ranching is being successfully carried out at the Kabawer
ranch (Bookers Sugar Estates Ltd). Unimproved pasture carries about 1
beast to 4 ac: minimal improvement raises this to 1 beast to 2 ac.
Rupununi Project Area
3.04      The ten Rupununi ranches would have Lethem as their natural
outlet (see Map). Open range carries only 1 beast to 64 ac but careful
management can improve this to 1 beast to 30 ac, or better. Extensive
cattle ranching can be successful there, as the Rupununi Development Co Ltd
and numbers of smaller private ranches demonstrate. Rainfall is good and
so are prospects for pasture improvement.
Land Tenure
3.05      Few project ranches now have acceptable freehold or leasehold
title. On the coast most of them would be newly established on State
land with 25 year renewable, transferable leases. Large tracts of
suitable land are available. Most Rupununi ranchers have long term title
to their homesteads, but only annual grazing rights for their pasture.
Whi]e these rights have been regularly renewed, they do not encourage
long term investment and cannot be used as security for long term loans.
3.06      Government has promised prompt issue of leases to participating
ranches on terms acceptable as security for commercial banks. To facilitate
issue of leases within 60 days of application Government is amending its
legislation to enable aerial survey to be used for defining lease areas.
During negotiations, appropriate assurances were obtained from Government,
and it will be a condition of effectiveness that at least 30,000 ac of
coastal land had been surveyed for immediate lease as project ranches.

3.07      Amerindian (indigenous) villages have non-transferable tribal
land, unsuitable as security for loans from commercial banks. Government
has guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on commercial bank loans
to participating Amerindian ranches (of which about four are expected in
the Project) in a form acceptable to the commercial banks and it is a
condition of effectiveness that the necessary legislation be passed.
C. Detailed Features
Ranch Ownership and Type
3.08      Participating ranches would be owned by individuals, partnerships,
companies or cooperatives. The form of ownership would depend on individual
preference and circumstance but, unless a ranch was owned by only one person,
cattle would be owned by the ranching enterprise and not by its members
separately. Coastal and Amerindian ranches are expected to be owned by
newly formed cooperatives whose members would have contributed cattle in
exchange for share. The few coastal mixed farmers included, whose
cattle operations would be developed under the Project, have mortgageable
land and own up to 500 cattle each. They are equivalent in total
to about one coastal ranch. All ranches (except Amerindian - see para
3.07) would have long term renewable leases or otlher acceptable land
title. The average ranch and herd sizes would be:
Type of Ranch    Size      Acres to be      Initial      Target
(Acres)    Developed        Herd        herd
Coastal      10,000      7,500          2,750       5,000
Rupununi     64,000    64,000           1,200       2,250
Mobilization of Coastal Cattle Owners
3.09      A special and important feature of the Project is the grouping
of small coastal cattle owners into commercial ranching enterprises. The
Preparation Commission set up for this Project, together with Government
staff, persuaded a number of small coastal cattle owners that it would
be worth their while to combine, transfer most of their cattle to enterprises
they would own collectively, on new land that Government would make available,
and employ ranch managers under the central supervision of a Project Director.
Those who rely on cattle for occasional cash income would keep a few for
this purpose. They would also keep or dispose of elsewhere, those cattle
not accepted into the Project. Enough cattle owners have expressed interest
to form at least ten enterprises, and a few have already been formed as



ranching cooperatives; others await the outcome of Government's application to
IDA and the granting of leases. All would need the stimulus the Project can
provide. Government's offer of long term leases on new land at reasonable
rental is a powerful incentive and 15 coastal ranches, of various types, is
a reasonable initial objective.
Cooperative Ranching Enterprises
3.10      For primary agricultural cooperatives of the usual type, in
Guyana as elsewhere, business transactions are simple and conducted on
a relatively small scale. Such cooperatives can be managed by the elected
officers and committee. For ranching enterprises, it is essential that
the ranch manager be clearly responsible for the technical and financial
operation of the ranch, without interference from elected officers and
committee. For this, and other reasons the traditional form of cooperative
rules is not entirely suitable for cooperative enterprises. A form of rules
has been devised that would, with relatively minor amendments, be suitable,
and acceptable to IDA. Certain exemptions would be required under the
Guyana Cooperative Societies law and can be given by the Cabinet of Ministers.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that rules, acceptable to IDA,
and in conformity with the Cooperative Societies Ordinance would be adopted
and would not be changed so as to adversely affect commercial operation of
project ranches. It would be a condition of effectiveness that any neces-
sary exemptions be obtained.
3.11      Cattle owners forming ranching enterprises will need help with
legal and administrative details. Only limited assistance can be expected
from the overworked Cooperative Department and an early task of LPD (see
paras 3.02, 3.22 and 3.23) would be to organize ranch formation. The LPD
Deputy Director (Administrative) would be primarily responsible for this task.
Details of the problems of cooperative group ranch organization and
suggestions for their solution are outlined in Annex 4.
LDCo Ranches
3.12      LDCo, to be formed specially by Government and private investors,
would be an important part of the Project. LDCo property would comprise:
(a) a 20,000 ac ranch based on the Government owned Mara Rice
Scheme (now dormant), which has housing, workshops and
access roads. It would include an initial commercial
herd of about 3,000 local cattle and a small stud herd
of specially imported cattle to provide high grade breeding
stock to the industry. Commercial production of pasture
legume and grass seed would also be included; and
(b) a 200,000 ac ranch based on the Government owned St.
Ignatius station in the Rupununi with an initial herd of about
3,000.



- 10 -
3.13      These ranches would be run by a Ceneral Manager, internationally
recruited by LDCo and satisfactory to IDA; he would be available part time
for training ranch managers and 25% of his salary would be paid by LPD.
At the time of appraisal, LDCo had not been formed. Covernment has since
been discussing details with prospective shareholders, on the basis of
Government holding 51% of the share capital, and has registered LDCo under
Guyanese law. It would be a condition of effectiveness that LDCo had been
established and shall have adopted articles of Agreement mutually satisfac-
tory to Government and IDA and Government shall h-ave secured confirmed
agreement from other interested parties to subscribe to its equity. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that LDCo general
manager, satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed.
Ranch Development and Management
3.14      Four models illustrate the Project:  one for ranches in the
Coastal Savanna; one for ranches in the Rupununi; and one for each of the
two LDCo ranches. Financial projections show the amount of new investment
and how it would be financed-80% by long term loans from commercial banks
and 20% by ranch contributions (in cash and kind). Coastal ranches would
have surplus saleable steers, or equivalent cash, to help provide working
capital and ranch contributions to investment. Rupununi ranches already
have some improvemenits but would need funds for ranch contributions to new
investment (para 3.15) and additional working capital. LDCo would
have equity financinlg for ranch contribution to new investment and initial
working capital. All ranches would need short term finance during the
initial herd build-up period and, during negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Bank of Guyana that it would require participating banks
to provide this finance to eligible ranches on the basis of development
plans approved under the Project. Details of Investment, Herd Projections
and Financial Projections are in Annexes 5 through 16.
3.15      Ranch output would markedly increase through management
techniques applied under the guidance of the Project Director and through
investment in fencing, stock handling facilities, dry season water supplies,
land clearing and pasture establishment, and other improvements, including
tractors and implements, 4-wheel drive vehicles, outboard canoes (water
access is important in the Coastal Savanna) and adequate housing for the
managers and labor.
3.16      Ranch managers would ensure disease control, particularly in
the Rupununi where cattle would be vaccinated regularly against FMD.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that: veteri-
nary services would be provided for project ranches, comprising at least
one veterinary officer for coastal ranches and one veterinary officer for
the Rupununi, both of whom would be stationed permanently in their respec-
tive areas; adequate measures to protect cattle from FMD under the Project
in the Rupununi would be taken including the use of appropriate vaccines
fully in accordance with the Pan American FMD Prevention Program; and sup-
plies of vaccine for project ranches would be readily available.



- 11 -
Ranch Manager Training
3.17      Though some ranches would have managers or owner/managers who
could operate successfully under the guidance of the Project Director,
shortage of trained managers is a major constraint. About 24 potential
managers are being trained at Tuskegee, Alabama, but most would need
further experience in Guyana before assuming full responsibility. LDCo
would set up a training scheme under its General Manager but, until this
is ready, the Kabawer ranch (para 3.03) would provide facilities. The Project
Director would arrange this training. It would be a condition of every
sub-loan that a manager, approved by the Project Director, be employed.
Land Clearing
3.18      An important element is land clearing on coastal ranches (about
10% of their area). Several contractors in Guyana have experience in clean
clearing with heavy tractor and blade but few know how to clear by chaining
i.e. pulling down trees with a heavy chain drawn between two tractors.
To encourage interest in this type of clearing, the Project includes
5-year loans for two heavy duty (250 hp plus) tractors and a heavy
(10 to 16 ton) chain. Funds are also included for visits by LPD and
contractor staff to similar areas, e.g. Venezuela, where chaining is
practiced. Project costs have been based on the higher known cost of
blading (US$15 per ac). The Project Executive Committee (para 3.21) would
select a contractor after inviting proposals. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that no loan for clearing equipment would be
made unless the Committee was satisfied as to the prospective borrower's
competence in chaining.
Developmental Studies
3.19      The Project includes production-oriented technical, marketing,
and processing studies for the future development of the industry, and
the preparation of further livestock projects for possible Bank group lending.
Technical studies, for which about US$80,000 would be provided, would
include pasture establishment with tropical legumes,, animal production trials
and use of urea/molasses supplements. They would be carried out in the
Project Areas, Intermediate Savanna and the Northwest by staff of the Ministry
of Agriculture and, if necessary, by consultants. The other studies would
be carried out by consultants (8 to 12 man-months) and are estimated to cost
about US$40,000. Before each study was carried out, the Project Director,
who would be responsible for study supervision, would be consulted and
Government would submit for IDA approval, detailed terms of reference and
the names of proposed consultants.  During negotiations appropriate assurances
to this effect were obtained.
D.  Organization and Ianage!yent
3.20      The Project would be organized throtugl its trtiste42, the Bank of
Guyana (see Chart), the most suitable agency through which to channel funds



- 12 -
to the commercial banks. A Livestock Advisory Commnittee, set up by Minis-
terial Decree, composed of the Governor of the Bank of Guyana (Chairman) and
one representative each from the Ministries of Agriculture and of Economic
Development, the participating banks and one selected by the cattle produ-
cers, would be responsible for general policy. The Project Director would
be Executive Secretary. It would be a condition of effectiveness that such
a committee be set up.
3.21      A small Project Executive Committee, set up by the Bank of Guyana
Board, would make LPD's recommendations to commercial banks. It would com-
prise one representative each from the Ministry of Agriculture (Chairman),
Bank of Guayana, and the Ministry of Economic Development, and the Project
Director.
3.22      LPU) would be headed by the Project Director, a specialist in
animal husbandry or related activity, responsible to the Governor of the
Bank of Guyana for implementation of the project.  He would be assisted
by a Deputy Director (Technical), a Deputy Director (Administrative),
approximately five Livestock Teclhnicians, and supporting staff.
It would be a condition of effectiveness that LDF and LPD had been
established and that an internationally recruited Project Director,
satisfactory to IDA, had been appointed on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA and, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Bank
of Guyana that Deputy Directors (Technical) and (Administrative), accepta-
ble to IDA, would be appointed. (See Annexes 17 and 18).
3.23      LPD would help ranches prepare loan applications, including
detailed ranch development plans, and would make a technical, economic and
financial appraisal of each ranch on behalf of the commercial bank through
which an application had been submitted. Conmercial banks would assess
creditworthiness. LPD staff would supervise progress of ranch plans and
assist and advise ranch managers. The Project Director would arrange for
local and overseas training of technicians. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from thle Bank of (;uyana that sub-loans would be made on the
basis of ranch plans approved by LPD and that loan agreements would contain
suitable performance covenants.
E. Cost Estimates
3.24      Total project cost is estimated at G$8.9 million (US$4.4
million), including contingencies, of which about US$1.8 million
would be the foreign exchange component. Estimates are based on
enquiries in the field during appraisal, and include approximately
10% for contingencies to cover possible omissions and increases in cost.
Details are in Annex 19. The Livestock Development Fund cash flow is in
Annex 21. Summarized cost estimates are:

P.  Finan
3.25      Proposed financing is based on IDA covering 60% of new on-ranch
investment and clearing equipment costs,, with participants (including Govern-
ment as LDCo shareholder) and commerical banks providing 20% each. IDA would
also cover the foreign exchange costs of LPD and developmental studies. IDA
would thus finance the total foreign exchange cost of US$1.8 million and
US$0.4 million equivalent of local currency cost. Participants would contri-
bute US$0.8 million in cash or kind according to their means, and commercial
banks US$0.8 million. Goverlnment contribution includes assets and some cash
for LDCo and the local cost of LPD and developmental studies, a total of
US$0.6 million. Ranches would also contribute by retaining stock, not in-
cluded in project cost, valued at about US$1 million during the first three
years of herd development.
3.26      On the above basis, estimated project financing (including
contingencies) would be:

G. Procurement
3.27      International competitive bidding would not be appropriate
because the scale of individual investment is too small, and the variety
of items too great, for bulk procurement.  There is no restriction on
imports and, except on vehicles (25%), duties are reasonable (6 to 11%,



- 15 -
subject to Commonwealth preference of 5%). Apart from breeding cattle,
semen and pasture seed, items needed for the Project are readily
available through existing commercial channels, including many international
suppliers. Competition is keen and servicing adequate. Breeding cattle
and semen would be purchased by LDCo from a country free of FMD; but the
Project Director would be consulted and no imports under this category made
without his prior approval. Pasture seed is subject to rigorous Government
control. During negotiations, appropriate assurances as to procurement
were obtained from Government and from the Bank of Guyana.
H1. Disbursement
3.28      IDA would reimburse to Government the amount of commercial bank
loans discounted by the Bank of Guyana from LDF (up to a maximum of 75%
of the total of such loans) and 100% of the foreign exchange cost of LPD
and developmental studies, against certified statements of disbursement.
3.29      IDA credit disbursement, allowing slippage (Annex 21), would be
approximately:

3.30      It is intended that amounts not used for the credit be canceled.
I. Accounts and Audit
3.31      Commercial banks would keep separate accounts of project lending and
submit details to LPD. LPD would also keep accounts showing the total of
approved ranch plans (on-ranch investment and working capital), sub-loans
made, amounts discounted by LDF, and LPD expenses. The above accounts would
be audited by the independent auditors of the Bank of Guyana (Pannel,
Fitzpatrick & Co), who are acceptable to IDA. The Ministry of Agriculture
would keep separate accounts of expenditure on developmental studies and
these would be audited in a manner satisfactory to IDA. Appropriate assurances
were obtained during negotiations. Assurances were also obtained that sum-
maries of these accounts would be submitted quarterly to IDA, and that copies
of audited project accounts would be submitted to IDA not more than three
months from the end of the Bank of Guyana's and Government's fiscal years,



- 16 -
respectively, and that copies of the Bank of Guyana's audited annual
accounts would be sent to IDA, when issued.
J. Lending Operations
3.32      Each loan application would be made to a commercial bank and,
if the applicant's credit rating were satisfactory, would be passed to
LPD for appraisal. After appraisal it would go to the Project Executive
Committee for final recommendation and return to the commercial bank that
submitted it. A favorable recommendation would not be made without the
Project Director's approval which would also be needed before changes to
the development plan could be made. Criteria for selection, in addition to
creditworthiness, would be: ownership of an acceptable beef herd; manage-
ment by a ranch manager approved by the Project Director; and tenure, on a
25 year renewable lease (or better), of an appropriate ranching area, includ-
ing in the case of coastal ranches, at least 10% not susceptible to annual
flooding. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that these proce-
dures would be followed. Assurances were also obtained that LPD would sub-
mit details to IDA before submitting for approval, any sub-loan (or series
of sub-loans to one applicant) of more than US$150,000 equivalent and in the
case of sub-loans to LDCo the LPD would satisfy IDA that LDCo has sufficient
funds and is adequately staffed to carry out the Development Plan.
3.33      To enable cattle to be accepted as security for long term lending,
Government has drafted a Livestock Loans Act, similar to the Guyana
Agricultural Loans Act of 1966, which would enable lenders to take a
fixed and floating charge over a borrower's assets and make it a criminal
offence for a borrower to sell pledged property except as provided in a
loan agreement between lender and borrower. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that the Livestock Loans Act was acceptable
to participating banks as the legal basis for long term lending, and it
would be a condition of effectiveness that such an Act had been passed.
3.34      The commercial banks would make sub-loans for 12 years, with
4 years' grace, at 9 1/2% per year, including 1/2% service fee which
would be credited to LDF. 75% of each loan would be rediscounted with
LDF at 6%, (except Government guaranteed loans to Amerindian ranches,
which would be rediscounted at 8%) giving commercial banks, which would
carry the total loan risk, a reasonable margin of 3%. The rediscount
rate would be keyed to prime rate (changing in the proportion of one point
to every three points change in the prime rate) so as to maintain the margin
on the banks' own 25% contributions. Commercial banks would also make short
term loans for working capital at the current rate. During negotiations,
appropriate assurances were obtained from Government and the Bank of Guyana
including an assurance that a form of agreement acceptable to IDA, would
be entered into between the Bank of Guyana and participating banks.



- 17 -
3.35      The IDA credit would be made to Government which would bear the
foreign exchange risk. IDA funds for rediscounting cormercial bank loans,
and for operation of LPD, would be credited to LDF by Government which
would need to provide initial resources (interest free) to LDF. Surpluses
would be freely available to Government for any public investment purpose
including further livestock development, as interest payments are made and
sub-loans repaid over 14 years (Annex 20). During negotiations, conditions
of the Trusteeship Agreement between Government and the Bank of Guyana
were finalized and specific assurances were obtained from Government that
it would provide the amounts needed for initial operation of LDF. It would
be a condition of effectiveness that the Trusteeship agreement be signed.
IV. MARKETS, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Markets
4.01      In spite of a rising population, Guyana beef demand has remained
fairly static over the last few years, due largely to tight supply (Annex 3).
Existing slaughter facilities are satisfactory for the Project but improve-
ments would be needed to make them suitable for later meat exports. Sales
would be made through Meat Marketing Ltd or other channel acceptable to the
banks. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that no price control
would be imposed on beef unless mutually satisfactory to Government and IDA.
Prices
4.02      Between 1965 and early 1970 beef retail prices rose by 25% from
G$0.55 to 0.69/lb. Producer prices generally rose in parallel, though
with a tendency to harden during late 1969/early 1970 because of the
temporary ban on movement of Rupununi cattle due to FMD. W4hile prices
might continue to rise somewhat, a steady coastal producer price of
G$0.50/lb (Rupununi G$0.43), the 1969 average, has been assumed for
project estimates, compared with G$0.55/56 during early 1970 and an
average of G$0.47 over the last four years.
Producer Benefits
4.03      It is difficult to quantify present benefits to coastal beef
producers, who are numerous and whose practices vary. The Project would,
however, increase net income before tax, as the following table shows:

/2   Result of 10% decrease/increase from assumed output prices.
4.04      Rupununi returns would be lower because costs are higher and
farmgate prices lower than on the coast; but no additional management costs
would be incurred on owner-managed Rupununi ranches. In addition to the
above increases in net income, herd values would increase substantially:
coastal from G$370,000 to 820,000; Rupununi G$138,000 to 280,000; and LDCo
G$0.8 to 3.8 million.
Revenue Generation
4.05      Ranches would pay interest and repay loans from revenue over the
first 12 years and their owners would be liable to income tax on total
ranch and other income. Capital expenditure is deductible for tax pur-
poses, and losses can be carried forward. At the forecast rate of invest-
ment, tax would not be payable until about the 7th or 8th year when, at
present rates and under present tax law, it would be 45% if profits are
retained, 60% if distributed. The following is an illustration:

- 19 -
4.06      Beef cattle owners have not reinvested extensively in cattle
raising, mainly because of lack of secure land title (para 3.05). Proj-
ect ranches would have this security and would be encouraged to make
further improvements. They would also reinvest through their increased
herds, retaining stock that would otherwise have been sold (para 3.25).
4.07      The tax position of individual ranches would vary according to
size, profitability and other income. At present, cooperatives are
not taxed as corporations but members are liable for tax on dividends.
Government tax revenue would depend on these variables, future tax poli-
cies, and the efficiency of tax collection (not high in rural Guyana).
Based on the above table and on similar calculations for Rupununi and
LDCo ranches, maximum incremental tax revenue from the project would be
of the order of G$2 million (US$1 million) per year at full development.
V. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project would increase Guyana's beef supply from about the
4th year. At full development in the 11th year, incremental annual production
would reach 2,800 sh tons beef, valued at about G$2.8 million (US$1.4 million).
This would be about 45% of present annual supply. At full production, an-
nual foreign exchange earnings or savings would be about US$1.0 million
annually.
5.02      The estimated rate of return to the economy of Guyana, dis-
counted over the assumed 20 year life of project ranches, would be 20%.
A shadow wage rate has been used (G$3 instead of G$4) because of the high
rate of unemployment, and the value of Rupununi production has been re-
duced by the amount of the air freight subsidy. Details of these and
other adjustments are in Annex 22.
5.03      In addition to its direct benefits, the Project would be impor-
tant for the stimulus it would give to the beef cattle industry, both by
example and by the supply of surplus improved young breeding and fattening
stock. It would involve the commercial banks for the first time in long
term lending for agriculture and would lead to import savings and ultimat-
ely to export revenues.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS 1/
6.01      In addition to standard assurances agreement was reached with
Government during negotiations that:
11   References in parenthesis to previous paragraph numbers.



- 20 -
(a) 25 year (or better) renewable, transferable leases, on
terms acceptable as s.!curity to the commercial banks, would
be issued promptly to participating ranches (within 60 days
of application) (3.06);
(b) rules for cooperative ranches, acceptable to IDA, and in
conformity with the Cooperative Societies Ordinance, would
be adopted and would not be changed so as to adversely affect
commercial operation of project ranches (3.10);

(3.13);
(d) essential veterinary services would be provided so as to
ensure disease control, particularly FMD, on project ranches (3.16);

satisfactory to Government and IDA (4.01).
6.02      During negotations, assurances were obtained from the Bank of
.'uyana as Trustee administering LDF that:
(a) it would require participating banks to provide short term
finance to eligible ranches on the basis of development plans
approved under the Project (3.14);
(b) sub-loans would be made on the basis of ranch plans approved
by LPD and loan agreements would contain suitable performance
covenants (3.23);
(c) it would rediscount up to 75% of sub-loans by participating
banks at 6% (guaranteed Amerindian sub-loans at 8%), ad-
justed t.o maintain the margin on the banks' own contribu-
tions (3.34);
(d) a form of agreement, acceptable to IDA, would be entered
into between the Bank of Guayana and participating banks
(3.34).
6.03      In addition to the customary conditions the following have been
agreed upon as conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit:
(a) at least 30,000 acres of coastal lands had been surveyed
for immediate lease as project ranches (3.06);
(b)  The Livestock Loans Act and legislation to permit Governmen.
guarantee of loans for Amerindian ranches had been passed;
(3.07 and 3.33);



- 21 -
(c) necessary exemptions from the Cooperative Societies Law (for
cooperative ranch rules) had been obtained (3.10);
(d) LDCo had been established and adopted Articles of Agreement
satisfactory to IDA and Government had secured confirmed
agreement from interested parties to subscribe to its equity
(3.13);
(e) a Livestock Advisory Committee had been set up by Ministerial
Decree (3.20);
(f) LDF and LPD had been established and an internationally
recruited Project Director, satisfactory to IDA, had been
appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (3.22);
(g) a Trusteeship Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between the
Government and the Bank of Guyana had been signed (3.35).
6.04      The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$2.2 million.






ANNEX 1

GUYANA
BEEF CATTLE PROJECT
Banking and Credit
A. General
The Banking System
1.    The banking system in Guyana, on the traditional British pattern,
comprises:
a) the central bank, the Bank of Guyana, whose essential
purpose is "to foster monetary stability and promote
credit and exchange conditions conducive to the growth
of the econony" (Bank of Guyana Ordinance 1965), and
b) the commercial banks, five of which are branches of
international banks with head offices overseas.   A
sixth bank, the Guyana National Co-operative Bank, was
established on February 2h, 1970, by Government as part
of its program to foster cooperativism in the "Cooperative
Republic of Guyana".
The Credit System
2.    The commercial banks are the most important institutional source
of short term credit.   At the end of December 1969, about 8% of their
lending was for agriculture, excluding processing.   Long term credit
is provided generally by the Guyana Credit Corporation, the life
insurance companies, and the New Building Society (savings and loan
society), and about 30% of commercial bank lending is for more than
a year (see para 15).   Most of this longer term lending is for real
estate investment, though the Guyana Development Corporation also
invests loan and equity capital in industry and commerce.   The
Guyana Marketing Corporation provides credit in kind to small
farmers, eg livestock feed for pig producers and fertilizers for
producers of some crops.
B. The Banks
3.    The Bank of Guyana is the sole bank of currency issue;  holds
gold and foreign currency reserves; is banker for Government and
other banks; and is primarily responsible for controlling credit
and foreign exchange activities.   It undertakes ancillary functions,
such as the management of the internal public debt, and provides statis-
ical and other services for the banks and Government.   Exchange control
is presently limited to non-sterling transactions.






Annex 1
-2-                          Page 2
4.    The 4-man Board of Directors, under the chairmanship of its Governor,
is the policy making organ of the Bank of Guyana.   The other members
are the Banking Manager (Deputy Governor) and two representatives nominated
by the Minister of Finance.   The Secretary to the Treasury attends Board
meetings, but without a vote.
5.    The commercial banks must maintain minimum balances with the central
bank.   These are 6% against demand liabilities and 4% against time
liabilities, the level at which they were fixed when introduced in March
1966.
6.    The banks must also maintain a prescribed level of liquid assets
fixed, since December 1966, at 20% of demand liabilities and 15% of time
liabilities (the central bank may change this level between 15% and 30%
for demand liabilities, 10% and 20% for time liabilities).   These liquid
assets comprise mainly deposits with the central bank, cash balances and
balances with banks abroad, foreign treasury bills, commercial bills
eligible for rediscount with the central bank and local treasury bills.
7.   Advances from the Bank of Guyana to Government are agreed from
time to time but, under the Bank of Guyana Ordinance, are subject to
a ceiling of 15% of the average annual ordinary revenues collected and
accounted for by the Government during its last three preceding
financial years, and to the constraint that such direct advances shall
not, during any financial year, be outstanding for a total of more than
350 days.
8.    Table 1 shows assets and liabilities of the Bank of Guyana at
December 31, 1969.
The Commercial Banks
9.    The Private Banks.   The 5 private commercial banks operate main
branches in Georgetown' the capital, and subsidiary branches in other
parts of the country:
Bank                          Branches including
main branch
Barclays (DCO)                            16
The Bank of Baroda                         2
The Royal Bank of Canada                  11*
Chase Manhattan                            1
The Bank of Nova Scotia                    1
*Including a mobile branch.
The oldest established in Guyana (more than 50 years) are Barclays (DCO)
and The Royal Bank of Canada.   The newest (1968) is the Bank of Nova Scotia.

10.   The Guyana National Cooperative Bank.   The Guyana National Coop-
erative Bank has no operational experience, as yet.   Its authorized
share capital is G$10 million (US$5 million).   Eligible shareholders
are Government, registered cooperative societies, registered trade
unions, registered friendly societies, public corporations established
under the Public Corporations Ordinance, 1962, and such other corporate
bodies as may be recommended by the Minister of Finance.
11.   The assets and liabilities of the branches of the private
commercial banks operating in Guyana are not published separately,
though they are reported confidentially to the Bank of Guyana.   The
total rose from G$115 million (US$58 million) at the end of 1968
to G$130 million (US$65 million) at end 1969, an increase of 13%.
The Commercial Banks as a Credit Source
12.   The return to stability in the country since 1964 has been
reflected in the increasing demand for money and this in turn has
resulted in pressure on the commercial banking system for loans.
13,  An analysis of lending between 1965 and 1969 is in Table 2.
The total doubled during the period.   The proportion of this total
lent for agriculture remained at about 8%; and of the amount lent
for agriculture, between 4% and 10% was for livestock.   In 1969,
loans to commerce and services were about 40% of the total, to manu-
facturing about 30% and for personal consumption (including direct
loans for housing) about 20%.
Commercial Bank Interest Rates
14.   Since July 26, 1966, when the Guyana bank rate rose to 6W6 from
6%, the prime lending rate (usually 1% above bank rate) has remained
at 73;;%. In general, rates of interest range from the prime rate
of 7V-  for traditiozmU1y good business customers, to over 10% for
some personal loans.   The average annual rate of interest for all
loans and advances was about 81g in 1969, compared with a little over
8% in 1968.
Loan Term
15.   Most loans by the commercial banks are for short term financing
of business enterprise.  At the end of 1969, "term" loans totaled
G$23.3 million, (about 30% of the value of all lending) of which
G$18.8 million were in the private sector, with 31% of these loans to
individuals.   Distributed by amount outstanding at the end of 1969,
50% of "term" loans were for less than 2 years; 43%, 2 to 7 years;
and the remaining 7%, over 7 years.   The weighted average term was
about 3 years.






Annex 1
4                           Page 4
16.   Long term lending in the agricultural sector is almost entirely
to large corporations that can offer substantial collateral security.
A recently passed Agricultural Loans Ordinance permits creditors to
take a lien on crops as part security for a loan, but the commercial
banks are uncertain of its validity and, so far, it has been rarely
used.
Default Rate
17.   Due to careful scrutiny of potential borrowers and very adequate
collateral security, commercial bank loan defaults are rare.   On the
other hand, lending tends to be cautious and a large potential demand
for development loans remains unfulfilled.   This caution is under-
standable against the background of poor repayment records of other
lending instttutiows in Uuyana, evon whan direct-collection from crop
procedds is attempted.
C. Other Lending Institutions
The Guyana Credit Corporation
18.   The Guyana Credit Corporation (established in 1954) is a Government
lending agency providing medium and long term loans for agricultural
improvement, industrial development, and housing; but it has tended to
concentrate heavily on housing, light industry, purchase of agricultural
machinery and equipment rather than on general farm improvement based
on well drawn and carefully supervised plans.   It has, nevertheless,
been the principal source of the small amount of long term agricultural
loan funds available to farmers other than the large corporations.
Like the commercial banks, the Credit Corporation also requires collateral
security, usually real estate, and small farmers lacking this kind of
security have found it difficult to borrow,   It has a poor repayment
history.
Insurance Companies and the New Building Society
19.   Insurance companies and the New Building Society lend long term
mostly for housing or other real estate.   During 1969 their rates of
interest averaged around 8% and maximum maturities were 15 to 20 years.
Loans are generally subject to a maximum of about 75% of the lenderts
valuation of the underlying security.
Other Sources of Credit
20.   Other institutional sources of credit are not at present veryr
important,   The Guyana Marketing Corporation provides credit in kind
to farmers with whom it contracts for purchase of farm produce.   Most
of the transactions were for pig production but other production has
recently been included, especially crops for which the Marketing
Corporation provides fertilizers.






Annex I
-                           Page 5
21.   Consumer credit, especially through hire-purchase, has helped many
farmers to mechanize their operations.   This credit is generally for
only 1 or 2 years and the effective interest rate (since repayments are
made monthly as a proportion of the original cash cost plus interest)
is a good deal higher than the nominal amount charged on the original
loan.
22.   Cooperative credit societies provide small loans to members at
12%.   The effective rate is somewhat lower, since borrowing members
are usually paid dividends out of cooperative net income(including
interest income).   Thrift and Credit Societies in the rice industry
have benefited from such short term loans.
Non-institutional Credit
23.  Many persons, including farmers, have recourse to moneylenders
'who provide small loans at very exorbitant rates of interest.   The
borrower is usually unaware of the real rate of interest, eg 4% or 5%
per month. He is usually either unable to convert this to an annual
rate or thinks of it only as a payment for short term accommodation.
The amount of such lending is not known, but it is likely to be sub-
stantial.
D. The Private Investment Fnd
24.   The Private Investment Fund (PIF) was established in 1966 with
a loan of US$2 million from USAID and G$3 million from Government.   The
Bank of Guyana is trustee and administrator but PIP loans are made
through the commercial banks who act as on-lenders and carry the credit
risk but do not provide any long term funds.   The Bank of Guyana decides
the interest rate to be applied to PIF loans, and the commercial banks
receive a margin of 3% for risk and administration.
25.   The commercial banks are responsible for finding applicants.   The
Guyana Development Corporation plays a role in appraising the individual
loan applications, in close cooperation with the banks, who are responsible
for final assessment of creditworthiness.   Once a loan is approved, the
banks disburse promptly to the ultimate borrower, all funds or credits
received from PIF.   They help borrowers with complementary working capitU.'
They pay the Bank of Guyana, as PIF Trustee, all amounts received from
borrowers (repayments and interest), less their approved 3% spread.   PIF
lending is confined to US or local procurement.

BEEF CATTLE PROJECT
The Guyana Beef Cattle Industry
INTRODUCTION
1.      The Guyana national herd is estimated at about 260,000, about
70% of which are in the coastal strip east of Georgetown and about 25%
in the Rupununi Savanna. A few thousand are in the Intermediate Savanna,
now only of minor importance, but with potential.
2.      Meat production from the coastal region and the Rupununi was
3,350 and 1,150 short tons, respectively, in 1968, and the per capita
consumption of meat fell from a peak of nearly 19 lb in 1966 to 16.3 in
1969. M4eat quality is poor and the 280 lb average carcass weight in
1969 reflected the large percentage of lightweight animals being
slaughtered from the coastal area. In the RIapununi, the offtake is mainly
steers over 5 years old, with a dressed carcass weight of 400 to 450 lb,
and cull cows of 300 to 350 lb.
COASTAL REGION
3.      MIost coastal cattle are owned by rice farmers and are generally
of local Creole/Zebu breed, well adapted to surviving under adverse con-
ditions. Average herd size is about 12 head per family. Less than 1,000
families own more than 25 head while only 200 own more than 50. These
rice farmers keep cattle as a supplementary source of income, selling them
off irrespective of age, sex, or as cash is needed. Farmers actually
prefer to sell young animals because of the danger of theft from their
free ranging herds (see para 5).
4.      Because they do not own enough land on which to depasture their
animals all the year, farmers must use communal grazing areas, usually
within 3 miles of their farms. These areas, however, have about 6 in to
2 ft of water over them for 3 to 8 months of the year. About 30% of the
area is above flood height but covered by forest and not used. These
communal grazing areas are badly overstocked and have degenerated
because no attempts are made to control either the numbers or movement
of animals; and the high quality swamp grasses have largerly disappeared
from them.
5.      The animals themselves receive very little attention although
the owner may visit his cattle about once in a week. Mating is uncontrolled
and breed improvement impossible; cow fertility is low because of
disease (mainly brucellosis) and poor nutrition. The 30% calf mortality
is due mainly to losses from drowning at birth.  No attempts are made to
control parasites or diseases and the percentage of calves weaned is a
mere 30%. Losses from stealing from these communal areas are also high.
Under these conditions, it is barely possible to maintain cattle numbers
and impossible to increase production.






ANN= 2

6.       While communal grazing areas could be extended by using large
areas of available State lands, it is doubtful that the problem would be
solved without also providing management and control. It is also highly
doubtful that many of thie local fa.mers would be willing to place their
animals in areas farther away from their farms than the existing communal
grazing areas.
7.       Making the necessary changes in management to increase meat pro-
duction would be difficult because of the ownership pattern. The necessary
basic changes are that (a) stocking rates be limited to ensure sufficient
pasture to sustain an economic breeding/fattening operation; and (b)
animals and land be managed to optimize weaning and extraction rates.
8.       This can best be achieved with herds large enough to carry the
cost of the skilled management needed. One successful commercial ranch
in the coastal region, Kabawer, exemplifies the value of sound management
and capital investment in fencing, sleeping mounds, forest clearing and
pasture establishment and better quality breeding stock. This 16,000 ac
ranch commenced its development less than 4 years ago with 3,000 cattle.
It now has 8,000 head of improved stock, is continuing to develop and
expand its herd and is on a sound profit-making basis.
The few rice farmers aware of the need for this type of manage-
ment have previously lacked the land, know-how, cattle and capital to
undertake such a venture. These farmers recognize also that, while there
may be some difficulty in persuading others to put their animals into
larger production units, first class management is the most important
requirement.
10.      One way to establish such units in Guyana would be on a co-
operative basis. Rules and by-laws would be designed to allow small owneis
to place all or some of their cattle on a cooperative ranch where they
could be managed as a single production unit without interference from
individual cooperative members in day-to-day management.  The cattle so
contributed would form the nucleus herd for a ranch development program.
Optimum size for such a ranch in the coastal area is between 5,000 and
10,000 ac, carrying between 2,500 and 5,000 animal units at full develop-
ment.  Ample State land is available for lease to interested cooperative
or company groups on 25-year terms, with option of renewal and right of
transfer. Enough rice farmer/cattle owmers have shown interest to ensur'e
the establishment of 15 ranch units of about 7,500 ac average each over a
3-year period. This involves the aggregation of about ho,000 head of
cattle.
11.      A key feature would be to ensure that sufficient high land
grazing is available during the wet season, particularly for animals about
to calve. All new ranches would have up to 30% of such land. On each,
about 750 ac of the forest that covers this high ground (10% of the total
area) would be cleared and sown to highly productive tropical legume/grass
pastures.






ANNEX 2
Page 3
12.     Cl)aring these areas cheaply and quickly, would require use of
techniques new to Guyana. The areas are well suited for chain clearing
but local management personnel and operators would have to be trained.
This could very likely be done in Venezuela where chain clearing is being
done successfully. The use of improved tropical legumes and grasses would
also be new to Guyana and it would be necessary to ensure that the best
species were selected and that correct management was applied.
RUPUNUNI SAVANNA
13.      The Rupununi Savanna covers about 25,o0o sq mi in southeast
Guyana (see Map) wthere cattle ranching is the main activity. Annual
rainfall is about 50 in, most of which falls between May and October.
Soils are infertile and are particularly low in phosphate, The pastures
are generally burned annually and therefore consist of a fire-resistant
low-quality grass with virtually no legumes. During the wet season, they
grow and mature rapidly and lose feeding value unless the growth is con-
trolled by grazing or cutting but this is not possible under the existing
extensive management conditiona. In the dry season, the pasture dies and
becomes very dry, its feeding value declines further and, from January to
March, it is so low in available energy and protein that it cannot meet
even maintenance requirements of grazing animals. The quality of the pas-
ture could be improved by stopping annual burning to allow the softer more
nutritious grasses to regenerate. The dry season feed quality problem
could also be alleviated by establishing improved pastures but this must
be dond economically. The most promising approach lies in using tropical
legumes which will "hay off" and retain feeding value in the dry season.
14.      Of the 55 to 60,000 head of Creole/Zebu cattle in the region,
about 30,000 are o-ned by the Rupununi Development Company and run on its
24,000 sq mi ranch. The remainder are owned by about 12 individual
ranchers (about 12,000 head), Amerindian villagers (about 11,000 head) and
the Government (about 3,000 head). Most of the latter were confiscated
from ranchers involved in the January 1969 rebellion. The privately
operated ranches are in the north. Average size is about 50,000 acres and
herds vary from a few hundred to over 2,000 head.
15.      Insecurity of land tenure has discouraged these ranchers from
investing in their properties and applying modern ranching technology.
All land in the Rupununi is State owned and leased on a year-to-year
basis, with no guarantee of renewal. Government policy now proposes,
howJever, that 25-year leases be granted, as for the proposed coastal
project ranches.
16.      Fencing is inadequate on all ranches and communal reserves and
the cattle are run on the open range, making control of grazing almost
impossible. Carrying capacity is estimated at about 10 animal units per
sq mi (1 AU/64 ac), weaning is about t0%, adult mortality is about 7%
per annum, and steers are marketed at 4 to 5 years old at an average cold
carcass weight of 400 lb or at 5 to 6 years old for a slightly higher
carcass weight. The cull cows are slaughtered at 250 to 300 lb carcass
weight.  The annual extraction rate is about 10;.






AMThEX 2

17.       Most of the region's cattle areslaughtered at a central abattoir
at Lethem, with an annual throughput of about 6,000 head. The beef is air-
freighted to the Georgetown market at a cost of 90 (G)/lb.  A subsidy of
5e/lb is paid by the Government market and the producer receives about 43 to
45h (G)/lb cold dressed weight. Almost all slaughtering and marketing from
the area is done by Meat Marketing Ltd (Annex 3).
18.       Many consumer goods and essential on-ranch investment items (fencing
wire, troughing, tools and equipment) required to develop the area must be
air-freighted from Georgetown, which increases their cost. This, plus the
cost of air-freighting meat from the region would place the Rupununi at a dis-
advantage compared to the coastal areas if it were not for the lower production
costs in the Rupununi - G$3/head compared to G$11/head on the coast.
19.       Since shipment of boned-out meat is perhaps the best way of immedi-
ately reducing transport costs, the Government should be encouraged to provide
facilities at Lethem. A small treatment plant to process bones could then be
established and the bone produced flour could be fed to range cattle to provide
badly needed supplementary phosphate. The potential bone flour production would
meet about 35% of estimated requirements.
20.       There is one Veterinary Officer on short term appointment from
Georgetown in the area. He is responsible mainly for supervision of the
Lethem abattoir and regional foot and mouth disease (FMD) control programs.
FMD is not endemic but occurs sporadically (there have been two outbreaks in
the last 9 years). An outbreak generally has serious repercussions since the
entire area is placed under quarantine to prevent the disease spreading to the
coast. Shipment of meat is stopped and not allowed to resume until all ani-
mals in the area have been vaccinatedtwice at 4-month intervals, and no out-
break has occurred for 3 months.
21.       The fact that beef production can be increased considerably has been
demonstrated in some of the better areas where carrying capacity has gone from
10 to 40 head/sq mi by using fencing to control grazing. Also, large tracts
in the Rupununi appear to be suitable for the tropical legume Townsville st3lo,
This legume can be sown from the air with no seed bed preparation. In similar
areas in Australia, it has increased animal production per ac 3 to 5 times.
Townsville stylo is native to tropical South America and is found in those
areas in the Rupununi that have been protected from annual burning.
INTERMEDIATE SAVANNA
22.       This area covers 3,800 sq mi south of the coastal alluviums, 30 to
40 miles from the sea. Annual rainfall is 70 to 80 in during two wet seasons,
December through January and May through July. The solls are infertile and
consist of white and brown sands. They are freely drained and pasture growth
is often seriously retarded during the dry seasons. The mature pastures are
poor and cattle cannot be kept in good condition without management and min-
eral supplements.






AfNTEX 2
Page 5
23.       The only cattle in the area are located at the Ebini research
station (about 2,500 head) and at an adjacent private ranch (500 head). The
Ebini station was founded in 19L12 to determine whether beef could be produced
in the area. W4ork has been concentrated on the establishment and management
of sown pasture grass (mainly pangola) and study of a wide range of beef
breeds. Although high levels of production have been obtained, results are
of little practical value because of the large amounts and high cost of the
fertilizer (mainly nitrogen) needed to maintain this type of pasture.
24.       The area could probably be developed to produce beef economically
as has been shown in similar areas in N. Queensland. Studies on the native
pastures should be expanded and include (a) supplementary mineral and protein
feeding, with molasses as a carrier; (b) tropical legume establishment and
management and; (c)  economic use of phosphate fertilizer, particularly wzith
tropical legumes. This requires additional financing, particularly for stock
handling facilities, scales, fencing, pasture seeds, fertilizer and overseas
training of local technicians.
NORTH¶EST ZONE
25.       Only a few head of cattle are now in the Northwest but there is
potential for establishing productive ranching in the extensive tracts of
virgin forest. Excellent legume/grass pastures can undoubtedly be grown in
the deep rich soils.  First, however, information is needed on land clearing
methods and costs, and the pastures best adapted to the region. The Govern-
ment of Guyana has asked for finance to help study these problems.

Consumption
1.        Despite annual population growth of 3% from 1965 to 1969, Guyana's
beef demand increased at a yearly rate of only 1.3%. World demand, on
the other hand, is estimated to have increased 6% annually from 1965 to
1967.1/ Guyana per capita consumption fell from ncaioy 19 lb in.x L46 to 16.3 lb
in 1969.  This was due partly to the availability oI beef substitutes
(particularly poultry), partly to the rising beef price.
2.        In 1965, Guyana's local beef supply was about 9.2 million lb
from 29,000 cattle averaging 314 lb carcass weight. In 1969, the local
supply was 10.3 million lb from 36,000 cattle averaging 287 lb. The lower
average weight was due to lighter, immature, cattle being slaughtered.
3.        About 70% of Guyana's domestic beef supply comes from the coast,
.25% from Rupununi (see Map). Imports of fresh, pickled, smoked and canned
beef, mainly from Argentina and Australia, have declined from about 2.3
million lb in 1965 to 1.2 million lb in 1969, or from 20% to 10% of total
beef consumption, as domestic production has risen (see Table). Local
production is expected to decline temporarily, during the next few years,
and Government plans to increase imports to keep overall supply more or
less in line with demand at current prices.
Commercialization
4.        Cattle from the coastal areas are bought on-farm or in village
centers by cattle dealers, bargaining individually with owners and esti-
mating weights visually. There is no system of auction. The average farm-
gate price for 1969 was G$0.50/lb (US$0.25); this had risen temporarily
in February 1970 because of the Rupununi ban (see para 7) to G$0.56/lb
(US$0.28). Purchased cattle can be moved by boat, truck or train, or can
walk, to Georgetown and New Amsterdam for slaughter. Costs vary between
G$0.06 and 0.23 per head per mile according to distance and quantity.
5.        Cattle are slaughtered in Georgetown municipal abattoirs under
moderately hygienic conditions. Countryside and village slaughter facili-
ties, however, are poor. There are four abattoirs in Georgetown and its
suburbs and one each at New Amsterdam, McKenzie and Bartica. They are
operated on two or three days a week, well below capacity. None has

facilities for the recovery and procossing of blood, bone or other by-
products. The Georgetown municipal abattoir has cold storage which is
not used; therm is ample private cold storage in Georgetown, owned by
four companies, Weting and Richer Co., Guyana Market Co., Williams and
Son Co. and Frederiks Ltds.   Total capacity is 260,000 lb.
6.         Beef is retailed in supermarkets, municipal markets, and small
shops.   Eight supertnarkots are estimated to absorb around 1.5 million
lb beef per year; 1 million lb are sold through Goergetown municipal
markets and smal shops, and 6 million retailed in the rest of the country,
Supermarkets are, therefore, still a rinor category although demand for
improved quality and prewrapped cuts is increasing.   Stew beef has by
far the greatest sales volume,
7.        Rupununi supplied 2.7 million lb beef in 1969, or about 40%
of the Georgetown demand.   In November 1969, however, this supply was
temporatily cut off by a ban on Rupununi movements, due to an outbreak
of foot and mouth disease.   Rupununi ranchers sell their beef through
Meat Marketing Ltd. a company owned by cattle producers (see para 8).
Theynotify the company the number of cattle they have for sale the follow-
ing month and these are usually delivered at the due time.  There is
no penalty for late delivery, but an explanation is required.  Rupununi
cattle are slaughtored at the Government owned Lethem abattoir and the
carcasses airfreighted the same day to Georgetawn, where they are inspected
and distributed.  The rancher receives his proceeds 10 days after
delivery.   In 1969, FML paid G$0,43 (US$0.22) per lb to Rupununi ranchers,
G$0.07 less than the price paid to coastal ranchers.  MML paid G$0.04
for slaughtering, handling and inspecting and G$0.05 per lb for air
freight.
Meat Marketing Ltd (MUL)
8.         MML is a joint stock company limited to 50 members and registered'
under the Companies Ordinance in l956.  There are currently 22 members
and, of the issued share capital of 536 G$100 shares, Rupununi Development
Co Ltd owns 250, Kabawa ranch 80, and Government the minimum of 5 shares,
On a capital of G$60,000 MML is currently turning over G$l million annually
and operating on a gross margin of 4.5%.
9.        NML has consistently paid above average prices to producers,
making a large initial payment and a half-yearly patronage bonus based
on deliveries.   It has declared regular dividends of 10% to 12%, after
taxes, (18% to 22% grossed up at the standard rate)o   MM would be a
suitable chaniel for marketing project output, at least for the initial
stages, preferably if other producers could be admitted as ehareholders
in proportion to their output,
Prices
10.        If the-proposed project is implemented, local supply may equal
demand in about 4-5 years.   It should then be possible to consider expcrtding
surpluses (Table 1),   By that time also Guyana shouild aim to have slaughter-
ing and cold storage facilities adequate to meet the standards required by

CARIFTA countries, notably Trinidad, Barbados and Grenada, the principal
potential market for Guyana beef exports.l/
11.       Each year from 1960 to 1969, local beef retail prices increased
3.6%, the urban food price index increased 2.6%, and the national urban
price index increased 2.8%. The indication is that beef prices are
increasing faster than food prices by 1% and faster than the national
urban index by 0.8% more or less following world beef price trends. This
suggests that the use of current Guyanese beef prices in project estimates
would be conservative; on the other hand expected production increases
should restrain price rises after 1975. Average 1969 retail price in Guyana
was G$0.67 (US$0.38) per lb as compared with uS$o.56 per lb in Central
America for beef of probably higher average quality. Farmgate prices
follow retail price trends (Table 1). Project estimates are based on
1969 farmgate prices; G$0.50 for the coast and G$0.43 for Rupununi.

BEEF CATTIE PROJECT
Types of Enterprise and Cooperative Group Ranches
A. General
1.     Guyana law relating to legal personality and control over business
organizations and enterprises derives generally from British law.
Partnerships
2.     As in Britain, a partnership is the relationship that subsists between
persons carrying on a business with a view to profit.   This definition thus
embraces all persons who are engaged in a business venture that has no other
separate legal identity.   The law relating to partnerships is codified in
the Partnerships Ordinance (Cap 325).   Partnerships may not exceed 20 persons
and the code and its related case law are specific as to the rights and
liabilities of members.   In general, partners are jointly and severally
liable for the total debts of the partnership.   There is no provision in
Guyana law for partnerships with limited liability.
Companies
3.     A limited liability company is a corporate body, for the debts of which
the members are responsible only to the extent of their shareholding or of
the guarantee they have given.  Guyana companies are formed under the Companies
Ordinance, which closely follows the British Companies Act of 1908.  A company
may be either public, with a minimum membership of seven, or private, with
a minimum of two members and a maximum of twenty.  Private coi'mpanios need not make
certain statutory returns that apply to         companies and need not publish
accounts.   All companies must be registered and each is subject to the Con-
pani.es Ordinance and its own Memorandum and Articles of Association.
Cooperatives
4.    A cooperative is a society that has as its object the promotion of the
economic interests of its members in accordance with cooperative principals
and that is formed in Guyana under the Cooperative Societies Ordinance (Cap 326)
1948.   The main differences between a cooperative society and a company are:
(a)   societies are registered with the Registrar of Cooperative
Societies and submit their accounts to him;
(b)   a society may require and bind its members to deal exclusively
through it;






ANNEX h
Page 2
(c) no member has more than one vote or rmay hold more than one-
fifth of the share capital;
(d)  the payment of dividends, though not necessarily the distri-
bution of cash surplus, is limited; and
(e)   societies may be (and are) exempted from the payment of income
tax.
A cooperative may be registered with or without linited liability, although
in the former case, it may, through its rules, extend the liability of its
members beyond the amount of their shareholding.
Statutory Boards
5.     A statutory board or corporation may be formed as a corporate business
enterprise in Guyana, e.g., the Guyana Marketing Corporation.   Each needs
special legislation.   They are generally set up to satisfy needs that,
because of the risks or capital involved, cannot be fulfilled by the normal
form of business enterprise, and they are subject only to the provisions
contained in the legislation that incorporates them.
B. Cooperative Group Ranches
6.     The usual form of primary agricultural cooperative society in Guyana
is a vil1age or community group, formed to obtain credit for goods and services
or to lease a block of land that is then sublet to members.   The Cooperative
Ordinance and Regulations, and the standard form of cooperative rules are
tailored to this form of enterprise.   In these societies, business trans-
actions are usually straightfonrard and they are managed by the elected
officers and committee.   Where cooperatives are few, and simple in operation,
the Government cooperative staff have been able to cope with extension work.
However, owing to the increase in the number of cooperative enterprises, which
is a stated aim of the new Cooperative Republic of Guyana, field workers are
now over-extended and a backlog of audit and supervision work is building up.
For example, in the Upper Corantyne District, where a number of the proposed
livestock cooperatives are to be located, a Cooperative Officer who has no
staff and who is untrained in even simple bookkeeping methods is responsible
for the supervision of 82 registered cooperative societies of all types;
he is unable to offer the type of assistance and supervision provided for
in the Cooperative Ordinance.
7.     The object of the proposed group ranches is to assemble privately-
owned cattle into ranch units and to run them as a commercial herd under
competent management, supervised by project staff (Livestock Project Division
of Bank of Guyana).   Group ranches must be recognizable commercial entities
and may be partnerships, companies or cooperatives.   Neither the traditional
form of the cooperative rules nor the current Guyana legislation is entirely
suitable for cooperative group ranches and only limited assistance can be






ANNEX 4
Page 3
expected from the Cooperative Department in their formation and supervision.
Furthermore, farmers have seen a number of agricultural cooperatives fail,
mainly because of inadequate management, and they are wary of pooling their
cattle in an untried and unproven venture.
8.      The problems that cooperatives pose for the project are thus both
managerial and social and in order to cope with them the project must provide
its own cooperative advisory service. This would be distinct from,
but complementary to, project technical assistance and supervision.
9.      A deputy project director (administrative) (DPDA) with wide
cooperative experience would be employed on the project staff to help
cattle owners form their group ranches and to supervise their business
activities, which are defined as all matters such as financing, audit
and marketing not directly related to animal production. Ranch
managers would not handle these administrative matters but would
concentrate on technical production, supported by the economic and
financial data the (DPDA) would help to provide. The rules of the
group ranch cooperatives and service contracts should provide that:
(a) ranch managers are not to be employed as cooperative society
secretary/managers;
(b) arrangements are made for ranch operating expenses to be
run on an imprest account controlled by the ranch manager,
who would have responsibility for drawing up the operating
budget, all recurrent expenditure, keeping of ranch
records and accounts and employment of staff; and
(c)  all other financial matters, such as the purchase of capital
items (as agreed upon in preparation of farm plans),
and marketing should remain the responsibility of each
cooperative's management committee, assisted by the DPDA
10.     To give the farmers incentive to join a cooperative and in order to
bind them to it once they have joined, the rules should also provide that:
(a) cattle that members transfer to the cooperative should be
evaluated in the manner prescribed in the rules, and shares of
equivalent value issued for them;
(b) such shares wiould be transferable but not withdrawable for at
least 3 years; and
(c) operating surpluses may be distributed as a patronage bonus.
11.     These arrangements may be made under the Cooperative Ordinance
although existing livestock cooperatives wishing to participate may
need to change their rules. The bonus distribution referred to would
require official interpretation under the Ordinance by the Chief
Cooperative Officer, and rules to meet the above requirements would
need Cabinet approval for certain exemptions, as provided under the
Ordinance.

12.    IDA would need to be satisfied that audit and supervision
arrangements were acceptable.   It would also require that rules for
the cooperative ranches were acceptable and that any future changes
in cooperative law would not affect their commercial viability.

GUYANA                            ANNEX 22
Page 1
BEEF CATTLE PROJECT
Rate of Return to the Economy
Rate of Return to the Economy
1.   The estimated rate of return of the Project to the economy of Guyana
is 20% as calculated from the attached table.   The following paragraphs
explain the rationale by which the component values were determined.
Incremental Net Income
2.   Incremental net income is taken from the models projected in Annexes
8, 12 and 16 multiplied by the number of units of model size expected to
enter the Project in each of the first three years.   Annual net income
without development is deducted from annual net income with development,
to arrive at incremental net income attributable to the Project.   Since
expenses are higher with the Project than without, and income is slow to
build up, the increment is negative for the first few years.
Shadow Wage Rate
3.   There is 20% unemployment and underemployment in agriculture, and the
current official wage rates overstate the cost of labor to the Guyana
economy.   However, if this wage cost in ranch expenses is reduced by 25%
(G$3 per day instead of G$4) the effect on the rate of return would be
less than one percent.
Adjustment for Transport
4.   Air freighted beef from Rupununi is subsidized at a rate of G$0.05
per pound.   The cost to the economy is therefore increased by the annual
weight transported multiplied by G$0.05.
Investment
5.   On-ranch investment cost is taken from the models in Annexes 5 and
9, multiplied by the number of units of model size, as in para 2 above.
Adjustment for Taxes
6.   Since import duties and taxes are transfer payments and not true
costs to the economy, the amounts paid by the farmer and included in the
farm financial projections are added back.






ANNEX 22
Page 2
Technical Services
7.  Technical services include training and staffing for post-project
phases of beef cattle production and not all the cost of these services
should be charged against the economic cost of the project.   The cost
of the project director, plus approximately half the cost of supporting
staff, is included during the first three years, and this is gradually
reduced as the need for on-farm appraisal and supervision declines and
staff is transferred to other duties.
Discount Period
8.  Ranches are considered to have an economic life of 20 years, the assumed
life of buildings and installations which form a significant part of project
cost, and the net balances are discounted over that period.   If they are
discounted over 15 years or 12 years, the effect would be negligible (less
than one percentage point, after rounding).
