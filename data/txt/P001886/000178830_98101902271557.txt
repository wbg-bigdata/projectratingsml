INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MAURITIUS
FOR A REVISED PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to lauritius for the equivalent of US$3.6 million on standard Third
Window terms of 25 years including 7 years of grace,with interest at 4.7
percent per annum to help finance a revised port project for which a US$10.0
million loan was made in 1974 (Loan No. 976-MAS). The proceeds of the loan
would be onlent to the Mauritius Marine Authority for 20 years, including 5
years of grace, at an interest rate of 9 percent per annum. The project is
being cofinancd by the UNDP and the United Kingdom.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (268-MAS)
was circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. A basic economic
mission visited Mauritius in April 1976, and its report is being prepared.
Lhe following reflects the findings of the mission. Country data are provided
in Annex I.
3.        Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop: sugar. Throughout the 1950's and 1960's the population growth
rate averaged 2.8 percent annually, while the economy stagnated. A program to
limit the population growth rate was begun in the early 1960's as a result of
which the population growth declined to only 1.2 percent a year bv the mid-
1970's. Since independence, in 1968, the Covernment has successfulLy promoted
the establishment of export industries    and the development of tourism.   ThLs,
combined with the impact throughout the economy of a boorino su --r industrN has
enabled employment to be rapidly expanded.
4.        The First Plan for Social and Economic Development covered the four
years up to 1974/75. During this period, output of all sectors increased,
and real GDP grew at an average real rate of 8 percent from 1970 to 1974, when
it reached USS536 million. In 1975, GDP fell as 35 percent of the sugar crop
was lost through cyclone damage, but in 1976 growth has resumed owing to a
more normal sugar crop. GNP per capita stood at US$580 in 1975. The terms
of trade rose from 100 in 1970 to 175 in 1974, and advanced further to 206 in
1975 largely due to the sharp rise in the price of sugar. These unprecedented
improvements generated considerable increases in domestic income, the growth
rate of which increased from 5 percent in 1971 to 35 percent in 1974, and
averaged 15 percent through the four years.    The high level of demand stimu-
lated rapid growth in the sectors producing for the domestic market, such as
manufacturing, construction and the service industries. nowever, it also
caused a rapid rise in imports and in domestic prices.

5.         The rapid increase in real domestic income, combined with a higher
proportion of profits in the total, led to substantially increased savings
and investment rates in recent years. Saving- rose from 13 percent of gross
domestic income in 1970 to 24 percent in 1975 (at constant 1970 prices).
Over the same period the investment rate rose from 12 percent to 22 percent,
withi private investment increasing more stcq-ly than government investment.
Most of the increased savings accrued in trite private sector, and financed
reequipment and renovation in the sugar industry, hotel and factory construc-
tion, and private residences. In 1974 and 1975, Government mobilized consid-
erable private savings to finance its investment, largely by means of bond
issues totalling over US$75 million.
6.        The main objective of the First Plan was the creation of new jobs.
In 1970 there were over 50,000 unemployed in Mauritius, and the labor force
was increasing by almost 7,500 annually. The target was the creation of
13,000 new jobs annually as a step towards full employment by 1980. Recorded
employment in larger establishments rose by an annual average of 7,800 from
1970 to 1975. There is evidence that unrecorded employment also grew fast and
that the plan target was virtually achieved. The unemployment rate fell from
over 20 to 10 percent of the labor force between 1970 and 1975. Part of the
credit for the lower unemployment rate rests with Government for attracting
foreign investors by means of fiscal and other incentives and organizing a
labor intensive program of public works. The latter alone provided about
10,000 new jobs. The rapid expansion of the economy resulting from high sugar
prices and the strong growth of private investment indirectlv created a large
number of new jobs in construction and the service sectors.
7.         Despite the success in expanding employment, Mauritius still has
some unemployment that is proving hard to eliminate. Almost all the new jobs
created during the last five years are located in the urban strip running from
Port Louis to Curepipe, which, despite the small size of the country, is not
readily accessible from several of the high unemployment areas.      Furthermore,
about 85 percent of the jobs created in the manufacturing sector are for young
women working in garment manufacture and light assembly work. The result has
been localized shortages of specific categories of labor while a substantial
number of people remained without jobs, many of them young men with some
secondary education.
8.         Deficiencies in education and training are a major constraint to
development. Schools do not provide proper training for the jobs available.
Shortages of trained workers have already slowed down the expansion of the
construction industry, and employers in industry and tourism have difficulty
in finding qualified workers. In order to raise the productivity in those
activities, and to attract new industries to Mauritius, it will be necessarv
to adopt a more systematic approach to practical training.
9.         >lauritius also faces physical and organizational constraints to its
continuing rapid development. Water and electricity supply will need to be
nprInded substantially to meet industrii! , iariculttUraL and domestic needs.



Closer planning of land use is necessary to take advantage of existing infra-
structure. Public transport and traffic management are in need of improvement
in the urban areas. The expansion of certain export industries is hampered by
the inadequacy of existing port facilities. Construction and public works are
likelv to be constrained by the capacity of the contracting industry.      To some
extent these constraints developed because of the high growth in the past five
years which considerably exceeded expectations. The second Five-Year Plan
(1975-80), published in May, 1976, broadly recognizes the constraints noted
above.   It proposes a public investment program amounting to US$57-     million
with priority being given to the diversification of agricultural production
and to power and water development. Full employment by 1980 remains the key
objective to be achieved mainly by the continued expansion of manufacturing.
10.       Over the past five years, the distribution of income has become
more uneven as a result of changed relative prices and wages. Increases in
sugar export prices caused the share of sugar in GDP (at current factor cost)
to rise from 27 percent in 1970 to over 50 percent in 1975, and the real
earnings of every economic group connected with sugar rose substantially.
This percolated into most organized sectors such as government, manufacturing,
the hotel industry and transport, but many unorganized and informal sectors
and those groups with limited economic bargaining power may not have raised
their real incomes at all. The share of wages in GDP dropped markedly from
1970 to 1974, but rose in 1975.
11.       A number of government policies were devised in response to the
deterioration in income distribution, but were unable to offset it entirely.
The National Remuneration Board, which was established in 1973 to review wage
claims and present recommendations to the Ministry of Labor, was largely re-
sponsible for the rise in real wages of organized workers in 1975. Govern-
ment spent 16 percent of its recurrent budget from 1973/74 to 1975/76 on
subsidies for rice, flour and potato consumption, and also increased various
welfare payments. Price controls on 33 major items of consumption were in-
troduced to reduce consumer price increases. These measures had some short-
run impact in improving the real income of poorer groups, especially as the
bulk of direct taxes is paid by a limited and wealthy group of the population.
12.       The wage increases for civil servants, and higher payments for sub-
sidies and imported goods had a substantial impact on government current ex-
penditure, which rose from US$46 million in 1970/71 to US$126 million in
1974/75. To finance this increase, several fiscal measures were taken, in-
cluding a 25 percent increase in import duties, a 10 percent surcharge on in-
come taxes, and a number of changes in the graduated sugar export tax, which
raised the top rate from 6 to 10 percent of value. As a result, revenue rose
from US$47 million in 1970/71 to US$127 million in 1974/75.     Unfortunately
there were almost no budgetarv savings over this five year period, even
though the rapid increase in income and demand arising from high sugar
prices presented   a unique nppnrtuntitv for using o  --    re t::s
to finance develooment.



- 4 -
13.       The Government's concern at the high level of demand was reflected
L.i a number of monetary measures. A ceiling to credit growth of 15 percent
*'1nnii.: LI: was imposed over the past three years, the priviLege of rediscounting
_r bills was withheld, and the cash reserve requirement of commercial
-ananKs was raised fron 5 percent in 1972 to 12 percent in 1974.   As a result
of tes, corb L:,e. ractors, price infLation was brought down from 29 percent
: '97- to 15 percent in 1975.
l.        Ihe high price for sugar exports led to a considerable surplus
in the current account of the balance of payments in 1974, despite a 72 per-
cent increase in imports. Exports of goods and nonfactor services were
US$372 million, while imports were USS333 million. In 1975, cyclone damage
reduced export earnings to US$344 million, but insurance compensation of
USS28 million from overseas was also received. Imports rose to US$342 mil-
lion, though their increase was much tempered by the effect of demand manage-
ment policies. In 1974 and 1975 there were net capital inflows (including
transfers) of USS27 million and US$31 million, respectively, which permitted
a substantial buildup of international reserves. At the end of 1975 these
stood at US$166 million, equivalent to about 5 months' imports.
15.       Sugar export prices have risen consistently in real terms since
1970, but as of June 1976, when the special EEC Sugar Agreement for 1975/76
came to an end, a major drop in the real price occurred. In 1975/76 MAauritius
realized US$575 per ton for its sugar exports, whereas for 1976/77 the price
is likely to be around US$320 per ton, with no real change forecast by the
Bank in the years to come. Even with the expected decline in sugar export
prices in 1976/77, the terms of trade in 1980 should still be 15 percent
more favorable than in 1970, though the resource balance can be expected to
become negative in the late 1970's and capital inflows would have to increase
to about US$60 - 70 million annually.
16.       At the end of 1975 external public debt outstanding and disbursed
was USS43 million, of which US$8.0 million each to IBRD and IDA, while undis-
bursed debt amounted to a further US$82 million. Total service payments
during 1975 were US$3.7 million, of which US$0.6 million to IBRD and less
than US$0.1 million to IDA. The ratio of debt service to exports was 1.1
percent in 1975. However, in view of the large amount of undisbursed debt
and prospective capital requirements in the coming years, the debt service
ratio is expected to rise to about 9 percent in 1985 and 12 percent by 1990.
17.       'tauritius is considered eligible for Bank lending on Third W4indow
terms on the basis of the following criteria:
a.   Per Capita Income
In 1972 Mauritius' GNP per capita was US$300.
b.   Performance
Mtauritius attained an average rate o' ,-rot   o' PF      - percent
per annumn fron 1970 to 1974.  The Governnenit s pLins -re focu.ised oni em-lo)vmvi
creation and a serious effort is being miade L) improve ineione distribtLt Ha.



-5-
C.   Creditworthiness
In view of the growth of exports achieved in recent years, the
relatively favorable prospects for sugar in the future, and the present
low debt service ratio, Mauritius is creditworthy for Bank lending. However,
given the high proportion of exports in GDP and the heavy dependence on a
single export crop subject to an unstable international market, the Mauritius
economy is vulnerable to external factors beyond its control. For this reason
it is desirable to limit as far as possible Mauritius' external debt service
by the provision of concessionary finance.
d.   Access to Alternative Sources of Finance
Mauritius will face growing financing needs over the Second Plan
period, and although it has several other sources of assistance available, the
overall needs can only be met if it receives continuing and significant
support from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       To date Mauritius has received five IDA credits and five Bank
loans totalling US$53.2 million to help finance projects in industry (US$20
million), infrastructure (US$17 million), agriculture (US$9.2 million) and
education (US$7 million). IFC has made a loan in 1971 for hotel construction
and is presently considering a second project in the same sector. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Mauritius as of
September 30, 1976, as well as notes on the status of execution of ongoing
projects. Implementation of the industrial and infrastructural projects is
generally satisfactory. The education and agriculture projects faced man-
agement problems last year but these have now been brought under control.
The first Bank Group financial assistance to Mauritius for port develop-
ment was a US$10.0 million loan (Loan No. 976-MAS) made in 1974. The
status of implementation of this project is discussed in detail in Part IV
below.
19.       The program for Bank Group lending to Mauritius supports the
Government's strategy in promoting economic diversification and creating
emplovment outside the sugar industry. We intend to continue assisting
Mauritius in the development of the industrial and manufacturing sector
bv financing further industrial estate and development bank projects. A
small-scale industry and agricultural credit project, which would provide
financial and technical assistance to rural artisans, farmers and entre-
preneurs, was recently identified and is expected to form part of the next
development bank project presently under consideration. Projects in education,
power and water supply are also being prepared by the Government to improve
and expand infrastructural and institutional capabilities in support of its
diversification effort.

PART III - THE TRANISPORT SECTOR AND PORT OF PORT LOUIS
20.       Since 1966 when an uneconomic 62-mile railway system was phased
out of operation, transportation within I4auritius has been provided entirely
by an 870-mile road network, about two thirds of which is paved. The network
gives Mauritius a total road density of 1.2 miles/sq. miles. The city of
Port Louis and its surrounding area have been growing rapidly and serious
traffic congestion started developing on the main roads in the early 1970's.
To relieve the situation, a 10-mile expressway connecting Port Louis and
Phoenix to the south was completed in 1974, and several others are under
consideration. These include a 4-mile expressway between Port Louis and
Terre Rouge in the north, an expressway interconnecting the southern and
northern expressways via a partially elevated highway through the capital
and, eventually, an extension of the northern expressway to a new airport
to be built in the northeast.
21.       The international airport at Plaisance on the southeastern tip
of the island is the only airport serving Mauritius. Aircraft movements
at the airport have increased substantially over the past decade, reflect-
ing both increased tourism and the island's strategic location as a refuel-
ing stop on the Africa - Australia route. Twelve international carriers
offer 25 scheduled flights to Mauritius weekly. Light aircraft fly twice
weekly to the island of Rodrigues.
22.       Flight operations into and out of Plaisance International Airport
are difficult because the airport is located between mountains and the sea.
During the past three years, navigational aid improvements were introduced
at the airport to accommodate modern jet aircraft operations. Nevertheless,
flight operations at the airport remain hazardous in adverse weather condi-
tions and at night. As the current rate of growth of air passenger traffic
is expected to be maintained, the Government is considering the construction
of a new airport in the northeastern part of the island. Air cargo, consist-
ing primarily of high value goods, is projected to remain a very small propor-
tion of Mauritius' total import-export traffic.
23.       All surface imports and exports are shipped through Port Louis, the
country's only commercial deep-water port. The island has another deep-water
bay at Grand Port in the southeast but, because of its exposure to the south-
east tradewinds and storms, it is not utilized as a harbor. Port Louis has an
excellent natural harbor and is well protected from prevailing storms by the
surrounding mountains. In 1975, Port Louis handled a total of 1.67 million
tons of cargo, comprising 500,000 tons of sugar, 507,000 tons of general and
bagged cargo, and 611,000 tons of bulk cargo (petroleum products, cement and
edible oils).
24.       The existing transport modes complement rather than compete with one
another and transport coordination is therefore not a major issue. Transport
sector planning is the responsibility of the Economic Planning Unit of the
Ministry of Economic Planning and Developnent. Under the 1971/72-1974/75



- 7 -
Development Plan, only 40 percent of the US$30 million allocated for the
transport sector was spent. The shortfall was largely due to the deferment
of the new international airport and slow progress in the preparation of road
projects. The Second Plan, covering the period 1975/76-1979/80 has targeted
about US$100 million for the transport sector. This is probably too ambitious
but it does reflect the Government's determination to meet the needs of this
sector.
25.       Port Facilities.   The port of Port Louis is predominantly for ligh-
terage, with 15 mooring buoys for vessels from 20 to 30 foot draft. Ocean-
going general cargo is handled at three public lighterage quays having a
total length of 1,500 feet, and a fourth serves inter-island traffic. Sugar,
the port's largest export commodity, is taken by lighter directly from the
quays adjacent to the warehouses to the vessels at anchor, where the bags
are emptied into the hatches. Bagged imported cargo, such as rice, flour
and pulses, is taken by lighter to a Government-owned granary. There are
two deep-water alongside quays, used mainly for liquid and dry bulk cargo.
Petroleum products are unloaded via a submarine pipeline, and bulk cement
is pumped into silos. The Government recently decided to start implementa-
tion of a bulk sugar transport and storage project, which had been under
consideration for several years. The project, which includes storage and
ship loading installations in Port Louis, could be suitable for future Bank
Group financing.
26.       Port Operations.   Lighterage and cargo handling operations, ex-
cluding liquid bulk and cement, are labor intensive. The total labor force
employed is about 3,500 divided into two main groups: stevedores working
on the vessels, and dock labor working on the lighters, quays and in the
warehouses.
27.       Travel between ship and shore for meal stoppages reduce the actual
daily working hours to about nine on weekdays and five on Saturday (including
one or two hours of overtime per day). The average tonnage handled per
general cargo vessel is at present 1,200 tons discharged and 200 tons loaded.
Gang output is a reasonable 10 tons per hour; the average ship service time is
high at about 110 hours and is increasing. Night work is infrequent for
bagged cargo and rare for general cargo since lighterage after dark increases
the already considerable pilferage and damage due to double-handling, and poor
and uncoordinated supervision at quays and in the transit shed. The project
will eliminate this problem by providing alongside berths which will facili-
tate safe and efficient cargo handling at night and provide an opportunity to
introduce multi-shift working arrangements. Sufficient labor, however, will
not be available for permanent employment until the labor force presently
engaged in handling bagged sugar is released after the start of operations of
the planned bulk sugar terminal. Multi-shift working will be introduced at
that time (Section 3.01 of the draft Project Agreement).
28.       Port Administration.   When Loan No. 976-MAS was approved in 1974,
responsibility for port operations was divided among several government
agencies. The lack of overall coordination and control led to serious oper-
ating difficulties and materially reduced port efficiency. Cargo pilferage
and damage were high and storage space inadequately utilized. In order to



- 8 -
overcome these inadequacies, the Government agreed, under the first loan,
to establish a Mauritius Marine Authoritv (MMA) which would be responsible
for all aspects of port administration, operations and finance. Enactment
of the enabling legislation (Act No. 30 of 1975) required more time than was
aniticipated. The Authority's Board and Board Chairman were appointed in July
1976 and staff recruitment is underwav, but the Authority is not yet operational.
The proposed loan would not be effective until the start of operations of MMA
with the coming into force of the main provisions of Act No. 30 of 1975. Al-
though no difficulty is envisaged in engaging local professional staff for
management posts, such staff will lack port experience. Consequently, tech-
nical assistance in administration, finance and cargo handling operations is
needed to create and develop an efficient and financially viable port organ-
ization. Posts for a port management advisor and a cargo handling advisor,
financed by the UNDP for two years ending September 1976, will be continued
for another 23 months and 18 months, respectively. UNDP has agreed to finance
these extensions, except for 12 man-months which will be financed by the Bank.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
29.        The project financed with Loan No. 976-MAS of April 1974 comprised
construction of three deep-water berths, two transit sheds, an administra-
tion building, workshops and open storage areas, as well as consulting en-
gineering services for final design, specifications, tender documents and
supervision of construction. Its total cost, net of taxes, was estimated at
US$16.1 million with a foreign exchange component of US$12.1 million or 75
percent. Dredging required in the port was expected to be executed as an in-
cidental part of an ongoing reclamation program financed by the UK Overseas
Development Ministry (ODM) in the nearby Mer Rouge area.     As this program
required considerable dredging to obtain suitable material for the reclama-
tion site, it was agreed that part of it could be done at the port area, thus
providing the dredging required for the project at nominal cost. ODM also
agreed to finance the purchase of port operating equipment. Technical assis-
tance was financed by UNDP. A detailed breakdown of project cost estimates
and financing is set out in Annex IV/Table 1.
30.       The loan became effective on June 13, 1974, a month after project
implementation had started. In August 1974, while the dredger was working
north of the reclamation site (not in the project area), an explosion, most
likelv due to discarded World War II ammunition, occurred in its discharge
pumD and the dredger sank. Both the Government and ODM considered it advis-
able to terminate the reclamation contract instead of insisting that the
contractor complete it, in order to avoid protracted legal procedures and
to save related costs. The contract was thus terminated which meant, of
course, that the dredging in the port basin was discontinued. Bank supervi-
sion staff considered the Government's decision reasonable. ODM subsequent-
ly agreed to Durchase a new, smaller dredger. This dredger, while suitable
tor slow comDletion of the reclamation, cannot be used to complete dredging in
the port which, after preliminary engineering, was found to involve removal of



coral rock which could have been handled by the first, larger dredger. ODM
was not willing to finance the higher cost of completing the dredging for the
project berths and decided, instead, to finance the steel structure for the
transit sheds, in addition to the port operating equipment.
31.       As a result of the change in dredgers, the Government and its
consultants (Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, UK) reconsidered the align-
ment of the berths with a view to minimizing costs and concluded that the
volume and cost of dredging otherwise required could be reduced by building
the third berth in a straight-line extension of the first two berths, rather
that at a 90-degree angle as orginally planned. The revised alignment also
permits more flexible berthing of vessels and is thus operationally advan-
tageous. In addition, the filling required behind the realigned third berth
produces a roughly 50 percent larger port area behind the berths, compared
to the earlier plan. The material to be dredged will provide most of the
necessary fill behind the third berth. The rest of the fill will be trucked
from the Mer Rouge area.
32.       The civil works tender documents were accordingly amended to in-
clude completion of port dredging at its full cost, including mobilization.
Had the reclamation dredger not been damaged, it would have been more econo-
mical to align the third berth as orginally planned even with the coral rock
dredging. However, as the reduction in the volume of dredging required more
than offset the unit cost increase, the straight-line layout is now the less
costly alternative. After international competitive bidding, in accordance
with Bank Guidelines, the major construction contract for the three berths
and the required dredging was awarded to the lowest bidder, Kier International
(UK). However, during the delay in awarding the civil works contract, caused
by the dredging accident, prices increased considerably, with the result that
the estimated cost of civil works is substantially higher than had been
forecast in early 1974 (para. 35). In September 1975, the Government
requested Bank Group assistance in financing the cost of the revisions.
The Revised Project
33.       As a revision of an ongoing project, the appraisal of the proposed
project is based on Bank supervision missions' findings, existing contract
unit prices and cost estimates prepared by the consultants and Bank staff.
The results are included in this report; a separate appraisal report has not
been prepared.
34.       The components of the revised project are similar to those of
the original one and are described below:
(i)   Three Berths and Related Facilities
Three deep-water berths, with storage sheds for two berths
and an open storage area behind the third, a small jetty
and administrative and workshop buildings will be con-
structed. The only change from Loan No. 976-HAS is



- 10 -
that the berths will be positioned in a straight-line
alignment instead of at a 90-degree angle as originally
planned. This will result in a 50 percent increase in the
port area behind the berths.
(ii)   Dredging
The remaining dredging for the berths will be completed.
The quantity of dredging for the third berth is less than
that which would have been required for a 90-degree align-
ment. On the other hand, a greater quantity of filling is
necessary behind the third berth. A rock bund will be con-
structed to protect the filled area.
(iii)   Consultant Services
Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners are carrying out the
required engineering and construction supervision. They
have been on the job since early 1975 and are competent.
The only change in this component from Loan No. 976-MAS is
that these services have been extended over the revised esti-
mated construction period.
(iv)   Port Operating Equipment
The mechanical cargo handling equipment will serve the
new general cargo berths; two tugs have replaced two obsolete
vessels under ODM financing. Fire fighting equipment and related
facilities have now been included. This component also includes
some additional small items of equipment.
(v)   Technical Assistance
Because of the delay in setting up MMA, it has become
necessary to extend the financing provided under Loan No.
976-MAS for a Port Management Advisor and a Cargo Super-
vising Advisor. These services will be extended by 23
months and 18 months, respectively, to assist in building
up the Authority's operational capability and in training
Mauritian counterparts.
Revised Project Cost Estimates
35.       The total cost of the revised project is estimated at US$23.5
million (including US$0.2 million representing taxes and duties) of which
75 percent, US$17.7 million,is foreign exchange. A detailed cost analysis
in Mauritian rupees is shown in Annex IV/Table 2; cost estimates under
Loan No. 976-MAS are set out in Annex IV/Table 1. A summary of estimates
under Loan No. 976-MAS and the revised project is given below.

36.        The revised estimates have been arrived at as follows:
(i) Construction, Dredging, Filling and Equipment: based on
the three contracts which have been awarded and on reason-
able, revised estimates for transit sheds, open storage
areas, administrative buildings and workshops, and port
operating equipment;
(ii) Engineering and Construction Supervision: the cost of
these services is equivalent to approximately 5 percent
of construction and dredging costs, and is considered
reasonable;
(iii)  Technical Assistance:    this component is estimated at
a total of 87 man-months of technical assistance to MIA,
of which 75 man-months will be financed by UNDP and 12
man-months by the Bank. The cost has been based on UNDP
pro forma man-month rates, on average US$3,600 per man-
month; and



- 12 -
(iv)  Contingencies:   Physical contingencies for items (i),
(ii b), and (iii) have been estimated at 5 percent.
Contingencies for expected price increases for (i) and
(ii b) amount to 14 percent for 1976, 12 percent for
1977-79, and 10 percent for 1980; and for (iv), 10
percent for 1976, 8 percent for 1977-79, and 7 percent
for 1980.  The price contingencies apply to both local
and foreign costs.

/1   Internally generated (Annex IV/Table 7) and proceeds of a contribution
from the Government (para. 41).
38.       Of the US$3.6 million additional Bank Group financing, US$2.1 mil-
lion comprises 74 percent of the cost of the remaining dredging and filling.
Fire fighting equipment and related facilities, as well as technical assis-
tance are estimated at US$0.3 million. The balance of US$1.2 million will
finance estimated cost increases for other items, partly caused by the delay
in project implementation which is explained in paras. 30 and 31. An analy-
sis of all project cost increases and their causes is given in Annex IV/
Table 3.
39.       UNTDP and ODMI participation is on the basis of parallel financing.
Although ODMI will not finance completion of the dredging as originally
planned, its share in the financing has increased by three percentage points
in view of its providing for the transit shed steel structures. All agreements
relating thereto have been signed. The Bank's participation represents a de-
crease of four percentage points, even with the proposed additional financing
of US$3.6 million. The means by which H-M4A will generate its cash contribution
to project costs are described in para. 47.



Onlending Terms
40.       The proceeds of Loan No. 976-HlAS and of tihe proposed loan would be
onlent by the Government to HMA at nine percent interest per annum, for 20
years including five years of grace (with the first amortization payment due
in FY1982). This would require changing the onlending arrangements for
the previous loan from 7.25 percent for 25 years including 5 years of grace
(with the first amortization payment due .July 15, 1979). There would be
no change in the amortization schedule of Loan No. 976-MAS, so that the
Government would have to accomodate the difference in amortization schedules.
For cargo handling equipment and transit shed structures, ODM funds will be
onlent by the Government to EMA at 7.25 percent interest, with repayment to
the Government over 20 years.
41.        Because of low internal cash generation during the first two years
of MIA operation (Annex TV/Table 7), the Government would contribute to UMA's
equity the equivalent of US$1.6 million in FY1977 and US$2.5 million in
FY1978. Assuming such a contribution, plus the projected increase in revenues
(paras. 47-49), MNA should be able to finance its share of project expendi-
tures.  If for any reason X A should be unable to cover its share of project
costs, the Government would make available all necessary funds to complete the
project (Section 3.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). Because MMA's financial
viability could be endangered if it incurred substantial additional debt,
the debt service coverage of 1.5 required under Loan No. 976-MAS will be
maintained.
Project Execution
42.       MIA, with assistance from the M1inistry of Communications, will be
responsible for project execution. Construction began in April 1976 and is
expected to be completed in late 1979. Three contracts have been awarded,
in each case to the lowest bidder after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
Disbursements
43.        No withdrawal applications have been submitted, pending the esta-
blishment and staffing of MHA.
44.        The proceeds of the proposed loan and of Loan No. 976-MAS wiLl be
disbursed concurrently, on a pro rata basis. Disbursements will be on the
basis of 74 percent of civil works, which approximates the foreign exchange
component, excluding the transit shed structures financed by the 0DM, and
100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of engineering consultant services
and technical assistance. Disbursement for fire fighting equipment wilL be
on the basis of 100 percent of foreign exchange costs or 90 percent or tntal
expenditures if purchased locally. A schedule of estimated disbursenents
covering both the existing and the proposed Loans is shnkm in Annex TV/
Table 4.

Financial Evaluation
45.        General.  The financially autonomous IDMA will assume the functions
of the Marine Services Department in the Ministry of Communications, which
until now has been responsible essentially for the berthing of ships. In
addition, IMA will take charge of security, cargo handling and control
(hitherto handled by other agencies) and the accounting and administrative
services required for efficient port operations. Appropriate commercial
accounting, costing and budgeting control systems will be introduced by
July 1, 1977 (Section 4.03 of the draft Project Agreement). By this date,
t1MA will also take out and maintain with responsible insurers, or make other
provision satisfactory to the Bank Group for, insurance against risks in an
amount consistent with appropriate practice.
46.       Assets.   MMA will take over existing net fixed assets which have
a book value of some Mau Rs 36.6 million. The new project facilities will
add Mau Rs 148.0 million to the above value during FY1978 and FY1979; upon
completion of the first berth by January 1, 1978, the second by July 1,
1978, and the third by January 1, 1979. Because the project costs have
increased by 44 percent (expressed in US dollars), the asset base will in-
crease substantially. Further, the additional cargo capacity provided by
the three berths is not expected to be fully utilized until FY1983. These
factors, combined with operating costs that are higher than anticipated under
Loan No. 976-MAS (para. 47), make the 8 percent rate of return on net fixed
assets for FY1976 and FY1977, and 7 percent thereafter required under the
976-MAS Loan Agreement, unrealistic targets. A revised financial covenant
(as described in para. 49) will be incorporated in both Loan No. 976-MAS and
the proposed new Loan Agreement.
47.        Revenues and Costs.   MiLA's revenues are derived chiefly from charges
for piloting, towing and anchoring; service fees for upkeep of government
tugs, radio station and lighting; and quay and handling fees. As the project
berths become operational, the cargo handling tariff base will be revised as
necessary to that applicable for alongside operations. Traffic projections
based on past experience assume an average annual growth of 3 to 5 percent.
Operating expense projections (excluding depreciation) include reasonable
allowances for cost increases resulting from price rises, while improvements
in productivity are expected to offset the cost of handling increased ton-
nage.  In addition to the projections of existing costs, M1MA will incur
recurrent expenses of some Mau Rs 2.0 million annually as a result of its
expanded activities (para. 45). Depreciation of fixed assets will increase
fivefold from 1977 to 1980.
48.        The income statement shown in Annex IV/Table 5 assunes that interim
selective tariff increases designed to increase total revenues bv 25 percent
in each of FY1978, FY1979 and FY1980 will be introduced to ensure that operating



expenses (including depreciation) are fully covered, debt service require-
ments fully met, and a contribution of about 8% towards investments under the
project provided through FY1980. MMA will also generate some Mtau Rs 8
miLlion for future investment needs (presently unidentified) through FY 1983
(Annex TV/Table 7). A tariff system based on cost and market considerations
will be introduced by January 1, 1978, instead of by July 1, 1976 as provided
for in the 976-MAS Loan Agreement (Section 4.05 of the draft Project Agree-
ment).
Financial Covenant
49.        Given the circumstances described in the preceding paragraphs
and, in particular, the construction delay and increased project and operat-
ing costs, the financial covenant agreed to under Loan No. 976-llAS (Annex
IV/Table 6) will be amended to the effect that MMA will take all necessary
measures (including adjusting tariffs and reducing costs where possible) to
generate sufficient revenues to maintain a rate of return on net fixed assets
in use, as revalued from time to time, of at least 3 percent through FY1979,
5 percent for FY1980, FY1981 and FY1982, and 7 percent thereafter (Section
4.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
Economic Evaluation
50.        The economic justification for the project is based on the findings
of a Bank supervision mission which visited Mauritius in February 1976 and
on data available at headquarters. The project has a 19 percent economic
return over its 25 year economic life (Annex IV/Table 8), compared to 17
percent for the original project. The return was calculated by comparing the
proposed investments with continued lighterage operations. Since implementing
the proposed project means that the otherwise necessary lighterage investments
will be avoided, they are treated as capital cost savings in calculating the
project's economic return.
51.        Economic Analysis.   Quantified project benefits, based on more
accurate, updated estimates (in comparison with Loan No. 976-tAS), are
described in detail in the attachment to Annex IV/Table 8. They comprise:
(i) Avoided Lighterage Costs: over the project life in the "without"
case, required investment for continued lighterage operations
would be about Mau Rs 34.7 million for additional lighterage
quays and transit sheds, replacement lighters and tugs, and
lighterage quay equipment.
(ii) Operational Cost Savings: compared with continued lighterage of
general cargo, the project will result in cost savings (Annex IV/
Table 8) comprising:
'a) -lore efficient cargo handling in alongside operations,
it a saving of 'lau Rs 15.8 per tor (the estinate
in the 1973 anoraisril *as a savinr,g o  laIn Rs 7.f-,
ner tonr:



- 16 -
(b)  a 36-hour average reduction in ship servicing time.     At
ilau Rs 30,000 per ship/day and assuming that only half
the savings accrue immediately to tlauritius through ap-
propriate tariff adjustments and/or avoidance of freight
surcharges, the savings amount to Mau Rs 13.5 per cargo-
ton (in 1973, the saving was estimated at Mau Rs 9.0 per
ton); and
(c) reduced cargo loss and damage, through eliminating the
double handling entailed in lighterage operations,
is estimated at 1.5 percent of the average value per
ton, Mau Rs 3,000, and amounts to a saving of Mlau Rs
45 per ton. (The value of cargo handled at the Port
has doubled since 1973, mainly due to inflation - see
attachment to Annex IV/Table 8.)
52.        Sensitivity Analysis and Risks.   Even with construction cost in-
creases (the major project risk) of 15 percent and a 15 percent decline in
project benefits, the project's economic return is still an acceptable 15
percent. It is considered that project risks are no greater than those
attendant to any project of this nature; no significant difficulties are
envisaged.
PART V:  LEGAL INSTRUM1ENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.        The draft Loan Agreement between M1auritius and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and Mlauritius Marine Authority, the
recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
54.       The special features described in paragraphs 48 and 49 of this
report are reflected in Sections 4.05 and 4.06 of the Project Agreement.
The coming into force of the main sections of Act No. 30 of 1975 has been
sDecified as an additional condition to the effectiveness of the Loan Agree-
ment (Section 7.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
55.        Several sections of the Loan Agreement for the first port loan
(Loan No. 976-MAS) have been amended by Article VI of the draft Loan Agreement
for the proposed second port loan to avoid inconsistencies between the two
agreements. In addition, by virtue of Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment and of the provisions of the draft Project Agreement, all performance
covenants under the first Loan Agreement have been assumed by the TIrA.
56.        1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
jf Agreement of the Bank and with the established criteria for Third !Window
oans.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 239-MAS Tea Development Project: US$5.2 Million Credit of
April 9, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: June 11, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Project field development experienced problems due to poor soil
and drainage conditions, poor quality of planting materials (seedlings
instead of- VP plants) and the effect of a cyclone which hit Mauritius in
February 1975. These difficulties were aggravated by general problems
facing the Mauritius tea industry, especially rapidly increasing wage rates
in the sugar industry with which the tea sector is unable to compete. These
problems were examined about two years ago by a study group which included
Bank staff members. The recommendations of the study group, which included
suggestions on what the role of the Tea Development Authority (TDA) should
be, were accepted by the Government and are being implemented. Further, the
area under the project was reduced from 5600 to 3000 arpents and, consequently,
the number of factories was reduced from 2 to 1. Savings resulting from this
reduction in the scope of the project are being used for rehabilitation of
plantations after the February 1975 cyclone damage. In addition, the Govern-
ment took various administrative measures to bring about improvements. A
new acting General Manager was appointed and 2 senior tea officers were
seconded to the Tea Development Authority from the Ministry of Agriculture.
Project accounts are now in better shape following the appointment of a
qualified financial controller and a chief accountant. Field work is now
proceeding on schedule and the first project plantations should be ready
for handover to smallholders in 1977-78.
Credit No. 411-MAS Industrial Estate Project: US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 1, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Implementation of the project is on schedule.
Credit No. 419-MAS Rural Development Project: US$4.0 Million Credit of
July 9, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: October 11, 1973;
Closing Date: October 30, 1977
The Rural Development Project has been slow in implementation.
Several factors, including procurement difficulties, the rise in sugar
prices which caused land prices to rise sharply, thus making it difficult
for the Government to obtain land for the project, and the February 1975.
cyclone, have contributed to the delays. There have also been management

problems, including, in particular, the lack of interministerial coordina-
tion and a deterioration in the management capacity of the rural develop-
ment unit.  Audited accounts,which should be submitted within 6 months
after the end of each fiscal year, are still awaited for 1974/75.
Following measures taken in mid-1975, some improvement in project
progress has occurred. Government involvement in management decisions has
expedited land acquisition, re-organization of the Development Works Corpo-
ration (DWC) and the training program for younger workers. Progress under
the productive self-help component and with worker vocational training con-
tinues.  The monitor-ing arid evaluation unit, after a slow start, Ls now
working well and its first operational evaluation studies are being issued
to Project Management and IDA for review.
An in-depth supervision mission is scheduled for November.
Loan 976-MAS     Port Project:  US$10.0 Million Loan of April 12, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 13, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
Civil works contracts under the project have been awarded and
physical execution of the project is proceeding. Changes in the project
design had to be made, however, which have resulted in increases in cost,
which the proposed Third Window loan discussed in this report would help
finance.
Loan 979-MAS     Second Development Bank Project:  US$5.0 Million Loan of
April 24, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: July 17, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The amount is fully committed and disbursements are now ahead
of schedule. No problems are anticipated.
Loan 1033-MAS and Credit 501-MAS     First Education Project:   US$3.5 Million
each of July 29, 1974; Date of Effective-
ness: October 29, 1974; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
Implementation progress is proceeding satisfactorily after initial
difficulties with site acquisition, the appointment of architectural con-
sultants, and delays in the provision of bilateral technical assistance. The
Government has decided not to use the parastatal Development Works Corpora-
tion for the construction of project institutes and will now seek competitive
tenders. The Program Unit is fully staffed and operating well. A committee
composed of representatives of all the relevant ministries was formed to regu-
larly review progress and to ensure effective coordination of all activities
under the project.
Loan 1168-MAS   Third Development Bank Project:    US$7.5 Million Loan of
October 23, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: December 9, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is proceeding well. About US$3.8 million have been
committed and US$0.8 million disbursed.

N@et:  Fir the USS cost comparison shown in Table 3, the current exchange rate of USS1   6.72 Mau.Rs. has been
used, except for the major contract which has been awarded and which contains a fixed exchange rate of US$1 =
6.12 Mau.Rs. It is considered that it would be incorrect to use the current exchange rate here, as the depreciation
of the Mauritian currency has no doubt resulted in price  escalation over and above the worLdwide price contingencies                             October 1976
which have been used according to Bank guidelines.

tAURITIUS - REVISED PORT PROJECT
Economic Benefits
The economic analysis presented in the Appraisal Report (No. 318a-
HAS) for Loan No. 976-HAS has been revised on the basis of updated informa-
tion. The principal changes in economic benefits and the reasons therefor
are the following:
(a) Avoided lighterage capital costs: Over the life of the
project, in the "without" case, additional investments
would be required for continued lighterage operations
to handle the export-import trade of Miauritius.   In
Report No. 318a-IAS, these were estimated at Mau Rs 20.9
million. The required investments are now estimated to
cost tHau Rs 34.7 million, and these would be avoided by
undertaking the project. The increases are due to up-
dating the cost estimates for civil works and equipment.
(b) Savings in Cargo Handling Costs: Compared with continued
1iighterage of general cargo, the project will help reduce
cargo handling costs, since alongside operations are nore
efficient. This saving was estimated at liau Rs 7.0 per
ton of cargo in the original appraisal. It is now esti-
mated to be about Mau Rs 15.8 per ton, based on a detailed
comparison of cargo handling costs with and without ligh-
terage carried out in early 1976 by the Ilarine Services
Department of Mauritius under the guidance of the UNDP
Cargo Supervising Adviser. -his increase since 1973 is
due in part to increases of about 22 percent in the wages
of port labour and of about 28 percent in fuel costs.
(c)  Reduction in Ship Service Time:    The savings on this account
continue to be 36 hours per ship on the average, the same
as at the time of the original appraisal. However, more
recent data available from shipping sources indicate a value
of Mau Rs 30,000 per ship/day, compared with the earlier
figure of Mau Rs 10,000. However, only half this amount is
assumed to accrue to Mauritius, and the present economic
evaluation is based on that assumption.
(d)  Reduction in Cargo Loss and Damage:    The resultant savings
are estimated at 1.5 percent of the average value per ton
of general cargo, the same as in the original appraisal.
However, the average value per Lt-n      i now estimated at Mau Rs
3,000, compared with Mau r, i,'> i. n      ori-inal appraisal.

The revised figure is based on estimates made by the
Mauritius Chamber of Commerce on the basis of data
for early 1976. The increase is due in part to world-
wide inflation since 1973, and especially in the UK,
which supplies a substantial part of the import require-
ment of Mauritius.
The resultant changes can be tabulated as follows:
Original           Present
Appraisal         Appraisal
1.   Avoided lighterage capital
costs (Mau Rs million)                       20.9              34.7
2.   Savings in cargo handling
costs (Mau Rs per ton)                        7.0              15.8
3.   Reduction in ship service
time (Mau Rs per ship/day)                  10,000            15,000
4.   Reduction in cargo loss and
damage (Mau Rs per ton)                      22.5              45.0
