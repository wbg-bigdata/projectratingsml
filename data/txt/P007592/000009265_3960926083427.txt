MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A NINTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$400 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including three years of grace,
at the standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background. Mexico's agricultural sector accounts for ab3ut 9% of
GDP, employs about 25% of the labor force, and contributes about 26% to the
country's non-oil exports. kirnl incomes are low with 78% of rural
households earning incomes less than 30% of the national average. Because of
agriculture's large share of employment, its political importance and the
extent of poverty in many rural areas, the Government considers the
revitalization of agriculture to be an important economic and social element
in the structural recovery of Mexico.
3.        Before 1970, Mexico produced sufficient food to feed its population
and export substantial surpluses. By the end of the 1970s, however, it had
become a major importer of basic foodstuffs. In March 1980, the Government
resorted to major action to reverse agriculture's decline by using the
growing revenues from oil. It raised support prices, and increased subsidies
on agricultural inputs and on credit. These interventions, coinciding with
favorable weather, led to substantial increases in agricultural production of
6% p.a. in 1980 and 1981. However, because of the burden they placed on the
budget, these market interventions were not sustainable and fell early victim
to Mexico's economic crisis. In 1982, when farmgate prices fell in real
terms with high inflation, agricultural production declined by 1%.
Production recovered moderately from 1983 to 1985 and gre-w about 2.5% p.a.
primarily because of a supportive exchange rate and favorable weather. In
1986, however, agricultural production fell by 4.2% due to poor weather and
contractior. in domestic demand. Declines in domestic consumption and a
favarable exchange rate, however, permitted increased exports, producing the
first agricultural trade surplus since 1979, estimated at aborut US',~ billion.
4.        The Government continues to seek remedies to Mexico's rural
problerds. Fiscal constraints prevent it from reverting to the kinds of
costly subsidy policies used in the early 1980s. Instead, it has made its
main objectives reducing subsidies while improving the effectiveness of
remaining subsidies including those directed at agricultural credit, raising
returns to public investments, and reducing its intervention in the market.
5.        Agricultural credit, delivered mainly through the FIRA/Commercial
Banks and the FICART/Public Development Bank Credit Systems, is an important
instrument for meeting these objectives. However, due to the continuing



-2-
eaonomic crisis and lack of financial resources, agricultural credit is
declining in real terms. Projections through 1991, however, indicate a rapid
increase in the demand for agricultural credit along with a general recovery
of the Mexican economy.
6.        Consistent with its overall policy to reduce subsidies, the
Government has taken important steps in reducing credit subsidies. In the
past, interest rates have been negative in real terms and accelerating
inflation in recent years has heightened this tendency. To deal with this
issue, the Government and the Bank entered into a General Interest Rate
Agreement (GIRA) in 1984. As a result of GIRA and its amendments, the
interest rate regime has improved and credit subsidies have been
significantly reduced. All interest rates have been linked to an index of
deposits rates (the average cost of funds or ACF) and made variable.
Nevertheless, aggregate credit subsidies to all sectors remain large (at
about 3.8% of GDP in 1986). To address this problem, the Government and the
Bank have been discussing a possible revision of GIRA. A new agreement is
being developed to provide for the introduction of an administrative
framework for systematic credit subsidy budgeting and control, along with
progressive further reductions in the amount of credit subsidies. Until such
time as a new agreement has been concluded, the present GIRA remains
effective.
7.        Current bank lending supports the Government's objectives in
increasing the efficiency of production and reducing subsidies. A proposed
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan to aid structural reform in the sector is
under appraisal and projects to increase efficiency in extension and
research, irrigation, dairying and forestry have been or are about to be
appraised. The proposed project, the ninth of a series of successful credit
operations involving FIRA, would finance agricultural credit to improve the
sector's productivity while supporting further reductions in interest rate
subsidies to farmers.
8.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to:
(a) increase agricultural productivity, exports, farm incomes, and
rural employment;
(b) improve agricultural sector policies by reducing interest rate
subsidies and by carrying out a study of rural credit issues so as
to facilitate addressing these in the future; and
(c)  improve the institutional capability of FIRA and FICART while
assisting in maintaining their capital structure.



-3-
9.        Project Description. The proposed project would:
(a) finance short-term and investment credit for crops, livestock,
agroindustries and other activities (e.g. aquaculture and
horticulture);
(b) provide training, technical assistance and consultants' services,
as well as civil works for the construction of demonstration
centers, to support FIRA and FICART's technical assistance
programs to farmers; and
(c) include a rural credit study to identify further areas to improve
the rural financial system and resource mobilization.
10.       Total projeet cost is estimated at US$1,000 million, which
represents about 15% of the overall program of FIRA and FICART. The foreign
exchange cost i8 about 40%. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Mexico are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Staff Appraisal Report No. 6802-ME dated
May 29, 1987 is also attached.
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The provision of credit is a key
element of the Government's strategy to increase agricultural output and to
raise living conditions in the countryside, where most of Mexico's poor
live. In recognition of this, support to private farmers, ranchers and
agroindustries has accounted for a major share of Bank lending to Mexico.
Past Bank-financed rural credit operations to FIRA show that funds are
utilized appropriately with significant production, institutional, social and
economic gains. The proposed project--the first in which FICART/BANRURAL
(Mexico's largest source of term lending for agriculture) would participate
directly--would extend the Bank's institutional development assistance to
FICART/BANRURAL. Without the proposed loan, FIRA and FICART would have to
curtail their lending programs. The proposed project would also lead to
reductions in interest rate subsidies and thus contribute to the important
policy objectives of phasing out subsidies and allocating resources more
efficiently.
12.       Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government of Mexico
agreed that:
(a)  The obligations under the General -terest Rate Agreement would be
applicable under this loan;
(b) the agricultural financial subsector study would be completed by
January 31, 1988 under terms of reference agreed with the Bank and
thereafter there would be an exchange of views with the Bank on the
conclusions and recommendations of such study. Beginning March 31,
1988 the study's recommendations would be implemented within a time
period acceptable to the Bank;



-4-
(c) all necessary actions would be taken to ensure that adequate funds
would be budgeted annually to FIRA and FICART to prevent any
material capital erosion, in real terms, which FIRA or FICART may
have incurred during the immedliately preceding year on account of
all their lending operations after January 1, 1986; and
(d) participating banks would have their eligibility suspended whenever
the arrears under loans made by any such participating bank and
discounted by FIRA or FICART exceed fifteen percent of the
aggregate outstanding amount of such loans.
13.       This loan supports the Government's medium-term structural policy
reform program and is part of the 1986-87 external financing plan of
assistance to Mexico supported by the Bank and other donors. Release of the
third tranche of the commercial bank package to Mexico is linked to
effectiveness of the proposed loan.
14.       Justification. The project would benefit about 100,000 families, a
total of about 550,000 beneficiaries, and would generate an additional
240,000 jobs. Evaluation of model investment plans indicates that
subprojects are expected to have financial and economic rates of return in
the range of 22% to over 50%. The project would also have an important
institutional strengthening effect, particularly for
FICART/BANRURAL--Mexico's largest agricultural credit lender. Furthermore,
the financial subsector review should lead to improved efficiency and
self-sustainability of the rural financial system.
15.       Risks. The main risk is that political pressures could reverse the
progress achieved in reducing interest rate subsidies. However, this is
unlikely to occur. The Government is committed to the gradual elimination of
distortions and has a close dialogue with the Bank on interest rates
--including those charged to farmers--within the context of GIRA. As an
indication of Government's continuing cormitment to the gradual elimination
of interest rate subsidies, interest rates to small farmers were increased
from 70% of ACF to 75% of ACF as of May 1, 1987.
16.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
