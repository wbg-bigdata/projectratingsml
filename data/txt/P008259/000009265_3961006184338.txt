ALBANIA
POWER LOSS REDUCTION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Government of Albania
Executing
Agency:            Albanian Electroenergetic Corporation (KESH)
Credit Amount:    SDR 3.4 million (US$5 million equivalent)
Terms:             Forty years maturity with a ten-year grace period.
Credit proceeds would be lent to the Government at
the standard IDA service charge
Onlending Terms:  Ten years maturity including a four-year grace
period, at a rate equal to the yield on 10-year
U.S. Treasury Bonds plus a margin of 100 basis
points, with the foreign exchange risk to be
borne by KESH
Project
Objectives:        (i) to reduce non-technical electricity losses
(mainly due to theft of electricity) thereby
reducing uneconomic use of electricity and
increasing electricity revenue; ii) to support
institutional reform and strengthening in the
power subsector.
Project
Description:       The  project  would  consist  of  the  following
components: an action plan to reduce non-
technical power losses, technical assistance and
training for the power loss reduction program,
and  support   for   institutional   reform  and
strengthening.
The action plan includes: transferring the
electricity inspectors to KESH, increasing their
numbers, reorganizing them, improving their
equipment and assuring police support if needed;
replacing broken or faulty meters in the cities
of Tirana, Durres, Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore
with packages consisting of a new meter combined
with a current limiter protected by a plastic
case with a signed seal, installing meters at
transformers,  and    upgrading  meter  testing,
calibration and repair; improving consumer
services management through establishing consumer
contracts, creating a better database, carrying
out a publicity campaign, and introducing
incentive schemes in the distribution entities.



KESH would be converted to a joint stock company
and establish new accounting and financial
systems.
Environmental
Aspects:           The  project  has  been  placed  in  environment
category C. The installation of meters and the
organizational and management changes under the
project would have no impact on the environment.
Benefits:          The benefits resulting from reduced non-technical
losses would be (i) increased electricity
revenue, and (ii) reduced uneconomic electricity
demand, which would give a cost saving and reduce
pressure   on   overloaded   transmission   and
distribution facilities.  The reduced strain on
facilities would also reduce technical losses.
Risks:             One  risk would be  a failure  to provide  the
personnel needed to implement the action plan on
schedule.  To minimize this risk the tasks have
been identified in considerable detail with many
time-bound   targets,   and   KESH   would   have
sufficient   funds   to  employ   the  necessary
personnel.      The   additional   revenue   from
converting non-technical losses to billed sales
would provide an incentive to make sure the
program is successful.  A second risk is that the
inspectors would be prevented from entering
consumers' premises or bribed to not report
electricity theft.   To minimize this risk the
inspectors have been given the right by law to
have access to consumer meters, they have been
transferred to the direct control of KESH, the
Government would provide police support if
necessary, an improved customer file system would
make it easier to detect irregularities, and
local inspectors would be cross-checked by
inspectors from KESH headquarters. A third risk
is that consumers would break the new meters. To
reduce this risk each customer would be made
responsible for his or her meter, and consumers
without meters would be billed anyway. A fourth
risk is that customers would not pay their bills.
This risk would be minimized by disconnecting
customers in arrears.  A final risk is that the
program would not achieve public acceptance. To
minimize this risk a publicity campaign would
emphasize the benefit from reduced overloading of
electrical facilities resulting from the program.

POWER LOSS REDUCTION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Resources and Status of Development
Energy Resources
1.01 Albania's energy resources comprise: oil, natural gas, coal, wood and other
biomass, peat and hydropower. (a) Remaining proved recoverable oil reserves are
estimated at 27 million tons.  (b) There are also limited remaining recoverable
natural gas reserves estimated at 1.63 billion cubic meters (1.39 million tons
oil equivalent (toe)). Production of most of the remaining oil and gas will
require enhanced recovery methods.   (c) Total minable coal reserves in seams
thicker than 0.4 meters are 350 million tons (82 million toe), but they are not
economic.   (d) The standing stock of wood in the forest estate is about 80
million cubic meters (14.1 million toe), and there is much wood and other biomass
available for fuel use outside the forest estate, but estimates of the annual
sustainable supply of fuelwood and other biomass vary widely. (e) Albania's peat
resources are estimated at 158 million tons (47 million toe), of which 156
million tons are located in a single deposit near Maliq.   Use of peat as a
household fuel was investigated but found not to be feasible because of high ash
content and marginal economics. (f) While Albania's hydropower potential has not
been precisely established, it is thought to be more than three times as large
as the amount already developed, which produces 4,000 GWh in a normal
hydrological year, equivalent to 1.6 million toe. Albania's energy resources
have been sufficient to supply the country's needs and enable it to be a net
energy exporter.
Past Energy Production and Consumption
1.02 Historical energy production and consumption data are shown in Annex 1.1.
(a) Crude oil production declined gradually from 1.35 million tons in 1981 to
1.13 million tons in 1989 but fell rapidly to 568 thousand tons in 1993. While
the decline in the early period was due largely to natural depletion the collapse
since 1989 resulted mainly from the breakdown of old equipment and lack of spare
parts. (b) Natural gas production fell from a high of about 800 thousand toe in
1982 to about 200 thousand toe per year over the next seven years, and then
dropped to 70 thousand toe in 1993. The first fall was due to a bad fire, while
the second was due mainly to equipment breakdowns combined with lack of spare
parts. (c) Coal production rose gradually over the 1980s reaching 515 thousand
toe in 1989, but fell even more precipitously than oil and gas to only 52
thousand toe in 1993. In this case the decline was due to a fall in demand. (d)
Fuelwood production rose slowly from about 1,100 thousand toe in 1981 to 1,260
thousand toe in 1989 and then fell to 1,190 thousand toe in 1992.  After 1989



- 2 -
fuelwood deliveries to cities by state enterprises fell sharply because of
failures in the transport system and a reduction in supply of industrial wood
(some fuelwood is a byproduct), but the shortfall was partly made up by cutting
of wood (to some extent illegally) in and near cities. (e) There has been no
peat production.   (f) Hydroelectricity generation varied from a low of 567
thousand toe in 1983 to a high of 1,219 thousand toe in 1986 because of changes
in water availability. Production in 1993 was 828 thousand toe.
1.03 Total energy consumption in Albania grew by 1.1% per year from 3.857
million toe in 1981 to 4.223 million toe in 1989, but then fell abruptly by 35%
to 2.746 million toe in 1992. Consumption in 1993 was about the same as in 1992.
The reduction since 1989 was associated with the collapse of the economy over the
same period. The economic collapse reduced energy demand directly by reducing
industrial energy requirements, and indirectly by causing reductions in energy
supply which in turn restricted consumption. The option of importing energy to
make up for indigenous supply shortfalls was not taken. Thus, despite the large
reductions in energy supply after 1989, Albania remained roughly self-sufficient
in energy through 1993.
1.04 Per capita energy consumption fell from 836 kilograms oil equivalent (1,022
kgoe including fuelwood) in 1990 to 458 kgoe (811 kgoe including fuelwood) in
1992.  Levels for both years are high compared to figures for countries with
similar per capita incomes.   The 43 low income countries  listed in World
Development Report 1992, with average per capita GNP of US$350 in 1990, had an
average per capita commercial energy consumption of 339 kgoe. The reasons for
the relatively high consumption are the same as for the other countries in
Central and Eastern Europe, namely, an economy oriented towards energy intensive
industries such as mining, metallurgy and petrochemicals, and low energy prices.
Data on consumption of individual energy carriers by end-use sector are shown in
the Energy Balance for 1990 in Annex 1.2.
B. Sector Institutions and Management
1.05 Responsibilities for energy are shared among several entities at the
government level.   In late 1993 the Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources
(MME) was created with responsibility for: the Albanian Oil and Gas Corporation
(Albpetrol); the National Petroleum Agency, established in mid-1993 with
responsibility for issuing licenses for petroleum exploration and production; the
Albanian Electroenergetic Corporation (KESH); and the coal mine enterprises. The
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Territory Adjustment (MC) administers
government subsidies for household energy and has been responsible for arranging
coal imports.   It used to have authority   over municipal fuel distribution
enterprises, but responsibility for these was transferred in late 1992 to the
municipal governments.  Since August 1993, MC has also been responsible for the
Executive Agency for Energy Resources for the Population, which was established
at that time to prepare and implement policies for household energy.   The
National Committee of Energy (NCE) was created in late 1992 under the Council of
Ministers with responsibilities for carrying out analyses of energy policy,
compiling energy statistics, making forecasts, and liaising with foreign
governments and international organizations on energy matters. The Ministry of



- 3 -
Finance has the lead responsibility for energy tax policy.   Energy price
decisions are made by the Council of Ministers. The Committee for Environmental
Protection and Preservation (CEPP), a semi-autonomous committee within the
Ministry of Health, is responsible for preparing and implementing environmental
protection measures affecting the energy sector.
C. Sector Strategv
1.06 The Government has plans to expand energy supply for export as well as
domestic markets. However, because of limited resources it is rightly giving
first priority to rehabilitation of existing facilities in the power and
petroleum subsectors. This emphasis is evident in the Public Investment Program
for the period 1993-96. The Government has also begun institutional reforms in
these subsectors leading towards commercialization of Albpetrol and KESH, and
encouragement is being given to private activities. In the petroleum subsector,
contracts have been given to foreign oil companies for exploration off-shore and
efforts are under way to contract out exploration, enhanced recovery and
rehabilitation  activities  on-shore.   With  respect  to coal,  a substantial
downsizing of the industry has already taken place, and the most promising
remaining mines are being studied for restructuring or closure by the Enterprise
Restructuring Agency. Particular attention has been given by the Government to
meeting space heating requirements of households during the cold winter months.
Arrangements were made with donor countries in 1992 and 1993 for imports of
kerosene, LPG and stoves.   During 1993 private suppliers of wood were made
eligible to receive the same subsidy as state enterprises and to compete against
state enterprises in auctions of rights to cut wood in specified areas. There
was a strong response resulting in increased fuelwood deliveries to cities. With
respect to the environment, the CEPP has prepared a National Environmental Action
Plan with technical assistance managed by the Bank. Among the priorities are
measures to ensure that forests are exploited in a sustainable way so as to avoid
deforestation leading to soil erosion.
D. Energy Prices
1.07 Government-fixed energy prices in Albania as of April 1994 are shown in
Annex 1.3. Comparisons are made with estimates of economic costs and prices in
OECD Europe.
1.08 Over the past three years the Government has made rapid progress in raising
energy prices from very low levels. Prices as of March 1994 were already at or
above cost for gasoline, diesel oil, fuel oil, kerosene for non-household use and
coal for non-household use. On April 1, 1994 the prices of fuelwood and coal for
households were freed. The price of kerosene for household use was raised from
5 leks per liter to 20 leks, about equal to its economic cost. The price of LPG
was raised from 19 leks per kilogram to 40 leks, probably above its economic
cost.  The price of district heat may be fixed by producers subject to a 10%
profit and the requirement that the price to households be 40 leks per cubic
meter of heated space. The natural gas price is 6.3 leks per cubic meter for
non-household users and 950 leks per month for household users in summer and 1600



- 4 -
leks per month for household users in winter. At present household consumers of
district heat and gas are not metered. Government subsidies for household energy
have been eliminated completely.
1.09 Prior to April 1, 1994 households in large cities paid 0.8 leks per kWh for
an initial block of consumption per month (250 kWh in large cities and less
elsewhere) and 3 leks per kWh for all additional consumption. On April 1 the
price for all household consumption was raised to 4.5 leks per kWh.   The
household electricity price is often the most difficult price for governments to
raise, for social reasons.   Albania's price is now at or above the average
household price in each of the other Central Europe countries.   Such a rapid
catch-up is a considerable achievement.
1.10 Prior to April 1, 1994 most non-household consumers paid 2 leks per kWh.
Lower prices were paid by several large state industries. On April 1 prices were
fixed at: 1.4 leks per kWh for the petroleum industry, 1.6 leks per kWh for the
metallurgical industry, 2.1 leks for most other state consumers, 4 leks per kWh
for medium-voltage private consumers and other state industries (e.g., textiles,
wood, construction), 4.5 leks per kWh for low-voltage industrial consumers, 4.2
leks per kWh for low-voltage commercial consumers in summer and 8.0 leks per kWh
in winter.   Some consumer classes  also pay small fixed charges based on
subscribed demand. Consumers with time of day meters (so far there are few or
none) would be charged 1.2 times higher in the day and 0.6 times at night.
1.11 The Government has implemented a scheme to compensate households for an
estimated 75% of the household energy price increases by means of increases in
wages, pensions, unemployment benefits and welfare payments.   The amount of
compensation given to each family depends on the type of employment of family
members, whether they are unemployed, or on pension, etc.  It is independent of
the amount of energy purchased. Financing is being provided by excise taxes on
energy with most of the money coming from taxing electricity. The Government
takes the difference between the retail price and 1.1 leks per kWh for all
electricity  sales within Albania.   The April  1 tariff changes  raise  the
consumption weighted average electricity price within Albania from 1.4 leks per
kWh for the first three months of 1994 to 3.6 leks per kWh for the last nine
months of the year. Therefore, on average 2.5 leks per kWh go to the Government
as excise tax.
1.12   The Government intends to adjust the level and structure of electricity
prices over the next several years to reflect economic costs.  These range from
4.2 leks per kWh at high voltage to 6.9 leks per kWh at low voltage.'
Particular attention will be given to adjusting the prices for state consumers
to the level charged to private consumers. Refinements in the tariff structure
are expected to be made on the basis of a detailed electricity tariff study to
be carried out under EBRD's project to rehabilitate hydropower stations.

E. IDA Activities in the Energy Sector
1.13 IDA's first credit to Albania, for the Critical Imports Project, includes
financing of US$13.34 million, plus $2.64 million of parallel financing by the
Swiss Government, for urgent repairs to the Drin River hydropower stations and
the transmission and distribution systems. The power component is being carried
out successfully. As of October 1994 90% of the items had been delivered.
1.14   An Energy Sector Review was prepared in 1993. IDA managed technical
assistance for energy has included:
- a feasibility study for rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of the
power transmission and distribution systems and related dispatching
facilities (financed by Italy);
- a power subsector organization study (financed by Switzerland);
- a peat supply feasibility study (financed by Japan);
- a study of the economic feasibility of making briquettes from sawdust
(financed by the Netherlands);
- testing of stoves available in Albania (financed by the IDA Critical
Imports Project);
- estimation of the demand and sustainable supply of fuelwood (IDA
financed);
- a household energy survey (financed by the Netherlands); and
- a space heating study (financed by the Netherlands).

II. The Power Subsector
A. Past Power Consumption and Supply
2.01 Electricity demand within Albania, which had fallen by 21% between 1989 and
1992, grew by 19% in 1993 to 3318 GWh (Table 2.1). This increase in electricity
demand contrasts with the stagnant demand for other forms of energy in Albania
in 1993 (see para. 1.03). It was due mainly to demand increases by households
and small commercial enterprises, much of it illegal use of electricity, and much
of it uneconomic use (e.g., for space heating).   The increase in household
consumption was due to shortages in fuelwood and other household fuels, to
imports of large numbers of appliances from abroad, many of which were financed
by Albanians living abroad, to a belief that Albania has plenty of low-cost
electricity, to the low electricity price for household use, and to widespread
resort to illegal use of electricity. Billed household demand grew from 270 GWh
in 1989 to 774 GWh in 1993 (the increase in 1993 was 61%).  Transmission and
distribution losses grew from 11% of net generation in 1989 to 40% (1362 GWh) in
1993. Of these losses, non-technical losses (mostly illegal use by households
and other small consumers) grew from a negligible level in 1989 to an estimated
669 GWh in 1993.2  The additional household demand, which is heavily skewed
towards the hours of peak demand on the power system, explains the surge in peak
load to a record high of 720 MW in December 1993 and the fall in system load
factor from 67% in 1988-1990 to 50% in 1992 and 53% in 1993.
2.02 Over 90% of electricity generation in Albania comes from hydropower
stations. It is not surprising, therefore, that variations in water flow account
for the variations in gross generation from a high of 5083 GWh in 1986 to a low
of 3172 GWh in 1990.  Water flows at the Fierze hydropower station have been
abnormally low in every year since 1986.
2.03 Variations in water flow also explain most of the fluctuation in net
electricity exports from a high of 2134 GWh in 1986 to -206 GWh in 1990.
However, since gross generation rose in 1993, the fall in net exports from 560
GWh in 1992 to only 166 GWh in 1993 was due entirely to increased demand within
Albania.
2 Technical losses consist of energy lost in transmission and distribution
lines and transformers.   They arise from the resistance of conductors and
equipment to electrical current. Non-technical losses consist of the difference
between actual final consumption and billed consumption. Non-technical losses
arise mainly from theft, and to a lesser extent from uncalibrated and broken
meters, errors and problems with meter reading, poor invoicing and collection.

B. Existing Generating Plants
2.04   Total installed capacity is 1,650 MW, of which 1,437 MW is hydro and 213
MW is thermal (Annex 2.1).   Of the 11 hydropower stations the three largest
(Fierze 4x125 MW, Komani 4x150 MW and Vau i Dejes 5x50 MW) form a cascade on the
Drin River in northern Albania and account for more than 90% of total hydro
generation (Annex 2.2). Total hydropower capacity available in dry years (with
90% probability) is 835 MW.    Total installed thermal capacity is 213 MW in 7
plants, of which the largest are Fier (oil/gas, 159 MW) and Ballsh (oil/gas, 24
MW) (Annex 2.3). The smaller thermal power stations are used for district heat
supply. Estimates of available electric energy in Albania depend on water flows
and the shape of the demand curve over the year.   For 1994 gross expected
generation was 3,500 GWh with 90% probability, 3,800 GWh with 75% probability and
4,313 GWh with 50% probability.   Even in dry years Albania has sufficient
generating capacity to meet both peak and energy demand in Albania.
C. Existing Transmission and Distribution Facilities
2.05 The transmission system in Albania in 1993 consisted of 120 km of 400 kV
lines,  1,100 km of 220 kV,  1,180 km of 110 kV and 1,150 km of 35 kV.   The
distribution system consisted of 6,450 km of 10 kV lines, 6,120 km of 6 kV lines



- 8 -
and 31,200 km of 0.4 kV lines.   In 1993 first steps were taken with Italian
assistance to introduce the 20 kV voltage level in Tirana. The 400 and 220 kV
transmission lines appear to be strong and well balanced for meeting load demand
requirements up to the year 2000. However, the change in composition of demand
away from high-voltage industrial consumers to low-voltage household and small
commercial consumers has caused serious overloading of the 110 kV and 35 kV
systems, the 220/110 kV transformer capacities and the distribution systems in
major  load centers.   The results are excessive  losses,  voltage drops and
instability,  outages  and damage  to transformers,  cables,  meters and other
equipment. Total blackout duration in large cities was 30 days in winter 1991-92
and 4 days in winter 1992-93 through January 1993. These figures do not include
localized outages. Six hundred and fifty transformers were damaged in the winter
of 1991-92 along with 25 km of medium-voltage cable and 150 km of low-voltage
cable. Two-hundred and eighty transformers were damaged in the winter of 1992-93
up to the end of January 1993, along with 15 km of MV cable and 100 km of low-
voltage cable. The reduction in outage duration and damages in 1992-93 was due
to the relatively mild winter and the installation of new transformers with
protective devices and new medium-voltage cables.
2.06 The overloading has also contributed to an increase in technical losses in
1993 to 9.9% of net generation for transmission and 10.4% for distribution. In
a comparable efficient power system the sum of these losses would be less than
10%. Reduction in these losses in Albania will require large investments in
rehabilitation, upgrading and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution
networks.   It is envisaged that the Bank will contribute to financing these
investments in a power transmission and distribution project. The Power Loss
Reduction Project is aimed at addressing the most urgent priority, reducing non-
technical losses, although it would also reduce technical losses to the extent
that it reduces electricity demand, especially during peak periods.
D. Load Forecast
2.07 Since Albania is in transition between two fundamentally different economic
systems, the reliability of a long-run forecast of electricity demand made at
present is very low.   Further,  for Albania, unlike some other countries in
transition, the problem is made more difficult by the large swing from a 21%
reduction in demand from 1989-1992 to a 19% increase in 1993.
2.08 A second consideration is the overloading of the transmission and
distribution networks in critical load centers and a looming constraint in
generation if water flows continue to be as low as during the last seven years.
It will take some years before these constraints can be removed.
2.09 Under these circumstances, KESH is projecting that total demand within
Albania will rise to the level of available hydro and thermal power capacity in
a dry year (3500 GWh) by 1997 and be constrained by the capacity limit for
several years  thereafter.   KESH's approach does not allow for the higher
generating capacity available in years of normal and greater than normal water
flows nor for Albania becoming a net importer of electricity. This approach is
reasonable since the additional electricity would further strain the overloaded



and weakened transmission and distribution systems, thereby risking a major
breakdown.   It provides a properly conservative basis for making financial
forecasts. It also allows for the possibility that successful reduction of non-
technical electricity losses and increased electricity prices will limit demand
to the estimated supply capacity. While KESH's approach is satisfactory for the
present, a detailed forecast of demand by end-use sector will need to be made in
the near future.  Such a forecast will be prepared as part of the least-cost
power generation investment program study planned to be carried out under EBRD's
project to rehabilitate hydropower stations (see para 2.13).
E. Power Subsector Investment Program
2.10 Investment priorities in the power subsector over the next several years
include: (i) measures to reduce non-technical losses; (ii) rehabilitation of the
transmission and distribution systems; and (iii) rehabilitation of existing
hydropower stations.   Detailed feasibility studies have been carried out for
these three priorities.   The EBRD and co-financiers are expected to provide
finance for hydropower rehabilitation. The proposed Power Loss Reduction Project
would focus on non-technical loss reduction. An IDA project under preparation
would provide assistance for transmission and distribution system rehabilitation.
2.11 To prepare for future dry years when hydropower generation may become
inadequate and for growth in electricity demand, KESH will evaluate
rehabilitation of the Fier and Ballsh thermal power stations.
2.12 For the period after 1996, the Ministry of Construction envisages to resume
construction of the 2x30 MW Banja hydropower project, on which work has been
temporarily  suspended.3   The priority  of this project  in  the  least-cost
generation investment program will first need to be confirmed. KESH plans to
carry out detailed feasibility studies of new hydro projects at Bushati (2x40 MW)
on the Drin River and Tepelene (2x60 MW) on the Viosa River.
2.13 KESH is planning to prepare, with external technical assistance under
EBRD's project, a least-cost power generation investment program in order to
determine more precisely priorities for rehabilitation of existing thermal power
stations and construction of new hydro and thermal plants.
F. Investment Expenditure Forecast
2.14 An investment expenditure program was prepared by KESH and the Ministry of
Mineral and Energy Resources as part of "The Strategy for the Development of the
Electricity System in Albania for the Period 1994-96".  This program has also
been incorporated in the Government's Public Investment Program for the same
period. In 1994, KESH revised the program to take account of new estimates of
the time needed to secure financing, procure and install equipment. The revised
3 During 1993 responsibility for this project was transferred from KESH to
the Ministry of Construction.

investment program is satisfactory. The projected investments are shown in Annex
2.4.
During negotiations agreement was reached with KESH to review with IDA by
October 31 of each year, its proposed investment program for the following
five years, and take the Association's views into consideration in
finalizing this program.

III. THE BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
3.01  The Government of Albania would be the borrower.   KESH would be the
implementing agency.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government to onlend
the credit to KESH for a period of 10 years, including 4 years' grace, at
a rate equal to the yield on 10-year U. S. Treasury Bonds plus a margin of
100 basis points.   It was also agreed that KESH would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
A. KESH
3.02 KESH is a state entity under the Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources,
established in 1992 in accordance with the Law on State Entities dated July 13,
1992.  It is defined under its April 1993 statute as a vertically integrated
electricity undertaking responsible for production, transmission, distribution
and sale of electricity to consumers throughout Albania and to export markets.
KESH's organizational structure is shown in Annex 3.1.
3.03 Within KESH the operation of the production and transmission systems is
carried out by 13 regional production and transmission entities. Distribution
is carried out by 33 distribution entities, which until 1991 were separate state
entities under a different ministry.   Some large industrial consumers  are
supplied at high- voltage directly by the production and transmission entities.
In addition to electricity supply, KESH is also involved in the production and
sale of steam to industrial users.
3.04 The number of staff of KESH totals about 9,500, of whom 5,100 are employed
in the distribution entities, 3,900 in the production and transmission entities,
and the rest, some 500, in the head office in Tirana and other branches of KESH
such as the Institute of Energetics, the central workshops and the central
stores.
B. Power Subsector Reform
3.05 A Power Subsector Organization Study was carried out during 1993/94 by
Electrowatt Engineering Services Ltd of Switzerland. The main recommendations
of the final report (April 1994) include keeping for the next few years KESH as
an integrated company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution;
establishing KESH as a joint stock company under the Companies' Law; negotiating
a Memorandum of Understanding between KESH and the Ministry of Mineral and Energy
Resources designed to ensure KESH's autonomy; and preparing an Electricity Law
which would, among other things, provide for production and sale of power by
independent entities. KESH would be transformed into a commercial entity as much
like a private company as possible except that, initially at least, its shares
would be owned by the Government. There would be a major internal reorganization



- 12 -
allocating staff to five directorates and integrating the personnel of the Energy
Institute (which currently carries out planning and research for KESH) into the
Planning Directorate.   New financial,  accounting and management information
systems would be set up, with each production and distribution entity treated as
a cost center. A new computerized billing system would be established. There
are also recommendations for changes in the tariff structure.
3.06 For the long term (the period after the next two-three years) two scenarios
are considered in the study report depending on whether the Government opts for
further restructuring and privatization. In the first scenario, in which it is
assumed that KESH would continue as a vertically integrated state owned monopoly,
there would be no requirement to create an independent regulator or draft a major
new electricity law. The Memorandum of Understanding could continue to serve as
the main regulatory instrument. The only modifications recommended would be to
separate ownership from policy-making and regulation and amend the electricity
law to make the Memorandum of Understanding a statutory requirement.   This
scenario would allow for private development of new power stations on the basis
of licenses provided for under the electricity law.
3.07 The second scenario allows for unbundling of generation, transmission and
distribution to an appropriate degree and significant private ownership in one
or more of these activities.   In this scenario it is recommended to transfer
regulatory responsibility to an independent regulatory entity and create a
licensing framework with separate licences for transmission, distribution and
supply. These steps would require legislation, and could be achieved by drafting
a new regulatory law to supplement the electricity law mentioned in paragraph
3.05.
3.08 The Government has indicated a desire to move towards privatization
beginning with the distribution entities, and has invited the Bank to help it
establish a regulatory framework. This assistance will be provided as part of
preparation for the proposed power transmission and distribution project.
3.09 The proposed Power Loss Reduction Project would support other institutional
reforms recommended by the Power Subsector Organization Study. In particular, the
project would support the establishment of new financial and accounting systems
(para 4.11).   Agreements were also reached to ensure that KESH maintain a
satisfactory financial performance (para 5.17). In addition
During negotiations agreement was reached on the establishment of KESH as
a joint stock company under the Companies Law by December 1, 1995 on the
basis of statutes adopted after prior consultation with the Association.
It was agreed that the statutes would include provision for: inclusion on
the Board of Directors of users and other responsible non-government
groups; management and staff selection and pay scales to be determined by
the Board; procurement of goods and services on the basis of generally
accepted guidelines; and the necessary power to disconnect/prosecute all
clients (private and public) who do not pay their bills within a specified
period of time.



- 13 -
3.10. A number of steps are needed under Albania's laws to transform KESH into
a joint-stock company. These steps include: (i) appointment of a shareholding
ministry (Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources); (ii) determination and
valuation of assets to be vested in KESH requiring:  (a) a policy decision on
which assets and liabilities are to be transferred to KESH; (b) valuation of
these assets and liabilities and (c) a government decision to transfer the assets
and liabilities to KESH; (iii) determination of the capital structure of KESH,
which should be based on a detailed financial analysis of the company to identify
the appropriate mix of debt and equity; (iv) amendment of KESH's statute; and (v)
incorporation procedures. KESH and the Government plan to obtain financing from
sources other than the proposed project for technical assistance to carry out
these steps. However, agreement has been reached for the Bank to help identify
consultants, prepare terms of reference and help manage this technical
assistance.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01 The proposed project's objectives are to: (i) reduce non-technical losses
(mainly due to theft of electricity), thereby reducing uneconomic use of
electricity and increasing electricity revenue; and (ii) support institutional
reform and strengthening in the power subsector.
B. Project DescriRtion
4.02 The proposed project would consist of the following components: an action
plan aimed at reducing non-technical power losses; technical assistance and
training for the power loss reduction program; and support for institutional
reform and strengthening.
Action Plan for Non-technical Loss Reduction
4.03 Overall Distribution Losses. The overall annual energy losses (difference
between supplied and billed) on the KESH distribution systems have increased from
7.6% of net supplied to distribution entities in 1989 to 36.2% in 1992 and 40.5%
in 1993 (Annex 4.1). The dramatic increase in distribution losses, particularly
since the end of 1°90, was mainly due to non-technical losses (27.5% of the total
40.5%).   Virtually all of the theft of electricity is carried out by small
consumers, mainly either domestic or commercial (small shops and enterprises).
Annex 4.2 shows the energy supplied, billed and the level of losses in 1992 in
each distribution entity. Shkoder, Tirana, Elbasan, Vlore and Durres have losses
summing to 450 GWh (58%) out of the total of 770 GWh of distribution loss.
Shkoder has the greatest loss, at 72% of energy entering the network for smaller
customers; the next greatest is Vlore at 57%. The Annex shows that these five
entities are also the largest in terms of total sales and losses. The high level
of power loss not only leads to a considerable loss of revenue to KESH, but also
threatens the safety of the transmission/ distribution system and the quality of
power supply.   The non-payment for electricity also encourages excessive and
uneconomic use of electricity,  particularly for heating.   This has already
drastically reduced the energy which KESH can export, and will soon lead to an
actual electricity shortage in Albania unless the amount of electricity not paid
for is reduced. The importance of reducing non-technical losses can thus not be
over-emphasized.



- 15 -
4.04 The principal causes of non-technical losses in Albania are:
(1)   unmetered supplies due to large numbers of broken, defective and
missing meters.   Between September 1992 and July 1993, 4000 used
meters  were  received  from  Germany  and  installed.    There  are
currently around 250,000 connections (about 85,000 consumers in
villages and 165,000 consumers in cities) with broken meters,
defective meters or without meters (37% of total household
connections in Albania).   Shkoder is the worst entity, with only
half of its consumers having meters. The majority of these meters
have been broken since the beginning of 1991.
(2)   meter tampering.  The methods include:  (a) rotation of meters from
the vertical; (b) stopping the meter with a celluloid insert; (c)
stopping the meter by drilling a hole in the disk and inserting a
wire through case; (d) insertion of a horse's hair to slow the disk;
and (e) adjustment of meters internally.
(3)   external wiring alterations.  Major methods of tempering with wiring
include: (a) shorting out the meter; (b) reverse running of the
meter; and (c) disconnecting of the voltage coil of the meter.
(4)   illegal connections.   These are often made by connections to a
transformer  substation,   junction  box,   lighting  circuits  in
stairwells or to overhead conductors.   Frequently, only a single
wire is used with earth return.
(5)   the existing system for monitoring losses per substation area is
almost completely inoperative due to the fact that many meters on
low voltage transformer substations are missing or damaged.
(6)   incorrect meter reading and billing deficiencies.
(7)   institutional and organizational weaknesses in dealing with power
theft.
4.05 A survey of registered consumers in Tirana, Elbasan, Korce and Kavaje
commenced in October 1993.  A survey of consumers in the rest of the country
began in January 1994. Based on the first survey, the estimated breakdown of
percentage losses classified by principal causes in the five major distribution
entities is shown in Annex 4.3.
4.06 Non-technical Loss Reduction Action Plan. An Action Plan for non-technical
loss reduction would be implemented under the proposed project (Annex 4.4,
Attachment 1). The Action Plan covers the period 1994-1997. The objective of
the Action Plan is to improve KESH's commercial operations, so it can:   (a)
reduce non-technical losses in the five major distribution systems (Tirana,
Shkoder, Elbasan, Vlore, and Durres, including both the city and the surrounding
rural area) with the highest power losses, to an acceptable level within 3 years;
(b) bill all customers on time; and (c) provide higher quality customer service.



- 16 -
4.07 The Action Plan has been structured so that it covers not only the five
major distribution systems but also the rest of Albania. Overall loss reduction
targets are set for these five areas and the rest of Albania (Annex 4.4,
Attachment 1, para. 6). By the end of 1997 their non-technical losses would be
drastically reduced. After 1997 KESH would continue the loss reduction program
to achieve and maintain a nation-wide non-technical power loss level of no more
than of 5% of net supply by year 2000.
4.08 The following major actions are included in the Action Plan:
(1)   institutional and organizational aspects, including creating a Loss
Reduction Management Unit in KESH (para. 4.20) and strengthening the
Electricity Inspectorate. The Law (Annex 4.5) setting up the
Inspectorate placed it under the Ministry of Mineral and Energy
Resources in December 1992.   The Inspectorate is responsible for
enforcing the existing legislation, with the aim of   increasing
compliance  with  the rules  by electricity users.    At present,
coordination between the Inspectorate and Distribution Entities is
inadequate. The service is under-resourced, facilities available to
the inspectors are very limited, and their authority needs to be
strengthened. Actions would include:
(a)   government support actions include treating electricity theft
as a crime, providing for police support to the electricity
inspectors   when  needed,   transferring   the   Electricity
Inspectorate from the Ministry to KESH and permitting KESH to
keep the fines collected from consumers to cover the costs;
(b)   doubling of the number of inspectors, with new inspectors to
be  recruited  where   feasible   from  within  KESH,   and
reorganization into two sections: a headquarters section which
would report to the Executive Director of KESH and inspect and
audit actions of the distribution entity inspectors.
Distribution entity inspectors would report solely to the
directors of the respective entities.  Job descriptions for
meter readers, electricians and inspectors would be clearly
defined;
(c)   equipping  of each  major  inspection  team with  a service
vehicle, a portable radio system for emergency communication,
a leakage clamp meter for detecting tampering with wiring and
illegal connections, and a camera for obtaining photographic
evidence.
(2)   installation and calibration of household meters.   The metering
system is a crucial area where improvements are vital for the
success of the non-technical  loss reduction program.   Specific
measures would include:
(a)   installing 115,000 new meters and low voltage current limiters
within three years (priority areas for meters are the five



- 17 -
distribution systems with the highest losses).   The meter,
limiter and terminal block would be enclosed in a plastic case
with a sophisticated seal to discourage tampering;
(b)   installing new kWh and maximum demand meters and current
transformers on all transformer incomers, and installing
meters on outgoing feeders with suspected high losses;
(c)   establishing a meter maintenance unit at KESH headquarters in
charge of all meter calibration and repair.   Upgrading of
meter testing, calibration and repair facilities at major
distribution  entities,   and   implementing   a  systematic
recalibration program for meters.
(3)   improvement of consumer services management.
(a)   completing a consumer survey and establishing a consumer
database in each entity with a single file on each consumer;
issuing a contract (Annex 4.6) to each consumer which would
specify the liability of the consumer for damage to his meter,
and his responsibility to prevent and report electricity theft
and the penalties to be applied in case of abuse; 4
(b)   strengthening control and inspection of consumer installation
metering systems:   (i) all meter readers would be given a
short course on proper meter reading and on recognizing the
various types of meter tampering and obvious signs of wiring
irregularities; (ii) a procedure would be established whereby
meter readers and electricians would report suspect consumers
to inspectors, and inspectors would follow up, with police
backing where necessary; (iii) monitoring systems would be
reinstalled to monitor losses by substation area and by
feeder; (iv) there would be an increased frequency of
inspections of consumer installations and meters giving
special  attention  to  finding  and  eliminating  illegal
connections;   (v) a reward system would be introduced to
provide incentives to distribution entities to achieve loss
reduction targets; (vi) improvements would be made in rural
area metering, billing and collection procedures; and (vii)
low-voltage consumers without meters would be billed on the
basis of average low-voltage consumption in the distribution
entity until the time when new meters are installed;
(c)   a continuing publicity campaign would be established using
television, radio, brochures and pamphlets, newspapers and
posters to emphasize that electricity is not a free good or a
right, but has to be paid for, and that electricity theft,
4 Consumer contracts were first introduced in late 1991. By June 1993, 43%
of consumers had contracts.



- 18 -
meter and wiring tampering and illegal connections would have
serious consequences.
4.09  The proposed assistance  to carry out the Action Plan5 would finance
household meters, meter testing, calibration and repair facilities, computer
hardware and software for improved accounting, radios, transport and other
equipment for electricity inspectors and technical assistance.   Because of
resource constraints the new metering and associated equipment for KESH under the
proposed project would suffice for only the above five major distribution
systems.
4.10. The  Government  has  amended  the  Act  establishing  the  Electricity
Inspectorate to transfer the Electricity Inspectorate to KESH (Annex 4.5), and
permit KESH to keep fifty percent of the penalties collected from consumers, and
assure  police  support  to  the  electricity  inspectors  when  needed.    KESH
established a Loss Reduction Management Unit on April 17, 1994 as agreed, and the
staffing of the Unit is satisfactory.
During negotiations agreement was reached with KESH to: (a) carry out the
non-technical loss reduction project in accordance with the Action Plan
and time schedule agreed with IDA; (b) provide additional resources where
necessary, including additional staff, to carry out the action plan; and
(c) exchange views with IDA on progress, analysis of results, evaluation
of implementation, proposed adjustments to the program and any other items
considered relevant.
Technical Assistance for Power Loss Reduction
4.11    Experts would be required to assist with the metering and loss reduction
program.   Terms of reference for expert services are included in Annex 4.4,
Attachment II. They cover the following. (a) Management and Organization Expert
(3 person-months).   The main duties of the Management and Organization Expert
would be to advise and assist KESH in carrying out the 'Institutional and
Organizational' and 'Consumer Services Management' aspects of the Action Plan,
especially to review the existing consumer manual database at the distribution
entities and recommend improvements, and set up feedback systems to be used by
meter   readers   and   electricians   when   they   report   meter/installation
irregularities. (b) Metering Expert (5 person-months). The main duties of the
Metering Expert would be to advise and assist KESH in carrying out the metering
aspects of the Action Plan, particularly to review technical specifications
prepared by KESH and evaluation of bids for combined meter/limiter units, current
5 The  associated  topic  of  the  reduction  of  technical  losses  in
transmission/distribution system is not covered specifically by the Action Plan.
However, the load limiters included with the meters would, by limiting maximum
demand, reduce technical as well as non-technical losses. Further reduction of
technical losses is needed, but it would require substantial investment, and,
therefore will be covered under separate projects.

transformers, and meter calibration equipment, and to run training programs for
the trainers of the meter readers, inspectors and installation and maintenance
electricians. (c) Publicity Campaign Expert (2 person-months). The main duties
of this expert would be to assist KESH in carrying out the publicity campaign.
In particular, this would comprise assistance in the design, organization, script
and production of mini TV and radio series, brochures and pamphlets for delivery
by meter readers, and poster campaigns.
Institutional Reform and Strengthening
4.12. KESH would convert to a joint stock company under the project (para. 3.09).
Expert accounting assistance is being provided under separate financing to help
KESH to modernize its financial and management accounting systems to comply with
the new Albanian accounting law, and to be consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles, standards, and practices (Annex 4.4, Attachment III).6
This includes implementing an internal control system, and adopting other
necessary measures that would enable KESH to obtain an unqualified opinion on its
financial statements from an international auditor.   Thirteen man-months of
external expertise are being provided to implement an operational accounting
system. The consultants have expertise in (i) computerized accounting systems,
(ii) audit requirements and procedures, and (iii) financial accounting and
managerial accounting requirements of power utilities. Local expert assistance
is being used to ensure compliance with the new Albanian law.   The project
includes computer hardware and software needed for the new financial and
accounting systems.
C. Cost Estimates
4.13 The estimated cost of the proposed project, including contingencies but
excluding interest during construction, is about US$8.2 million, of which about
US$7.5 million equivalent in foreign exchange and about US$0.7 million equivalent
in local cost. The estimated cost of the project is summarized in Table 4.1. The
cost estimates reflect end-1993 prices and are based on the latest tendering
information available for similar equipment in Europe, Asia and North America.
Physical contingencies are calculated at 5% for both foreign and local costs.
Price escalation is calculated according to anticipated international price
movements of 3.0% for 1994, 1.5% for 1995, 1.8% for 1996 and 2.6% for 1997.
Detailed estimates of project costs are provided in Annex 4.7.
6 US$143,000 from the Swiss Trust Fund for studies is being provided for
financing the expert accounting assistance.

4.15 The proposed IDA Credit of $5 million would be used to meet about 61
percent of the total project cost, or about 67 percent of the foreign exchange
requirements. The credit would finance the following components:
(a)   household single phase meters and limiters;
(b)   radio communication systems, and other instruments for electricity
inspectors; and
(c)   microbuses for inspectors.
4.16 The proposed Swiss fund of $2.5 million equivalent would be used to
finance:
(a)   single phase meters and current limiters for commercial customers;
(b)   meter test consoles, calibrating and repair equipment;
(c)   three phase meters, current limiters and current transformers;
(d)   computer hardware and software for prototype accounting system; and
(e)   technical assistance.
E. Procurement
4.17 The proposed IDA Credit would finance about 67% of the foreign cost for the
purchase of goods and services. The procurement arrangements are summarized in
Table 4.3. The bulk of the equipment for the proposed project (mainly household
single phase meters and current limiters) would be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines.
Contracts for small amounts (microbuses and radio communication systems for
inspectors), and miscellaneous items, (such as special tools and instruments,
personal computers, and cameras) estimated at US$110,000 or less per contract,
up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$250,000 (or five percent of the
credit) would be procured through international shopping (IS) procedures
requiring price quotations from at least three suppliers from at least three
member countries. Prior review by the Bank of procurement documentation would
be required for ICB contracts, representing 97 percent of the credit.   Bank
standard bidding documents for procurement of goods would be used. Swiss grant
funds would be used to procure hardware and software for an improved accounting
system, meters and meter testing and repair equipment and technical assistance
for the non-technical loss reduction program, following procedures set out by the
Government of Switzerland. These procedures are satisfactory in terms of economy
and efficiency. A more detailed procurement plan and schedule are shown in Annex
4.4, Attachment IV.

4.18 KESH will be responsible for procurement following IDA Procurement
Guidelines for contracts financed by IDA, including preparing specifications,
issuing bidding documents, evaluating bids, conducting international shopping,
negotiating and signing contract agreements, and taking delivery of goods. To
strengthen KESH procurement capabilities, technical assistance from a metering
expert will be provided for assisting on reviewing of technical specifications
and evaluation of bids for combined meter/limiter units, current transformers and
meter calibration equipment.
F. Status of Project Preparation
4.19   For non-technical loss reduction, the issues and actions to be taken were
investigated in the "Albania Power Sector Organization Study", prepared by
Electrowatt Engineering Services Ltd. of Switzerland, under terms of reference
agreed with IDA.   Based on a detailed review of the Study,  the Power Loss
Reduction Action Plan has been elaborated and agreed on with KESH. Technical
specifications and the bidding document for the largest package (household
meters) for the power loss reduction program have been prepared by KESH with
consultant assistance, and reviewed by the Bank. The bidding process for this
package is in progress.
G. Project Implementation
4.20  Overall management of the implementation of the Power Loss Reduction
Action Plan and technical assistance and training would be carried out by KESH
who would be responsible for their execution, including procurement and
disbursement of funds. It has the organization and staff required for project
implementation. The Implementation Plan is shown in Annex 4.4. To strengthen
project management, KESH has established a Loss Reduction Management Unit (LRMU)
directed by the Vice Technical Director. The LRMU consists of the Distribution
Director (Chairman), the Chief Inspector, the Billing Economist (each with a
full-time assisting officer responsible for day-to-day management), and charged
with coordinating, supervising and monitoring the execution of the Action Plan,
with assistance of consultants. KESH will ensure that LRMU related activities
and independent functions within KESH organization are integrated effectively.
The five distribution entities would carry out meter installation and consumer
contract management, inspections of consumer service installations, rectify
irregularities, prepare invoices for unbilled consumption where such was
detected, and make disconnections for non-payment.   The Inspectorate and its
inspectorate teams would carry out sanctions for theft of electricity. While the
LRMU exercises control over all program related activities, it would receive
cross-support from other KESH departments in selected areas, such as procurement,
technical support, legal matters, budgeting, accounting, disbursement and cost
control,  scheduling,  manpower  allocation,  and  operational  support.    The
organization chart for implementation of the Action Plan is set out in Annex 4.4,
Attachment V.



- 24 -
H. Disbursement
4.21  The IDA Credit would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign expenditures
for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a CIF basis. In-land
transportation and installation would be covered by KESH. Disbursement for the
Credit would be made against full documentation except that expenditures
pertaining to contracts for goods and technical assistance of less than US$50,000
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures.   Documentation
supporting such expenditures would be retained in the KESH headquarters office
and made available for review by the IDA's supervision mission.
4.22  Annex 4.11 presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA Credit.
IDA's standard disbursement profile would not be observed as this is a three-year
time bound project; most of the contracts would be placed in 1994 and 1995 and
delivery completed in 1996. The Credit would be disbursed over a period of about
three years, to permit payment of the invoices and liquidation of the contracts.
The IDA Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1997, and the
closing date would be December 31, 1997.
I. Environmental Aspects
4.23   Since the installation of meters and the organization and management
changes proposed under the project would have no impacts on the environment, the
project has been placed in Category C, implying that an environmental impact
assessment would not be required.
J. Monitoring and Reporting
4.24  KESH would furnish to the Bank regular half yearly project progress
reports by July 31 and January 31 of each year supplemented by brief reports to
be submitted by April 30 and October 31 each year. These reports would include
information on progress of procurement activities and project implementation,
identify any problem areas and indicate remedial action.   Furthermore,  an
Implementation Completion Report would be submitted by KESH to the Bank no later
than six months after completion of the project. The timely implementation of
the project critically depends on adequate financial resources being made
available when needed. For this reason, an annual financing plan for the project
would be furnished to the Bank no later than the third quarter of the previous
year. The scope and content of the project progress reports were discussed and
agreed on during negotiations (Annex 4.4, Attachment VI).

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. The Accounting and Auditing Framework
5.01  Until recently, Albanian industry was not exposed to even basic accounting
and auditing principles and practices as understood in most market based
economies, although it had a recording system which served the needs of its
former command economy. Financial, accounting, and auditing skills, in general,
are extremely scarce, and even those that are available have been attracted to
better paying private sector jobs. Financial reporting requirements are also
weak. Under the old accounting law, KESH was required to produce a single annual
financial statement, which was somewhat similar to a balance sheet.  It was not
required to produce an income statement, or a funds flow statement. The practice
of having financial statements audited by independent external auditors does not
exist.   To date,  none of the well known international auditing firms has
established an office in Albania, although some of them have expressed interest
in working there.
5.02  The Albanian Government has recently passed a new accounting law, which
would require Albanian companies to present their financial statements on the
basis of new formats which are similar to financial statements prepared under
generally accepted accounting principles.   Under the new Albanian law, which
became effective on January 1, 1994, a chart of accounts similar to the French
chart of accounts has been adopted. For 1994 and thereafter, entities would be
required to present a balance sheet and an income statement. There is, however,
no requirement to produce a funds flow statement. The new law is expected to
improve the quality of financial information in Albania, but its implementation
is not expected to be easy, as Albanian accountants would have to be trained in
new accounting concepts and procedures, and this will take some time.
5.03  To address the shortcomings of the existing accounting and auditing
framework at KESH, technical assistance is being provided, with financing from
the Swiss Trust Fund, for improvement of the financial and accounting systems of
the entity.  The Terms of Reference are in Annex 4.4 (Attachment III).  This
assistance will enable KESH to train its personnel in modern accounting concepts
and procedures, and implement an accounting system that will be consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles.   The technical assistance includes
training to establish an effective internal control system, including the
strengthening of KESH's internal audit function. The proposed project provides
for introduction of annual audits of KESH's financial statements by an
independent auditor, acceptable to IDA.
5.04  During negotiations,  agreement was reached that,  as a part  of the
reporting requirements of IDA, KESH would establish and maintain separate
project related accounts, to be operational from commencement of project
implementation.  KESH also agreed to prepare financial statements on a
quarterly and an annual basis. Inter alia, this would include an income
statement,  balance  sheet,  and a funds  flow statement.   The annual
financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow



- 26 -
statement) would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA.
The audited financial statements, along with the opinion of the auditor
would be presented to IDA within six months after the end of the fiscal
year. The first audit would be for the calendar year 1995. As part of
the audit, the auditors would review the adequacy of the internal controls
of KESH, and recommend improvements.   The auditors would also provide
opinions on the project accounts, statements of expenditure, and
compliance  of KESH with all  covenants  agreed with  IDA.   Unaudited
quarterly financial statements would be provided to the Bank within two
months of the end of the quarter. KESH agreed to appoint an independent
auditor, acceptable to IDA, as soon as practicable but in no event later
than July 1, 1995.
B. Billing System
5.05   Electricity billing is done manually.  Typically in cities, for example
Tirana, meters are read on a monthly basis in the second half of the month, the
bill is handed directly to the consumer by the meter reader, the consumer is
required to pay by the end of the next month at a regional office (there are 11
in Tirana), payment is predominantly by cash, a fee of 1% of the amount due per
day of delay is imposed for late payment, and the customer is disconnected after
three months  of non-payment.    In rural areas meter  reading,  billing and
collection is the responsibility of the electricians. The electricians bring the
money collected to the payment offices on a monthly basis.
5.06  The urban billing system is simple and straightforward.  Its defects are
largely due to lack of a consistent and comprehensive database and
computerization.   The possibilities of carrying out controls and retrieving
information for management purposes are very limited. There is room for error in
copying data manually and for irregularities in registering meter readings. The
system controls only the electricity billed, but not the connections. There have
been complaints of long lines at payment offices particularly when payment
deadlines approach.
5.07  The rural billing system is unsatisfactory as there is no way that the
electricity billed and the total sum collected can be controlled efficiently.
The source of the problem appears to be the disappearance of the rural
cooperatives following the political changes in 1991. They used to function as
rural payment offices by collecting the electricity bills from consumers.
5.08  Under  the  action  plan  to  reduce  non-technical  losses  (Annex  4.4,
Attachment I), a single file will be created on each consumer. All core consumer
data and information, including information on work carried out for the consumer,
will be recorded in the file by all parties (e.g., meter readers, inspectors and
electricians).   The data will be eventually transferred to a computer-based
monitoring system and used to identify changes in consumption patterns, thereby
highlighting the consumer for further investigation. At the same time KESH is
embarking on a pilot scheme to introduce a computerized billing system in Tirana.
For rural areas, the action plan specifies special billing procedures to be
established, with the proposed involvement of communal authorities.

C. Past and Current Financial Performance
5.09  Considering that reliable financial information is not available for the
previous years, it was not possible to conduct a thorough financial statement
analysis based on financial data of several years, as is normally done. The most
recent year for which reasonably accurate data could be made available was 1992.
For 1992 and 1993, KESH, with assistance from its consultant, Electrowatt, has
reorganized its financial information to create an income statement, a balance
sheet, and a funds flow statement. These statements have been constructed from
KESH's records, discussions with staff of KESH, and best estimates of KESH and
Electrowatt, based on their knowledge of similar utility companies in other
countries. The figures presented in these statements are estimates at best, and
would not stand up to the scrutiny to an audit conducted under generally accepted
auditing standards. These statements have been reviewed by the Bank mission, and
they appear reasonable under the circumstances, and have been used as the basis
for analyzing the existing financial position of KESH. In the judgment of KESH
and Electrowatt, and with which the mission agreed, it was not possible to create
similar statements for years prior to 1992, because many of the distribution
entities were not part of KESH, and, further, the records maintained by these
entities as well as KESH were for the purposes of a centrally planned economy,
and this information was not adequate to prepare financial statements.
5.10  On the basis of the 1992 income statement mentioned above, the total
revenue for the year was estimated at 3,602 million leks, of which 1,384 million
leks (38 percent) was generated from export of electricity (Annex 5.1). Total
expenses before interest and taxes amounted to 2,121 million leks, leaving an
operating income of 1,481 million leks, or 41 percent of total revenue, which is
high in comparison with other electric power companies, especially when one
considers the low average price of 0.90 leks ($0.009) per kWh of electricity that
KESH received in 1992. With such a low tariff, one could reasonably expect an
operating loss, even if the electric utility is an efficient low cost producer.
The reasons that KESH could show an operating profit are: (i) fuel costs are low
and mostly for production of steam for industry since nearly all electricity is
hydropower; (ii) interest charges are non-existent since investments prior to
1992 were not financed by borrowing; and (iii) the capital costs of KESH are
highly undervalued, and, as a result, the depreciation expense charged to the
income statement is unrealistically low. Capital costs appear to be undervalued
because they have not been adjusted to reflect the devaluation of the Lek against
major currencies in recent years.  Based on Electrowatt estimates, if capital
assets of KESH are appropriately valued, the depreciation expense could increase
fifteen fold; i.e., from 159 million leks to about 2,400 million leks.  This
would completely wipe out the operating profit of KESH, and put it in an
operating loss position.
5.11 Another problem faced by KESH is its increasing arrears. At the end of
1992, total accounts receivable were 1,524 million leks, or 42 percent of KESH's
annual revenue of 3,602 million leks. This implies that, on average, KESH took
over 5 months to collect its bills. In the case of certain industrial users in
Albania, this period was much longer. In 1993, receivables increased to 1,741
million leks, which was about 42Z of the annual revenue of 4,100 million leks.



- 28 -
Because some of these receivables will never be realized by KESH, and would have
to be written off, the actual net income of KESH will be considerably lower than
what is shown in its income statement. As many of KESH's customers with arrears
are other government agencies, KESH has not been able to disconnect their
services even when bills have not been paid for months. This arrears problem is
being addressed through improved billing and accounting systems, and through a
recent government policy decision to allow KESH to disconnect services to
customers that are delinquent in payment of their bills.
During negotiations, it was agreed that KESH would take the necessary
steps to reduce its average accounts receivables to two months of sales.
5.12  At the end of 1993, KESH had total assets valued at 10,686 million leks.
Against this, the equity and liability side of the balance sheet consisted of
1,451 million leks of current liabilities, 1,259 million leks of long-term debt
157 million leks of provisions, and 7,819 million leks of equity. The short-term
liabilities consist mainly of accounts payable to creditors and taxes due to the
Government.  KESH has not been able to pay the Government and its suppliers on
time, because of the liquidity problem that it faces as a result of the delays
in collections from its customers, as discussed earlier. Compared to its total
capitalization,  KESH has a low level of long-term liabilities,  and could
therefore finance some of its future investments through long-term loans from
international institutions like IDA and the EBRD.   Its local cost investment
would, however, have to be financed through its internal cash generation, as
there is no domestic market for long-term financing, and the Government would be
unable to provide additional equity, due to its own budget constraints.  This
would mean that KESH would need to increase electricity prices in a manner that
would enable it to cover from its internal cash generation all investment costs
that are not financed through foreign borrowing or grants.
5.13  Key financial figures for 1992 and 1993 (in million leks) are presented

D. Financial Projections
5.14  One of the objectives  of the project is to safeguard the financial
soundness of KESH for the future, so that appropriate power generation,
transmission and distribution facilities can be maintained in the country. As
discussed earlier, electricity tariffs are considerably below cost, and this
means that KESH would continue to remain dependent on government financing in
order to maintain its existing facilities. Because of the shortage of investable
funds, KESH has postponed several necessary investments. Even if multilateral
and bilateral funding can be obtained to partially finance the investment program
shown in Annex 2.4, it is expected that at least half of the investments would
need to be financed through internal cash generation. Internal cash generation
can only be increased in two ways: either through reduction of operating
expenses,  or increase in revenues.   Since the scope for cost reduction is
limited, revenues would have to be increased to generate funds to support KESH's
investment program.
5.15  Financial projections (Annex 5.2) have been prepared on the assumption
that electricity prices net of excise tax are increased to permit KESH to cover
50% of investment costs.7  The remaining capital costs would be financed through
borrowing at about 7% nominal interest. Labor costs are expected to increase in
real terms at 20 percent per year from 1994 to 1996, and at 10 percent in 1997
and 1998. Thereafter they will keep pace with inflation, which has been assumed
at 10% per year. Fuel costs, which are currently priced at international levels,
are also expected to remain constant in real terms.
5.16  Based on these assumptions and the investment expenditure program in Annex
2.4, in order to achieve an average self-financing ratio of about 50 percent,
KESH would have to increase the average domestic electricity price net of excise
tax from 1.1 leks per kWh as of April 1, 1994 to 3 leks per kWh in 1996 and 4
leks per kWh in 1999.
7 Excise tax revenues were projected by KESH to rise from 898 million leks
in 1993 to 4,220 million leks in 1994.



- 30 -
5.17  During negotiations, agreement was reached that KESH would take all
necessary steps to ensure that: (i) internally generated annual cash
surplus will be at least 50X of the three year moving average capital
investment requirements of KESH; (ii) the debt/equity ratio of KESH would
be maintained at 1.5 or lower; and (iii) the debt service coverage of KESH
would be 2.0 or higher. By October 31 of each year KESH would provide to
IDA its forecast income statement, balance sheet and funds flow statement
for the following year to indicate whether these targets would be met. The
Government would take all actions to enable KESH to achieve these
financial targets, including but not limited to raising electricity
prices.
The projections indicate that, provided electricity tariffs are increased to
ensure compliance with the first condition, compliance with debt/equity covenant,
and the debt service covenant would be achieved without difficulty.

VI. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Relation to Policy Objectives
6.01  The  overall  objectives  of  the  power  subsector  are  to:  (i)  limit
electricity consumption to uses which are economic; (ii) ensure an adequate,
reliable, least-cost and environmentally benign supply; and (iii) restructure and
strengthen the subsector entities to enable them to be efficient and financially
autonomous and viable. The proposed project is the most urgent next step towards
realizing these objectives for the following reasons.   (i) It would directly
contribute to reducing uneconomic demand. (ii) It would indirectly contribute
to the same goal by serving as a prerequisite for increasing electricity prices
towards economic costs.   Unless illegal electricity use is controlled,  the
beneficial effect of price increases would be negated by increased electricity
theft. (iii) It would provide increased revenue for power investments and help
ensure the financial autonomy of KESH.   The institutional component of the
Project would contribute to increasing KESH's autonomy and commercialization
leading to possible future private involvement.
B. Economic Rate of Return
6.02  Reduction in non-technical losses would entail (i) conversion of some of
the unbilled consumption to billed consumption and (ii) reduction in consumption.
The first would result in a financial benefit to KESH, but from an economic point
of view it involves only a redistribution of income from consumers to KESH. Only
the second would result in genuine economic benefits, in the form of a cost
saving, and better supply quality and lower technical losses because of reduced
overloading of facilities. The cost saving is the only benefit considered in the
calculation of the economic rate of return. Moreover, it is considered only for
the five cities for which meters would be supplied.  Benefits attributable to
implementation of the Action Plan in the rest of the country were excluded. It
may be suggested that the meters, which account for nearly all of the cost of the
proposed Project, provide a benefit of their own since they would be needed even
if there were no non-technical losses.   However, many of the new meters are
needed to replace meters which were deliberately damaged by consumers as a means
to avoid paying for electricity.   To the extent that the destruction of the
meters was caused by the non-technical loss phenomenon, their replacement should
not be assigned any other benefit, except to the extent that the replaced meters
are better. No account was taken of this last benefit in the rate of return
calculation, nor of the benefit attributable to meters that would be given to
consumers who have had none up to now.
6.03.   The benefit from the reduction in demand is equal to the economic cost
saving attributable to the reduction minus consumers' willingness to pay for that
quantity. The proportion of the non-technical losses projected to be eliminated
which would take the form of demand reduction was estimated using an assumed
price elasticity of demand and the difference between the projected electricity
price for household use and the expected fine plus payment for previously unpaid
electricity per kWh imposed on an illegal consumer in the absence of the project.



- 32 -
The household price for marginal consumption was assumed to rise to the economic
cost of 6.9 leks per kWh by 1996. The expected fine plus payment for previously
unpaid electricity was estimated to be only 0.02 leks per kWh on the basis of
experience in 1993. A price elasticity of demand was selected equal to -0.02.
This is well below empirical estimates made for other countries, but those
estimates were mostly obtained by measuring the effects of relatively small price
changes whereas for present purposes the elasticity was applied to a relatively
very large price change. When applied to the projected price gap it results in
an estimate of 11% of the eliminated non-technical losses taking the form of
demand reduction. This is considered to be a conservative estimate. Consumers'
willingness to pay was estimated as the area under the demand curve having the -
0.02 elasticity over the range of the demand reduction. It is equal to 14.5% of
the economic cost of a quantity equal to the demand reduction.
6.04. The cost of the non-technical loss reduction program was taken as the
investment cost plus technical assistance needed for implementation of the Action
Plan. The operating costs associated with implementation of the program, mainly
in the form of salaries of the inspectors, were excluded since, on the basis of
experience in 1993, these costs were less than the value of the fines collected.
The detailed calculation of the economic rate of return is shown in Annex 6.1.
6.05.  The economic rate of return was estimated to be 21%.  Sensitivity tests
were carried out with respect to changes in: the quantity of non-technical losses
that would be reduced by the project, the price elasticity of demand and the
investment cost. The changes in the values of these parameters needed to reduce
the rate of return to 12% (equal to the estimated social discount rate) are as
follows:
30% shortfall in meeting the non-technical loss reduction target; or
30% reduction in the absolute value of the price elasticity; or
40% increase in the investment cost.
C. Risks
6.06  One risk would be a failure to provide the personnel needed to implement
the action plan on schedule.   To minimize this risk the tasks have been
identified in considerable detail with many monitorable time-bound targets, and
KESH would be assured of sufficent funds to employ the necessary personnel. The
additional revenue from converting non-technical electricity losses to billed
sales provides an incentive to make sure that the program is successful.   A
second risk is that the inspectors would be prevented from entering consumers'
premises or bribed to not report electricity theft. To minimize this risk the
inspectors have been given the right by law to have access to the meters, they
are being transferred to the direct control of KESH, the Government would provide
police support if necessary, an improved customer file system would make it
easier to detect irregularities, and local inspectors would be cross-checked by
inspectors from KESH headquarters. A third risk is that consumers would break
the new meters. To reduce this risk each customer would be made responsible for
his or her meter and customers without meters would be billed anyway. A fourth
risk is that customers would not pay their bills. This risk would be minimized



- 33 -
by disconnecting customers in arrears. A final risk is that the program would
not achieve public acceptance. To minimize this risk a publicity campaign would
emphasize the benefit of reduced overloading of electrical facilities resulting
from the program.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01   During credit negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(A)    With the Government:
(i)     to onlend the credit to KESH for a period of 10 years, including
4 years' grace, at a rate equal to the yield on 10-year U.S.
Treasury Bonds plus a margin of 100 basis points; the foreign
exchange risk would be borne by KESH (para. 3.01);
(ii)    on the establishment of KESH as a joint stock company under the
Companies Law by December 1, 1995 on the basis of statutes
adopted after prior consultation with the Association. It was
agreed that the statutes would include provision for: inclusion
on the Board of Directors of users and other responsible non-
government groups; management and staff selection and pay scales
to be determined by the Board; procurement of goods and services
on the basis of generally accepted guidelines; and the necessary
power to disconnect/prosecute all clients (private or public) who
do not pay their bills within a specified period of time (para.
3.08);
(iii)   to take any measures necessary,  including raising electricity
prices, to enable KESH to achieve the agreed financial targets
(para. 5.17).
(B) With KESH:
(i)     to  review  with  IDA  by  October  of  each  year  its  proposed
investment program for the following five years, and take the
Association's views into consideration in finalizing this program
(para. 2.14);
(ii)    to  carry  out  the  non-technical  loss  reduction  project  in
accordance with an agreed action plan and time schedule (para.
4.10);
(iii)   to  provide  additional  resources  where  necessary,  including
additional staff, to carry out the action plan (para. 4.10);
(iv)    to exchange views with IDA on progress,  analysis of results,
evaluation of implementation, proposed adjustments to the program
and any other items considered necessary (para 4.10);



- 35 -
(v)     to maintain separate project accounts and prepare on a quarterly
and annual basis an income statement, a balance sheet and a flow
of funds statement (para. 5.04);
(vi)    to arrange for audit of the annual financial statements and the
project accounts by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA; the
audited financial statements and project accounts would be
presented to IDA no later than six months after the end of the
financial year; the first audit would be for 1995 (para 5.04);
(vii)   to appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, by July 1,
1995;
(viii)  to reduce average accounts receivable to two months of sales or
less (para. 5.11); and
(ix)    to ensure that: (a) the internally generated cash surplus would
be at least 50% of the three year moving average capital
requirements of KESH; (b) the debt-equity ratio is maintained at
1.5 or less; and (c) debt service coverage would be 2.0 or higher
(para. 5.17.
Recommendation
7.02  With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the proposed project
would be suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 3.4 million (US$5 million equivalent)
under standard IDA terms, with 40 year term, to the Government of Albania.

POWER LOSS REDUCTION PROJECT
POWER LOSS REDUCTION ACTION PLAN
1.0  INTRODUCTION
This Plan is concerned with the reduction of non-technical losses (electricity which is
used but is not billed), which are extremely large in Albania. These losses cause a
serious reduction in KESH's income and so threaten its future investment program,
both from the point of view of internal and of foreign financing. The non-payment
for electricity also encourages excessive and inappropriate use of electricity,
particularly for heating. This has already drastically reduced the energy which KESH
can export, and will soon lead to an actual electricity shortage in Albania unless the
amount of electricity not paid for is reduced. The importance of reducing non-
technical losses can thus not be over-emphasized. The Action Plan covers the period
1994-1997.
The associated topic of the reduction of technical losses in electricity transmission and
distribution is not covered specifically by the Action Plan, though the load limiters are
included with the meters should decrease load, and hence losses. Reduction of
technical losses is also of major importance, but distribution and transmission
improvements require major investment (though less than installing new generation
capacity).
The Action Plan is divided into the following aspects:
- Institutional and Organizational
- Consumer Services Management and Procedures
- Metering
- Rural Billing and Collection
- Overall Loss Reduction Targets
- Progress Review.
The provision of new equipment, both metering and for the Inspectorate is concen-
trated on the following five cities and surrounding rural areas, which together
accounted for 60% of the energy losses in 1992:
- Tirana
- Shkoder
- Elbasan
- Durres
- Vlore.



ANNEX 4.4
Attachment I
- 50 -                   Page2 of 14
Overall loss reduction targets are set for these five areas and the rest of Albania, for
the period mid-1994 to mid-1997, by the end of which their non-technical losses are
expected to be drastically reduced. Targets are also set for the year 2000, by when it
is assumed equipment improvements will have taken place in all the other entities,
although not part of this immediate Action Plan. To achieve these targets, actions are
required by both the Government and KESH.
2.0   INSTITUTONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS
2.1   Inspectorate of Electricity
- Cooperation and coordination of Inspectorate and Distribution Entities is not adequate.
- Internal structure and reporting of Inspectorate is not clear.
-  Financing of Inspectorate is inadequate.
- Inspectorate is under-resourced (personnel and equipment).
- Inspectorate is not readily identifiable (i.e., uniformed).
- Inadequate police support.
- Law for Inspectorate is inadequate and not being adequately enforced.
- Insufficient number and size of penalties being imposed.
Actions
KESH responsibility:
- Inspectorate to be under responsibility of KESH.
- Reorganize Inspectorate into two sections:
Headquarters section reports to Executive Director of KESH and inspects and audits
actions of Distribution Entity inspectors. Distribution Entity inspectors report solely
to the Directors of entities.
- Prepare job descriptions for Inspectors and Meter Readers, both in KESH H.Q. and
KESH's Distribution Entities.
- Increase number of personnel (see 3.5).
- Procure equipment for Inspectorate in five target areas (Tirana, Shkoder, Elbasan,
Durres and Vlore).
- Provision of radio systems, cameras and microbuses in five target areas.
- Provide uniforms for inspectors.
- Action to be managed and carried out by KESH's Loss Reduction Management Unit
(Item 2.2).
- Amend contract to be consistent with amended law for Inspectorate.



ANNEX 4.4

Page 3 of 14
Government responsibility:
Amend and pass Law for Inspectorate.
The following amendments are required:
Reorganization of Inspectorate into two sections, both responsible to KESH.
50% of penalties should go to KESH (25% to Distribution Entity, 25% to
KESH HQ).
KESH HQ pays inspectors at Kesh HQ; DE's pay their inspectors.
Ensure police and legal authorities in each area of Albania are aware of importance of
work of Inspectorate and provide full support when requested.
Publicize that theft of electricity is a criminal offense. Police and legal system can
prosecute persistent offenders.
Targets
All actions completed (measures taken) by end 1994 (actual).
2.2   Loss Reduction Management Unit
Issues
-  Organization, management, coordination, implementation and monitoring of Action
Plan.
A^ctig_ns
-  Establish Loss Reduction Management Unit (LRMU) at KESH HQ, reporting to the
Technical Vice-Director.
-  The LRMU should comprise:
Distribution Director (Chairman)
Billing Economist
Chief Inspector
The foreign experts provided under the Technical Assistance would work for and
advise the LRMU, along with three full time assisting officers from KESH,
responsible for day to day management of the unit.
-  The LRMU should meet once a week to coordinate and monitor the Action Plan.
- Each DE will establish a Loss Reduction Unit (LRU) responsible for loss reduction in
the Entity, and reporting to the Director of the Entity. The LRU should comprise:
Chief Inspector (Chairman), Chief of Technical Department and Chief of Economic,
with three full time assistants.
Targets
- Establish LRMU and LRU's by May 1994 (actual).



ANNEX 4.4

Page 4 of 14
2.3   Legal Advice
Issue
- Proposals for laws, contracts and regulations being prepared without legal advice.
Action/Target
- Recruit lawyer by March 1994 (actual).
2.4   Meter Maintenance Unit at KESH HQ
Issue
- Meter repair and calibration service of DE's needs improvement, including technical
management and supervision from KESH HQ.
Actions
-  Establish Meter Maintenance Unit in KESH HQ with specialists. The existing KESH
HQ Metering Unit, which at the moment is used to check the metering of the large
users fed direct from transmission entities, should form the basis for the new Meter
Maintenance Unit at KESH. This new unit, with specialists to cover all the
Distribution Entity Calibration Laboratories and repair facilities, and under the control
of KESH's Distribution Director, will be in charge of all meter repair and calibration
units of the Distribution Entities (technical management and supervision.
Target: End-1995.
3.  CONSUMER SERVICES MANAGEMENT AND PROCEDURES
3.1   Survey of all Consumers
- Inadequate information on condition of consumers' installations and contracts.
Action
- Complete surveys for all Distribution Entities, based on Tirana model (e.g. carried
out by teams each comprising an Inspector and a Meter Reader). The survey should
provide information on the status of consumers installation and contract issuance and
suspect meter tampering, illegal connections, and connections without permit.
Targets
-  Surveys for all entities completed by end-1994 (actual).



ANNEX 4.4
- 3                    Attachment I
Page S of 14
3.2   Contracts
- Inspectorate has difficulty in placing penalties if consumer does not have new type of
contract, correctly completed (i.e., all meter seal information and signatures correct).
- Only 60% of consumers have new contracts.
- Existing contract needs to be amended to be consistent with the amended Law for the
Inspectorate.
Actions
- Amend contract.
- Issue correct contracts to all consumers, based on Survey information.
- Employ more personnel in Contracts departments if necessary.
Igets
-  Al consumers with satisfactory installation and meter have correct contract by end of
June 1995.
3.3   Establishment of Consumer Database (Consumer Files)
- Difficult to find and monitor data and information on individual consumer basis.
Actions
- Establish manual system in each DE with single file on each consumer. All core
consumer data and information, and work carried out for each consumer should be
recorded here by all parties (e.g., Meter Reading, Billing, Installation and
Maintenance, Inspectorate). A pilot computerized billing unit will be established in
Tirana Distribution Entity. This unit, under supervision of LRMU, will prepare an
energy billing program which can be utilized on personal computers, and will
establish the standard format on consumer database for all distribution entities. The
data should eventually be transferred to a computer-based monitoring system and be
used to identify sudden changes in the use of energy, or in the pattern of energy
usage, and highlight the consumer for further examination or investigation.
- Add meter number of each consumer to energy billed record books at each DE.
Targets
- End 1995.

transformer metering at distribution points.
- No monitoring of distribution feeders to high loss areas.
Agtions
- Re-establish monitoring systems as metering is installed in 5 target Entities.
- Install meters on outgoing feeders with suspected high losses and monitor energy.
- Replace substation doors, and request police to ensure substations are not interfered
with.
Targets
- 5 target Entities: all by mid-1995.
3.5   Control and Supervision of Consumers
ILxU
- Insufficient monitoring and inspection of consumer installation/metering system.
Actions
- Increase number of personnel of Inspectorate so that each consumer is visited at least
once a year. (Requires approximately doubling of personnel; see 2.1.)
- Increased reporting from meter readers and electricians to Inspectorate of obvious or
suspected irregularities.
- Establish formal feedback system from Inspectorate to meter readers and electricians
of results of their reports.
Targets
- Actions complete (measures taken) by June 1995.
3.6   Separate Energy Statistics for Rural and Urban Consumers
- DE statistics supplied to KESH HQ do not differentiate between rural and urban
consumers.
Actions
- Collect S/S metering data for rural and urban feeders and include on revised monthly
form submitted by DE's. Form to include energy supplied, billed and lost split
between urban and rural areas.

Targets
End-1994 (actual).
3.7   Connections without permits
- In some DE's, particularly Tirana City and Durres, there are a considerable number
of connections to people illegally occupying state or municipal buildings, and houses
built without official permission.
Actions
- Immediately place fixed charge per month on remaining connections, and issue
provisional agreement between the consumer and distribution entity.
- Disconnect connections which are too hazardous to rectify, or occupants disrespect
agreement.
- Distribute leaflets stating that this work in no way implies that occupants have any
legal right to occupy premises (unless permission has been given).

Target
- Disconnect all illegal connections by June 1995.
3.9   Fixed Monthly Bills
Isum
- Connections with missing or faulty meters must be billed (fixed monthly amount).
Actions
- Extend program of billing all such connections, until proper metering is installed.
- Monthly bill should be estimated on the basis of annual average low voltage
consumption for DE's domestic customers (energy supplied less technical losses).



ANNEX 4.4

Targets for actions in other Entities
Regularize all installations with existing (working) meters and issue contracts by mid
1995.
4.2   Transformer Substation Metering
-  Many meters on transformer substations are missing or damaged.
-  Existing system for monitoring losses per substation area is almost completely
inoperative.
Actions (at 5 Target Entities)
- Install new kWh and max. demand meters and current transformers on transformer
incomers.
-  Specify metering on all future new substations.
Targets
-  All transformers metered in 5 target areas by end-1995.
5.   IMPROVEMENT OF RURAL BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES
-  The present billing and collection procedures in the rural areas are unsatisfactory.
Meter reading, billing and collection is carried out by the same person (the village
electricians).
-  Electricity consumed, electricity billed and the total sum collected cannot be
controlled efficiently.
-  The existing system is error prone; there is room for irregularities.



ANNEX 4.4
- 60 -                  Attachment I

Actions
- Detailed elaboration by KESH of two principal concepts for rural billing and
collection procedures based on a separation of meter reading/billing and collection of
money ('Shkoder system' and 'Communal authority support system').
- Investigation of possibilities of communal authorities to assist in collection of money
for KESH.
- Each Entity to propose billing and collection procedure for rural areas based on the
two principal concepts. Review and acceptance by KESH.
- Implementation of the rural billing and collection procedures in all Entities.
- Monitoring and control by KESH of financial arrears and power loss reduction targets
set for each Entity.
- Introduce bulk metering on some problem villages (Item 3.14)
Targets
- Each Entity has introduced an approved billing and collection system by the end of
September 1994 (actual).

POWER LOSS REDUCTION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS
EXPERTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FOR POWER LOSS REDUCTION
Introduction
Albania is in a state of transition from the former central planning system to a free
market economy. In this transition period KESH is experiencing high levels of
losses, which are seriously reducing its income and future investment program. This
is leading also to excessive peak power demands which are damaging the distribution
network and leading to expensive reinforcement. Energy demand is also rapidly
approaching the hydro-electric capacity, thus reducing the valuable foreign exchange
earnings from export and leading to future imports,load-shedding or an expensive
generation construction program.
Financing is being provided under an Action Plan for 1994-1997 to fund metering and
associated equipment for KESH with the object of reducing the non-technical losses.
Losses are about 40% of total supplied to the transmission network in 1993, with
about half the losses being non-technical.
Expert technical assistance is required to assist with the metering and loss-reduction
program. The provision of new equipment for metering and the Inspectorate of
Electricity is being particularly concentrated on five major Distribution Entities
(DE's), comprising Shkoder, Tirana, Elbasan, Durres and Vlore (including both the
city and surrounding rural areas).

ALBANIA
Terms of Reference (TOR) for Modernization of Financial and Managerial
Accounting System of KESH
1.    KESH is a vertically integrated state electricity utility undertaking that is responsible
for the production, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity throughout Albania. It
consists of a head office in Tirana, 13 generation and transmission entities, and 33
distribution entities. Some of these entities have only recently been integrated into KESH.
Total employment of KESH is about 9,500 persons. Of these, about 3,900 are in the
production and transmission entities; about 5,100, in distribution entities; and about 500, in
the head office. In addition to meeting the electricity needs of Albania, KESH also exports
electricity to neighboring countries.
2.   In 1993, the World Bank engaged Electrowatt Engineering Services Ltd., Switzerland,
to evaluate the present organization and structure of the Albanian power subsector, and to
recommend measures to restructure and strengthen the electricity supply industry.
3.    One of the areas identified for improvement is the accounting system of KESH.
Under the old regime, the accounting system was geared towards the needs of a centralized
economy. It now needs to be modified and improved to meet the financial and managerial
accounting needs of a commercial utility corporation in a market economy. A three phase
approach is needed to establish a modem accounting system: (i) initiation, (ii) expansion, and
(iii) integration. The consulting services of Electrowatt for the Power Subsector
Organization Study are to be extended to implement the first phase of the modernization.
During this phase, adequate steps would be taken to prepare KESH for audit of its financial
statements by external auditors acceptable to the World Bank.
4.    Inter alia, the consultants will do the following:
(1)   review the existing accounting system of KESH;
(2)   evaluate the education, training, skills, and competencies of the accounting and
financial staff of KESH, at headquarters and at the various generating,
transmission, and distribution entities, with a view to identify key personnel to
be trained for implementing the new accounting system;
(3)   review the organizational study prepared by Electrowatt, particularly the
sections dealing with accounting and financial management issues;



- 68 -
ANNEX 4.4
Attachment III
Page 2 of 3
(4)   study the new Albanian accounting law, in particular the new chart of accounts
that have been proscribed;
(5)   interact with the Ministry of Finance officials responsible for formulating the
new accounting law and chart of accounts, to understand how the new system
could be applied to an electricity utility like KESH;
(6)   review any consultant studies (such as the one prepared by Coopers and
Lybrand for the Ministry of Finance) that may have been prepared in
connection with development of the new accounting law;
(7)   after fully understanding the old and new accounting laws, prepare an
"accounting bridge" (i.e., a "how to do it manual") to convert financial
information from the old chart of accounts to the new chart of accounts, to
assist KESH in preparing its financial statements in accordance with the new
law;
(8)   assist KESH (a) to set up the new chart of accounts for the whole
organization, and (b) depending on the availability of time and resources,
establish appropriate computer files for its headquarters, for a distribution
entity, and for a production entity;
(9)   assist KESH to present the 1993 financial information in accordance with the
new financial statement formats, as was done for 1992, in the Power Sector
Organization Study;
(10)  assist KESH to establish appropriate books, ledgers, and other recording
systems at its headquarters, and at its various generation, transmission, and
distribution entities, to strengthen the accounting system of KESH;
(11) review the internal control system of KESH, recommend improvements, and
then assist KESH in its implementation, to ensure that the internal control
systems would satisfy the requirements of the independent external auditor;
(12) help KESH to establish an internal audit function to strengthen internal control;
(13)  help KESH personnel to prepare for an audit of its financial statements by an
independent external auditor;
(14)  propose appropriate actions which KESH could implement to improve its
accounting system and internal control, in order to get an unqualified opinion



- 69 -
ANNEX 4.4
Attachment III
Page 3 of 3
on its financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow
statement) from its auditors;
(15)  assist KESH in establishing systems to monitor project accounts, statements of
expenditure, special accounts, etc., and compliance with any other covenants
stipulated by IDA or any other lending agency;
(16)  advise KESH on actions that would help it improve its financial and accounting
system to be consistent with international standards;
(17)  advise KESH management in evaluating and selecting appropriate hardware
and software for its financial and accounting system;
(18)  time permitting, help KESH personnel in establishing budgeting procedures,
and in analyzing actual costs versus budgeted costs, and conducting variance
analysis to study the causes of variation from budget;
(19)  advise in preparing financial projections for the use of KESH management,
and for the use of financing agencies (e.g., using a forecast model like that
presented in the Power Sector Organization Study);
(20)  advise and assist, to the extent possible with available resources, on any other
financial and accounting matter, as requested by KESH.

Before signing this contract, the watt-meter #    was checked, and after being found
in good technical conditions, was sealed by the laboratory and registered in its files. The
number showing on the watt-meter at the time of sealing was    kwh.
The customer and the representative of the supplier checked the electrical installations
of the customer's residence to make sure that: (i) the supply with energy comes exclusively
through the watt-meter; (ii) power supply and the neutral are connected correctly to the
network; (iii) the neutral is not connected with the fuse; and (iv) the watt-meter is fixed in a
vertical position.
The watt-meter's cover was sealed in the presence of both customer and supplier's
representative with ...... (# of seals). The customer is required to immediately notify the
supplier for any failure of the watt-meter. In cases when the failure is observed by the
supplier, the customer has to pay the amount of energy consumed by him/her (estimated by a
special commission of the supplier) and not recorded by the watt-meter.
IV. Sanctions
Violation of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Part II, damage to the watt-meter or the seals on it,
intervention in the electrical network before the watt-meter, as well as any action with the

(a)   as administrative violations with fines ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 leks, as
well as the reimbursement from the violator of the full costs incurred by the
supplier. These costs will include: (i) the amount of energy consumed by the
customer and not registered by the watt-meter (which will be estimated by the
supplier based on the consumption norms of the customer's electrical
equipments for a period of 6 months, but in any case not less than 1,000 kwh);
(ii) damage caused to the network or watt-meter; and (iii) all other expenses
incurred by the supplier in such a case.
Payment of the fine should be made within 10 days from the day the
irrevocable decision is announced. In case of default, a daily penalty of two
percent of the initial fine will be charged to the customer for a period of one
month. If after the expiration of the second deadline the customer continues to

Annex 5.1
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Projection
1.    Financial projections for KESH have been prepared in terms of current Leks. Figures for
1992 and 1993 are estimates prepared by KESH and Electrowatt by extracting information from the
actual financial figures of KESH. It has been assumed that local inflation will remain at an average
annual rate of 10 percent, and the exchange rate at 100 Lek per US$.
2.     Revenues Electricity tariffs at present are significantly below their economic cost. In order
to meet its investment requirements in future, it is imperative for KESH to increase its revenues in
real terms. Accordingly, it has been assumed that, the average price of electricity (net of excise tax)
would be increased from 1.1 Lek in 1994, to 3.0 Lek in 1996, and 4.0 Leks in 1999.
3.    Interest Rate An interest rate of 7% per year has been assumed for all borrowings by KESH.
4.     Salaries and Waees Salaries and wages are assumed to increase at 20% per year in 1994,
1995, and 1996, and 10% in 1997 and 1998.
5.     Fuel Cost Fuel costs are expected to remain constant in real terms. Fuel oil and coal are
assumed to remain at 8,500 Lek per ton and 3,000 Lek per ton, respectively, in 1993 prices.
6.     Taxes and Duties Since these projections were prepared on the basis of electricity prices net
of excise taxes, no specific excise rate has been assumed. Other taxes and duties are expected to
remain at their current levels; i.e., 20% on export, 30% on profit, and 20% and 5%, respectively, on
import of machinery and other materials.
7.     Capital Expenditure In order to maintain the integrity of its generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, KESH would need to invest about 21 billion Lek (US$210 million), in nominal
terms, between 1994 and 1997. If generating capacity is to be increased, the requirements would be
larger.

IRR =                 0.21
a/ Affected quantity is the amount of non-technical Losses projected to be eliminated
by the Action Plan in the 5 target cities. Total non-technical tosses in the five cities
were 391 GWh in 1993.
b/ The demand fall was determined from the demand function with a constant price elasticity
of -0.02 over the range from the expected penalty of 0.02 cent/kWh to the projected household price.
The projected price is 4.5 cents/kWh in 1995 and 6.9 cents/kWh thereafter.
The expected penalty is the probability of an illegal user being fined in a year times the average fine
plus payment of unpaid energy totalling S20 divided by the average consumption per customer of 3700 kWh.
From 1993 experience in Tirana, Durres and Shkoder a customer is inspected on average
once every 1.1 years and one in every 80 inspections results in a penalty.
Assuming that the proportion of illegal consumers is equal to the proportion of non-technical
to the sum of sales and non-technical losses, 39% in the five cities, the probability of an illegal
customer getting a penalty in a given year is equal to (1/1.1*1/80*1/.39)=0.029.
c/ The quantity demand fall multiplied by 0.855 times the economic cost of 6.9 cents per kWh.
The excluded 14.5% of the economic cost is the benefit
to consumers of the electricity represented by the demand fall. It is measured by the area
under the demand curve with constant elasticity of -0.02 over the demand fall region.
