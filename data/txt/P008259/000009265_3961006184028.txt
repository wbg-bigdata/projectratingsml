MEMORANDUM, AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ALBANIA
FOR A POWER LOSS REDUCTION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to Albania for SDR
3.4 million (US$5 million), on standard terms with 40 years
maturity, to reduce non-technical power losses and to support
institutional reform.
2.   Background. The demise of communism in Albania was accompanied
by economic and social collapse. GOP fell by 10% in 1990, 28% in
1991 and another 10% in 1992.   A sharp turnaround followed the
election of a democratic government in March 1992, the launching of
a comprehensive program of stabilization and sytemic reforms, and
financial assistance from abroad. By late 1994, GDP was about 20%
above the 1992 level, and income including remittances from
Albanians abroad was about 30% above.
3.    Electricity demand within Albania has moved with the economy
but with some differences. The 21% fall between 1989 and 1992 was
less than the fall in GDP, and the growth in electricity demand
after 1992 was more rapid than growth in GDP. Demand within Albania
grew by 19% in 1993 to 3,316 gigawatt hours (GWh). This growth was
due mainly to demand increases by households and small commercial
enterprises, much of it for uneconomic use of electricity (e.g.,
space heating).   The increase in household consumption was due
partly to shortages of fuelwood and other household fuels. More
importantly, it was due to imports of large numbers of appliances
from abroad, many of which were financed by Albanians living abroad,
to the very low electricity price for housepold use (prior to April
1994), and to widespread resort to illegal use of electricity.
Billed household consumption grew from 270 GWh in 1989 to 774 GWh in
1993 (the increase in 1993 was a staggering 61%). Transmission and
distribution losses grew from 11% of net generation in 1989 to 40%
(1362 GWh) in 1993.   Of these, non-technical losses (unbilled
consumption, mostly illegal use by households and small commercial
enterprises) are estimated to be 650 GWh. The additional household
and commercial demand, which is heavily skewed towards the hours of
peak demand on the power system, explains the surge in peak load to
record highs of 720 Mw in December 1993 and 820 MW in late 1994.
4.    The change in composition of demand away from high-voltage
industrial customers to low-voltage commercial and household
customers has caused serious overloading of some 110 kilovolt (kV)
and 35 kV transmission networks, some 220/110 kV transformer
capacities and the distribution systems in major load centers. The
results are excessive technical losses, voltage drops and
instability, outages and damage to transformers, cable, meters and
other equipment.



-2-
5.    The Government tried to prevent household energy shortages
during 1992-94 by importing kerosene, liquid petroleum gas, coal and
stoves, and increasing fuelwood supplies to cities by encouraging
private enterprises to cut and transport wood.  To reduce non-
technical power losses the Government established an electricity
inspectorate at the end of 1992, and the Albanian Electroenergetic
Corporation, NSUH, began importing meters to replace broken ones.
6.    An emergency situation began in late 1994 partly as a result
of an extraordinary lack of rain which forced KESH to reduce
hydropower production from the three Drin River power stations to
less than one-third of the normal level. In most years these power
stations account for more than 90% of Albania's electricity supply.
As of December 1994, the Government hk i imposed a ceiling on
electricity supply at about 35% below estimated demand. Production
was greatly increased at the Ballsh and Fieri thermal power stations
and electricity was being imported from Greece. However, imports
were limited by the capacity of the transmission connection to
Greece. Albania has two transmission lines to former Yugoslavia,
but these have been closed because of the political troubles there.
The second cause of the emergency was increased demand due to the
arrival of cold weather. During periods when electricity has been
available, the high demand has overloaded distribution networks
resulting in considerably more interruptions and equipment damage
than last winter.
7.     IDA's country assistance strategy for Albania discussed by
the Board on September 14, 1993 gives high priority to
rehabilitation of weak infrastructure, which is a major impediment
to private sector development, as well as to foreign direct
investment. The electricity emergency of late 1994 highlights the
urgent need to strengthen the electricity infrastructure. Three IDA
projects address this need. The Albania Critical Imports Project,
approved in June 1992, is financing urgent repairs of the
electricity system.   The power component is being carried out
successfully.  The amount of money allocated to power has been
increased during project implementation to US$16 million (including
parallel financing by the Swiss Government). The proposed Power
Loss Reduction Project would focus on reducing non-technical
electricity losses. A larger project to finance rehabilitation and
upgrading of the power transmission and distribution systems is
being prepared for Board presentation in early FY96. In addition a
project to rehabilitate the Orin River hydropower stations was
approved by the NBED in November 1994.
S.   The Government has rapidly raised energy prices, so that most
of them are now at or above economic cost. The biggest steps came
on April 1, 1994 when government subsidies for household energy were
eliminated, the prices of fuelwood and coal were freed from
government control, and the prices of most other energy carriers for
household use were raised to the economic cost level. The price of



-3-
electricity for households was raised to 4.5 leks per kilowatt hour
for all consumption from 0.8 leks per kWh for an initial block (250
kWh per month in large cities, lower elsewhere) and 3 lake per kWh
for additional consumption.   Since only a small minority of
households consumed more than the initial block, the impact of this
price change was very large. The price for low-voltage commercial
use was raised from 2 luke per kWh to an average of 6 leke. These
prices compare to the economic cost of low-voltage electricity
supply of about 7 leks per kWh. These energy price increases have
been the steepest increases experienced anywhere in Eastern Europe.
9.    The Government  has  implemented  a  schem  to  compensate
households for an estimated 75* of the household energy price
increase by means of increases in wages, pensions, unemployment
benefits and welfare payments.  Financing is being provided by
excise taxes with most of the money coming from taxing electricity.
The Government takes the difference between the retail price and 1. 1
leks per kWh for all electricity sales within Albania. The April 1
tariff changes raised the consumption weighted average retail
electricity price within Albania from 1.4 leks per kWh for the first
three months of 1994 to 3.6 luke per kWh for the last nine months.
10.  Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project was given
first priority for the power sector by a Council of Ministers
decision on March 25, 1994.  It is incorporated in the Public
Investment Program for 1994-96.
11.  For IDA, the project would be the logical next step following
the Critical Imports Project for the following reasons.
(i) to the extent the project reduces electricity demand it
would avoid further damage to transmission and distribution
networks, relieve pressure on overloaded facilities and
postpone the time wheni new capacity is needed;
(ii) demand control is desirable before supply rehabilitation
and expansion since otherwise improved supply would facilitate
more widespread uneconomic use of electricity; and
(iii) reduction of non-technical losses and financial arrears
(also dealt with under the project) would improve the
financial position of REH.
12.    The project is consistent with the country assistance
strategy discussed by the Board on September 14, 1993 since it would
serve as a necessary precursor to future projects aimed at improving
the transmission and distribution systems.
13.  The project would provide the first opportunity for IDA to
support institutional reform and strengthening in the power
subsector. On the basis of the Power Sector Organization Study



-4-
completed in March 1994, support would be provided for conversion of
KESH to a joint stock company and the establishment of new
accounting, financial and internal control systems within KESH.
Conversion of XESH to a joint stock company, with the shares held
initially by the Government, would provide for a clearer definition
of the ownerenip role of the Government and of the capital structure
and property structure of the company and contribute to enhanced
autonomy. It is a first step towards privatization in the power
sector.  The Government has indicated a desire to move rapidly
towards privatization, beginning with electricity distribution.
14.   The project would also introduce in RESH the practice of
having financial statements audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. While RESH's past financial statements have not
been audited by independent auditors, the statements appear
reasonable, and provide an adequate basis for proceeding with the
IDA credit. Provided future electricity tariffs and taxes are set
to ensure adequate cash flow for KESH to meet its investment
requirements, and non-technical losues and financial arrears by
KESH's customers are reduced to the target levels agreed under the
proposed project, the enterprise is expected to be financially
healthy. Further, because it has almost no debt in its existing
capital structure, it is in a position to undertake long-term
borrowings for future investments.
15.  The project has been prepared with the collaboration and
support of the Swiss Government, which provided finance for the
Power Sector Organization Study and for establishing new accounting
and financial systems in KESH's financial department through a Bank
managed trust fund, and has approved parallel f._aancing of US$2.5
million equivalent for the project itself.
16.  Project Objectives.  The main objecti'ves are to: (i) reduce
non-technical  electricity  losses  (mainly  due  to  theft  of
electricity) thereby reducing uneconomic use of electricity and
increasing electricity revenue; and (ii) support institutional
reform and strengthening in the power subsector. The project would
indirectly reduce technical electricity losses by relieving pressure
on overloaded transmission and distribution facilities.
17.  Project Description.   The project would consist of the
following components: an action plan to reduce non-technical power
losses, technical assistance and training for the power loss
reduction program, and support for institutional reform and
strengthening.
18.   The  action  plrn  includes:  transferring the  electricity
* inspectors from the Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources to RESH
(completed), increasing their numbers, reorganizing them, improving
their equipment; replacing broken or faulty meters in the cities of
Tirana, Durres, Elbasan, Shkoder and Vlore with packages consisting



of a new meter combined with a current limiter protected by a
plastic case with a signed seal, installing meters at transformers,
and upgrading meter testing, calibration and repair; improving
consumer  services  management  through  establishing  consumer
contracts, creating an improved database, carrying out a publicity
campaign, and introducing incentive schemes in the distribution
entities..
19.   RESH would be converted to a joint stock company and establish
new accounting and financial systems.
20.  Agreements  Reached.    Agreements  were  reached  during
negotiations with the Government to:
(i) take any measures necessary, including raising electricity
prices, to enable RESH to achieve the agreed financial targets
under the project;
(ii) onlend the credit to RESH for a 10 year term, with four
years of grace, at a rate equal to the yield on 10-year U.S.
Treasury Bonds plus a margin of 100 basis points, with the
foreign exchange risk to be borne by RESH;
(iii) establish RESH as a joint stock company by December 1,
1995.
21.  Agreements were reached with RESH to:
(i) review with IDA by October of each year its proposed
investment program for the following five years, and take the
Association's views into consideration in finalizing this
program;
(ii) carry out the non-technical loss reduction project in
accordance with an agreed implementation plan (which includes
the action plan and time schedule);
(iii) exchange views with IDA on progress, analysis of
results,   and  evaluation  of  implementation,   proposed
adjustments to the action plan and any other item considered
necessary;
(iv) maintain separate project accounts and prepare on a
quarterly and annual basis an income statement, a balance
sheet and a funds flow statement;
(v) appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, by
July 1, 1995;



(vi) present the audited financial statements and project
accounts to IDA no later tthan six months after the end of the
financial year; tho first audit would be for 1995;
(vii) reduce average accounts receivable to two months of
sales;
(viii) ensure that la) the internally generated cash surplus
would be at least 50% of the three-year mo-ing average capital
requirements of RESH, (b) the debt/equity ratio is 1.5 or
less, and (c) debt service coverage is 2.0 or higher; and
22.  EHnvlronwental Aspects.   Tne project has been placed in
environment category C.   The instal ation of meters and the
organizational and management changes under the project would have
no impact on the environment.
23.  Beneflts.  The benefits would include reduced non-technical
losses resulting in (i) increased electricity revenue and (ii)
reduced electricity demand, which would give a cost saving and
reduce pressure on overloaded transmission and distribution
facilities. The reduced strain on facilities would also reduce
technical losses.
24.  RJsks. One risk would be a failure to provide the personnel
needed to implement the action plan on schedule. To minimise this
risk the tasks have been identified in considerable detail with many
monitorable time-bound targets, and RESH would be assured of
sufficient funds to employ the necessary personnel. The additional
revenue from converting non-technical electricity losses to billed
sales would provide an incentive to make sure that the program is
successful. A second risk is that the inspectors would be prevented
from entering consumers' premises or bribed to not report
electricity theft. To minimize this risk the inspectors have been
given the right by law to have access to consumers' meters, they
have been transferred to the direct control of RESH, the Government
would provide police support if necessary, an improved customer file
system would make it easier to detect irregularities, and local
inspectors would be cross-checked by inspectors from KESH
headquarters. A third risk is that consumers would break the new
meters. To reduce this risk each customer would be made responsible
for his or her meter and consumers without meters would be billed
anyway. A fourth risk is that customers would not pay their bills.
This risk would be minimized by disconnecting customers in arrears.
A final risk is that the program would not achieve public
acceptance.   To minimize this risk a publicity campaign would
emphasize the benefit of reduced overloading of electrical
facilities resulting from the program.



-7-
25.  ProJect Sustaenablllty.   While the project would finance
UwteXr for flva major cities and surrounding rural areas accounting
for about 60% of total non-technical losses in the country, the
action plan has ben structured to cover the whole country, and
national targets have beer set to tho year 2000. The prospects for
maintaining non-technical loosss at a low level once they are
reduced ar expected to be enhanced by* the improved organizational
structure within ZION to deal with non-technical losses, signing of
contracts with all consumers, the planned creation of a computerized
billing system with a sparate file on each consumer, the expected
spread of a system of rewards for loss reduction achievements, and
implementation of an effective monitoring system.   In addition
electricity theft is considered a criminal offence, and can, as a
last resort, be prosecuted under the criminal code. The consumer
contracts together with the planned provision for bill ag consumers
on the basis of a high assumed level of electricity should reduce
incentives to break meters and deny responsibility. Both x3s5 and
the Government will have a continuing interest in keeping non-
technical losos low because of the important revenue benefit.
26.  RecoCmlndaeton. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agree nt of the Asociation and
recomagnd that the Executive Directors approve it.
