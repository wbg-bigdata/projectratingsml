MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Bangladesh
Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery and
Distribution Project (Credit 1749-BD)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery
and distribution Project (Credit 1749-BD, approved in FY87) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office,
with Part II prepared by the Borrower. The credit was closed in December 1993, one year behind schedule.
Of the original credit amount of US$47.0 million, US$40.5 was disbursed, and US$6.5 million was
canceled.
The objectives of the project were: (i) to upgrade the Chittagong refinery to increase the production
of high value middle distillate products (kerosene and diesel fuel) and decrease the production of residual
fuel oil; and (ii) to increase the use of domestic liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by recovering LPG at the
Kailashtia gas field, establishing an institutional framnework for private sector participation in LPG
distribution, and implementing a joint venture for LPG bottling and distribution. In that connection the
Credit provided for the removal of Government controls on LPG prices.
The refinery modification program was successfully implemented with only relatively minor delays
and cost overruns. However, the LPG recovery and distribution components (about 30% of the original
project cost) did not get implemented. The reasons for the failure to implement the LPG recovery plant at
Kailashtia are not discussed in the PCR, and no lessons are drawn. The PCR states that the joint venture
LPG distribution project component was abandoned because it was found that the transport costs were too
high. A more likely explanation is that the GOB maintained the controlled retail price for LPG below that
needed to cover transport and distribution costs, in contravention to the project covenant on LPG pricing.
There is no discussion in the PCR of what needs to be done to overcome the problems of the LPG
subsector.
The project outcome is assessed as unsatisfactory because of the failure to implement two
important components in the critical area of LPG distribution. Institutional development is rated as
negligible, since there was no progress on the LPG side, and the refinery already had a satisfactory
institutional structure before the project. In contrast, the PCR judges the project in the light of the
successful refinery upgrading, and therefore rates the project outcome as satisfactory and the institutional
development as partial. Sustainability of the implemented refinery component is rated as likely. The
performance of the Bank is rated as satisfactory, in spite of the project's shortcomings, since the causes of
the failure of the LPG program appear to have been beyond its control.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance of their
official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



2
The PCR is rated as unsatisfactory: it gives only superficial attention to the project components
that failed, focusing its attention, instead, on the successful components, from which there was little to
learn. It does not explain the reasons for the failure of the LPG component in sufficient depth to provide
insight into how a subsequent effort could address the outstanding issues in the LPG sector.
No audit is planned at this time.

REFINERY MODIFICATION AND LPG RECOVERY AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1749-BD)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery
and Distribution Project in Bangladesh for which Credit 1749-BD in the amount of SDR 40 million
(US$47.0 equivalent) was approved on December 16, 1986. The credit closed on December 31, 1993,
one year behind schedule. It was 87.8 percent disbursed and the last disbursement was made in June
1, 1994. A total of SDRs 5,494,000 (US$6,456,000) was cancelled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy and Project Finance Division, Country
Department 1, South Asia Region and the Oil and Gas Division, Industry and Energy Department of
the Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III),
and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's final supervision mission of the project in
December 1993, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit Guarantee and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between IDA and the Borrower; and internal
IDA memoranda.

REFINERY MODIFICATION AND LPG RECOVERY AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1749-BD)
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
1.    The project includes several components with the common objective to minimize the net cost of
supplying essential petroleum products to the country. An important part of this objective was to
develop the commercialization of indigenous liquid petroleum gas (LPG) as a substitute for imported
kerosene and fuel wood, thereby reducing foreign exchange needs and deforestation.
Project Description
2.    The project had five main components: (a) the installation of a mild hydrocracker to convert
poor quality vacuum gas oil to high grade diesel oil, (b) a visbreaker to reduce the viscosity of fuel oil
while producing a small quantity of diesel oil, (c) facilities to recover and bottle LPG, (d)
establishment of a joint venture with the private sector to bottle and market LPG; and (e) provision of
technical assistance to implement the project and train staff.
Implementation Experience
3.    The implementation of the project was carried out by four agencies, the Eastern Refinery
Limited (ERL), the Liquified Petroleum Gas Limited (LPGL), Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
(BPC) and Petrobangla. All four beneficiaries had experienced staff. One project component ("c"
above) had to be partly abandoned due to the fact that the anticipated feed was contingent on the
completion of another project and did not materialize; another component ("d" above) could not be
implemented due to higher than expected prices quoted for shallow-bottomed tankers. The three
refinery components representing the main part of the project, however, were implemented efficiently
and with commendable speed.
4.     A major set-back to the project was the withdrawal of the general contractor with the most
competitive offer for the refinery components due to a minor technicality. The second lowest bidder
was invited, but he declined to extend the validity of his bid. Finally, the third lowest bidder was
awarded the contract. This delayed the implementation of the project by about nine months.
5.    Further, there was a catastrophic cyclone which hit the Chittagong area scattering material and
work in progress. This added at least another three months to the implementation schedule. Despite
these set-backs the project was completed just one year behind schedule, with about 88 percent of the
Credit (SDR 40 million) disbursed. The exemplary manner in which ERL staff and the general
contractor performed contributed to the efficient implementation of the project.
6.    The implementation of the project was helped considerably by the work done under the
previous Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1357- BD). Under this project, all
the viable options and implementation strategies were defined, which facilitated the expeditious
implementation of the project.
Project Results
7.    The addition of the two process units enabled the refinery to reduce the production of fuel oil
and increase the yield of more valuable distillate petroleum products. While not adequate to satisfy all



-ii-
demand for products, the benefits from the modifications are significant. Under the project, LPG
cylinders and regulators were also procured, which enabled LPGL to increase the sale of LPG.
Project Sustainabilitv
8.     As Bangladesh increases its production of natural gas, the demand for fuel oil will decrease.
The demand for diesel oil for busses and trucks will, however, continue to increase. Hence, the
project refinery modifications, which resulted in a reduction of fuel oil production and an increase in
the output of diesel oil, will continue to prove beneficial to the country.  The project sustainability
will be further enhanced by the growing demand for diesel oil in the Asia region and the resulting
increase in the margin between diesel oil and crude oil. In view of the above, prospects for the
sustainability of project benefits are good.
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.     The most significant lesson from  this project is that effective, results-oriented project
preparation and design are keys to efficient implementation. Particularly for Bangladesh, there is a
need to minimize the number of procurement packages and to minimize the delays resulting from the
approval process by the several layers of bureaucracy. Engagement of consultants to work alongside
the beneficiaries' staff facilitated procurement. Finally, the dedication of the beneficiaries' staff helped
in a large measure to implement the project.

PART 1: PROJECT REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Project Identitv
Project Name:       Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery and Distribution Project
Credit Number:      1749-BD
RVP Unit:           South Asia Region
Country:            Bangladesh
Sector:             Energy
Sub-sector:         Petroleum
2. Background
2.1.   The energy assessment study prepared in 1982 under the Joint World Bank/UNDP Energy
Assessment Program for Bangladesh identified major weaknesses in the energy sector planning and
supply of essential petroleum products. Among the main weaknesses were inefficiencies in the Eastern
Refinery at Chittagong, which could process only limited quantities of crude oil, well below its design
capacity, and the unusually high cost of petroleum product imports.   At the time of the energy
assessment, petroleum products and crude oil imports equalled nearly 40 percent of the total export
earnings. The refinery was in poor mechanical condition and experienced frequent unscheduled shut-
downs due to mechanical failures and non-availability of parts essential for regular maintenance. The
IDA financed Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1357-BD), which followed as
a result of the energy assessment study, provided funding and assistance to effect essential repairs to
improve the mechanical integrity and safety of the refinery.
2.2.   While the Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project provided short term relief, the
problems in the energy sector went beyond that of the high cost of supply of petroleum products.
Exploitation of natural gas, the only indigenous commercial energy source (except for a limited
hydropower potential), was constrained due to lack of funding and technical expertise. While two of
the world's largest rivers, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, flow through Bangladesh, the flat terrain
provides limited potential for hydropower, which is estimated at not more than 400 MW. The
extensive use of natural gas was also constrained by the inability of the refinery to reduce the output of
fuel oil, which natural gas could replace in industry and power sectors.  In parallel with the
exploitation of natural gas for power and industrial uses, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) also
recognized the need to minimize the cost of petroleum imports, which were making disproportionate
claims on the country's limited foreign exchange resources.
2.3.   A refinery modification study was conducted under the Energy Efficiency and Refinery
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1357-BD) to determine the optimum strategy for improving the refinery's
processing efficiency and reduce the output of fuel oil. This study identified the need for secondary
conversion facilities to convert excess, low value fuel oil to premium value middle distillate products,
like kerosene and diesel oil. This study gave rise to the Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery and
Distribution Project.
2.4.   While the refinery modification project was under preparation, GOB realized that substantial
quantities of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which could substitute for imported kerosene, were likely
to be available from the natural gas production at the Kailashtila fields. As neither the LPG marketing
skills nor the required institutional framework existed in the country, a pilot project was included to



-2-
develop the required expertise as well as to provide a limited quantity of LPG to the northern areas of
Bangladesh.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1.   The main project objectives were to minimize the net cost of petroleum imports to the country
by rationalizing the supply of petroleum products and promoting the use of LPG to substitute for
kerosene.
3.2.  To meet these objectives, the project provided for:
(a)  the installation of a mild hydrocracker, to convert poor quality vacuum gas oil to high grade
diesel oil;
(b)  the installation of a visbreaker, to reduce the viscosity of fuel oil and produce some diesel
oil;
(c)  facilities to recover and bottle LPG at Kailashtila;
(d)  the establishment of a joint venture with the private sector to bottle and market LPG; and
(e)  the provision of technical assistance to implement the project and training of staff.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1.   The project was implemented by four agencies: Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL) for the project
components which involved the addition of the mild hydrocracker and the visbreaker, Liquified
Petroleum Gas Limited (LPGL) for the LPG bottling and marketing facilities, Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (BPC) for the joint-venture LPG distribution facility and Petrobangla for the LPG
recovery plant at Kailashtila.
4.2.   The major project component was the modification of the Eastern Refinery at Chittagong, for
which approximately 65 percent of the Credit was allotted. This project component included the mild
hydrocracker, the visbreaker and associated utilities and off site facilities and was the most complex
project component. Under the Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project, ERL staff had
been trained in project management and gained valuable experience. The project implementation unit
established for the refinery component was well managed and facilitated the implementation of this
component. CE Lummus Company of the United States provided project design and implementation
assistance. Technip of France was the general contractor for detailed engineering, procurement and
construction.
4.3.   Another major component was the Small Scale LPG Recovery Facility at Kailashtila for which
the designated implementing agency was Petrobangla. Dependent on the completion of this facility
were other components , i.e. LPG Recovery Facilities at Kailashtila and LPG Storage and distribution
equipment, including bottling plant, LPG cylinders, trucks and a barge, retail filing units and technical
assistance to implement downstream activities associated with the proposed recovery of LPG at
Kailashtila. The LPG supply to the facilities did not materialize as the Second Gas Development
Project (SGDP) credit closed without implementing its LPG component. As a result, all components
of the LPG recovery, distribution and marketing components were suspended. Another component of
the project was the formation of a joint venture between BPC and a private sector company to bottle
and market LPG around Khulna. This joint-venture could not be formed due to the excessive cost of
transporting LPG from Chittagong to Khulna. LPGL was provided cylinders and regulators under the
project. Technical assistance was also provided.



-3-
5. Project Implementation
5.1.   The project was taken to the Board on December 16, 1986, and became effective on September
18, 1987. The original closing date was December 31, 1992 and the Credit was closed on December
31, 1993, after a one year extension of the closing date. Of the total Credit of SDR 40 million, SDR
34.73 million was disbursed, representing 87.8 percent of the Credit. Taking into account the fact that
the SDR had appreciated about 15 percent in respect to the US dollar between Credit negotiation and
closing, disbursement can be considered to be very satisfactory. Two project components, the small
scale LPG recovery plant at Kailashtila and the joint venture LPG bottling and marketing company,
could not be implemented for the reasons stated earlier.
5.2.   The Refinery Modification Component. Consultants were engaged to assist the very dedicated
and efficient group of staff headed by the Project Implementation Director. This component could
have been completed well ahead of schedule, but for the performance of the bidder who submitted the
most competitive bid and was selected for the award of the contract for detailed engineering,
procurement, installation construction and start-up of the facilities. This contractor withdrew his offer
for no justifiable reason, and ERL then negotiated, after IDA's approval, with the next most
competitive bidder. However, this bidder refused to extend the validity of his bid. At this stage, the
first contractor renewed interest, stating that he had acquired a subsidiary company and would now be
able to undertake the contract (divulging the true reason for the withdrawal).  Since there was a
substantial price difference, this placed GOB in a difficult situation. There was strong pressure to
award the contract to the original contractor. IDA, however, advised that this would not be acceptable
as the contractor had already withdrawn his offer and to readmit him would be contrary to IDA
guidelines. The contract was finally awarded to the third most competitive bidder.
5.3.       This delayed the contract award by about six months and, consequently, project
implementation. A further reason for slippage was the unusually severe cyclone which hit the refinery
and literally scattered all material and work in progress, and this delayed the project by at least another
three months. The contractor for project management assistance as well as the general contractor
performed quite well in assisting the ERL team to make-up for lost time.
5.4.      Initially disbursements were slow, but with the award of the contract for the refinery
component, disbursements picked-up. Nearly 88 percent (in SDR terms) of the Credit was disbursed.
6. Project Results
6.1. The main quantifiable results of the project are illustrated by the performance indicators for the
refinery yields for naptha, diesel and fuel oil before and after the project as summarized below:
Before Project                          After Project
'000 MTPA               (%)             '000 MTPA              (%)
Naptha                     102                 (6.84)               114               (7.93)
Diesel                     341                (22.86)               428              (29.76)
Fuel Oil                   631                (42.29)               478              (33.24)
ERR                   Appraised 21 %                            Actual 22%
6.2.   The slightly higher actual rate of return is due to the decrease in the price of crude and an
increase in the margins between distillate petroleum products and crude oil.



-4-
6.3.  The project also provided valuable experience and know-how to ERL staff in management and
execution of major projects. Provisions were made to train key technical and administrative staff.
However, the benefits of staff training were limited due to delays in the approval of nominated staff.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1.   The benefits from the project should be sustainable for the following reasons:
(a)    ERL has been transformed into a mechanically reliable, moderately efficient and
economically viable operation through the first Energy Efficiency and Refinery
Rehabilitation Project and with the completion of this project. It is by no means a
modem refinery, but its mechanical integrity has been restored to acceptable levels;
(b)    due to the increasing shortage of middle distillate petroleum products, the margin
between these products and crude oil increased and is likely to remain at fairly high
levels, which would ensure adequate net returns to the refinery;
(c)   the increased use of natural gas to replace fuel oil has further justified the installation
of facilities to convert fuel oil to higher value middle distillate; and
(d)   the provision of LPG cylinders and accessories facilitated the expansion of the LPG
market. LPG has become the domestic cooking fuel of choice, assuring LPGL an
important role in the development of this market.
8. IDA Performance
8.1.   With regard to the refinery modification and LPG components, the major components of the
project which were implemented, IDA's performance met the expectations of the Borrower. On the
other components, the joint venture with the private sector and the small scale LPG recovery
component, IDA endeavored to initiate their implementation. However, due to circumstances beyond
the control of IDA, neither component could be implemented. Nevertheless, IDA's efforts were
appreciated by both agencies involved.  IDA assisted all agencies involved to expedite project
implementation. A case in point was the award of the contract for the implementation of the refinery
modification component, when the selection of the contractor was held-up (see para 5.2). IDA's
intervention enabled ERL to award the contract to the bidder selected by BPC and ERL.
9. Borrower/Beneficiary Performance
9.1.   ERL managed the implementation of its project components efficiently and in an exemplary
manner. Project documentation was good, and reports were received on time. ERL monitored the
general contractor's work very efficiently and at every stage kept abreast of project progress. LPGL
staff worked diligently to implement their project components. Both BPC and Petrobangla, despite the
fact that their components could not be implemented due to circumstances beyond their control,
demonstrated initiative and tenacity in trying to overcome the problems which confronted them.
9.2.   ERL and LPGL staff worked conscientiously on the respective project components. While
ERL had some familiarity with IDA's procurement procedures, initially there was some frustration on
the need to get IDA's approval on procurement.  However, as the project progressed, easy
communication with IDA was established, which made it possible to obtain clearances with minimum
delay. IDA's staff was cooperative and helpful and facilitated the expeditious implementation of the
project.
10. Project Relationship
10.1.  The relationship between the various beneficiaries and IDA  was good.  Despite some
procurement problems, there were no reversals of procurement decisions. IDA did not receive a single



-5-
complaint from disappointed bidders against any of the implementing agencies. A major reason for
this was the efforts made by IDA and the implementing agencies to keep the bidders informed of all
steps taken in the bid invitation, evaluation and award cycle and responding quickly to questions.
10.2. In addition to supervision of the project, IDA missions were involved in discussions on further
activities in the energy sector, which may become necessary to meet the increased demand for
petroleum products, natural gas and LPG. BPC and ERL have discussed the future role of the refinery
in the context of more liberalized policies in the energy sector.
11. Project Documentation and Data
11.1.  The Staff Appraisal Report is comprehensive, well prepared and provides a suitable refinery
modification strategy, as well as procurement and implementation arrangements. The rationale for the
other components was also well justified and explained. The SAR provided valuable guidelines for the
implementing of the project.
12. Findings and Lessons
12.1. The main lessons are:
(a)   the first refinery project, the Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project,
was completed three years behind schedule. A small but important component of this
project was training of staff and strengthening of institutional arrangements. Most
project delays were due to the limited experience ERL staff had of project
implementation and general refinery operations. The project of this PCR benefitted
from the work done under the previous rehabilitation project. Completion of the
refinery modification project just 12 months behind schedule, despite the withdrawal of
the selected contractor and the unforeseen major cyclone, was primarily due to the
dedication and training of ERL staff. The experience ERL gathered from the previous
IDA operation was evident in the efficient manner in which the project was managed;
(b)   the importance of a well focused study to identify the most appropriate and cost
effective project design and the engagement of well qualified consultants;
(c)   thorough project preparation, strengthening of the implementing agency and the design
of an appropriate and realistic implementation strategy are prerequisites for successful
project implementation;
(d)   the need to engage consultants of the appropriate qualifications and experience early in
the project implementation cycle to assist the implementing agency as well as to keep
such consulting support to the bare minimum to ensure meaningful involvement of
ERL staff in the implementation of the project; a parallel lesson both for IDA and GOB
is the need to avoid multiplicity of consultants and the duplication or over-lapping of
functions;
(e)   the need for implementing agencies to have adequate authority to take decisions
pertaining to project matters. Only with appropriate interventions by IDA was ERL
able to get the timely support and approval of agencies above ERL for quick decisions,
which facilitated expeditious project implementation; and
(f)   the failure to implement LPG recovery and the transport and distribution components
illustrates the risks of designing project components, which are dependent on the
performance of other projects. The lesson is that the necessary supplies and other
project inputs should be assured before Board presentation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE'
General Comments
1.    Part III was reviewed by Senior staff of the ERL and LPGL. Part III is adequate, factual and
accurate.
2.    Part I of the PCR was also reviewed by ERL and LPGL. Here, again, the analysis reflects the
objectives, scope, implementation characteristics and benefits which ERL and LPGL derived from the
project. Our specific comments on various aspects of project implementation and monitoring by IDA
are given below:
(a)   As a general comment, we consider IDA's monitoring procedures at times to be
restrictive. Greater latitude for the implementing agencies to make decisions on
procurement related matters could have been helpful.  While IDA responded and
cleared documents expeditiously, nevertheless, some delay is involved and we believe
that the implementing agencies should be given the freedom to make procurement
decisions, within the guidelines established by IDA;
(b)    With regard to the LPGL project components, we are disappointed that the Small Scale
LPG Fractionation Facility could not be implemented under the project, resulting in the
delays in the implementation of the bottling plant; and,
(c)    The procurement of 20,000 LPG cylinders and 1 00,000 regulators under the credit
increased the quantity of LPG marketed. This was one of the major benefits for LPGL
from the project.
IIDA Performance
3.    We consider the timely execution of the major components of this project to be the direct result
of cooperation between ERL, LPGL and IDA. IDA staff has been helpful and responded to our
requests readily. We appreciate particularly efforts made by IDA to finalize a contract for the refinery
modification project, which was delayed due to the selected contractor withdrawing his offer after
notification. This delayed the project by at least six months.
Lessons Learned
4.     The ERL refinery component, which represented about 65 percent of the credit was completed
just 1 2 months behind schedule despite a major catastrophic cyclone and withdrawal of the proposal of
the initially selected contractor. This was due primarily to effective project implementation and
monitoring arrangements. The project demonstrated the value of good project preparation and follow-
up.

Performance of Beneficiaries
5.    ERL and LPGL staff worked conscientiously on the respective project components. While
ERL had some familiarity with IDA's procurement procedures, initially there was some frustration on
the need to get IDA's approval on procurement.  However, as the project progressed, easy
communication with IDA was established, which made it possible to obtain clearances with minimum
delay.  IDA's staff has been most cooperative and helpful and facilitated the expeditious
implementation of the project.
