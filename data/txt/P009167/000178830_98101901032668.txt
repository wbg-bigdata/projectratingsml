NAFTOVOD OIL PIPELINE PROJECT - LOAN 1173-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
Loan 1173-YU for the Yugoslavia Oil Pipeline Project was signed on
November 19, 1975. The loan for $49.0 million was fully disbursed in June
1981 except for $0.6 million previously cancelled due to misprocurement on two
contracts. Implementation delays required postponement of the original
closing date of December 31, 1979.
This report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by
the Energy Department and the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Projects
Department. The PCR is based on the findings of a Bank mission which visited
Yugoslavia in July 1981 and documents and data furnished by the Borrower.
A copy of the PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments. The reply
is reproduced as Attachment. Appropriate changes have been made to the PCR
to refLect the Borrower's comments.
Under the selective auditing system, the project has not been
audited by OED staff.

NAFTOVOD OIL PIPELINE PROJECT - LOAN 1173-YU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.       The loan under review was for US$49 million to assist in financing a
marine terminal on the Adriatic Coast and a pipeline system to deliver
imported crude oil to inland refineries. A new entity. Jugoslavenski Naftovod
was formed by the three main regional oil and gas enterprises in Yugoslavia to
design, construct and operate the project facilities. The Executive Directors
approved the loan on November 4, 1975.
2.       The principal objective of the project was to provide an economic
means of transporting imported crude oil landed at Krk Island Terminal to
refineries in Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It was agreed with the
offtakers that the pipeline system would be ready to deliver 16 million tons
per year by May t978 and 20 million tons a year later. Actually, the pipeline
was not completed until December 1979, but because of slack demand following
the steep rise in the price of crude oil, the offtakers agreed to postpone
deliveries until January 1980 (paras. 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05). The
pipeline has been in operation since then but at a greatly reduced rate, only
6.3 million tons during 1981. The 20 million ton rate is only expected to be
reached in the year 1990. However, the Borrower, if it so elects, is largely
protected against financial loss by the oil transport agreement with the
offtakers who are required to pay 80% of the unused capacity the contract
allocates to them (para. 3.07).
3.       Project implementation was delegated to the Borrower but its
authority to carry out this task was severely limited. A council of 12
governors appointed by the founders was responsible for all policy decisions,
and overall management responsibility was held by a general director guided by
a coordinating committee of six members from the founders (para. 7.01).
4.       The final project cost excluding interest during construction was
US$525.1 million of which US$396.3 million was for local and US$128.9 million
for foreign expenditures. At appraisal the local and foreign exchange cost
were estimated to be US$183.8 million and US$193.20 million respectively
giving a total cost US$377.00 equivalent to an overrun of US$49.00 million or
39%. The cost overrun was mainly due to project changes and delays and to the
large underestimate of local costs. The latter was further compounded by the
fact that the ratio of local to foreign costs was much higher than originally
estimated, and since the local inflation rate was projected to be higher than
the international rate, the price contingency was considerably underestimated
(para. 3.08).



-v -
5.       Financial projections have remained satisfactory despite the reduced
through-put and the need to finance a sizeable cost overrun. However, future
cash flow problems could develop as a result of domestic offtakers' inability
to meet their obligations.  Further cash flow problems may result from a
dispute about price escalation with the foreign offtakers and their force
majeure claims regarding import curtailments caused by Iran-Iraq war (para.
5.07).  Economically, the project remains a sound investment, even without the
benefit derived from foreign transit oil (paras. 6.01 through 6.05).
6.       On completion of the construction phase, the Borrower became a full
fledged commercial enterprise with essentially full autonomy over its
activities except for policy matters which remained the prerogative of the
governing council. The enterprise has a competent staff recruited from the
local refineries which were able to provide a manpower pool with the requisite
skills. Its operational and managerial performance has been entirely
satisfactory (paras. 7.01 and 7.02).
7.       Experience has shown that project implementation involving more than
one jurisdiction in Yugoslavia can result in complications and delays. In two
instances regional and parochial interests of the founders led to
misprocurement on Bank financial contracts, and resulted in the cancellation
of US$582,000 of the loan (para. 7.05).
8.       Although the Bank loan covered only a modest portion of the estimated
project cost (13%), the fact that the Bank was helping to finance the project
played an important role in attracting other lenders. Two loans in the amount
of US$195 million by Kuwait and Lybia were contingent on the Bank's
participating in the project finances (para. 8.01).

Naftovod Oil Pipeline Project - Loan 1173-YU
I. lntroduction
1.01     The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and three oil and gas
enterprises of Yugoslavia --INA, Naftagas and Energoinvest-- requested the
Bank ito help finance a pipeline system to transport imported crude oil from an
Adriat-ic port to refineries in Yugoslavia and to Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
YugosLavia's main energy resources are lignite, coal and hydropower. Total
fossi:L fuel reserves are estimated at 4100 million tons of oil equivalent
(toe) with low grade coal and lignite accounting for 97% and hydrocarbons only
3%.  Despite large coal reserves Yugoslavia is not self-sufficient in energy
and has to rely on imports of hydrocarbons and coking coal to satisfy
internal demand. This is principally due to the low quality of lignite and
brown coal which prohibits transport over long distances and limits its use to
power and steam generation. Domestic oil production has not kept pace with
the growing demand and the country has had to rely on imports from Russia and
the Mi.ddle East to meet the requirements of its six refineries. It was
estimated that import of crude would increase from 7.9 million tons in 1975 to
28 million tons in 1980, most of it from the Middle East through the Adriatic
ports. With the exception of Rijeka, all the Yugoslav refineries are located
inland and were being supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges and rail
tank cars. It was rightly considered that the volumes of imports required by
1980 to supply the refineries and the countries could not be economically
transported by conventional means and that the only feasible solution would be
a pipetline system connecting the port of entry with the inland refinereis and
with Hungary.
1.02     On November 4, 1975 the Executive Directors approved the US$49
million loan to Yugoslavia to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of a
pipeline system comprising a marine oil terminal and a 750 km pipeline
togeth,er with ancillary facilities to be built from the Adriatic coast to
Lendava and the Hungarian border in the north and to Novi Sad and Pancevo in
the east. Stage I of the project comprising facilities to transport 16
million tons of crude oil per annum was to be completed by mid-1978 and Stage
II, increasing the capacity to 20 million tons, by mid-1979.
1.03     The principal oil and gas enterprises of Yugoslavia --The Founders--
INA of Croatia, Energoinvest of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Naftagas of Serbia--
jointly established a new enterprise, Jugoslavenski Naftovod, to design, build
and operate the port and pipeline facilities. The loan agreement for US$49
million was signed between this new enterprise as the borrwer, and the Bank on
November 19, 1975; the loan became effective on February 28, 1976.
1.04     This was the first loan by the Bank to Yugoslavia for an oil pipeline
project, although in 1973 the Bank approved a loan for a gas pipeline.
Overall the Bank has approved a total of 23 loans amounting to US$1,248.4
million in the tranpsort sector (12 for highways, 7 for railways, 2 for ports
and 2 for pipelines) and five loans totalling US$288 million in the power
sector as of March 1, 1982.

1.05     This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission that visited
Yugoslavia in July 1981 and the documents and data furnished by the borrower.
II. Project Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     Investigations for a pipeline project were first initiated by
Yugoslav authorities in 1970-71 but were de:Layed by competing regional
interests. Various areas on the Adriatic coast were considered and two
different systems were proposed but it was not possible to reach interregional
agreement as to which was better. In 1972, within the framework of the
Yugoslav Transport Survey, the Bank reviewed the two proposed projects and
concluded that the least cost alternative would be a system originating in the
area of Rijeka (Rijeka Bay) and connecting all the refinereis, with a branch
line to Hungary, primarily because of its proximity to the refineries and
because of the reduced length of mountainous terrain that the pipeline would
have to traverse as compared to other areas.   Thereafter (July 1973) the
three oil and gas enterprises of Yugoslavia jointly established a new
enterprise, Jugoslavenski Naftovod, to design, build and operate the
pipeline. Following the Bank Annual Meeting in Nairobi (September 1973) the
Bank decided that it might participate with a limited amount in the financing
of this system provided Yugoslavia would define a rational policy for the
overall development and utilization of the energy resources available to the
country.
2.02     A Bank identification mission went to Yugoslavia in December 1973 and
inter-alia, suggested that experienced consultants be appointed to prepare a
detailed project proposal including a complete definition of the project,
reliable cost estimates, relevant data for an economic evaluation and a
suitable financing plan. After further discussion with a Yugoslav delegation
in Washington it was agreed that the study would be undertaken by a Yugoslav
consultant in collaboration with a foreign consultant. This study was
completed by July 1974 and submitted to the Bank in Augsut 1974.  Thereafter a
preappraisal mission visited Yugoslavia in September 1974 and discussed
various details of the project and the financing plan. It was agreed that
additional studies would be undertaken in order to optimize tanker unloading
facilities including oil storage capacity, crude oil despatching procedures
and pipelines diameter before the project was appraised. It was also agreed
that the energy sector study carried out by the Federal Secretary for Economy
late in 1973 (which provided justification for the project) that was being
updated by a new committee --The Federal Committee for Energy and Industry--
would be made available prior to appraisal.
2.03     The appraisal, originally scheduled for November 1974, actually took
place in January 1975 because of the delay in collating the data mentioned in
the preceding para. The project as defined at appraisal comprised the
following:
(a)  construction of two marine oil berths on KrK island in Omisalji Bay
capable of handling tankers from 30,000 to 350,000 DWT, and
procurement of two tugs of 2,000 HP each plus other floating craft;
(b)  construction of pipeline system of about 736 km (18 to 36 inches
diameter) from the port in the island of KrK across the Strait of



- 3 -
Omisalj in the Adriatic to five inland refineries and to the
Yugoslav-Hungarian border;
(c) construction of oil storage tank farms with a capacity of about
900,000 M3 and seven pumping stations;
(dl) procurement and installation of a supervisory control system
including telecommunications, telemetering and telecontrol; and
(e*) provision of related engineering services.
(a map of the pipeline system is attached)
The project was to be carried out in two stages: Stage I to provide for an
annual throughout capacity of 16 million tons and Stage II to provide for an
annual. throughput capacity of 20 million tons. The system was also to be
designed to permit eventual expansion to an annual throughput capacity of 34
millicon tons.
2.04     The project was estimated to cost US$400 million (including interest
during construction of US$23 million) of which US$216.2 represented foreign
exchange. A special feature of this project was that it was to be financed
entirely with borrowed funds, US$294 million coming from foreign and US$106
milion from local sources. Initially only US$30 million was proposed as the
Bank loan, later at the time of negotiations, this was raised to US$49 million
as it was felt that the smaller amount would be insufficient to enable the
Bank to finance the foreign exchange costs of consulting and construction
services (along with some equipment items) throughout the implementation
period, this was considered to be the minimum level of participation that
would enable the Bank to obtain a satisfactory degree of influence over the
implementation of the project. A loan of US$49 million represented about 13%
of the project cost whilst that of US$30 million would have represented only
about 8%. The other foreign loans were as follows:
Amount      Interest rate  Grace Period        Repayment
US$ million      Annual %          Years           Years
Kuwait                125.0             8.5               4               8
Libya                  70.0             9.0               3               7
Hungary                25.0             8.2               3               6
Czechoslavakia         25.0             9.0               3               7
Total             245.0
The loan from Kuwait was to include about 58,000 tons of pipe representing
about 33% of its loan and the rest in cash. The Czech loan was to be in the
form of 28-in pipe (about 15,000 tons) and construction services for the
Sisak-Hungarian border pipeline. The Hungarian and Libyan loans were to be in
convertible currency.

2.05     The Bank loan was to meet the foreign exchange costs of consultants,
civil works (excluding project materials) and loading arms for the two
berths. Since securing of finance, both foreign and local, was crucial to the
implementation of the project, a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan
was the effectiveness of the other loans.
III. Implementation
Background
3.01     At the time of appraisal, transport agreements were concluded with
the local and foreign offtakers providing for the commencement of deliveries
of stipulated quantities of oil from 1978 and the payment of penalties in case
of failure to transport the stipulated quantities. Therefore, completion of
the project by 1978 was of prime concern and the implementation schedule was
drawn up accordingly, Stage I to be completed by May 1978 and Stage II one
year later. This required that Naftovod place orders for pipe and long lead
materials for Stage I in late 1975 and the starting of site clearing, grading
and blasting in Omisalji by the beginning of 1976, with the pipeline
construction starting soon thereafter. However, valuable time was lost,
mostly through no fault of the Borrower, in arranging financing and resolving
procurement problems. For example, for the Omisalji-Sisak pipeline, the two
lowest tenderers were unresponsive and the third lowest delayed signing the
contract until the bid bond expired, thus forcing the borrower to lengthy
negotiations with the fourth lowest bidder.

3/   Originally scheduled with each station



3.04     Additional reasons for delay were as follows:
(a) The Omisalji-Sisak Pipeline was completed by 4/79 except for the
Adriatic crossing which had to await the completion of the arches of
the bridge (being built by the local authorities with a financial
contribution from the borrower) until 9/79. Had a submarine pipeline
been constructed (as was the original intention) there would have
been a saving of six months.
(b) Melnice pump station was delayed partly because of some difficulty in
design work and partly because of inclement weather.
(c) At Dobra station, planned for completion towards the end of the
construction period, the discovery of caverns resulted in a slight
change of location and filling of some of the caverns with concrete,
causing delays in design work and execution.
(d) Provision of increased storage capacity.
(e) Slow work by a local contractor resulted in half of the Sisak-
Bosanski Brod section being given to another contractor after time-
consuming negotiations.
(f) The Sisak-Gola line which was to be completed by 12/79 by a
Czechoslovak contractor had to be given to another contractor because
the former was unable to perform and this resulted in delay and
expense.
(g) It was decided to move the Bosanski Brod termianl close to the
refinery across the river, and this resulted in two unforeseen river
crossings and a delay of about nine months.
(h) Cathodic protection --about 20 power companies had to be coordinated
and mobilized to instal short lines and transformers-- a time-
consuming process.
3.06     The pipeline was commissioned in December 1979, the Omisalji storage
receiving first crude in October 1979, and the different sections of the
pipeline being filled and the different pumping stations being started up
between December 1979 and December 1980.
Achieviements of Objectives
3.07     The project has achieved the objective of providing an economical
means of transport for crude oil from the coast to the various refineries. It
was expected that Stage I would be ready by May 1978 with a capacity of 16
million tons and Stage II a year later with a capacity of 20 million tons. In
actual execution, however, the pipeline was commissioned only in 12/79 after
both stages had been completed. Compared to the anticipated completion of
Stage I, there was a delay of 18 months, but with reference to the project as
a whole there was a delay of only 7 months. Further, the delay did not
materially affect the operations of the borrower nor the offtakers, since, due
to the high cost of imported crude oil the expected growth in demand did not
materialize and the offtakers agreed to postpone their use of the pipeline
until 1980.

Project Costs
3.08     The project has been completed except for some small items of project
expenditure that are still to be incurred. Iaking into account the
expenditure that has been incurred and provid[ing for the items that are still
to be incurred the total project cost amounts to US$525.1 million (excluding
interest during construction) as against the appraisal estimate of US$377
million --a cost overrun of about 39%. Actual and estimated costs are
compared in Table 1. Because of the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
Yug. Dinar, vis-a-vis the dollar, the cost overrun expressed in Yug. Dinars
would be about 63%. The main reasons for this increase are analyzed below:
Extra Costs
Million US$
(a)  For operational, ecological and social considerations
the total length of the pipeline was increased from
733.9 km to 763.1 km and the weight of pipes for the
Omisalji-Sisak section increased from 33,000 tons to
46,400tons because of the extended length of the
pipeline and because of the increased thickness to
provide for a higher safety coefficient requested
after appraisal by the local authorit:ies                       16.7
(b) Extra pumping horsepower required as a result of
lower pump efficiencies, longer pipel.ines and speed
increasers                                                       4.4
(c) Bridge crossing instead of submarine crossing from
KrK island to the mainland                                       2.6
(d) Larger plot plants, extra buildings and additional
floor space in the buildings over thal: provided in
the preliminary design                                          11.9
(e) Relocation of the Bosanski Brod terminal requiring a
longer tie-line and two extra river  crossings                   4.1
(f) Provision of a bubble barrier instead of a floating
boom for oil spill control at the tanker terminal,
relocation of Dobra pump station and longer tie lines
at Sisak due to relocation of the main line to
protect it from earthquakes                                      4.4
(g) Increased yearly inflation rates, in excess of
appraisal estimate, affecting both local and foreign
costs                                                           32.2
(h) Telemetry and telecontrol which was made up 'Largely
of cable instead of microwave for security reasons                7.9

Disbursements
3.09     Delay in project implementation affected the disbursement schedule of
the loan. The table below compares the actual disbursements with the
appra:isal forecast:

Barring the first year when there was no disbursement and the second year when
disbursement were rather low because of the delay in the commencement of
operat:ions, the profile of disbursement was not significantly different from
that forecast.
Performance of Consultants
3.10     The borrower assigned overall design responsibility to a local
consuting firm assisted by a foreign firms who were responsible for basic
designs, tender preparations, project coordination and the other items listed
in Annex 3 of the appraisal report. The borrower assigned construction
supervision to a second local firm assisted by the foreign consultants.
Generally the performance of the consultants was satisfactory. The principal
local consultants were pressured by the three owners to sub-contract to other
local firms on the basis of parochial and regional considerations, and while
some cf this was expected at appraisal, the impact was not then fully
anticipated. The plethora of local sub-contracts caused problems in
coordination and moderately delayed the progress of implementation, but this
was unavoidable in the context of the decentralized Yugoslav politico-economic
system. Further, the foreign consultants were perhaps too pliant and inclined
to accept various proposals without effective questioning even though they
involved delay and expense. This was due in part to the hostile environment
and partial vacuum in which they worked and also because the borrower did not
have confidence in their staff. Had the foreign consultant provided a more
senior and aggressive team, many gf the problems would have been avoided and
progress would have been smoother.
Performance of Contractors
3.11     The performance of the various contractors was generally
satisfactory, and some of the experienced ones were very good. For example,
the contractor who did the tanker terminal completed the work on schedule



- 8 -
without creating any problems. Because of parochial and regional
considerations (i.e. the tendency to balance the interests of the three
regions in which the three founding enterprises are located by dividing the
work among enterprises from those regions) a large number of construction and
equipment contracts (many not financed by the Bank) were entered into
resulting in problems of coordination and supervision which were not antipated
at appraisal. But, considering the regional competition inherent in
interregional projects, this was perhaps inevitable and, under the
circumstances, it can be said that the overall performance was satisfactory.
IV. Throughput and Operations
4.01     The pipeline has been in operation since December 1979.  A spot
inspection of the oil terminal and some tank farms and pumping stations
revealed that the facilities were manned by competent personnel and being
operated efficiently and maintained adequately.
4.02     The substantial increase in the price of foreign crude has forced the
Federal Government to introduce various measures to conserve and substitute
energy thereby restricting the import of crude. Th,erefore, because of
circumstances beyond the control of the borrower, the pipeline is being
operated very much below its capacity of 20 million tons per annum. As
against the estimated throughput of 19.8 million tons during 1980, the actual
quantity transported was only 5.1 million and the estimate for the year 1981
is only 6.3 million tons. According to current estimates, the crude oil that
the pipeline can be expected to handle is likely to increase to only about 14
million tons by 1985. The economic and financial implications of this
shortfall in the throughput are analyzed separately.
V. Financial Performance
5.01     At the time of appraisal the financial projections were based on the
assumption that the pipeline would be commissioned by mid-1978 and that full
operations would start by mid-1979. The pipeline was actually commissioned
only in December 1979 with the full capacity of 20 million tons and commercial
operations started only from January 1980. Consequently for comparison with
actuals only the figures for 1980 are available.
5.02     Further, as stated in part IV above, the pipeline is operating below
capacity. On the basis of the actual quantities of crude that are likely to
be transported, the annual income of the borrower will be limited. But the
borrower is legally protected from financial difficulties because of the
provision in the agreements with the offtakers that transport costs will be
payable for the full reserved quantities each year whether transported or
not. The original agreement with the offtakers provided for a yearly
transport of crude oil to the five refineries in Yugoslavia and to Hungary and
Czechoslovakia ranging from 8.3 million tons in 1978 to 27.4 £' llion tons in
1985. Just before commissioning of the pipeline, Naftovod agreed with the
offtakers to delay the commencement of operations from 1978 No 1980 and to
provide for a yearly transport of crude oil ranging from 27.9 million tons in
1980 to 34.8 million tons in 1985.
5.03     Though the existing capacity of the pipeline is ony 20 million tons
per year, the increased quantities specifiedl above were agreed upon because



- 9 -
most of the capital investment for a throughput of 34 million tons has already
been incurred and only a small additional investment is now required to
increase the capacity beyond 20 million tons to 34 million. Domestic
refineries are required to pay transportation costs on the basis of the toal
fixed operating costs of the relevant section of the pipeline for transporting
the reserved quantities (the fixed costs including the amount required for
repayment of loans that is not covered by normal depreciation, as also
interest charges) plus variable costs in proportion to the actual quantities
transported and allowing for a surplus of about 11% of the operating costs.
Foreign offtakers are to pay transportation costs on the basis of a basic rate
per ton plus escalation calculated annually on the changes in the cost of
steel, electricity and labor, 80% of such costs being paid as penalty for any
unused capacity.
5.04     Because of the increase in the cost of the project Naftovod had to
procure additional financing, partly local and partly from foreign sources. A
complete list of the financing obtained for the project is given in Table 2.
5.05     At the time of appraisal it was assumed that the port facilities
would be entrusted for operation to the port of Rijeka (or similar
organization) on an annual charge which would cover at least the debt charges
(estirnated at Din. 89.9 million) on the capital investment involved.
Naftovod, however, has entered into a different agreement with the port of
Rijeka under which (a) the two tugs have been leased to the port on payment of
an annual fee; (b) the port will use the tugs to render the services required
by the tankers on a priority basis; and (c) Naftovod will be free to collect
berthing and other normal port charges from the tankers. Also, at the time of
appraisal it was assumed that the line fill would be provided by the Federal
Directorate for Reserves of Foodstuffs and Strategic Stocks (MATRIZ); but on
commissioning of the pipeline, the line fill has been provided by the local
refineries.
5.06     Taking into account the increased cost of the project (and the
conseq[uent increased debt service obligations and depreciation charges) and
the other changes mentioned above a revised statement of income and
expenditure as compared to appraisal estimates for the period 1978-1985 is
given in Table 3. Salaries and wages have been escalated at 16% per annum and
electricity charges, maintenance and sundry expenses at 10% per annum.
Revised statements of balance sheet and of cash flow for the same period are
also in Tables 4 and 5.
5.07     Though the financial projections show a satisfactory picture, in
actual practice Naftovod is likely to experience a cash flow problem because
of the inability of the offtakers to meet their obligations. Legally
speaking, Naftovod is fully covered, in view of the agreements with the
refineries (supported by Bank Guarantees) that transportation costs will be
paid for the reserved quantities. But the refineries do not have the
requisite foreign exchange to buy foreign crude and are operating far below
their rated capacity with serious repercussions on their finances and
consequently their ability to pay. During 1980, as against a cash requirement
of Din. 1,857 million, Naftovod actually received only Din. 1,451 million and
was, therefore, forced to resort to short-term borrowings from local banks.
The pcsition is expected to improve this year, but with the continued
operation of the refineries below capacity, the possibility of a serious cash



- 10 -
problem cannot be ruled out. Further, Naftovod is having difficulties with
the foreign off-takers who are disputing the price of steel in the escalation
formula and are also invoking the Force Majeure clause in the agreement to
avoid liability because of the Iran-Iraq war which has curtailed their
imports. It is understood that arbitration proceedings are being resorted
to. Consequently the satisfactory position reflected in the cash flow
statement might not materialize and Naftovod might have to resort to short-
term borrowings from banks.
Financial Covenant
5.08     In contravention of sec. 5.12 of the Loan Agreement, annual financial
statements audited and certified by the Social Accounting Service have not
been furnished by Naftovod. However though there is a technical breach of the
covenant, Naftovod is not really in default since it has been submitting the
statements to the Yugoslav audit authorities who have held them in abeyance
because under Yugoslav regulations annual statements of new enterprises whose
assets are under construction need not be audited until such enterprises are,
on completion of construction, changed to operating enterprises. Naftovod has
been formally transferred into an operating enterprise from 6/81 and the
annual financial statements will be audited and certified from the year ending
December 1981 onwards. This does not imply that the accounting transactions
of Naftovod have not been subject to any audit; they have been under
continuous audit since all vouchers had to be passed by the Social Accounting
Service before they could be presented to the Bank for payment (see para. 4 of
Annex 4 of Appraisal Report).
VI. Economic Evaluation
6.01     The economic return was estimated in terms of the equalizing discount
rate between the pipeline costs and those of the next best alternative mode of
transporting crude to the offtakers. At appraisal this was calculated to be
50% and sensitivity analysis indicated that if throughput were 15% below the
level estimated for 1990 of 34 million tons, the return would be reduced to
about 43%. The reevaluation estimates the return at 30% or only 25% if
transit oil traffic does not materialize.
6.02     The re-evaluation estimates that throughput in 1990 will reach only
20 million tons (the capacity of the pipeline) and then, only if transit
traffic to Hungary and Czechoslovakia develops rapidly. In view of the
failure of this traffic to come up to appraisal expectations and because of
the present dispute between the parties, the project benefits were re-
evaluated on two alternatives bases: with a growing but lower volume of
transit traffic than forecast at appraisal; and without any transit
traffic.l/ Yugoslav demand for imported crude oil is forecast by the
Government to increase at about 7% per annum (Annex 1, Table 1). In view of
Yugoslavia's comparatively low per capita consumption of petroleum at present,
the Government may find difficulty in restricting growth to a 7% annual rate
and this is therefore a conservative basis on which to evaluate the
1/ Disappearance of transit traffic reduces rate of return by only 5% (from
30-25%); eliminating growth in domestic throughput would reduce the rate of
return by a further 5% to about 20%.



-11 - 
project.I/ Yugoslavia's largest refinery, at Rijeka, is expected to reduce
its intake from 1981 to 1983 and the refineries supplied by the pipeline to
increase their intake, so that pipeline throughput, excluding transit oil,
will increase at an average of about 11% per annum over the period 1981-88; if
Naftovod's estimate for transit oil is included, pipeline throughput shows a
17% growth rate over the same period.
6.03     The re-evaluation takes as economic benefits of the project the
saviag in railway capital and operating costs which would have been incurred
without the pipeline. This is essentially the same approach as that used in
the appraisal report, except that barge transport was eliminated as an
alternative since it is no longer regarded as feasible or competitive by the
Yugoslavs.
6.04     The appraisal report estimated that transport of the 34 million tons
of oil then forecast for 1990 would require the acquisition of some 12,500
rail tank cars and 750 locomotives, and of an unspecified number of barges and
pusher tugs. The re-evaluation indicates that, without the pipeline, the tank
car fleet would have to be expanded by 11,635 cars between 1981 and 1990; in
addiition, replacements over this same period (estimated at 5% per annum) would
have totalled about 5,870 (Annex 1, Table 6). Insufficient detail is
avaiLable on the appraisal calculation to reconcile the differences between
theses figures, but a major factor is clearly the appraisal report assumption
that, in the "without" case, a proportion of the oil would move by barge. The
assumptions underlying the re-evaluation are shown explicitly in Annex 1 Table
6, and are reasonable. It was conservatively assumed that no additions to the
locomotive fleet would be required, but that traffic growth would be handled
through improved productivity of the existing fleet. Tank cars made surplus
by the pipeline are treated as a sunk cost.
6.05     The calculation of the railway operating cost savings by construction
of the pipeline is based on rail tariffs for the routes involved. The
railways are operating at a substantial deficit and if tariffs were high
enough to cover this deficit the project benefits would be corresppondingly
higher. On the other hand, the tariffs should cover an indeterminate amount
of depreciation for the routes involved. The amount of this depreciation is
roughly equivalent to the amount of the deficit, and therefore, tariffs are a
reasonable proxy for economic operating costs on the routes concerned. The
appraisal report used a figure of Din. 0.17 per ton-km for operating costs;
the re-evaluation figures range between Din. 0.54 and Din. 0.67 per ton-km.
The difference could easily be accounted for by inflation and depreciation of
the <linar since 1975, when the project was appraised. Complete details of the
assurnptions on which the economic costs and benefits were based are contained
in Annex 1.
Conclusion
6.06     Notwithstanding higher capital costs and substantially lower
throughput volumes than those anticipated at the time of appraisal of the
1/ Disappearance of transit traffic reduces rate of return by only 5% (from
30-25%); eliminating growth in domestic throughput would reduce the rate of
return by a further 5% to about 20%

project, the pipeline was a sound investment because of its substantial
savings in railway capital and operating costs. Even without any transit oil,
and operating at a third of the volumes forecast for 1990, the project remains
clearly justified.
VII. Institutional Development and Performance
Background
7.01     Yugoslavenski Naftovod was a new enterprise especially created by the
three principal oil and gas enterprises of Yugoslavia to design and build a
tanker terminal and pipeline system for the t:ransport of imported crude oil.
During the period of construction of the project Naftovod was an "Enterprise
under Foundation' governed by a council of 12 members responsible for policy
decisions and managed by a General Director guided by a coordinating committee
of six members, two from each of the three founders. About 40 staff had been
appointed at the time of appraisal, and this figure was progressively
increased until the time of commissioning in December 1980 the number was
390. Their distribution is given below:
Rijeka                          31
Omisalji Terminal              108
Zagreb                          83
Sisak Terminal                  79
Virje Terminal                  22
B. Brod Terminal                38
Nisad Terminal                  27
Beograd                          2
390
Upon commissioning Naftovod became a full-fledged commercial enterprise
("Enterprise in Operation") and at that time gained greater autonomy.
Organization and Management
7.02     On commissioning of the project the enterprise was converted from a
construction enterprise to an operating enterprise and the governing council
substituted by a worker's council with the coordinating committee now only
looking after the interests of the founders rather than making major decisions
as done previously. The enterprise now has five departments --namely,
Technical, Economic and Financial, Legal, Personnel, Commercial and
Operations. The enterprise being new and having become operational only
recently it is perhaps premature to comment on its operational and managerial
competence as a commercial enterprise, though its performance as a
construction enterprise was satisfactory and its performance so far as an
operating enterprise has been quite good.  As explained below, it is manned by
competent staff and there is no reason to feel that its operations will be
other than efficient.
Staffing and Training
7.03     Since experienced staff were available in the various refineries
there was no difficulty in recruiting skilled perscnnel who required only
familiarization with the new facilities and the pipeline's operating

procedures. Further, the limited training that was envisaged at the time of
appraisal and referred to in Sec. 3.04 of the Loan Agreement has been
provided, a total of 70 personnel having been trained in different skills aL
different locations as detailed below:

7.04     An inspection of some of the facilities during the last supervision
in July 1981 showed excellent to good housekeeping and care of equipment. The
operators were knowledgeable and efficient and there was ample evidence that
the facilities were manned by competent personnel.
Project Managment
7.05     The project management team was a mixture of experienced and
inexperienced people. During the peak period of construction about 38 staff
were in the technical department. However, field inspection was done by a
local consultant and the owner's representatives checked on the latter and the
contractors. Because of cumbersome working arrangements with too many
designers the work of project management was both onerous and delicate. In
addition, because of conflicting regional and parochial interests of the
owners or founders, the project manager's hands at times were tied such as in
the case wherein the Bank had the unpleasant duty of cancelling part of the
loan (a sum of US$470,000 was cancelled in July 1977 and a further sum of
US$112,000 in July 1978) --for misprocurement because of failure on the part
of the coordinating committee to follow the Bank guidelines for international
competitive bidding. In addition there was a general feeling that sufficient
local talent was available to do the job efficiently and consequently a
reluctance to employ foreign consultants and contractors who, in some
instances, might have been more efficient. These factors tended to affect
adversely the efficient management of project implementation which, however,
was in general, quite good.
VIII. The Role of The Bank
8.01     Initial Bank involvement in the project was confined to examination
of a number of alternative proposals to supply Yugoslavia's dispersed inland
refineries network, with no intention of seeking Bank financing for this
purpose. Following the examination of several alternatives, it became clear
that the only feasible solution would be a pipeline connecting the Adriatic
port of entry with the inland refineries and with Hungary. Once the
Government was convinced of the viability of the pipeline solution it not only
took the necessary steps to prepare the design of the pipeline system, but
pressed the Bank's senior management (at the Nairobi meeting) for Bank



- 14 -
financial assistance as well. During appraisal and subsequently, it was made
clear to Bank staff by representatives from Libya and Kuwait that these
countries would not participate in co-financing the project without the Bank's
involvement. Therefore, Bank financing attracted US$195 million equivalent of
financing from Kuwait and Libya.
8.02     Throughout the implementation period., the Bank was able to provide
assistance in contract packaging and grouping; procurement, prequalification of
contractors and several design matters. The Bank's relations with the
borrower were good throughout in spite of the two cancellations due to
misprocurement.
8.03     The project, during its early stages, was used as a vehicle for a
dialogue with the Federal Government on energy matters. Thanks to the general
interest in the project, the Federal authorities agreed to the Bank
undertaking an overall energy study in the context of the 1974/75 world energy
scenario. Even though the Government rejected many of the specific
recommendations of this first study because they viewed it as lacking
relevance in the context of Yugoslav socio-economic system, both they and the
Bank learned from the experience and the subsequent dialogue has become more
productive with many of the actions having been taken along the lines of the
initial recommendations.
IX. Conclusions
901     Even though crude oil shipments were started 18 months behind
schedule, the project was well implemented. In spite of the energy crises
that occurred during implementation, the project is economically sound. In
retrospect, given the much slower growth in oil imports compared to appraisal
estimates, the pipeline diameters could have been reduced by about 25% with
savings in investment and increased economic benefits of about 10%.
9.02     The foreign consultants were proper:Ly utilized in the beginning of
the project; they did the basic design of the project, a task which could not
have been done by Yugoslav consultants. However, during implementation, the
foreign consultants were not properly utilized due in part to the borrowers'
uncooperative attitude towards foreign consu:Ltants and to a lesser extent to
the nature of the personnel provided by the foreign consulting firm. There
are no easy solutions to these problems, and they will probably recur in
future projects in Yugoslavia.

ANNEX 1
YUGOSLAVIA
Oil Pipeline Completion Report
Economic Justification - Background and Assumptions
Crude Oil Demand
1.         Demand for immorted crude oil is expected to grow at 7% per annum
from 10.8 million tons in 1981 to 14.2 million tons in 1985. Both of these
figures are officially approved figures and are reasonable. The volume of
imported crude oil for Yugoslav internal consumption was projected to 1989
at the same rate of 7% per annum.  Domestically produced crude oil is expected
to grow from 3.2 million tons in 1981 to 3.6 million tons in 1989, an increase
averaging 1.5% per annum.
Refinery Intake (Table 1)
2.         Construction of this oil pipeline and a new refinery at Skopje,
which is expected to come on stream in 1982, will progressively change the
present pattern of crude oil intake. Intake at Rijeka refinery, the country's
largest, will fall from 5.25 million tons in 1980 to about 3.5 million tons
in 1983-84 before rising to about 6 million tons in 1988-89. At the same time,
intake at refineries supplied by the pipeline will increase steadily at about
11% per annum until 1987 at which point they will be operating close to capa-
city if supplies of domestic crude oil come up to expectations. It is assumed
that Skopje refinery will be supplied by rail through Greece.  These changes
in supply patterns should substantially reduce the costs of distribution of
refined products.
Pipeline Throughput (Table 2)
3.         Notwithstanding the failure of refineries in Hungary and Czecho-
slovakia to take their contracted volumes, Naftovod forecast "transit" oil to
increase from 1.4 million tons in 1981 (none has been shipped to date in 1981)
to 4 million tons in 1985. This growth trend has been projected to 1990 when
total throughput reaches the capacity of the Omisalj to Sisak section (20 million
tons). In view of the dispute between the parties to the transit oil agreement,
and as long as supplies of oil can be obtained by Hungary and Czechoslovakia from
the U.S.S.R. at prices significantly lower than those prevailing in world markets,
Naftovod's expectations regarding transit oil may continue to be disappointed.
Consequently, an alternative forecast assumes no throughput of transit oil; with
those Yugoslav refineries which are supplied by the pipelines being close to their
capacities by 1990, this alternative forecast implies that pipeline throughput will
stagnate at a level of about 13.0 million tors, or about 65% of capacity. It
should be noted that, to the extent that Yugcslavia receives penalty payments
from Hungary and Czechoslovakia to compensate for lower volumes of transit oil
than covenanted, the loss of economic benefits will be borne by Hungary and Czecho-
slovakia, but in view of the political ramifications it is difficult to predict
the outcome of any negotiations.

ANNEX 1
Economic Costs
4.         The economic capital costs of the project were derived by deducting
Customs duty of 469.2 million dinars from total capital costs of 10,459.2
million dinars and converting the resulting figure of 9990 million dinars to
U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate prevailing in each year of the
project for the expenditures made in that year. This gives economic capital
costs of US$501.5 million (Table 3).
5.         Economic operating costs were supplied by Naftovod for the years
1980-85, and were projected on a consistent basis through 1988 (Table 4). To
obtain economic costs of operating the pipeline in the absence of transit oil
traffic, the cost of electricity, the only truly variable costs, was adjusted
downwards on the basis of ton-km. While this probably overstates operating
costs without transit traffic, it is a reasonable and conservative approximation.
The pipeline ton-km used in these calculations are shown in Table 5; they are
significantly less than the rail ton-km used in the calculation of economic
benefits, because the route-km for the pipeline are less than the route-km for
the railway.
Economic Benefits
6.         The economic benefits of the project consist of the avoided capital
and operating costs of the alternative railway transport. The appraisal report
compared pipeline costs against an alternative consisting of a combination of
rail and inland water transport; however, it is understood that barge transport
is no longer considered practical or competitive and, therefore, the re-
evaluation compares only against the costs of the railway alternative.
7.         The appraisal report estimated that transport of the 34 million tons
of oil then forecast for 1990 would require the acquisition of some 12,50C rail
tank cars and 750 locomotives and of (an unspecified number of) barges and
pusher tugs. The re-evaluation (Table 6) indicates that, in the absence of the
pipeline, the tank car fleet would have to be expanded by 11,635 cars between
1981 and 1990; in addition, replacements over this same period (estimated at 5%
per annum) would have totalled about 5,870. Insufficient detail is available
of the appraisal calculation to reconcile the differences between these figures,
but a major factor is clearly the appraisal report assumption that, in the with-
out case, a proportion of the oil would move by barge. The assumptions under-
lying the re-evaluation are shown explicitly in Table 6, and are reasonable. It
was conservatively assumed that no additions to the locomotive fleet would be
required, but that the extra traffic would be handled through improved produc-
tivity of the existing fleet. The railways have suffered a substantial loss of
traffic as a result of the pipeline, and have a surplus of tank cars. However,
these surplus cars can be leased to other European railways and, in any case,
are treated as a sunk cost for the purposes of the economic evaluation.
8.         The re-evaluation of railway operating costs (Table 7) is based on
rail tariffs provided by Naftovod. We feel that the current deficit on the
routes in question (offset by a subsidy) approximates depreciation charges and



- 22 -
ANNEX 1
other non-economic costs. Therefore, rail tariffs seem to be a reasonable
proxy for economic costs. The appraisal report used a figure of Din. 0.17
per ton-km for operating costs. The re-evaluation figures range between
Din. 0.65 and Din. 0.67 per ton-km; the difference could easily be accounted
for by inflation and depreciation of the dinar since 1975, when the project
was appraised.
Economic Return
9.       The foregoing benefits, which are stumsrized in Table 8, yield on
equalizing return of 30%, compared with 50% at appraisal. If it is assumed
that no transit oil is shipped through the pipeline, the benefits are reduced
as shovn in Table' 9, and the economic return is reduced to 25%.
Conclusion
10.      Notwithstanding higher capital costs and substantially lower through-
put volumes, the pipeline was a sound investment because of its substantial
savings in railway capital and operating costs. Even without any transit
oil, and operating at a third of the forecast volumes, the project remains
clearly justified.

2.  Excludes depreciation, taxes and interest.
3. Value of tank cars which would have had to be purchased in the absence
of the pipeline (Annex ). From 1991 onwards, the value of replacement
cars only is used.
4. Estimated incremental economic cost of transporting oil by rail instead
of pipeline. Benefits are in line with pipeline throughput until 1990,
when the pipeline capacity is reached.
5.  Economic benefits exclude a benefit derived from postponement by at least
5 years in the need for increased railway track capacity between Rijeka
and Zagreb. The planned project, which includes a 25 km tunnel, would
cost possibly as much as US$500 million. Postponement by 5 years of such
a project would yield annual savings of US$60 million at a 12% cost of
capital.

Subject: Project Completion Report
on Yugoslavia Oil PIpeline - Loan 1173 YU
Dear Mr. Kapur,
Thank you very much for your "Project Completion Report on
Yugoslavia Oil Pipeline - Loan 1173 YU", which we received
in February 1983 and which we immediately analized at the
level of our administrations and consequently we would like
to bring forth the following:
Your report is prepared correctly and it represents our
Project in all stages of implementation comptsing its
beckground. We emphasise that we have no remarks concerning
the data and interpretation of the same except that we somehow
desagree with the understanding of certain statements which are
components of your report, i.e:
- Page 2, Chapter II: "Conflicting regional interests": the
same formulation regards the background of the Project, that
is the preliminary appraisal of needs ald possibilities of
domestic and foreign partners for the subject Project -
transportation of crude oil by pipeline. It was only upon

the agreement of all partners and the definition of rends
for each off-taker that the decision for construction Cf:
the pipeline had been made. The earlier works represent an
optimum solution of the most suitable choice for -the pipeline
alignment and the tanker port, because possibilities fvr
their locations existed from the South to the Nt-h-
Adreatic coast. The choice was made in common by cvalI
oil economy of Yugoslavia, what is familiar to your experts

By the end of 1980 the amount of 850.000 tons of crude oil
was taken over via the Omisalj port and tank fa .
in the direction of Sisak - other refineries. Since Lhe terlrmnaL

assistance during elaboration of the design, supervision
of construction works includinq the commissioning of
particular installations and the Pro-ject as a whole. Also,
your statement "Hostile envirornment", and "vacuum - in
which they worked", as well as "did not have confidence in
their staff", is not real and does not express the real
atmosphere which was established among us. The consultant
was continually incorporated in the work from the beginning
to the end of the Project implementation, and Jugoslavenski
naftovod together with the Managements of the consultants
agreed upon the replacements of experts in particular fields,
but in fully amicable and correct environment on the part
of both partners. Similar remarks of the consultants were
never addressed officially totheEmployer.
Also, your statement in the samae Item 18, Page 8, "plethora
of subcontractors caused problems in coordination and ...",
"but this was unavoidable in the context of the decentralized
Yugoslav politico - economic system". Our comment would be:
The engagement of all available capacities of domestic
consultants in the stage of design pr-eparation and implenfentation
of the Project - Jugoslavenski naftovod - represented one
necessity, due to the size and importance of the Project
which, beside the already said it has also an international
character, and the capacities and the possibilities of the
domestic engineering - designing organizations. For these
very reasons we contracted the foreign consultants, first
IMEG - London, and then OTP - IParis, and this can not be
explained as being necessary consequence of the "decentralized
political and economic system of Yugoslavia", as stated in
your report. Also, we stress that the domestic consultants
are at the same time members of the sponsors, and it is
.

quite normal to engage their capacities for their own
Project.
-  Page 4. item 11. ..." Valuable time was lost in arranging
financing and in corresponding with bidders". (section
Omisalj - Sisak etc.). Jugoslavenski naftovod followed to
the maximum the proposed procedure of IBRD, which could
also, due to its inflexibility contribute to your above
mentioned statement to decline the effectivenes and
promptness of contractors choice, as it was for example the
choice of the contrator for the Omigalj - Sisak pipeline
section. You know that only the fourth bidder signed the
contract, after long negotiations and much later than it
could have been normally done. Could the Employer eliminate
more simply uniterested bidder without certain formalities
which the bidder - contrector used, and which were provided
to him by the procedure procured by IBRD, more significant
saving of time would have been gained from the moment of
contracting to the moment of Contructor's introduction in
field (work).
Our remarks are general and we believe that you would analyze
the same and in the limits possible correct your final
report.
At the end we wish to stress that we are very grateful for
the assistance given by your experts to our professional
services and professionals during the official visits to
Yugoslavia and Washington and we believe that your experts as
well, who participated on this project were also pleased
with the cooperation and the relations with our experts and
all other participants in the Project implementation.
It is our wish to meet again your experts, and IBRD
