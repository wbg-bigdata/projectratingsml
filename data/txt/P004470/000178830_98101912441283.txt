PHILIPPINES
PROVINCIAL CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
I. THE SECTOR
Background
1.01      The Philippines is endowed with abundant water resources.  Not only
does the country have an average annual rainfall of about 300 cm, but it also
has nine major river basins, many lakes and streams, and extensive groundwater
resources sufficient to cover foreseeable needs in most areas of the country.
However, public investment in the water supply sector has traditionally been
very low, with the result that the infrastructure for water supply, sewerage,
and drainage is currently inadequate throughout the country. Only about 39%
of the population has access to safe water. Sanitation facilities are in
great need for improvement. About 5% are served by public sewerage systems;
some 37% depend on individual septic tanks or pit latrines and the rest are
without any facilities. The Government's objective is that by the end of the
current five-year plan in 1982, water supply should be available to about 62%
of the population and sewerage facilities to about 46% of the population.
1.02      The sector can be divided into three parts:  Metropolitan Mlanila
Area (MMA); other urban centers; and rural areas. Except for MMA in which
about 82% of the population has access to piped water, in other areas and in
the rural communities only about 51% and 33%, respectively, obtain a safe
supply through piped systems, artesian wells, and springs. In communities
with piped water systems, the growth in demand, the advanced age of the systems
and the high leakage rates arising from inadequate maintenance have all
gradually reduced water main pressures and lowered the quality of the water
supply. Many water systems are operated to supply water for only a few hours
a day to avoid loss of water during the off-peak hours. About 61% of the
population manage with water which is often of doubtful quality from sources
such as open wells, handpumps, rain water cisterns, lakes, rivers, and
streams.
Metropolitan Manila
1.03      Water supply and sewerage is the responsibility of Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in MMA. Of MMA's 1977 population of
5.8 million,about 3.1million (or about 53%) obtain water from MWSS. The
$397.1 million Second Manila Water Supply Project, for which the Bank and ADB
made loans totaling $188.3 million, will go part of the way to meeting
Government's objective in the five year plan. The project will about double
the water supply and provide safe drinking water to nearlv 4 million additional
residents, as well as improve the present unsatisfactory service to about 3 mil-
lion. A sewerage and sanitation improvement project is also included in
MWSS' construction program for 1980-1985. With these investments, totalling
about $650 million, the water supply and sanitation services in MM4A would
improve greatly and the danger to public health would accordingly be reduced.



-2-
However, by the end of 1982 only about 78% of MWSS' service area population
will have access to safe public water supplies. The Government is therefore
preparing the Third Water Supply Project for Manila.
1.04      In May 1977, under the Provincial Cities Water Supply Project
(Loan 1415-PH) the Bank made available US$4.0 million to MWSS for preparing
a sewerage and sanitation project for MMA. Project preparation is advanced
and will soon be ready for possible Bank financing. MWSS is also preparing a
Solid Wastes Management Project.  These two projects would significantly
improve the existing poor sanitation of the city, especially in the low
income areas.
Other Urban Centers
1.05      The Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) is responsible
for developing water utilities in some 628 provincial cities with populations
exceeding 20,000. LWUA assists with the formation of Water Districts (WDs)
in these cities and provides them with technical, managerial and financial
assistance. Water Districts are locally controlled public utility organizations
created under Presidential Decree No. 198. As of March 1979, 82 cities had
formed Water Districts and some 60 others had expressed interest in doing so.
Fifty-four of the 82 cities have ongoing water supply projects. Water supply
in the cities which have not yet formed WDs continues to remain the respon-
sibility of the local authorities until such time as LWUA and the local
authorities reach agreement on forming WDs.
1.06      Out of a total urban population of 8.4 million living outside MMA
about 51% has access to safe water. Several external agencies USAID, DANIDA,
ADB and the Bank have made loans, through LWUA to WDs aggregating about $73.0
million, for the construction, expansion and rehabilitation of water supply
facilities in the WDs. Most of these projects are still under construction
and progress is generally satisfactory.
Rural Areas
1.07      An IBRD/WHO sector study made in 1976 recommended the creation of a
specialized institution for rural water supply. The Government in recent
times is placing great emphasis on the development of rural water supplies
and also on rural sanitation.  Presidential Letter of Instruction (LOI) 683
of March 30, 1978 established policies for providing water supplies in
communities with less than 20,000 inhabitants. The Government is also taking
keen interest in the promotion of environmental sanitation and is participating
in an UNDP demonstration project for developing low cost water supply tech-
niques.



-3 -
1.08      LOI 683 also created a Task Force  on Rural Water Supply in the
National Water Resources Council (NWRC/TF) under the Ministry of Public Works
Transport and Communications (MPWTC) to: (a) coordinate and develop rural
water supply; and (b) propose a permanent institution for the rural water
sector. The Task Force has completed a few pilot projects and is preparing
to launch a major program with assistance from the proposed Bank Group
financing.
Investment Program
1.09      To remedy the past neglect of this sector, the Government has
embarked upon an ambitious water supply program in the country. LWUA's
program for assisting WDs in provincial cities in the five years 1980-84
would amount to about $218 million, an average of about $44 million per annum
compared to $16 million in 1977. For the rural areas, the Five-Year Plan
envisages an investment of $210 million, an average of about $42 million per
annum compared with about $2 million per annum in 1973-76. While these
targets are ambitious, the Government has taken important steps within
the sector to establish the organizational arrangements necessary to implement
the program. A Bank loan of $23 million (Loan 1415-PH) was made to the
Government in 1977 for the First Provincial Cities Water Supply Project.
Progress in implementing this project is generally satisfactory. A second
Bank loan of $88 million (Loan 1615-PH) was made last year to help improve
and expand the MMA water supply system, finance detailed design and fea-
sibility studies for water supply in provincial cities and prepare a rural
water supply program. To complement the water supply and sewerage program,
the Government has recently adopted large urban programs to expand basic
services in low-income urban areas in integrated packages of water supply,
sewerage, roads and other infrastructure. These programs are being carried
out by the National Housing Authority and municipal governments, and Bank
assistance for them is planned.
Bank Lending for Water Supply and Sewerage
1.10      The Bank's strategy in the water supply and sewerage sector is to
support the Government's investment program for improving water supply,
sewerage and sanitation facilities and to provide technical assistance and
training for institution building and staff development. The Bank's future
lending program includes a loan for sewerage and sanitation in Manila and a
loan for construction of additional water supply systems in provincial cities
and rural areas. Bank-financed urban and rural development projects are
also providing water supply and sanitation systems for low-income groups.



II. THE BORROWER, BENEFICIARIES AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
The Borrower
2.01      An IDA credit of $22.0 million and a Bank loan of $16.0 million are
proposed. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines which will
relend $30 million of the proceeds of the credit/loan under a subsidiary loan
agreement to LWUA.  The terms and conditions of the Government loan to LWUA
will be set out in a subsidiary loan agreement which would be signed before
the credit/loan becomes effective. LWUA will relend under subsidiary loan
agreements to about 50 WDs $28.5 million for water supply construction and
retain $1.5 million to prepare future projects. Government will provide from
out of the remainder of the proceeds of the credit/loan (a) $6 million to the
WDs to help finance local currency expenditures; and (b) $2.0 million to
MPWTC for rural water supply construction and to develop rural sanitation.
The Beneficiaries
2.02      The main beneficiaries of the Bank Group financing will be the
(a) Water Districts in about 50 provincial cities; and (b) Rural Water
Associations (RWAs) in about 1,000 rural communities. LWUA will benefit in
respect of feasibility studies for water supply projects, a pilot sanitation
project, training and equipment.
The Implementing Agencies
2.03      The implementing agencies will be LWUA for water supplies for about
50 WDs, training and feasibility studies; and MPWTC (a) through the Task
Force on Rural Water Supply of the National Water Resources Council (NWRC/TF)
for water supplies for about 1,000 RWAs, pilot sanitation studies in rural
areas and detailed design of rural water supply projects; and (b) through
LWUA for pilot sanitation studies in urban fringe populations.
Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA)
2.04      Organization and Structure.  LWUA was established in September 1973
with an authorized capital of 500 million pesos (US$67.6 million),/l in
pursuance of the Provincial Water Utilities Act in 1973 embodied in Presidential
Decree No. 198, primarily to function as a specialized institution for the
promotion, develompent and financing of local water utilities. Its main
objectives are: (a) to assist in the formation and development of technically
sound and financially viable locally controlled WDs; (b) to provide loans to
WDs for the improvement and expansion of water supply and waste water disposal
systems; (c) to provide technical assistance and personnel training for WDs;
and (d) to establish and enforce standards of water quality and service. It
/1   By PD 1479 of June 1978 LWUA's authorized capital was increased to
2.5 billion pesos (US$337.8 million).



is attached to MPWTC and enjoys more or less complete autonomy, subject to
the general policy directives of Government. The only control exercised by
MPWTC is that the award of all contracts must have its prior approval.
It is expected that this approval would be given within a period of less than
one month. The Board appoints the General Manager, who is also an ex-officio
member of the Board, and is responsible for all aspects of LWUA's management
subject to the policies established by the Board. Because of the importance
of his position it was agreed during negotiations that LWUA should afford the
Bank an opportunity to comment on the qualifications of any new appointee to
this position. LWUA has five main departments and the organization is shown
in Chart 19883. This structure is satisfactory and during negotiations
assurances were obtained that without prior consultation with the Bank, no
major changes will be made in LWUA's charter and organization. These cove-
nants are the same as in the first loan.
Staff and Training
2.05      LWUA has been increasing the recruitment of both technical staff
and support personnel to meet its growing operational requirements. Techni-
cal staff has grown from 36 in 1974 to 270 at the end of 1978. LWUA plans
to double it by 1982. Personnel turnover is high mainly because young
engineers often leave to join consulting firms, after they have gained some
experience in LWUA. The quality of LWUA personnel is good. LWUA's training
program covers both its own staff and the staff of WDs and is satisfactory.
Management Systems
2.06      The management systems introduced by the consultants at the time
LWUA was organized are working well. However, there is an urgent need to
(a) develop a financial planning and control system; (b) improve coor-
dination within the organization; and (c) strengthen project management
through the appointment of a Project Manager (para. 2.11). During negotia-
tions understandings were reached that by January 31, 1980 LWUA would
have prepared and implemented plans acceptable to the Bank (a) to increase
coordination between its departments; and (b) for a comprehensive financial
planning and control system.
Audit and Internal Control
2.07      LWUA's operations are audited by the Commission on Audit (COA).
Audited reports have been presented for 1976 and 1977 and are satisfactory.
A copy of LWUA's audited accounts and auditors report will be sent to the
Bank not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.
Taxation
2.08      Under P.D. 1177 of 1977 which applies to government controlled
corporations, LWUA has to start paying corporate taxes in 1979, but it is
expected that Government will eventually reimburse these payments.



-6-
Insurance
2.09      LWUA has insurance coverage against the normal risks related to its
operations.
Billing and Collections of LWUA's Loans to WDs
2.10      LWUA's lending program is growing very fast.  To make sure that the
institution will be able to handle the resulting large volume of operations,
it has to define responsibilities, policies, procedures and control sytems
for collection of principal and interest on loans to WDs. During negotiations
it was agreed that LWUA will present for Bank's comments not later than
January 31, 1980, policies and procedures for collection of principal and
interest on loans. Also LWUA will establish procedures satisfactory to the
Bank for making provisions for bad debts.
LWUA's Performance, Strengths and Weaknesses
2.11      Project Implementation.  Progress on water supply construction for
the six WDs under Loan 1415-PH is behind schedule by about nine months
because of (i) slow progress by the consultants in preparing the designs,
contract drawings and bid documents, and (ii) difficulties encountered by
LWUA in organizing the project and retaining a competent project manager.
To correct this situation LWUA has recently appointed a senior individual as
Project Manager with full time responsibility for implementing the project.
2.12      Compliance with Covenants.  Consumer complaints to the Government
by some WDs led to the issue in September 1978 of Presidential letters of
Instruction (LOIs) 700 and 744 directing that tariff increases should not
exceed 60% at a time and that public hearings should be held before any
proposed tariff increase is put into effect. LWUA therefore needed time to
comply with a covenant in the ongoing project (Loan 1415-PH) which required
that by October 1, 1978 the six WDs should have reviewed their tariffs and any
increase or change in structure should be implemented by January 1, 1979.
Compliance with this covenant is a condition for effectiveness of the proposed
credit/loan.
Water Districts
2.13      WDs are formed on a local option basis by a resolution of the
municipality or local authority. Once a district is formed, the local author-
ity ceases to have jurisdiction over it and the district can be dissolved only
by a resolution of its Board of Directors. Financial viability of operations
is a basic requirement. The WDs can borrow money for improvement of water
supply but if a district has borrowed funds from LWUA it cannot incur any
further indebtedness without LWUA's prior approval. The organization of a
typical WD is shown in Chart 16703.



-7-
Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MPWTC)
2.14      The MPWTC will be the implementing agency for the rural water supply
and sanitation components of the project. Since LWUA is attached to MPWTC,
coordination and exchange of informaticn between NWRC's Task Force on Rural
Water Supply and LWUA will be more effective. The proceeds of the credit/loan
will be channeled through MPWTC to the Task Force for the rural water supply
project and to both the Task Force and LWUA for the pilot sanitation studies.
Natural Water Resources Council/Task Force (NWRC/TF)
2.15      NWRC/TF is a temporary organization and has just started preparing
itself for the task of providing about 1,000 rural water supply schemes under
the proposed project. The Bank is financing technical assistance in: (a) staff
training; (b) preparation of a data base for the rural water supply sector;
(c) preparation of a design manual; and (d) preparation of the rural water
supply component of the proposed project. The organization of the Task Force
is shown in Chart 19866. Because NWRC/TF is a temporary organization
it was agreed during negotiations that the establishment of an organization
for rural water supply satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of
disbursement of the rural water supply component of the proposed project.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The primary objective of the project is to provide improved water
supplies by carrying out rehabilitation and construction works in about 50
WDs in the provincial cities and about 1,000 rural communities. A list of
the proposed and ongoing LWUA subprojects is at Table 3.1.
3.02      The feasibility studies and detailed designs covering 28 WDs are
being prepared by LWUA with the assistance of consultants C. Lotti Associati
(Italy) and Motor Columbus (Switzerland), financed under technical assistance
components in Bank Loans 1415-PH and 1615-PH. MPWTC, also with the help
of consultants financed under Loan 1415-PH, is carrying out training and
the preparation of rural water supply projects.
Description
3.03      The principal features of the project are as follows:
Part A
(a) Source development, mostly springs and wells, rehabilitation and
construction of transmission and distribution systems, installation
of new service connections, public faucets, metering, leak detection
and repair and improvement of existing facilities in (i) Iloilo,
the fourth largest city in the Philippines with a served population
of about 200,000 and (ii) about 50 small WDs each with served
populations varying between 10,000 and 30,000;
(b) technical assistance for project preparation, detailed designs and
supervision of construction.
Part B
(a) Technical assistance for reconnaissance surveys for about 150
communities, and detailed design for future water supply and
sanitation projects for WDs;
(b) training of LWUA and WD staff including needed equipment; and
(c) vehicles and equipment for WDs.
Part C
(a) Construction of wells, development of springs, pumping stations,
pipelines, public faucets and house connections for some 1,000
rural communities.



-9-
Part D
Pilot sanitation study for about eight rural communities.
Concept and Composition
3.04      Water Districts in Provincial Cities.  To meet the Government's
objectives of speedily providing safe water supplies to most of the provincial
cities, four modifications have been made to the approach adopted under the
ongoing first project (Loan 1415-PH):
(i) Unlike the first project in which the feasibility studies on
the six big WDs were completed at the time the loan was made,
in the proposed second project there are about 50 WDs /1 and for
these only about 12 feasibility studies would be completed at
the time of loan effectiveness; 16 more feasibility studies
would be completed in each year thereafter for three years./2
As this project will aim at reaching 10 times as many communi-
ties in comparison with the first project, understandings
were reached during negotiations for the annual review of
project implementation (see para. 5.09);
(ii) Secondly, in the first project the designs were made to meet
demand for five to eight years after project completion. This
has caused hardship to some communities because of the larger
debt service. The Second project would be designed to meet
water supply needs for about six years after project completion.
If the WD so desires construction would be in two phases. Each
one of these phases would be technically sound and be compatible
with the total design and will meet needs for about three years
after construction completion. During negotiations this was
discussed with LWUA and understandings reached on the
criteria to be used for subproject design and implementation
as set out in Annex 1, Part 1.
/1  The biggest WD in the proposed project is Iloilo for which feasibility
studies are expected to be completed in June 1979. It is similar in
size to the WDs in the first project and based on that experience, a
first stage project is estimated to cost P 66 ($9.0) million.
/2  The feasibility studies are divided into four packages (details are at
Table 3.1): Package #1 = 12 studies, started December 1977; Package #2 =
16 studies, started February 1979; Package #3 = 16 studies, starting
September 1979; Package #4 = 16 studies, starting scheduled for June 1980;
total = 60.



- 10 -
(iii)  In the ongoing first project, because of poor communication
between some WDs and their consumers there has been opposition
to water tariff increases. Therefore, in this Second project
public hearings would be held at critical stages of subproject
preparation to keep WD consumers informed of the proposals;
water tariffs would be reviewed annually and so designed that
no single increase would be greater than 60% and made only
after a public hearing.
(iv)  Finally, each WD in the first project is providing 10% equity
contribution from internal cash generation. The servicing of
the resulting 90% debt has proven to be a burden for these
cities, which are comparatively larger and wealthier. There-
fore for the WDs in the proposed project (except for Iloilo),
Government will match a 10% contribution by WDs with a 20%
equity contribution for each subproject in order to reduce the
required financing to 70% of the subproject cost. This was
agreed during negotiations with Government.
3.05      Rural Water Supplies.  About 875 rural water supply subprojects
have been prepared by the Rural Development Division of the Bureau of Community
Development. These subprojects are in sufficient detail for immediate review
by NWRC/TF which would, in addition, prepare the remaining 125 subprojects for
implementation mostly through Electric Cooperatives and other Government
Departments. An understanding was reached with Government during negotiations
on the criteria for rural water supply subprojects as set out in Annex 1,
Part 2.
3.06      Rural Sanitation Studies.  These studies, which will include pilot
projects would be carried out by LIUA and NWRC/TF. The rural sanitation
studies and pilot projects would be prepared to criteria acceptable to the
Bank.
Project Area and Served Population
3.07      LWUA's subprojects are scattered throughout the Philippines and
are shown in Maps 14132 and 14133 and listed in Table 3.1. Until the feasi-
bility studies for subprojects are completed it would not be possible to
accurately estimate the population served by the project. For the three
sample cities of San Jose, Orani and Guagua on which feasibility studies
are completed total population served in the project is expected to increase
by two and a half times from 21,300 to 54,900 as shown in Table 3.2.
3.08      The distribution of the estimated 875 communities by Region for
which rural water 5upply projects have been prepared and which will form RWAs
is given below:
Region
I   II  III  IV   V   VI  VII  VIII  IX   X  XI  XII   Total
Subprojects      88  173   43  86  32  100   89   103  19  68  26   68    875



3.09      The total urban population served in 1982 in the subproject WDs
and Iloilo will be approximately one million. Assuming an average village
of 100 households, and an average family size of 5.8 persons per household
the total rural population served under the project would be about 580,000.
Subproject Preparation and Appraisal
3.10      Every WD, as soon as it is formed becomes eligible for inclusion in
one of four packages for the preparation of feasibility studies, detailed
design and construction. The rate of water district formation is about two
per month and the status of WD formation for the project as of March 1979
is at Tables 3.3 and 3.4. The first package of 12 WDs for this project was put
together in December 1977 and the feasibility studies are expected to be
completed by mid-1979 (see Implementation Schedule - 19963). The second
package of 16 WDs have been formed and the consultants Motor Columbus started
work on February 15, 1979. LWUA expects to have formed 16 more WDs (third pack-
Age), bringing the total to 44 and be ready to start feasibility studies on
this package by September 1, 1979.
3.11      LWUA wishes to make the feasibility studies for packages three and
four by itself without assistance from consultants. However, LWUA's
managerial and technical capability for making these studies to acceptable
standards and to the tight schedule is untried and recent delays in the
first project give rise to serious doubts. LWUA has therefore agreed that it
will, in consultation with the Bank, appoint consultants to carry out feasibil-
ity studies, detailed design and construction of the project.
3.12      LWUA's Project Manager responsible for carrying out the project
would appoint an expert team, with one member external to LWUA, to review the
draft final feasibility study reports and check if each subproject meets the
agreed criteria. LWUA would then hold a public hearing and obtain the WD's
agreement to the subproject and timing of tariff increases. If a subproject
does not meet the agreed criteria, it would not be included in the project and
would be replaced by another subproject.
3.13      Any rural community with households ranging from 50 to 600 and
willing to form a rural water supply association, contribute labor and
materials to not less than 10% of the project cost, repay the remainder of the
project cost at 4% interest over 20 years and be also willing to operate and
maintain the system, would be eligible for a rural water supply subproject.
-Ehe established community organization system in the country is suited for
effectively operating and maintaining these simple rural systems. Although
the Bank will have the right to review all such subprojects, in practice its
review would be limited to the larger rural water supply subprojects and
those identified as needing special justification. During the initial period
of implemenetation at least 10 rural water supply subprojects would be closely
reviewed by the Bank.

Cost Estimates
3.14      The total cost of the project is estimated to be $64.0 million with
a foreign exchange component of $32.0 million. The proposed IDA credit and Bank
loan of $38 million will finance the foreign exchange cost plus local currency
costs of $6.0 million. The project cost estimates are at Table 3.5 and the
summary cost estimates are given below:

- 13 -
3.15      The cost estimates are based upon preliminary engineering studies
prepared by the consultants for Orani, Guagua and San Jose WDs and preliminary
costs provided by the WD manager for Iloilo, information supplied by LWUA on
WDs and data provided by NWRC/TF on rural water supply subprojects. The
subprojects for WDs are based on a per capita cost of P 224 ($30) with
average populations decreasing from 17,000 to 11,000 from the first package
(excluding Iloilo) through to the fourth package. The foreign exchange
cost of 50% is only a little higher than the first Provincial Cities Water
Supply Project (Loan 1415-PH) in which it was 49%. The cost estimates do not
include duties and taxes on imported goods since LWUA and NWRC/TF will be
reimbursed such charges. All prices are adjusted to a base line of June 1979
and are reasonable.
Feasibility Studies, Design, Construction and Supervision of Construction
3.16      Construction supervision of the subprojects in the WDs will be
mostly by LWUA with minimal assistance from local consultants. However,
because of general inexperience in the supervision of drilling high yielding
long life municipal wells to satisfactory standards, 24 man-months of such
assistance from internationally recruited consultants is included in the cost
estimates for packages three and four. The project provides for a total of
126 man-months of internationally recruited consultants at an average man-month
cost, of $6,500 excluding transportation, housing and local costs which are
variable depending on home station and family circumstances of individual
consultants. As these consultants would be experienced senior staff, this is
a reasonable cost. The experience and qualifications of LWUA's team conducting
the feasibility studies, and of local and internationally recruited consultants,
and the terms and conditions of employment of all consultants should be
acceptable to the Bank. Some equipment and two vehicles have been included to
help carry out LWUA's public education program in the WDs and also to facilitate
the presentation of projects at the mandatory public hearings. For those WDs
that are desperately short of urgently needed tools and vehicles, a budgetary
provision of US$250,000 has been made in the estimates. In addition, 150 man-
months for training LWUA and WD staff are included. The training program
will be formulated and sent for Bank review by January 31, 1980.
Contingencies
3.17      As most of the works are below ground and scattered throughout the
country, unforseen obstructions, corrosive soils and poor foundation condi-
tions are likely to be encountered. Also, in well drilling, some dry holes
or holes with poor quality water are likely. Therefore a physical contingency
provision of 10% for both civil works and equipment has been made in the cost
estimates. This is a reasonable provision. International and local inflation
for 1979-85, were taken into account in assuming a price contingency of7.5%
p.a. during the project implementation period both on civil works and equipment.



- 14 -
This is also a reasonable provision. Similar contingency provisions are built
into the estimates for consultant services. The total of US$8.0 million
provided for price increases in Part A is 17% of the baseline cost plus
physical contingencies and engineering. This cost is reasonable because
of the lead time required to prepare packages two, three and four.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.18      Except for Iloilo, procurement of all equipment and civil works
required for each water supply subproject, which on an average are estimated
to cost below $1.0 million equivalent for each WD, will be packaged by LWUA
into single contracts, satisfactory to the Bank, and will be awarded on the
basis of competetive bidding advertised locally in accordance with Government
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. These works would account for
75% of the total project cost. LWUA's local procurement procedures are
satisfactory and appropriate for these works. Equipment and civil works for
the Iloilo subproject, estimated to cost $9.0 million (14% of the total
project cost), will also be packaged into a single contract, but will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. For the rural water supply subprojects (6% of the
total project cost) all equipment would be obtained by MPWTC through bulk
procurement on the basis of international competitive bidding. Procurement of
vehicles, tools and equipment (less than 1% of the total project cost) will
also be made through ICB. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of
imported goods or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower, would be
extended to local manufacturers for procurement through ICB. Except in cases
where voluntary labor is offered, MPWTC would follow local procurement proced-
ures, which are satisfactory and appropriate, for minor civil works in laying
pipes, constructing intakes and small reservoirs, installing public faucets
and related items for rural water supply projects. Both LWUA and MPWTC will
also follow local procurement procedures for the pilot rural sanitation
projects. The Philippines has a growing construction industry and almost all
contracts are expected to be won by local contractors. The subprojects
(except for Iloilo) are not only small in value but are also scattered through-
out the country and are therefore likely to evoke little interest from inter-
national contractors. Goods costing less than $15,000 equivalent needed for
the public education program, carrying out public hearings, training and for
urgently required off-the-shelf items for project completion may be procured
through local shopping procedures satisfactory to the Bank provided the total
cost of such items does not exceed $100,000 equivalent for both Parts A and B
and $20,000 for both Parts C and D, respectively.
3.19      Disbursements for civil works would be (a) 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for mobilization; and (b) 65% of other civil works expenditures. For
equipment and materials, disbursements would be at 100% of the foreign exchange
cost of directly imported equipment, 100% of the ex-factory price of locally
manufactured equipment and 65% of imported goods procured locally. For costs
of consultants and overseas training, disbursements would be 100% of expendi-
tures. Disbursements in respect of overseas training would be made against
the training program (para. 3.16). The quarterly disbursement forecast is shown



- 15 -
in Table 3.6. It is the intention that the IDA Credit funds be fully committed
before disbursements commence on the Loan.
Financing
3.20      Government wishes to be assured of the financing for the total
project at this time so as to ensure the implementation of an uninterrupted
stream of subprojects following the completion of feasibility studies. The
detail financing plan for the project is presented in Annex 2 and a summary
follows:

3.21      The Government would relend $30.0 million of the proceeds of the
credit/loan to LWUA with a term of 20 years, including 5 years grace period,
and with the same interest as the Bank loan. LWUA would retain $1.5 million
of the proceeds of the subsidiary loan to finance preparation of future
projects. LWUA would relend the balance of $28.5 million together with
$13.1 million of its own resources to the WDs for development of their water
supply systems. LWUA's loans to the WDs would have a term of 30 years including
a grace period equal to the construction period at an interest rate of 9% per
annum. WDs would finance $5.7 million (10% of project costs) from internal
cash generation. Government will make available $6.0 million from the proceeds
of the credit/loan plus $3.5 million from its own resources, as its equity
contribution to the small WDs representing 20% of project costs of the water
supply program. Financing by LWUA of interest during construction is necessary
in view of the cash requirements of the WDs in the initial years of formation
and the need to keep tariff increases to within the ability to pay of the
small and poor communities. As in the first loan (Loan 1415-PH), Government



- 16 -
will finance the interest on the portion of the proceeds of the credit/ loan
($30.0 million) onlent to LWUA. The terms and conditions of the subsidiary
loan agreements between LWUA and the WDs will be approved by the Bank.
3.22      The Government would use the remainder of the proceeds of the credit/
loan of $2.0 million to finance the foreign exchange costs of the rural water
supply component ($1.8 million) and rural sanitation studies ($0.2 million).
MPWTC would be responsible for implementing these components and would finance
the local costs of $2.0 million through Government budgetary allocations.
Project Supervision
3.23      Review by Bank staff of the implementation of subprojects would be
mostly made in the field with approvals given for carrying out the next
step. For part A, each of the subproject sites will be visited once during
the project period but for Part C Bank review would be restricted to selected
samples. Each mission is expected to be at least two weeks in the Philippines
and in the first two years would occur around every 4 months.
Project Completion
3.24      Construction of major components would be completed by December 31,
1984, but because of seasonal bad weather near the end of the year installation
of service connections on some of the later subprojects in WDs would be
completed in the forthcoming dry season. The project is therefore expected to
be completed by June 30, 1985 and to permit disbursement of contract retention
monies, etc., the closing date would be December 31, 1985 (see Implementation
Schedule - Chart 19963). Any surplus funds would be used for additional
subprojects.
Environmental Impact
3.25      As this is a project essentially for providing domestic water
supply, some pollution of surface waters can be expected from the used water.
Most of these cities and villages cannot afford conventional sewerage or
sanitation systems. However, research and development of low cost alterna-
tives is expected to provide affordable and practical systems which could be
included in the next stage project. Meanwhile, because of the high rainfall
and the general nature of the terrain in the several islands which constitute
the project area, the natural drainage and dilution is adequate to ensure that
there is no significant increase in the pollution to the environment because
of the project.

4.02      A good percentage of LWUA's revenues has come from the return on
short-term Government securities bought with the unused portion of the capital
contributions received from Government. This has given LWUA a reliable base
to finance its operations in this early stage. Gross spread is large because
a high percentage of the borrowings committed so far comes from soft loans./l
The ratio of longterm debt equity at the end of 1978 was 0.65:1 well below

the limit of 3.0:1 covenanted in Loan 1415-PH. In June 1978 LWUA's authorized
capital was increased from P 0.5 billion to P 2.5 billion ($338 million).
This is a good indication of the intention of the Government to continue
supporting LWUA. Paid in capital as of September 30, 1978 was, however, only
P 239.2 million ($32.3 million).
4.03      Because of the public reaction against large tariff increases by
water districts the Government has been considering the reduction of the
interest rates charged by LWUA to WDs. Unless this move is accompanied by
complementary actions to decrease LWUA's cost of capital there is the risk of
making LWUA financially nonviable. Since actions like these may endanger
the future of the institution, during negotiations it was agreed that, in
future, LWUA's operating and financial policies will not be modified without
prior consultation with the Bank.

4.05      Government would relend $30.0 million of the proceeds of the credit/
loan to LWUA. In addition, LWUA's borrowing program for 1980-84 includes
$68.3 million of which $33.1 million will come from loans already contracted
with AID, ADB, IBRD and DANIDA and the balance of $35.2 million from sources
not yet fully identified. Contacts with ADB, DANIDA and AID have been made in
this regard. LWUA's lending program for 1980-84 is $218.1 million which
includes $41.6 million to WDs covered by the proposed project.
4.06      The Government is expected to contribute to LWUA the equivalent of
$100.3 million of which $9.5 million will go to the WDs as an equity contri-
bution. The balance of $90.8 million will be the Government's capital subscrip-
tion to LWUA. This represents an increase of about 80% over the average
capital payments received by LWUA from Government in the past three years. It
was agreed during negotiations that Government will increase LWUA's paid-in
capital to meet its annual requirements, estimated at $18.0 million equivalent.
The financing plan is reasonable and reflects the level of operations that
LWUA has to undertake to help in the reduction of deficiencies in the sector.
Government will provide any shortfalls in WDs cash generation and any other
funds for the satisfactory completion of the project.
LWUA's Future Financial Performance
4.07      LWUA's projected financial statements are presented in Annex 4.
Based on the underlying assumptions, LWUA's outlook is satisfactory. After
corporate taxes of 35%, net income as a percentage of average equity is
expected to increase from 1.1% in 1978 to 4.5% in 1986. As a percentage of
average total assets, net income grows from 0.7% in 1978 to 2.5% in 1986.
4.08      Nevertheless, as loans with higher interest rates become a larger
percentage of the total borrowings, the gross spread is cut in half from 4.6%
in 1978 to 2.3% in 1986. This reinforces the point made in para. 4.03 that
lending rates should not be lowered without other compensating actions.
4.09      During the period under consideration - 1978/86, LWUA's capital
structure is expected to remain sound with a long-term debt to equity ratio
under 0.8:1, well below the maximum of 3:1 covenanted in Loan 1415-PH.
Debt service coverage, although decreasing through the years, remains satis-
factory above 1.8. It was agreed during negotiations that LWUA's long-term
debt will not at any time exceed its equity by more than three times.
4.10      LWUA's liquidity is very important for the adequate implementation
of its lending program. Assuming that government payments to its capital
subscription are received on time no difficulties are expected in this area.
Current ratio remains above 1.7. The forecast includes cash on hand and
funds available in the Treasury that are expected to be on the average not
less than the equivalent of one month cash operating expenses of LWUA plus
expected disbursements for WDs' investment program. In addition, it is



- 20 -
assumed that LWUA will keep the present level of investment in short-term
securities as a necessary cushion.
4.11      A summary of some indicators of LWUA's future performance follows:

4.12      Because of the presently weak financial condition of the WDs and
thin spread between LWUA's onlending rate (9%) and the interest charged by
Government (8%) on the portion of proceeds of the loan relent to LWUA,
the Government will bear the risk of exchange for the loans disbursed
to LIUA in foreign currencies and this should be provided in the subsidiary
loan agreement between LWUA and Government.
Water Districts' Future Financial Performance
4.13      From the experience gained so far with LWUA's program, four modifi-
cations made to the approach adopted in the first project (Loan 1415-PH) are
described in paragraph 3.04. There are important financial and tariff
implications to the WDs because of these modifications. During the project
construction period, water tariffs of each WD will be so set as to generate
internal cash of at least 10% of the project expenditures. To assist in
achieving this and to make a gradual raising of the tariffs possible, WDs
will be required to earn rates of return of 3% in the third year following
the start of project construction increasing to 4%, 5%, 6% and 7% respectively
in each succeeding year, and 8% thereafter. This covenant was agreed during
negotiations and also that the following covenants in the first project will
be equally applicable to this project:



- 21 -
(a)  LWUA will cause each WD to establish and maintain realistic values
of their assets and to maintain complete records of their physical
values and locations;
(b) the project WDs will adopt accounting procedures acceptable to
the Bank;
(c) LWUA will cause each WD to have its accounts and financial statements
certified by an independent auditor acceptable to LWUA and submitted
to LWUA not later than six months after the end of each year;
(d) during the project construction period WDs will not undertake any
major capital expenditures /1 other than those included in the sub-
project and after project completion would not incur any indebted-
ness unless their internal cash generation for the past fiscal year
(or a later 12 months period prior to incurring such debt) is at
least 1.3 times the maximum debt service requirement on all its
long-term debt for any succeeding fiscal year;
(e) during the project period the performance of each WD will be
monitored using performance indicators acceptable to the Bank.
4.14      Annex 7 presents the projected financial statements for Orani,
San Jose and Guagua, three of the water districts expected to be financed
through the proposed loan.
4.15      Tariffs.  The Presidential Decree establishing LWUA stipulated that
the WDs shall fix rates and charges for water adequate to cover operating
expenses and debt service as well as to provide a reasonable surplus for
investment in the improvement and expansion of the system. Presidential
letters of Instruction 700 and 744 issued in September 1978 further directed
that tariff increases should not exceed 60% at a time and that public hearings
should be held before any proposed tariff increase is put into effect. LWUA
guidelines on tariffs now include the following criteria: (a) tariffs
shall be progressively stepped upwards with any one increase not to exceed 60%
at a time for domestic service; (b) the tariff structure will achieve both
financial and equity goals; and (c) those families who consume less than 10
cu m per month will spend no more than 4% of family income for water. These
guidelines are reasonable and LWUA has been informed that in addition, the top
block of non domestic services should be based on marginal supply cost. The
tariffs for the lower income categories who consume about 10 cubic meters per
month would be subsidized through higher charges to larger domestic consumers
and commercial and industrial users. During negotiations it was agreed that
LWUA will cause each Water District included in Part A of the Project to:
(i) carry out an annual review of the rate structure and level of its tariffs;
(ii) furnish such review to the Bank for its comments, not later than October
1 in each year from 1979 through 1984 and thereafter at such intervals as the
Bank may request; and (iii) taking into account the comments of the Bank,
implement the findings of such review by January 1 of the following year.
/1 Major capital expenditures are defined as these exceeding 20% of the sub-
project cost.

V. JUSTIFICATION
General
5.01      The justification for the project is that it will provide a basic
need to some of the poor urban and rural communities in the Philippines. It
comprises a big step in LWUA's long range ambitious program to provide water
supplies to some 628 provincial cities and will assist the Government in its
efforts to improve the standard of living of its citizens by increasing
access to safe water in both urban and rural areas and take the first steps
to improve rural sanitation. LWUA would be developed through the project to
take a sectoral approach in implementing community water supplies.  In turn
the communities benefitting from subprojects would have greater involvement in
the development of their respective WDs through the opportunities to partici-
pate in the decision-making process starting from the feasibility studies
through tariff setting and construction completion.
5.02      The subprojects to be financed under this credit/loan will be the
least cost solution and will:
(a)  provide investments in small urban and rural communities, with
emphasis upon the low income groups of these communities, most of
which have dilapidated or no water supply systems and little or no
hope of improving their systems except through this type of program;
(b)  be selected and reviewed in accordance with criteria acceptable to
the Bank to ensure that the subprojects will be justified on finan-
cial, economic and equity grounds. Each subproject would be selected
out of three feasible technical alternatives of which the alternative
chosen for design would be the least cost solution at a discount
rate of 10% and would be designed to meet water supply needs for
about six years after project completion. If the WD so desires
construction would be in two phases. Each one of these phases would
be technically sound and be compatible with the total design and
will meet needs for about three years after construction completion;
and
(c)  demonstrate to these communities that with relatively modest and
timely increases of water tariffs the communities could improve and
expand their water supply systems and gradually become more self-
reliant.
Project Benefits
5.03      Safe Water.  With the project, all consumption and production will
be measured, leaking pipes identified through leakage surveys for replacement,
needed extensions made in each system and chlorinators installed to make the
water safe for consumption. Without the project gastroenteritis and other
water related diseases, which mostly go unreported, would continue to delibi-
tate the working population and affect the growing children. Mortality and
morbidity rates due to such diseases would remain high and there would be a
continuous threat of epidemics of cholera, typhoid or infectious hepatitis.



- 23 -
5.04      Service to the Poor./l  There are no reliable estimates on the
number of poor in these provincial cities and rural areas. According to Bank
group estimates 39% of the estimated urban population of 13 million and 44%
of the rural population of 32 million of the Philippines were below the
absolute poverty line in 1977. In the three sample cities the 1978 income
distribution (based upon local perceptions) of consumers with house connec-
tions is shown in Table 5.1. In these cities the percentage of people, below
the absolute poverty line with house connections and standpipes, according to
the Bank's definition will be about 42% in Guagua, 70% in Orani and 64% in
San Jose. Assuming that the subproject WDs are similar to the sample WDs, it
is reasonable to conclude that between 40% and 60% of the population served
would be the absolute poor. In the same three cities about 16%, 33% and 26%
of the consumption will be by the absolute poor. On the basis of consumption,
about 25% of the total cost of the 3 subprojects of $2.05 million for these
cities will be for the absolute poor. Therefore, out of the total project
cost of $64 million, about $16 million is directly attributable to the absolute
poor.
5.05      Taking only the incremental number of persons served in the three
sample cities (33,600) the capital cost of providing the incremental service
is about P 441 ($60) per person. This is a low cost because the first stage
project aims at making immediate improvements and some extensions to demons-
trate to the communities the advantage of a safe and affordable public water
supply and will be a catalyst for further improvements and extensions by these
communities.
Employment
5.06      It is estimated that an average of 860 skilled and 1,300 unskilled
jobs will be provided over 4 years during project construction, LWUA's engi-
neering staff will increase by about 100% and each project WD will have a
small increase in operational staff because of the program.
Economic Evaluation
5.07      Because the subprojects for this loan are in various stages of
preparation and identification, it is impossible to calculate an overall
internal rate of return for the project. However, for the three sample cities
of Guagua, Orani and San Jose, using future tariffs (in constant prices) as a
minimal measure of economic benefits and assuming a foreign exchange conver-
sion factor of 0.9, the internal rates of return are 7.4%, 6.6% and 9.8%,
respectively. These presume a willingness to pay future tariffs on the
part of the consumers. In addition, these rates do not include the
/1 For 1977, the Bank group has defined the absolute urban and rural poverty
lines in the Philippines as $250 and $190 per capita per annum respec-
tively (P 1,877 and P 1,410).



- 24 -
"consumer surplus", or value of water to the consumer beyond that which he
is asked to pay. A more direct measure of the internal economic rate of
return is impossible due to the difficulty of quantifying health benefits.
The average incremental cost of water in these three cities is close to future
tariffs. (See Annex 9).
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
5.08      The rural water supply component of the project is part of Govern-
ment's basic policy to increase the public water supply coverage to about 85%
of the total population by 1987 with special attention to the rural areas.
This component will help the establishment of an organization for rural water
supply and also lay the foundation for future programs. The pilot rural
sanitation projects would assist the Government in planning of future rural
sanitation programs.
Project Risks
5.09      This is a large project in the context of LWUA's management capa-
bility, staff availability and the capacity of the limited local consulting
services. On the other hand, there is great pressure from the Government and
the people for an affordable water supply program on a scale much larger than
what has ever been attempted before. Therefore, in order to ensure that the
project generates the expected benefits, it is important that (i) the Water
Districts are formed to schedule; (ii) feasibility studies and detailed
designs completed on time; and (iii) subprojects implemented efficiently
within the time and cost allowed for in the implemetnation schedule. The Bank
is providing technical assistance for training LWUA staff in preparing the
financial projections for the large number of subprojects. LWUA has a
Project Manager for supervising the feasibility studies, preparation,
detailed design and supervision of construction. It was agreed during
negotiations that LWUA will complete the formation of 50 subproject WDs by
June 30, 1980. At the end of each year after the date of effectiveness, LWUA
will review progress in project implementation and make necessary changes to
ensure that the project is completed on time.
5.10      The project also faces the risk that since experienced expatriate
consultants are being replaced by relatively inexperienced but enthusiastic
local consultants there may be delays in the preparation of detailed designs
and in project implementation. Also in the preparation of the feasibility
studies, to be done mostly by LWUA staff there may be delays because of poor
management by relatively inexperienced project managers and untrained staff if
there is no improvement in LWUA's present high turnover. There is a provision
for technical assistance in the project which with timely use would alleviate
these risks (see para. 3.11).
5.11      Bank supervision missions would play a key role in minimizing
the project risks. Not only should they occur at around every four months,
more than the normal amount of staff time will be needed in the technical and
financial reviews of subprojects.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with Government
and LWUA on the following main points:
(i) policies and procedures for collection (para. 2.10);
(ii)  criteria for water supply subprojects in WDs (para. 3.04);
(iii) equity contribution of 20% to WDs (para. 3.04);
(iv)  criteria for rural water supply subprojects (para. 3.05);
(v) LWUA's financial policies (para. 4.03);
(vi)  increase of LWUA's paid-in capital (para. 4.06);
(vii) rates of return for WDs (para. 4.13);
(viii)  annual review of WDs' water charges (para. 4.15).
6.02      Conditions of credit/loan effectiveness would be:
(i) the execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between Government
and LWUA on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para.
2.01).
(ii)  review of water tariffs for the WDs in the ongoing project and
implementation of needed tariff increases (para. 2.12).
6.03      As a condition for disbursements of the rural component of the
credit/loan, MPWTC should have established an organization for rural
water supply (para. 2.15).
6.04      Subject to the above the project is suitable for an IDA credit of
$22.0 million on the usual terms and a Bank loan of $16.0 million for a term
of 20 years incuding a grace period of five years.

PHILIPPINES
PROVINCIAL CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
Subproject Criteria
Discussed with LWUA and Government Officials During Negotiations
and Included in the Agreed Minutes
Part 1 - Water Districts
Eligibility, Preparation, Review, Appraisal and Design Criteria for
Subprojects in Water Districts
A. Eligibility. Before a feasibility study on a subproject is started
the concerned WD should have: (a) obtained a Conditional Certificate
of Conformance; (b) authorized LWUA to act in its behalf as an agent
of the WD in the WD's dealings with the Bank; (c) obtained general
approval from the consumers through public hearings to higher rates
for improved service. A quarterly statement indicating the status of
these actions should be sent to the Bank.
B. Preparation. The terms of reference for the preparation of the
feasibility studies for each package would be approved by the Bank
and be based upon the ongoing master plan and feasibility studies for
the first package. LWUA would follow technical guidelines and
methodology satisfactory to the Bank and in effect on the date of the
agreement including the following provisions:
1.  Water District Formation.  The third and fourth groups of 32
candidate water districts for feasibility studies should have
Conditional Certificates of Conformance (CCCs) issued by
September 1, 1979 and June 1, 1980 respectively. The fifth and
sixth groups should have CCCs issued by December 31, 1981.
2. Master Plans. Study period up to year 2000.
3.  Feasibility Studies.  First stage design period - 6 years
First phase - 3 years
Served population - not less than 70%,
through house connections
and public faucets
4.  Least Cost Solution
For each subproject three feasible technical alternatives
will be chosen for preliminary study; the alternative to
be selected for detailed study will be that with the
lowest present value of incremental capital investments
and operational expenses during the design period discounted
at a rate of 10%.

5. Tariffs
(i) Tariffs shall be progressively stepped upwards with any one
increase after the initial not to exceed 60% at a time for
domestic service;
(ii)  The tariff structure will achieve both financial (para. 6)
and equity goals; the top block of non-domestic services
will be based on marginal supply cost;
(iii)  There will be an annual review of tariffs and those families
who consume less than 10 cu m per month will spend no more
than 4% o. family income for water. In very exceptional
cases this could be increased to 5% of family income. This
block would be subsidized through higher charges to larger
domestic consumers and commercial and industrial users.
6. Cost Estimates and Financial Projections
(i)  The cost estimates and projections for each subproject will
be prepared with assumptions and contingency provisions
satisfactory to the Bank;
(ii)  For each subproject the rate of return on average revalued
net fixed assets in operation will be assumed to be 3% in
the third year of construction, increasing to 4%, 5%, 6% and
7% respectively in each succeeding year and 8% thereafter.
(iii) Each WD will contribute over a period of five years at least
10% of the project cost from internally generated funds.
C. Application for Government Equity Contribution
1. The following steps will be taken by LWUA for subprojects to be
financed by 20% equity contribution from Government:
(i) LWUA will submit the draft final feasibility study
report to the Water District at a public hearing.
(ii) Conclusive public hearing: LWUA will submit to the Bank
the draft final report with the written agreement by the
WD to the progressive increase of tariffs and 10% equity
contribution for expert internal review.
(iii) Inconclusive public hearing: LWUA will within one month
present a modified subproject at a final public hearing.
(iv) LWUA will, release the 20% Government equity contribution
for subprojects in category (ii) pari passu with LWUA's
disbursements.



_ 35 -                             ANNEX 1
Page 3
(v) LWUA will submit regular statements to Government of
projects financed by the equity contribution.
D.  Subproject Review by LWUA
1.  LWUA will appoint an independent expert technical review team
acceptable to the Bank composed of an engineer, hydrologist
financial analyst and economist with one member external to LWUA
to review in detail the master plan and feasibility study, of
each subproject. The team would normally make a recommendation
in four working days which may include a site visit.
2.  Based on the findings of the review LWUA would make necessary
changes, and submit the final report for Bank approval together
with the report of the team.
E. Detailed Design
1.  On receipt of the Bank's comments upon the master plan and feas-
ibility study for each subproject LWUA would make any agreed
changes and prepare detailed design drawings to standard specifi-
cations satisfactory to the Bank, which will include but not be
limited to:
(i) the development of modular designs;
(ii) design files for:
(a) hydrological studies;
(b) pumping tests;
(c) hydraulic network analysis;
(d) soil and foundation tests.
(iii) special engineering economic studies comparing technical
specifications, investment costs and operating and
maintenance costs for selecting the least cost alter-
native for major subproject components, and
(iv) design files for pipelines, hydraulic structures and all
other major structures.
(v) revised cost estimates and financial projections.

F. Bid Documents
LWUA will prepare for approval by the Bank a model set of bid
documents for each subproject compatible with the Bank's procurement
guidelines dated March 1977. Subsequent changes to the model bid
documents would be made only with the approval of the Bank. Based
upon the agreed model LWUA will prepare bid proposal forms for each
subproject for Bank review.
G. Supervision of Construction
LWUA will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the expert
review of the detailed design calculations and drawings and supervision
of construction. Final completion drawings and a completion report
satisfactory to the Bank on each subproject will be prepared within
one month of the date of commissioning of the major facilities in
each subproject.
H. Training
LWUA will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for (i) use of
vehicles and training equipment procured under the project for a
public education program in the WDs, schools and for the training of
LWUA staff in the design of low cost water supply systems; (ii)
overseas training of about 150 man-months of LWUA and WD staff in the
preparation, design, management, operation and maintenance of water
supply projects.
Part 2 - Rural Water Supply
Eligibility, Preparation, Appraisal and Design Criteria for Rural Water
Supply Subprojects
A. Eligibility
The eligibility of a rural community for a rural water supply subproject
will be:
1. Formation of a Rural Water Supply Association (RWSA);
2. Approval of the RWSA by the National Water Resources Council.
3. Agreement by the RWSA to (a) contribute at least 10% of the sub-
project cost in cash or kind such as labor or locally available
materials; (b) repay the remainder of the project cost at about 4%
interest over a period of 20 years; and (c) set water charges at
levels to meet debt service and operation and maintenance costs.

ANNEX 5

Assumptions for LWUA's Financial Projections
General
1.        LWUA's experience is limited only to four years of operations
(1975-78) (for the last part of 1973 and 1974 the efforts were mainly
directed to organization and promotion). Even today LWUA is still in the
learning stage and so its policies and operational procedures need to be
periodically adjusted. For this reason the figures used for the projected
statements are not an extrapolation of historic behavior but targets or
judgements.
Revenues
2.        Interest on-loans to Water Districts:  projections are based on
LWUA's lending program.
3.        Interest on Investment:  it was assumed that LWUA will maintain
funds invested in short-term government securities at the level it had at the
end of 1978, with a yield of 9.5%.
4.        Other Revenues.  represent mainly income from sale of bidding
documents. In the past fees from training programs and advisory services
were charged to WDs. This was a good practice that was discontinued to
reduce WDs' costs.
Expenses
5.        Financial Expenses:  forecast on the basis of projected disbursement
of loans already contracted, the proposed credit/loan and other loans from
sources still not fully identified (para. 409).
6.        Administrative Services:  plant increases of 30% for 1979 and 1980,
20% for 1981, 10% for 1982 and 5% thereafter are expected to be required to
cover LWUA's growing needs until it reaches certain maturity. In addition an
inflation rate of 8% per year was included.
Provision
7.        Provision for Bad Debts:  following auditor's advice and Bank's
recommendation this provision should be introduced in 1979. Since the level
has not been defined by the COA it was assumed as 3% of the outstanding
loans at the end of 1978, 4% in 1979 and 5% in 1980 and thereafter.
8.        Depreciation:  up to 1978 fixed assets were mainly equipment and
vehicles and an average life of 5 years was assumed. With LWUA's new building
in 1979 an average depreciation rate of 7.5% was assumed to reflect the new
mix of fixed assets.

Current Assets
9.        Minimum Cash Requirement:   was estimated as equivalent to one month
of cash operating expenses plus one month of disbursement to WDs.
10.       Interest Receivable:  assumed to be equivalent to 90 days of collectable
interest from WDs.
11.       Accounts Receivable:  include short-term loans to WDs equivalent to
10% of their investment program for the year plus the equivalent of 90 days of
loan repayments from WDs for each year.
Special Projects
12.       Include projects undertaken by LWUA on behalf of the Government.
LWUA is reimbursed for its total cost.
Deferred Assets
13.       Include organizational costs and studies not recoverable from WDs
which are assumed to be amortized in five years.
Current Liabilities
14.       Interest Payable:  Assumed equivalent to 90 days of interest payable
during the year.
15.       Accounts Payable and Retentions:  according to the limited histor-
ical experience, were projected as equivalent to 30 days of the amount
disbursed each year by LWUA for WDs' programs.
16.       Taxes Payable:  starting in 1979 (PD 1177) LWUA has to pay corporate
taxes. Although there is a possibility that LWUA will be reimbursed by
Government for its tax payments, no specific decision has been made so far.
It was assumed that regular corporate tax of 25% on the first P 100,000 of
taxable income and 35% on the excess will be applicable. It was assumed that
LWUA would pay its taxes during the year following its accrual.
Long-Term Debt
17.       Each one of loans contracted so far by LWUA and the proposed
credit/loan were projected. The balance of borrowings included in LWUA's
program (for which sources are not fully defined) was assumed to be contracted
with 20 years repayment period including 5 years grace period and an interest
of 8% per year.

Assumptions for the Financial Projections of Orani Guagua
and San Jose Water Districts
Income Statement
Revenue
1.        Tariff levels were set to meet the following objectives:
(a) following government regulations, tariff increases should not
exceed 60% of the existing level;
(b) revenue generation should be adequate to meet the minimum rates of
return on net revalued fixed assets of 3% in 1981, 4% in 1982, 5%
in 1983, 6% in 1984; 7% in 1985 and 8% in 1986 and thereafter;
(c) net internally generated funds should be at least equivalent to 10%
of the project cost.
(d) after project completion, the WD should be able to meet its debt
service and to undertake a reasonable amount of investment to
continue extending and improving the system.
2.        In each case, a substantial effort to reduce the percentage of
unaccounted-for water is expected.
3.        Other operational revenue include penalties, reconnection fees, etc.
Operating Cost
4.        A general 8% escalation per year on operating cost was used.  Wages
are expected to increase about 20% to 25% (including escalation) during the
project period. This reflects the need of recruiting additional staff as
well as improving the remuneration of the present personnel.
5.        Chemicals and power increase with water production.  Cost of materials
increases reflect the need for better maintainance of the present system as
well as the expanded facilities. Other indirect cost comprises losses due to
bad debts estimated as 2% of water revenues. Depreciation was calculated at
3% of average revalued gross fixed assets in operation.
Flow of Funds
6.        Government is expected to contribute up to 20% of the investment
program to match the WDs' 10% internally generated funds. LWUA's loan,
equivalent to 70% of the project, will have a total repayment period of 30
years and 9% interest. In each case, the grace period was set to fit the
financial capacity of the W.D. Interest during grace period are financed and
capitalized.



ANNEX 8

7.        After project completion, the amount of other works indicate the
level of investment that the W.D. could undertake with its own internally
generated funds without any external financing.
8.        Temporary cash deficits are assumed to be covered with short-term
loans from LWUA.
Balance Sheet
9.        Fixed assets are revalued each year at 8% equal to the assumed
inflation rate.
10.       Mtinimum cash levels were calculated as equivalent to two months of
cash operating expenses. Accounts receivable were assumed equal to 60 days
of billings. Inventories were calculated to cover two months requirements of
chemicals and materials. Accounts payable were estimated as equivalent
to 60 days of cash operating expenses excluding wages and power.
11.       Annex 7 presents the projected financial statements for Orani,
Guagua and San Jose as well as their monitoring indicators.

PROVINCIAL CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
Internal Economic Rate of Return and Average Incremental Costs
for Orani, Guagua and San Jose WDs
1.        The incremental return on investment or internal economic rate of
return (IER) is the discount rate which equates the present values of the cost
and benefit streams attributable to the investment. Project justification is
then determined by comparing this rate with the opportunity cost of capital
in the economy. When the benefits of a water supply project are minimally
approximated by the revenue generated, the same input information can be used
to calculate the average incremental cost (AIC) of the water sold. The AIC
is the cost per cubic meter of the incremental water sold, averaged over the
project's life and discounted back to the present using the opportunity cost
of capital. Thus, if the price of water is set equal to its AIC, the internal
economic rate of return on the project will just equal the opportunity cost
of capital.
2.        The assumptions used to calculate the IER and AIC for the three
project cities are listed below.
(a) All costs are in constant prices of mid-1979, exclusive
of taxes and duties.
(b) The official exchange rate of P 7.4 per dollar is
adjusted by a standardd conversion factor of 0.9
to obtain a shadow exchange rate of P 8.2 per dollar.
This means that the shadow exchange rate is 10.8%
above the official rate.
(c) The opportunity cost of capital is 10%.
(d) The projects have a useful life of 30 years.
