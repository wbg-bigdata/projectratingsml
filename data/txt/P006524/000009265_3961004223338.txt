MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIIE BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELPMNT
TO TH EEE    DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE STATE OF MINAS GERALS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE EDERATIVE REPUBIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendatio on a proposed loan
to the State of Minas Gerais, with the g tee of the Federative Republic of Brazd, for the equivalent
of US$150.0 million to help finance a Municipal Management and Eironmental Infrastructure Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturitj of 15 years, including
five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be reent to municipalities and selected Stat
agencies for five, ten and fifteen years, including one to three years of grace, with a real interest rate of
about 12% per annum.
2.     akgougd. Ihe 1988 constitutional reforms have enhanced the importance of municipalities
in Brazil's federal system, so that they now have both greater responsibilities - in particular In the area
of provision of infrastructure and social services - and increased revenues from own and transfer sources
to fulfill their new responsibilities. Again the backgromund of macroeconomic crisis which begn in the
early 1980s and high urbanization rates (as rural poor migrated to cities, driven in part by the crisis),
Brazil's municipalites conront increasing challenges in the adequate and efficient provision of services:
Ihe first is low productivity of infrstructure assets. Brazil's mature infrastructure networks are among
the most extensive in the region, however, these ageing assets have not been adequately mainained and
are insufficient to meet the growing demand for service. Second, with population pressure and the
econic crisis, the informal economy has provided services in an unregulated fashion which has led to
degradation of the urban ecosystem, paricularly infavela areas. Third, over the past decade, poverty
in Brazil has become increasingly an urban problem, with the urban poor accounting for neady half of
toWal poor. Fourth, along with macroeconomic difficulties has come failure of federal infrastrcture
delivery programs, creating an insttional and resource gap. And fifth, despite the decentralization,
municipalities coninue to be dependent financialy on federal and state transfers, with less ta one-fifth
of revenues generated by own sources on average. These factrs point to a need to strengthen
municipalities' capabilities to efficiently manage both their resources and responsibilities.
3.    These national-level trends have nowhere been more apparen than in the State of Mas Gerais.
The Stae's dominant economic activity, particularly in the southern regions proximate to the primary
markets of Sbo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, has shifted over the past decade from agriculture (30% of State
GDP in 1960, falling to 15% in 1989) to the urban-based heavy industial sectors (from 14% of GDP
in 1960 to 28% in 1989). Changing economic trends and employment opportunities led to a dramatic
urbanization, with urban population more than doubling (from 36% of total In 1960 to 78% in 1989).
Although this economic activity has enabled Minas to become one of Brazil's wealthiest states - GNP
was US$38 billion, or 10% of the national total in 1990 - this wealth is unevenly distrbued, with 35%
of the economically active population in 1987 surviving on just two minimum salaries (compared with
the national rate of 29%). Under the stress of increased demand for service and inadequate mait_ece,
urban infastructure has become significantiy degraded, particularly in the area of sanitation, where
environment, health and poverty-alleviation concerns play an importat role. The sanitadon sectors have
beeni identified by the State government as among those with highest priority.
4.    Minas Gerais is also one of the couny's most diverse states, with a high degree of geographic
and economic strfification. In essence, Mias is a microcosm of Brazil: The economically-dominant
southern region bodering on SAD Paulo and Rio de Janeiro has comparatively high per-capita income and



-2-
urboanization rates (with the atendant problems of inadequate service provision and environmena
degradatoi), whlfe the region to the northeast is poorer, less densely urbanized, and has a differing set
of municip alhlenges, Including lower investment cacities and weaker Institutions.1 Municipalities
in the west of the State are principally rura and agriculture-based. Thus the State prsents a wide variety
of municipal types, a broad range of urban Issues and a high degree of variability in municipal fiancial
and institutional mangement capabilities.
5.    PWect Objectves. Ihe primary objectives of the proposed Minas Gerals Municipal Management
and Environmental Infrastucture (SOMMA) Project are: (a) to strengthen municipal financial
management in support of decentralization, through technical assistance to increase own-resource
mobilization, and training and incentives for efficient allocation of resources for both crrt expenditure
and capital investment; and (b) to improve environmenal management, through development of a
coherent State strategy for local provision of water and sewerage services, investment in priority basic
sat     infrastructure, and provision of technical assistance and etaining for municipal administraions
in environment management. In addition, the project will test the viability of two alternatives to
municipal service provision: (1) private sector provision of high-return services under appropriate
regulaxory frameworks, as required; and (i) cooperative regional service provision in poorer,
Ititutionaly weaker Northern municipalities.
6.    Project objectives are explicitly espoused in a Policy Statement of Decentralization and Municipal
trengthening of the State of Mnas Gerais, presented to the Bank during Negotations. The Policy
Statement sets out the States commitment to strengthening local governments through sound fiscal and
administraive management, accountability and efficiency in investrients and current expenditures, and
equity in service provision. As one of the key means of achieving these goals, the Policy Statement sets
out the State's intention to reduce discetionary transfers to municipalities and instead channel these funds
as counterpart to the SOMMA program, where they will be invested according to clearly-defined criteria.
7.     .oect estio  The project consists of five components: Part A, Institutional development
(8% of project costs); Part B, environmental Infrastruchwe (88% of costs); Part C, pilot projects (3%
of costs); and Parts D and E, studies (ess than 1% of costs). The institutional development component
would consist, Inter alta, of technical assistance for: updating and comp   property tax cadastres,
assessing the structure and improving billing and collection of property taxes and municipally-set user-
charges for water, sewerage and other services, Improving planning and zoning, strengthening local
enviromenl councils, and preparing draft environmental legislation; as weli as training in fancial and
adminisraive management. Technical assitance will also be provided to strengthen the State's economic
development foundaton, the Fundawo Joao Pinheiro (FJP), as an apex institution charged with
establishing norms and standards for, supervising and monitoring the institonal development
component. The ifrastructure component would consist of investments in the State's priority basic
sanitaion sectors, primarily: water sstem improvements, distribution and limited production; sewage
collection and limited treatment; drainage, erosion control and related road paving and public lighting;
and solid waste collection and disposal. Appropriate low-cost techmologies, in single municipalities or
through regional cooperation, would be encouraged for sewage treatment and solid waste disposal. The
project includes two small pilots: (a) to assess the potential for private provision of cumently public
municipal services (for which a small private sector counerart is planned); and (b) to test cooperative
regional delivery of services through associations of small municipalities in the poorer North of the State.

Studies at the State level will include: (i) development of a medium-term operational strategy for local
water and sewerage service provision in the State, supporing the decentralization of the sector; and vi)
an examination of the medium-term options for financing (including private sector equity and debt
instuments) of infrastructure services for which municipalities are responsible.
8.    The project is estimated to require about six years to implement, at a total cost of US$333.1
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$83.9 million (about 25% of costs). A
bradown of project cost, and project financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations in Brazil are provided in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map of the State of Minas Gerais is also attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 11714-
BR, dated June 21, 1993, is being distributed separately.
9.    Project hnplementation. The Borrower would be the State of Minas Gerais. Ihe State would
use the proceeds of the Bank loan and its own countepart funds to capitalize a municipal development
fund (SOMMA Fund), to be managed by the Banco de Desenvovlnento de Mias Gerais (BDMG), the
Stte's development bank. BDMG would be the Executing Agency for Parts A-D of the proposed
project, while the water sector strategy study under Part E would be executed by the State's Planning
Secreiat, with BDMG's assistance.  The SOMMA Fund would make sub-loans primarily to
municipalities for up to 75% -f investments under the nstitutional development and environmental
infrastructure components, with municipalities providing the remaining counterpart.2 The exact mix of
instidonal investments would be determined through individualized diagnosis and dewelopment of an
agreed Strategic Action Plan (PAE), with specific performance targets set out in sub-loan contracts.
Infastructure investment costs would be fully recovered at the local level through user charges for
revenue-ening services (eg., water and sewerage) and through property valuation and tax increases as
a result of the physical improvements for non revenue-earning services (eg., drainage and paving).
BDMG would appraise sub-borrowers and sub-projects on the basis of agreed technical, economic,
financial and insutional selection crieia, set out in an Operational Mamnu  which was agreed during
Negotiations and issued by the Executing Agency's Board of Directors June 9, 1993. The Manual also
includes guidelines for preparation of loan and technical assistance applications, procurement and
disbursement procedures, environmental licensing and impact assessment, and other project
mplementation procedures. While municipalities would be primary sub-borrowers, State, municipal and
other water and sewerage companies would also bt eligible for sub-loans on behalf of the municipalities
for which they hold service concessions. First-year investments of about US$60.0 million, and about
US$60.0 million in investments to be undertaken by the State water company, COPASA (together
represendng nearly 40% of project costs), have been evuated and approved. Municipalities would
implement the infrastructure components, with the assistance of sectoral technical agents and specialized
consultants.
10.   Sub-loans would have repayment tems of five, ten and fiften years, with a grace period (from
one to three years) and a real interest rate of about 12% (set on the basis of the cost of the Bank loan plus
a 3% spread),3 adjusted for the effects of inflon with the IGP-M, an appropriate index. The spread

would cover administaive costs and the risk of foreign exchange fluctuation (assuming the adjustment
index moves rughy In tandem with the devaluatin of the cruzeiro). Any residual foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the State. Ihe sub-loans would be guaranteed by commitmeu of municipal value-
added tax (ICMS) or Municipal Participation Fund (FPM) allocations, and by water company pledging
of tariff revenues or assets.
11.   hWt ua          =. State govenment commitment to project objectives, as set forth In the
Policy Statement, is a primay factor contributing to susinability. An experienced Executing Agency
is a frter key factor. Ihe proposed project, the fifth in a series of similar projects which are being
successfully implemented in other states in Brazil, was desigped in light of the lessons learned in these
previous projects. Market-approximating interet rates, cost-recovery at the sub-project level, and the
fact that the Bank loan would be repaid by the Stawe (makhmg Bank funds a permanent capitalization of
the SOMMA Fund) also increase the likelihood of project sustanbilty.
12.   L1on   nefrom Prviosg Bank    vem A. The proposed project would build on lessons
learned over sevral decades of Bank involvement in the water and urban sectors. OED reports have
commentod on excessive complexity of projects, ambitousess of objectives and weakness of executing
agencies, suggesting the need for simpli1ied project designs, greater flexibility in project implementation
and inovative supervision strategies. Tnese needs are even greater in the Northeast of the country,
where recent projects in the metropolkan regions of Recife and Salvador suffered senous implementtion
setbacks. Further, project completion reports have emphasized strengthening of municipal resource
mobilization and access to fancing, a more coherent approach to environmental management and greater
use of appropriate low-cost technologies for basic sanitation. Accordingly, and following the
decentralizadon reforms, the Bans assistce strategy has shifted towards improving the capacity of the
states and municipalities to effectively assume increased responsibilities for efficient ma.zgement of
resources and services under a new generation of rrojects being implemented in the southern states of
Santa Carina, ParanI and Rio Grande do Sul. Lessons from the mid-term reviews of these projects,
partcularly regarding: the identification of a firm pipeline of projects for the first year of implementation;
explicit linkage between the instiion  development and infastructure components; streamlining of
operational and implementation procedures; simplification of sector focus; and greater involvement of the
private sector have been inwcoporated into project design.
13.   Raionale f  Bank l           The Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies
and investmts that will encourage economic growth and socia development in the context of
macroeconomic stability. The Bank's emphasis is on efficien resource alocation, increased efficiency
in the public sector, improved environmental management and the appropriate targeting and delivery of
services to the poor. The Bank's strategy in the urban sector i to support the decentralization reforms
which took effect with the 1988 Constitution, and foster amonig Brazil's municipalities strengthened
financia management and increased fis  responsibility, in support of the macroeconomic policies of the
federal governmt. Urban sector strategy also emphasizes the importance of integratd environmental
management and development of incentives and tools for private sector participation in the provision of
infrastrucreservices at the local level. If municipalities are to be responsible fr expenditures on many
types of public goods and services, reform of the role, functions and fmancW  management of local
governmens must be designed as a coherent pacage. The proposed project would provide municipalities
with access to fnancing for inftructure (absence of long-term credit Instruments in Brazil and lack of
borrowing bistoty of most municipalities has made such financing unavailable), enable them to develop
creditwortiness for future prudent borrowing, and develop options for increased private sector
participation in the financing of nmnicipal Infastructure.



14.   Age  Actons. pgrin  Negiato, agreement was reacied on the followig: (a) a plan for
implementaion of the micro-regional pilot; tems of reference for the study componnt of the
privatizton pilot. and legal arrangemets for Implementation of the first test case; funding Iimits for each
pilot program, and that the mid-term review make a determaion whetker to discontinue or expand these
pilots; (b) terms of reference for the State studies, and timetables for their 'mplementation (to be
completed no later than mid-term reiew); (c) the project financing plan and the Borrower's guart
regarding necessary project counterpart funds; (d) that BDMG execute Parts A-D, and that the State
execute Part E (through SEPLAN and with BDMG's assistace) and cause 3DDMG to perform
satisfctorily; (e) the fia version of the Operational Maua, and tht the SOMMA program be opeated
in accord with the Manual; (f) the sub-loan interest rate to be calculated on the basis of the interest rate
of the Bank loan plus a 3% spread; the IGP-M to be used for adjusting local-currenc sub-loan balances;
and that the interest rate be discused amually; (g) appropiat  antees to be provided by sub-
borrowers; and that, beginning in the third year of implementaion, no sub-borrower be able to borrow
annually more than 10% of the total project amount (with the exception of COPASA wich woud be
limited to 20%) without prior consultation with the Bank; (h) that the Stte cause COPASA to mainPX
and improve its performance, according to an agreed Financial Plan; ) that the Bank have prior .elew
for those sub-projes expected to cost US$5.0 milion or more (US$2.0 million In the case of sewage
utatment and solid waste disposal sub-projects); 0) that Technical Agent agreements satsfctory to the
Bank for assistance with evaluation and supervision of sub-projects be sige with qualified agencies as
needed during project implemenation; (k) model Participation Agreements and Sub-Loan Contracts; and
that all conditions pent in the agreements between the Borrower and the Bank be reflected in the sub-
loan contracts between BDMG and sub-borrowers, as necessay; (I) procurment arrangements; (m)
disbursement arrangements, including establishment of a Special Account; (n) audit arrangements; (o) that
qterly monitoring reports, including one detailed annual report, be furniished to the Bank on the dates
wreed, to include, Inter alla, the agreed implementation schedule and monitoring indicators in the
Operational Mamual; (p) tat a mid-term review be scheduled about two and a half years after
Effectivtness; and that the Borrower prepare and fiurish to the Bank a Project Completion Report within
sic months after the Closing Date; and (q) that the State cause FEAM to perform Its environmental review
fmction satctorily.
15.    Prior to Board Presenitaon, the State presented its Policy Statement on Decentralization and
municipal Strengtheing.  rior to Loan ffinM, Technical Agent aeem    saiftory to the
Bank would be signed between BDMG and the following: COPASA, CEMIG and FJP, with the latter
to include responsibilities and monitoring indicators regarding FJP's role as ape cInsttion for the
insttutional development component. As a Conditon of DiLbum, appropriate environmenta
assments, consisewt with Brazlian law and Bank guidelie  (ncluding resettlement plans, if
neceary), would be undertaken. Because several sub-projects are well-advanced, retroactive financing
of up to 10% of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred after Jamny 1993, but not more than
12 months prior to loan Signature, is recommended.
16. Environmental Aset. Because of its focus on the sanitation sector, the project is expected to
have significant enviromental benefits, primarily related to improved sewage collection and treatment,
drainage, and solid waste collection and disposal, reduced water distribution system losses, and ari
integrated approach to management of sanitation services at the municipal level. The State envkomental
agency, FEAM, has a satisfactory classification system for environmental licensing and Impact assessment
according to project size and expected impact; less than 10% of sub-projects will require full
environmental a sm ents under these guidelines. Require environmental screeniag for the progrm
of first-year investments has been completed, and finalized eionmental  essm    report, where
necessary, would be a condition of disbursement. No serious eniromnental issues are foreseen.

17.   Pgo       bjective ategQds. Consistent with the Bank's goals for the sector, the projects
primary areas of emphasis would be tirst, improved public sector management (fiscal responsibility,
efficiency of investments), second, environment management and, third, to the extent possible, private-
sector development and poverty-alleviation.
18.                  Thect Benefits, Sne principal benefits of the proposed project would be: (a) enhanced municipal
resource mobilization as a result of increased proptvty tax and user-charge revenues; and (b) greater
e4Paciency in mamngement of current expenditures and prioritizaton of infrastructr investments.
Benefits would also include increased access of the State's urban population, a sizeable portion of which
(about 35%) are poor, to basic infrastracture services. In addition, the project's infrastructre
investments would have significant positive impact on environmental conditions in the State. (3iven the
socio-economic diversity of the State of Minas Gerais, the project would address the needs of a broad
cross-section of Brazil's municipalities. It is expected that about 150 of the municipalities (those with
populations over 20,000), representing about 75% of the State's population, woul2 participate in the
Inrastructure component, while about 300 municipalities, or about 90% of the State's population would
participate in the institutional developraent component. The economic rate of return for a representative
sample of inastrcture sub-projects (approximaely 65% of project costs) is about 27%. ERRs for the
remainirg ifrastructure components ar. expected to be between 12% and 90%. Sub-project selection
criteria ensure a minimum 12% rate of return.
19.   RWk. The major project risk is implementation of the institutional development program, which
is a challenging component requiring significant advance planning, in pardcular in a state with such varied
municipal institutional capacities. For this reason, agreed technical assistance and training programs and
targets for municipalities to enter the project's first-year program have been prepared and agreed, and
progress on the institutional development component would be linked explicidy to the infrastructure
component for aU sub-borrowers. This risk is also mitigated through the Executing Agency's access to
the experience of neighboring southern states with similar projects. There are few technical risks
associated with the project, since most infasutrure investments are of a routine nature, with the
exception of certain sewage treatment sub-projects which may employ low-cost alternative technologies
sfill somewhat innovative and less-well tested. Amounts allocated to this type of sub-project are limited,
and Bank prior-review of sub-project proposals minimizes the risk. Ihere is a risk that State government
elections in 1994 may be disruptive to the project, however the fact that municipal mayors recently took
office kYanuary 1993) for four-year terms which coincide with the project implementaion period,
diminishes this risk somewhat by ensuring continuity at the local level. Ihe Executing Agency is a
sophisticated and well-managed development bank, with experience in managing urban development
projects and working with multilateral agencies.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
