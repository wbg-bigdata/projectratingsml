REPUBLIC OF MALI
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Mali
Implementing
Agencies:           The Ministry of Urban Planming and Housing (MUH) is the Project Co-
ordinator; the Public Works Executing Agency (AGETIPE), Energie du
Mali (EDM), and the Land Auctioning Agency (ACI), are the principal
implementing agencies, with the participation of 14 local governments.
Beneficianres:      1.5 million people in 10 cities and their 14 local governments, the MUH,
the Ministry of Culture and Communication (MCC), EDM, and ACI.
Poverty:            Project Targeted Interventions.
Credit Amount:      SDR 55.50 million (US$80.00 million equivalent).
Terms:              Standard IDA terns, with 40 years' maturity.
Cofinancing:        Central and local governments, ACI, and EDM will finance an amount of
US$13.50 millio:.. parallel fin.%ncing: Canada US$15.00 million; France
US$20.00 million; Germany a first slice of US$7.00 million; ICCROM
US$0.20 million; other donors have expressed interest in participating
with parallel financing (US$18.90 million).
On-Lending:         The amounts of the land development for housing (US$8.50 million) and
civil works for water supply (US$8.50 million) subcomponents financed
by the IDA Credit will be on-lent to ACI and EDM, respectively, at an on-
lending rate of 7.7% per annum, with 20 years' maturity and 5 years'
grace. ACI and EDM would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Economic Rate       The ERRs of the subprojects range from 12% to 91%.
of Return:
Project Objectives:    The project's mair! development objective is to improve the delivery, on a
sustainable basis, of urban infrastructure services by local governments,
in partnership with the Central Government, the private sector, and com-
munities. The project's specific operational objectives are to: (a) build
local government management capacity, improve performance, strengthen
operations and maintenance, and improve planning, programming, budget-
ing, financial management, and revenue generation; (b) improve the pro-
vision of basic urban services, especially in the poorest neighborhoods,



ii
through appropnatt; ;.~estments in basic infrastructure (including safe
water supply) and infrastructure for economic activities, while improving
the urban environment, and creating employment through labor-intensive
works; (c) help preserve Mali's historical cities and monuments, classified
as World Patrimony, in cooperation with the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the communities in-
volved; and (d) pursue improvements in the operation of the urban land
market, begun under the IDA-assisted Second Urban Project, while pro-
moting a progressive formal privatization of the land market, creating new
revenue sources for local governments, and guiding urban development
and expansion.
Project Description:   The proposed project would finance a five-year investment program in 10
cities and would include five components: (a) capacity-building compo-
nent (6% of the program cost): (i) to enhance local governments' mana-
gerial capacities, especially through the introduction of urban management
tools; (ii) to strengthen the monitoring capacity of the Central Govern-
ment; (iii) to provide technical and managerial assistance, equipment, and
training, to support the municipalities; (b) urban infrastructure mainte-
nance and investments (62% of the program cost) implemented by
AGETIPE on behalf of the municipalities: (i) maintenance of existing in-
frastructure, to be financed by the municipalities and the Govenmment;
(ii) rehabilitation and or construction of roads and drainage; (iii) studies
and pilot sanitation actions in Bamako and Mopti-S6vare; (iv) subprojects
to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods (in cooperation
with communities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); (v) land
development for economic activities: for marketplaces and road transport
termnals (to ue fr.nchised te the private sector), and for industrial activi-
ties (in Bamako); (c) historic cities and monuments (9% of the program
cost) to preserve and develop 15th century sanctuaries and mosques of
Timbuktu, the archeological sites and architecture of Djenne, and the sites
of Bandiagara-Dogon and their 1 Ith century culture, in cooperation with
UNESCO, private foundations of which the Getty Conservation Institute
(GCI), and the communities involved; (d) water supply in Bamako and
Mopti (13% of the program cost), implemented by EDMI to extend and
improve the transmission and distribution networks in large neighbor-
hoods; (e) land development for housing (10% of the program cost) im-
plemented by ACI: 10,000 plots to be equipped in Bamako, of which a
first program of 5,000 IDA-financed plots to be sold with secured titles
and full cost recovery, of which 3,500 would be sold by auction.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The project's main benefits would be: (a) strengthened role of local gov-
ernments in urban management and project development, in the context of
decentralization; (b) improved municipal financial resources and cost re-
covery to move toward more sustainable development; (c) a high eco-
nomic return of the planned investments; (d) improved living conditions,
particularly in the poorest neighborhoods; (e) job creation; and (f) devel-
opment of local industries in construction and tourism. The principal



iii
project risks stem from the possibility that the Central Government may
be unable to implement the urban policy reform and decentralization, or to
remove obstacles to the mobilization and allocation of adequate financial
resources for the municipalities. These risks stem also from the inability
of local governments to increase their revenue base and tax collection and
mobilize adequate financial resources for infrastructure maintenance and
counterpart funding. The risks are mitigated by the strong sense of own-
ership demonstrated by the central and local governments during project
preparation, the planned close monitoring of performance indicators of the
municipalities and the public investment programs, and prolonged and
close coordination with other donors. They are also mitigated by: (i) the
implementation of the Economic Management Operation which supports a
program of fiscal reforms to increase domestic resource mobilization;
(ii) the instruments set up by the project to improve local resource mobili-
zation (fiscal mapping, new fee on urban occupancy, and privatization of
marketplace management); (iii) the institutional support to local govem-
ments; and (iv) on the counterpart side, the annual programs of civil
works to be financed by the project will be a function of the funds mobi-
lized by the local and central governments and spent for urban infrastruc-
ture maintenance. For the water supply component, the main risks are:
the long-term financial viability of EDM could be threatened by lower
water consumption than planned, low bill recovery rate, EDM's inability
to raise tariffs to cover its expenses, and inadequate water operation.
These risks are mitigated by introducing a "social connection" program,
instituting a service shut-off within a short time, and continuing coordina-
tion with other donors. For the land development component, the main
risk stems from the fact that ACI would not be able to find land to be de-
veloped or be entrusted with land development operations. The 750 hec-
tares of land (for 15,000 plots) to be entrusted to ACI before negotiations
mitigate this risk.
Poverty:            The project targets the poorest neighborhoods in Bamako, where 50% of
the population live below the poverty line, and the regional capital cities,
especially in the North, where 75% of the population live below the pov-
erty line. The project's safe water supply and sanitation subcomponents
would benefit the poor, especially women and children, who lack access to
clean, affordable water and waste-disposal facilities, mainly in Bamako
and Mopti. The urban infrastructure improvement would provide basic
infrastructure services that would improve the living conditions of the ur-
ban poor. Furthermore, the use of labor-intensive works' subprojects
would create 200,000 person-mronths of direct jobs, of which 70% would
be for unskilled workers. The use of new management tools would help
the municipalities better prioritize their investments and target poor areas.

REPUBLIC OF MA,LI
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
A. ECONOMIc DEVELOPMENT
1.1   Economv. Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world with per capita income esti-
mated at about US$250 in 1995. Access to key social services, notably education, basic health,
potable water and sanitation is limited. Past growth performance was constrained by inappropriate
economic policies coupled with a long-term decline in competitiveness and terms of trade. Since
the late 1980s, the Government of Mali (GOM) has made fundamental changes in its econormic
development strategy, opting for a market-based approach in place of the centrally controlled sys-
tem that existed before. It has put in place important measures to correct distortions in the incen-
tive and regulatory system, liberalized domestic marketing and pricing, freed up intemational trade,
and withdrawn from participation in key economic sectors in favor of the private sector. It has
improved fiscal management and is continuing efforts to improve the efficiency of public resource
use.
1.2    Macroeconomic performance in 1995 was impressive. The economy grew by 6% in real
terms, the overall fiscal deficit was redu.-0 to 10.5%° of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from
13.7% in 1994, while the current-account deficit fell from 18.2% to 15.2% of GDP. Inflation was
reduced from 25% to about 12.5% in 1994. The reform measures put in place and the devaluation
of the CFA Franc (CFAF) in 1994, have helped boost Mali's medium-term growth prospects.
Real growth is projected to average about 5% per annum over the medium term allowing per capita
income growth of at least 1.5%. Agriculture will continue to be the main sector of economic activ-
ity though growth in sectors such as mining, construction, and tourism is expected to be significant.
The projected growth rates will have to be complemented by policies to help the poor benefit from
growth in order to achieve the Govenmment's objective of significantly reducing poverty. These
would include policies to improve access to education and health, support income-generating ac-
tivities, and improve basic urban infrastructure (including water), particularly in disadvantaged
urban communities.
1.3    Urban Economy.  Urban-based non-agricultural activities contributed about 66% to
Mali's GDP in 1995, compared to 45% in 1''-0 IL-dusLnal and services sectors grew at the rate of
about 5.3% and 5% per year, respectively, while the agricultural sector grew annually at about
1.7% between 1990 and 1994. Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to reach an
annual average rate of about 5%. The growth of agriculture is likely to foster the development of
related urban-based activities, such as agricultural processing, transfer and storage of farm output,
and the provision of commercial and financial services. This suggests that as Mali's national eco-
nomic performance continues to improve, the share of urban-based economic activities is likely to
expand faster than in the past. However the weakness of urban infrastructure hampers the growth
of non-agricultural activities, which require adequate access to transport networks, clean water
supply, sanitary facilities, safety from flooding, and availability of titled and improved land.



2
B. URBAN DEVELOPMENT
1.4    Demographic Trends. Mali's urban population is 2.25 million (25% of a total of about
9 mnillion, compared with an average of 35% in Westem Africa) and has grown very rapidly, at an
armual average rate of 4.8% between 1970 and 1980, and 5.2% between 1980 and 1992. The
overall population growth rate was 2.1% and 2.6 %, respectively, over these two periods. Urban
population is estimated to grow to 6.7 million (45% of the total) by 2015. The population of the
capital, Bamako, was 300,000 in 1970, increased to 900,000 in 1995, and is projected to reach
1.9 million in 2015. Only six towns have more than 50,000 inhabitants, and 69 more than 5,000
inhabitants.
1.5    Urban Povertv. As highlighted in the Bank's Assessment of Living Conditions in Mali
(1993), poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, yet urban poverty is growing at an acceler-
ated rate due to the gradual disappearance of traditional solidarity networks and difficulties in ac-
cessing food. More than 50% of the population (75% in the North) live below the poverty line.
Despite improvements introduced by the ongoing Agence d 'Execution de Travaux d 'lntere Public
pour l 'Emploi (AGETLPE) project, employment opportunities in urban areas are scarce, especially
in the formal sector. The resulting social and political pressures are fierce. Furthermore, the lack
of basic infrastructure hurts the poor the most and affects public health, as demonstrated in Mopti
and Gao, where water-related diseases are common and cholera outbreaks are recurrent (in Mopti,
15,000 cases of diarrhea in 1994, 700 cases of cholera, and 100 deaths reported in the second half
of 1995). In Bamako, water in the poorest neighborhoods is about three to ten times more expen-
sive than elsewhere, with prices ranging from CFAF 80 per cubic meter (m3) for connected houses
to CFAF 600-1,000 per m3 for water from other sources.
1.6 Instinttional Framework. At the±,^.co_i nllebi, several miristries are responsible for ur-
ban development. The Ministry of Territorial Admimstration and Security (MATS) oversees local
governments and the police. The Ministry of Finance and Trade (MFT) is responsible for tax col-
lection, including local taxes, the treasury, and land tenure. The Ministry of Urban Planning and
Housing (MUH) is responsible for city planning, control of urban development, and housing. The
Ministry of Mining, Energy, and Hydraulics, is responsible, through its regional directorates and
the public company, Energie du Mali (EDM), for urban water supply and electricity. Government
institutions responsible for urban development do not have adequate technical capacity. However,
two agencies operating in the urban sector are the exceptions: AGET1PE, the executing agency of
the ongoing Public Works and Capacity Building Project (PWCBP, Cr. 2371-MLI), and the ACI,
the land auctioning agency assisted by the Second Urban Project.
1.7    At the local level, there are 19 "communes" or municipalities (13 until 1966): 6 of these
are in the District of Bamako (created in 1974), 8 in the regional capitals, and 11 (5 created by the
transition government in 1991-92) in the secondary towns. Since 1992, these municipalities are
being govemed by elected councils and mayors and, in principle, they manage the cities. However,
they lack technical and financial capacity, with the exception of the District of Bamako which de-
veloped technical units during implementation of the two IDA-assisted urban projects. Until re-
cently, the laws have not been changed, and the Central Govemment failed to define the responsi-
bility of the municipalities, improve their finances and staffing, and supervise them. The rest of the
country is managed by Central Government officials, comprised of local representatives of the
central govenmment, 8 govemors at the regional level with regional technical departments, and ap-
proximately 286 "che'fs d'arrondissemene" or local districts. The Government is supporting a de-



3
centralization reform to be implemented in 1997, with newl,' elected municipal representatives (see
para. 1.12 below).
1.8    Urban Infrastructure and Services. The 10 cities (Bamako, Gao, Kayes, Kidal, Koulik-
oro, Mopti, Segou, Sikasso, Sevare, Timbuktu), assessed during project preparation, lack basic
infrastructure and services, and the level of facilities varies among cities and neighborhoods. The
number of households connected to safe water is small, between 12% and 48%, and only 26% in
Bamnako. EDM management and performances should be improved. The water tariffs are very
low and threaten EDM financial viability. Less than 1.5% of the population is connected to sew-
age facilities. Roads (60 to 150 meters per hectare) and paved roads (5 to 33 meters per 100 in-
habitants) have deteriorated due to a lack of maintenance and many neighborhoods lack essential
roads. Bamako's 1,100 kilometer (Iam) road network has only 170 km of paved roads and much of
it is in disrepair. Drainage is inadequate, ranging from 0 to 34 meters per 100 inhabitants. Al-
though more than half of the solid waste is being collected, mainly by private enterprises and Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), the municipalities' transport equipment is inadequate to
meet the rapidly growing demand, and the sector is poorly managed. Unauthorized settlements
(30% of the city in Bamako) in peripheral urban areas, which lack basic services, are absorbing the
major share of the population increase and occupying the available suburban land. Marketplaces
are crowded and they lack storage and refrigeration, lighting, latrines, and water supply. Further-
more, the cities and monuments, classified by UNESCO as Mali's World Patrimony, are threat-
ened by serious sanitation problems, the weather and pillaging, even though the monuments have
been maintained by communities for centuries. They are also not being managed and preserved
because of insufficient financial and technical capacity.
1.9   Land Markets. Conversion of land to urLan use is inadequate and land markets function
poorly, as demonstrated by the chronic illegal settlements. This is due mainly to a high degree of
centralization, the land being mainly State property, and also because of: (i) the complicated ju-
ridical status and/or inadequate institutional capacity to develop and transfer land; (ii) shortage of
medium- and long-term financing for home buyers; (iii) an al-archic and informal land market; and
(iv) insufficient cost recovery from previous urban land development and no reinvestment by the
Government of costs recovered in land development. Of the approximately 7,500 land titles deliv-
ered by the Government in Bamako during 30 years, 6,200 were delivered by ACI from March
1992 to December 1995 under the Second Urban Project.
1.10   Municipal Finance. Municipal revenues, which totaled CFAF 2.3 billion (US$4.60 mil-
lion) in 1993, for 9 of the cities, are very low. The average annual budget is CFAF 50 million to
100 million (US$100,000-200,000) in the main cities, with the exception of the District of Ba-
mako, which has a budget of CFAF 1.5 billion (US$3.00 million). On a per capita/year basis these
revenues ranged in 1993 from CFAF 390 (US$0.80) in Gao to CFAF 2,406 (US$4.80) in Kayes,
and were CFAF 2,016 (US$4.00) in Bamako, compared with US$20.00 in Abidjan, Dakar, and
Douala. The revenues are based on taxes collected by the Central Government which is improving
tax collection and fees for services (amounting to 30% to 70% of the total revenue) provided and
collected by the local governments. The revenues are insuffizient because of the narrow tax base,
the absence of household taxation, massive tax evasion, and lack of decentralization and revenue
transfer from the Central Government. The ratio of municipal revenues/Central Govemment reve-
nues was 3% in 1993, compared with an average of 5% in West Africa countries. They are also
insufficient because of inadequate cost recovery for the municipal services provided (only around
15% of the existing potential is being collected). The taxation of economic activities, included fees
collection, represents 75% to 90% of municipal revenues.



4
1.11 Municipal expenditures: Municipal operating expenditures (recurrent budget) ranged in
1993, on a per capita/year basis, from CFAF 404 in Timbuktu to CFAF 2,843 in Kayes. Invest-
ment expenditures ranged from CFAF 0 in Timbuktu to CFAF 522 in Bamako, and to CFAF 757
in Kayes. The expenditures are not managed efficiently because municipal governments do not
have adequate technical and managerial resources. In addition, the municipalities lack an institu-
tional framework that defines in detail the responsibilities and allocates the resources between the
Central and local governments. {The financial information and data by city are provided in the
Project File, including the audits of the District of Bamako and the municipalities of Mopti, Se-
gou, and Sikasso.)
C. SECTOR POLICY AND STRATEGIES
1.12   Decentralization Reform. The most important Government policies related to urban de-
velopment are the decentralization reform mandated by the February 11, 1993 law (Conditions de
la libre administration des collectivites territoriales) and the January 27, 1995 Code (Code des
collectivites territoriales) to be implemented progressively from 1997, with newly elected repre-
sentatives. The Mission de Decentralisation, set up in 1993, is defining the relations between the
central and local govemments, and the division of resources, assets, and tasks, with the help of
several donors. The 1993 Law established the general legal framework for decentralization. It
includes: (a) reorganization of the administration of the country; (b) transfer of executive compe-
tencies, responsibilities, and resources; (c) police; (d) municipal resources; and (e) supervision of
the municipalities by the Central Government. The 1995 Code defined: (a) the notion of local and
national affairs; (b) composition of the h. -9l governmerts; (c) other decentralized institutions; and
(d) supervision by the Central Governmenit. Tlifee otlher laws were enacted in the fall of 1996: (i)
constitution and management of the municipalities land; (ii) municipalities' fiscal resources; and
(iii) fiscal resources of the District of Bamako and its municipalities.
1.13 Urban Development Polica. On September 25, 1996. the Government adopted an urban
sector policy letter (Annex 1) defining the action plan for improving delivery of urban services by
the municipalities on a sustainable basis, with greater competition and reliance on commercial
practices, private sector participation, and responsiveness to demand. The Government is also re-
viewing the Land Tenure Law and the Land Development Code to make them more operational and
to open the way for private land development. A parallel action would be undertaken to modernize
the agencies in charge of land management and provide them with appropriate management instru-
ments. The Government and municipalities are also assisting NGOs in targeted programs to im-
prove the delivery of urban infrastructure services to the poor. The Government is improving tax
collection and local governments will need to make greater efforts to improve their revenues, espe-
cially the collection of fees. The Government has undertaken a five-year investment programming
study (for 1997-2002), the first attempt to allocate public investments more efficiently for Bamako
and the regional capitals. The Government is also willing to protect and develop Mali's cultural
heritage. These actions reflect the five key policies of the Govemment: (i) strengthening the eco-
nomic linkages between urban and rural productive sectors, by improving the economic perform-
ance of towns and villages; (ii) increasing access to basic services; (iii) improving the living condi-
tions of the poor and vulnerable groups; (iv) building the local capacities for urban planning and
management; and (v) preserving and developing Mli's cultural heritage.
1.14   Donor Assistance in the Sector. Extemal donors, mainly the European Union (EU), Can-
ada, France, and Germany, are supporting the preparatory stage of the decentralization process.
These same donors are also involved in subprojects in secondary towns. A donor round-table



5
meeting was held in Bamako in July 1996; Canada, France, and Germany expressed interest in
participating with parallel financing. Other donors are planning to finance urban subprojects as
well, for example, Japan may support improvements in Bamako's water supply. UNESCO is sup-
porting the Government in preserving Mali's cultural and historic cities and monuments classified
as World Patrimony.
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT
1.15   Lessons leamed in Mali and othel West African countries which are relevant to the pro-
posed project would include: (a) the use of delegated contract management in public works
through AGETIPE is efficient for executing municipal projects; this would continue under the pro-
posed project; (b) the auctioning of serviced and titled plots by ACI is highly transparent, allows
full cost recovery, and transfers land to the private market; this mechanism would be expanded in
the project; (c) the revenues generated by auctioning plots could have been used to develop new
lands instead of simply turning over these revenues to the State budget; to avoid this in the future,
the statutes of ACI were amended to transform it into a commercial land development agency;
(d) municipalities should be more efficient in providing sustainable infrastructure services; to
achieve this, their capacity should be strengthened as proposed in the project; (e) client ownership
and responsiveness to demand need to receive adequate and early attention; beneficiaries, stake-
holders, municipalities, and executing agencies have played a leading role in project identification,
preparation, and design; (f) operation and maintenance: the ability of funding operation and main-
tenance has been a deteminant of the sc.ale of new investments; the maintenance subcomponent, as
part of the counterpart funds from the Government and the municipalities, would have a positive
impact on ensuring adequate spending for maintenance; and (g) the management and financial im-
provement in EDM are essential to achieve the project objectives.
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA iNVOLVEMENT
1.16   The proposed project supports the main objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) discussed in January 1995 aiming to: (a) build local capacity in the municipalities and
Central Govemment; (b) continue to support the generation of urban employment for workers with
little or no skills and help reduce poverty; (c) increase participation of the private sector by con-
tracting out services, consultancies, works, and transferring land to private ownership; and
(d) provide infrastructure that is essential for economic activities. Previous IDA urban projects
have been effective in developing urban policy and this project would be a logical next step for
continued support in the sector. A new ur' ½n project and a second AGETIPE project, planned in
the CAS, were merged into this project for more efficient programming of investment and mainte-
nance and it includes the preservation of Mali's World Patrimony.

2. TUE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. PREPARATION AND STAKEHOLDERS
2.1    The proposed project, a follow up to the IDA-financed Second Urban Project and the
PWCBP, was identified in July 1994 and appraised with other donors in June-July 1996. Feasibil-
ity studies, financed mainly by a Japanese grant (Y 74,200,000) and IDA (AGETLPE), were pre-
pared by the Govemrnment with the help of several consulting firms. Parallel studies were financed
by France. Project preparation activities were followed up by a Coordinating Comrnmittee effec-
tively chaired by the MUH. A comprehensive participatory process, involved several ministries, in
addition to the Decentralization Mission, the Mayors' Association, the local govenmments and their
councils, village councils, local NGOs, Neighborhood Associations, Mosque Associations, unions,
and beneficiaries. Local and foreign consultants worked together to obtain the relevant data and
information, and prepared base maps and data, urban master plans, and infrastructure investment
programs for the 10 cities and the historic and cultural cities. AGETIPE, ACI, and EDM, the fu-
ture implementing agencies, and NGOs assisted in the preparation of the different components, and
particularly in prioritizing investment needs. Project preparation included lessons leamed from the
previous Second Urban and ongoing PWCB Projects.
2.2    The proposed project responds to the Government's decentralization and regional planning
policy which aims to promote progressive decentralization and complements rural development
efforts, supported by a parallel donor-assisted five-year investment program in the urban sector in
eight regional capital cities (Gao, Kayes, Kidal, Koulikoro, Mopti, Segou, Sikasso, and Timbuktu),
the District of Bamako, and Djenne. Other donors are already involved in secondary cities and
towns.
B. OBJCTIS
2.3    The project's main development objective is to improve the delivery, on a sustainable ba-
sis, of urban infrastructure services by local govemments, in partnership with the Central Govem-
ment, the private sector, and communities. The project's specific operational objectives are to:
(a) build local govemment management capacity, improve performance, strengthen operations and
maintenance, and improve planning, programming, budgeting, financial management, and revenue
generation; (b) improve the provision of basic urban services, especially in the poorest neighbor-
hoods, through appropriate investments in basic infrastructure (including safe water supply) and
infrastructure for economic activities, while improving the urban environment, and creating em-
ployment through labor-intensive works; (c) help preserve Mali's historical cities and monuments,
classified as World Patrimony, in cooperation with UNESCO and the communities involved; and
(d) pursue improvements in the operation of the urban land market begun under the IDA-assisted
Second Urban Project, while promoting a progressive formal privatization of the land market,
creating new revenue sources for local governments, and guiding urban development and expan-
sion.

C. DESCRIPTION
2.4    The five-year investment program in the 10 cities would includefive main components.
{For a complete list of subprojects, see Annex 2) (The amounts shown below are base costs).
Capacity Building (US$ 7.4 million, 6% of the program cost, of which US$7.1 million will be
financed by IDA).
2.5    The project places particular emphasis on urban management instruments, sectoral re-
forms to strengthen local governments, and capacity building. The following program will be im-
plemented in coordination with and in addition to the program developed by the Mission de Decen-
tralisation, with the support of other donors. The Technical Assistance (TA) program will be
provided by short-term consultants, principally local consultants, engaged with a clear definition of
objectives and results. Groups of local and external consultants will be encouraged to bid jointly,
in an effort to develop Malian private-sector capacity. The training subproject will be implemented
mainly in Mali's existing schools or training centers. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for most of
these studies were prepared before negotiations; all the studies will be carried out before the end of
the second year of credit effectiveness.
2.6    This component would include:
(a)    Studies for (i) the establishment of a new urban fee; (ii) review of the land tenure
law; (iii) land management by local governments; and (iv) the management of
marketplaces and transport stations;
(b)    Detailed mapping of the regional capitals and an update of the urban infrastruc-
ture inventory; this subcomponent will help quantify the current and projected in-
frastructure deficit, the annual investment and maintenance programs, and the
status of urban land and its management;
(c)    Assigning addresses to streets and lots and collecting fiscal data in the four more
important cities to help land management and tax collection; this subcomponent
will be extended to the other regional capital cities during the course of the project;
an evaluation of the population will be made by neighborhood during data collec-
tion;
(d)    Setting up of accounting systems in the municipalities of Mopti, Segou, Sikasso
and the District of Bamako, the latest six months after credit effectiveness to im-
prove financial management; this subcomponent will be based on management

Per Operational Manual OP. 6.50 of May, 1996
2.12   The project financing plan is summarized in Table 2.4, with further details provided in
Annex 4. The Central Govermnent, local govemments, and agencies will finance an estimated
amount of US$13.50 million: US$8.70 million from the Central Govenmment, US$3.00 million
from local government revenue, US$1.00 million from EDM, US$0.80 million from ACI. A num-
ber of donors have announced their intention to participate in financing the proposed program.
These include Canada (US$15.00 million), France (US$20.00 million), Germany (an initial
amount of US$7.00 million), and the Intemational Centre for the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) (US$0.2 million). All cofinancing will be on a paral-
lel basis, with each participating donor managing its own subprojects in accordance with its re-
spective rules. Should the extemal contributions to program financing be insufficient, the Central
or local govenmments will increase their participation, or the program will be reduced accordingly.

palities (US$44.90 million, Urban Infrastructure), and EDM (US$2.40 million, studies), and other



13
portions will be on-lent to the following beneficiaries, at a 7.7% interest rate, with 5-year grace-and
a 20-year repayment period, the foreign exchange risk being assumed by the beneficiaries:
(a)   the portion related to the civil works water supply subcomponent, (Bamako and
Mopti, US$8.50 millicn) will be on-lent to EDM; and
(b)   the portion related to land development for housing (US$8.50 million) will be on-
lent to ACI.
2.14   These arrangements will be covered in subsidiary loan agreements between the Govem-
ment and EDM and ACI, respectively. Signing of subsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to IDA,
are conditions of credit effectiveness. Project agreements have to be signed between IDA and the
on-lending beneficiaries.
2.15   Recurrent costs related to the subprojects carried out for the municipalities will grow from
CFAF 257 million m Year 2 of the project, to CFAF 881 million in Year 9, and stay at that level
later. The project will provide additional revenues which will grow from CFAF 241 million in
Year 2 of the project to CFAF 1,297 million in Year 9 of the project. The result will be positive
from the year 2 and will total CFAF 2,769 million from by +he Year 9. The project financial fore-
cast by city, including recurrent costs and revernues, is shown in Annex 10.
E. SUSTAiNABILrY
2.16   Institutional sustainability would be strengthened undor the project by the provision of fi-
nancial and technical support to: (i) build municipal capacity to finance, operate, and maintain
infrastructure; (ii) strengthen EDM's water management capacity and review water tanrffs,
(iii) strengthen ACI and make it into an efficient land development agency; and (iv) assist the MCC
to preserve the historic cities and attract more tourists and foreign currency. Financial sustainabil-
ity of municipal investments will be achieved by: (a) enhancing programming and management;
(b) improving management and funding of maintenance; (c) increasing cost recovery service by
service and improving fee collection; (d) creating new sources of revenues (such as from market-
places, transport terminals, and the urban fee); and (e) contracting an increasing share of operation
and maintenance to the private sector. lTe progr2m's sustainability would be strengthened by the
monitoring system and training. Agreement has been reached on tariff adjustments of EDM's wa-
ter supply to meet economic and financial viability criteria. The sustainability of the market-
oriented ACI would be reinforced and extended through new land development operations, which
show a very high rate of return, as demonstrated by the 6t% ERR in the Second Urban Project.
The Mopti-Djenne-Timbuktu-Dogon area has a potential of attiacting about 20,000 tourists a yvar
and generating annual net revenues of US$10.00 million in foreign exchange. The preservation of
the main tourism attractions, the historical and cultural patrimony, is essential for tourism devel-
opment.

3. IMPLEMENTATION
A. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
3.1    Existing agencies, which operated during the Second Urban Project and the PWCBP, and
EDM will implement the project. The M4UH would be the lead ministry for the project. MUH
would head the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) created by the May 31, 1996 law N096-
157-PM-RM. The PCC includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Territorial Adnuni-
stration, Public Works and Transport, Health, Environment, Hydraulics, Culture, and Communi-
cation, the Mission de Decentralisation, and the Association of Mayors. The PCC, which will
oversee project implementation, will be supported by a small Coordinating Unit (PCU) with four
professionals, financed by the project. The Project Coordinator would be acceptable to IDA and
appointed prior to negotiations. The PCU and municipalities will be assisted by consultants in the
area of coordination, programming, monitoring, accounting, procurement, training, and evaluation.
The PCU would also be responsible for the project contract audits, the monitoring of city con-
tracts, project performance indicators and legal covenants, quarterly reports, and coordination with
donors. The responsibilities of the different central- and local-level institutions and implementing
agencies for the project components are shown in Table 3.1.

Nationale des Arts et de la Culture); DNUC (Direction Nationale de l'Urbanisme et de la Construction); DNI
(Direction Nationale des Imp&ts).
B. LMPLEMENTATION
3.2    The PCU would implement the capacity-building component, especially TA, in coordina-
tion with the concemed municipalities, agencies, the Mission a la Decentralisation, and mninistries.
The Mission a la Decentralisauon would be respons+h - for the coherence with other Decentrali-
zation assistance programs. The institutional studies would be completed and the new urban fee
(redevance urbaine) would be put into effect no later than 18 months after credit effectiveness.



15
Study recommendations on the management of marketplaces to improve fee collection and cosr
recovery would be implemented, in agreement with IDA, at the beginning of the second year of ef-
fectiveness. Simple studies would be carried out by local consultants. For more complex studies.
groups of local and external consultants would be encouraged to bid jointly to help develop the ca
pacity of the Malian private sector. A draft manual of implementation would be submitted to ID132
before negotiations and the final Manual before effectiveness, including perfonmance indicators.
3.3    The District of Bamako and the concemed municipalities (outside Bamako) will manage
the Infrastructure component, with AGETIPE as implementing agency. The draft of the Frame-
work Agreement between the Goverment and AGETIPE, with the Procedures Manual attached to
it as an integral part, would be submitted to the non-objection of IDA prior to negotialions. Its
signing will take place prior to credit effectiveness. At all times during project implementation, the
Articles of Agreement (statutes) of AGETIPE-MALI, the Framework Agreement (Convention
cadre), the Procedures Manual, and the Director General of the Agency, shall be acceptable to
IDA. A project Special Account would be operated by AGETIPE and a Project Agreement would
be signed by AGETIPE.
3.4    The obligations of the local govemments under the project would be formalized through;
Municipal Contracts (contrats de ville), (see Annex 5) to be signed annually by the MUH, each ot
the municipalities, and the District of Bamako. These contracts, which include performance indi-
cators, would provide, inter alia, that the municipalities and the District of Bamako are responsible
for meeting agreed upon performance benchmarks, providing funds for infrastructure maintenance
as project counterpart funds, managing maintenance expenditures efficiently, providing adequate
staff for the project, performing financial accounting, improving management, especially for fee
collection (marketplaces, transport stations, solid-waste collection, among others). The conven-
tions signed by the District of Bamako and the municipalities with AGETIPE would be reviewed
annually, to include the annual investment programs (see para. 3.6 below).
3.5    The Government, each local govenmment, and the District of Bamako will allocate the nec-
essary resources for maintenance as indicated in Annex 3, and will guarantee their availability by
depositing these funds quarterly, in advance, into a separate infrastructure maintenance account to
be opened at a commercial bank by AGETIPE. However, the Government shall guarantee the
availability of total funds for maintenance. These accounts would be opened before credit effec-
tiveness; their provisioning is to be a condition of disbursement of the other infrastructure subcom-
ponents for each municipality. For the marketplace and transport station subcomponents, agree-
ment has been reached and it has been agreed that the new infrastructure would be managed by the
private sector in a manner acceptable to IDA.
3.6    An urban master plan (plan d 'urbanisme de reference) and a program of urban infrastruc-
ture development (programme de developpement des infrastructures urbaines) were established
for each of the cities before appraisal. The main infrastructure subprojects were clearly identified,
other small subprojects will be proposed annually by the municipalities, in accordance with the
development program and selection criteria (Annex 6). The annual investment programs would be
established by July 15 each year. The PCU will organize joint annual review meetings attended by
donors, implementing agencies, and representatives of user groups and communities, to review
progress and to agree on the muucipaihties' proposed rolling investment programs for the following
year, and on the measures to be taken by each munikipality and agency. Annual amendments of
the municipal contracts would be signed at the end of July. The annual contracts with AGETIPE
and the District and the municipalities would be signed during the same period and submitted to the



16
non-objection of IDA. For the first year, the investment program, including the maintenance pro-
gram, has been prepared, and the draft municipal contract and the convention with AGETIPE,
have been submitted to IDA prior to negotiations.
3.7    MCC will manage the historic and cultural cities and monuments project component, in
cooperation with UNESCO, and with AGETIPE as implementing agency. This component will be
implemented in a participatory manner, in close cooperation with the associations which have safe-
guarded and maintained the monuments for centuries. An Action Plan has been prepared by the
MCC, before negotiations, defining the regulatory framework for the safeguard and maintenance of
the cities and monuments classified as World's Patrimony. This Action Plan defines the roles of
the State, the civil society, and the private sector. All the TORs for studies, consultants (including
supervision for civil works), and studies dealing with the actions on World Patrimony, must be
agreed to by UNESCO and the concemed donors. The draft Framework Agreement, acceptable to
IDA, between the MCC and AGETIPE, was submitted to IDA before negotiations.
3.8   EDM will implement the water supply subcomponent (Bamako and Mopti). It will be re-
sponsible for construction, operation, and maintenance of the water supply infrastructure built un-
der the project. Special attention will be gven to reducIrng leakage, eliminating illegal connections,
and maximizing efficiency. EDM will submit an action plan before credit effectiveness to improve
the Bamako and Mopti networks, in order to reach less than 22% of water losses by the year 200 1.
The project design would provide for a consultant to assist the EDM water department. Agreement
on performance benchmarks was reached during negotiations. The signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. Agreement on water tariffs increase from 19P8,
allowing the water department to balance its accounts by the year 2002 has been reached during
negotiations. Adoption of these tariffs by the Government and EDM is a condition of disbursement
of the water component. The national budget and the budget of municipalities and public services
would include specific amounts for water consumption determined with EDM. EDM would reduce
private parastatal receivables to below three months of billing by December 1997. A Project
Agreement will be signed by EDM.
3.9    ACI would implement the housing land development subcomponent. ACI shall at all times
ensure that its land development activities represent at least two thirds of its tumover. The signing
of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition of effectiveness. Prior to negotiations, an agree-
ment has been signed between the Government and ACI, to determine the framework for land de-
velopment. The necessary land titles for the improvement of at least 15,000 plots (750 ha) have
been entrusted to ACI prior to negotiations. All the plots developed would be sold with total cost
recovery and with secured titles, of which at least 70% by auction. The prices for auction would
be calculated in agreement with IDA. Specific criteria for the sale of the remaining 30% would be
provided in the Manual of Implementation. The implementation of the criteria would be monitored
annually through reports of ex-post study. The funds from the sale of land would be reinvested by
ACI to develop more new land to be sold, of which at least 70% by auction. The land tenure law
will be reviewed in consultation with IDA. A Project Agreement will be signed by ACI.
C. PROCUREMENT
3.10   The Malian procurement code was revised in 1995 in consultation with the Bank and is
generally sound. No special exemptions, pemits or licenses need to be specified in credit docu-
ments for Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB), as Mali allows Bank procedures to take prece-
dence over any contrary local regulations or practices. For ICB, procurement will be carried out in



17
agreement with the Bank's guidelines for procurement under IBRD and IDA credit (January 1995)
and the Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and civil works will be used. For consulting
services, the Bank's standard contracts and model of letter of invitation will be used. National
Competitive Bidding advertised locally (NCB) will be carried out in accordance with procedures
acceptable to IDA which allows that: (a) any bidders are given sufficient time to submit bids
(three to four weeks for contracts exceeding US$20,000 equivalent); (b) bid evaluation and bidder
qualification are clearly specified; (c) no preference margin is granted to domestic contractors or
manufacturers; (d) eligible foreign firms are not precluded from participation; (e) contracts provide
for security in an amount sufficient to protect the Borrower in case of breach of contract (without
distinction or exception); (f) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding docu-
ments are submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g) award will be made to the lowest
evaluated bidder. Table 3.2 below summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs, and
proposed methods of procurement.

0)  Of which US$24.10 million would be using AGETIPE standard procedures.
3.11      Civil Works. The project's main civil works components would be: (a) water supply in
Bamako and Mopti; (b) land development for housing in Bamako; (c) roads and drainage in Ba-
mako. These subcomponents are likely to be attractive to foreign bidders and would be tendered
through ICB procedures, at a total estimated value of about US$28.05 million. Eligible domestic
contractors bidding for civil works undei ICB would receive a 7.5% preference margin in bid
evaluation, in accordance with the January 1995 Bank Procurement Guidelines. The other sub-
components (US$25.67 million) would be tendered through National Competitive Bidding (NCB),
under procedures acceptable to IDA. Because of the number of contracts, the type of work, and
the location in the regional capitals and in dense lower income. communities, it is unlikely that these



18
works would be attractive to foreign contractors (though they would not be prevented from bid-
ding). Experience from previous projects confirms that there are a sufficient number of competent
local and locally based foreign bidders to provide effective competition for these types of works.
Intemational contractors, some of which are based in Mali, would be eligible to bid for these works
both individually and/or in joint ventures with local firms. For the Infrastructure and the Historic
Cities components, contracts under the US$500,000 (totaling about US$24.10 million) will be
awarded using AGETIPE standard procedures acceptable to IDA. AGETIPE will maintain a ros-
ter of contractors eligible for NCB, according to procedures spelled out in the AGETIPE's Manual
of Procedures. IDA will review and approve the prequalification and ensure that procedures are
consistent with the Manual of Procedures.
3.12   Goods. Goods financed under the project would include trucks and equipment for solid-
waste collection and transport, light vehicles, computers, and miscellaneous equipment for munici-
palities and implementing agencies. The total value of goods is estimated at about US$2.13 million
equivalent. ICB procedures would be used in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procure-
ment (January 1995), except for contracts (totaling US$670,000 equivalent) for vehicles, comput-
ers, supplies and furniture not exceeding US$150,000 each, which would be tendered through NCB
procedures acceptable to IDA. Prudent shopping based on price quotations obtained from at least
zhree reliable suppliers can be used for small quantities of goods, provided that: (a) these goods
cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$30,000; and (b) the aggregate amount does not
exceed US$200,000 for intemational shopping and US$ 100,000 for local shopping.
13   Consulting  services.    Consulting  services  financed  by  IDA, totaling  about
US$16.04 million, would be contracted in conformity with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants (August 1981). Services required under the project would be for the preparation of
designs, bid documents, work supervision, project management, institutional studies, capacity
'uilding, accounting, and technical and financial audits. For the use of architects and engineers,
kGETIPE will maintain a roster of firms and will select them through procedures acceptable to
LDA by using the short-list procedure in accordance with the AGETIPE's Manual of Procedures.
3.14   Review by IDA. Prior review by IDA would be required for: (a) work contracts exceeding
JS$500,000 equivalent; (b) contracts for goods exceeding US$150,000 equivalent; (c) contracts
with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; and (d) contracts with individual consult-
ants exceeding US$50,000 equivalent. The exception to prior review for consultant contracts
would not apply to TORs for such contracts, single-source hiring, assignments of a critical nature
las determined by IDA), and to amendments to contracts raising their value above the US$100,000
'1hreshold for firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants. Prior review would cover approxi-
m-tately 75% of the total value of contracts financed by IDA. Documentation for contracts under
:hese thresholds will be maintained for ex-post reviews by auditors and IDA supervisory staff. In
addition, for the subcomponents implemented by AGETIPE, for all contracts for works for which
dhere are less than three bidders or for any decision not to select the lowest evaluated bid,
AGETIPE will submit its proposal to IDA for approval prior to notifying the winning bidder.
3.15   Procurement Readiness and Procvrement .4rrangements. All ICB bidding documents and
a group of AGET1PE bidding documents for the first year would be prepared prior to credit effec-
!weness; notification of IDA's non objection on bidding documents, for items to be procured during
Iie first year of the project, subject to IDA prior review would constitute a condition of credit ef-
fectiveness. The procurement would be carried out by: (a) the PCU, supported by consultants as
necessary, for the Capacity-Building component, and the monitoring of the procurement schedule,



19
(b) AGETIPE, for the Infrastructure and Historic Cities components; (c) EDM, for the Water
Supply component; and (d) ACI, for the Land Development component. AGETIPE, EDM, and
ACI are familiar with Bank procurement procedures. Detailed procurement arrangements and a
first procurement plan for key contracts are in Annex 7. A more detailed procurement plan was
agreed upon during negotiations and will be integrated in the Project Implementation Plan to be
completed prior to credit effectiveness.
D. DISBURSEMENTS
3.16   The project would be disbursed over a period of six years. This is consistent with the dis-
bursement profile of urban projects in Mali and the efficiency of AGETIPE which is extensively
involved as implementing agency of the Infrastructure and the Historic Cities components.
AGETIPE  is now disbursing US$36 million a year under ongoing projects. A disbursement

TOTAL                                     80.00
3.18   As AGETIPE would implement more than 70% of the total project, it would operate a
Special Account. AGETIPE would open this account, in CFAF, at a commercial bank acceptable
to IDA. The authorized allocation would amount to CFAF 1,200 million and would cover three
months of eligible expenditures. Once the Special Account is opened, an amount of FCFAF 880
million would be deposited into it. The remaining balance would be made available as needed.
Three other Special Accounts would be operated by the PCU, EDM, and ACI. PCU, EDM and
ACI would open these Accounts at the same bank. The authorized allocations would amount to
FCFAF 150 million, 300 million, and 200 million, respectively. Three other accounts, the project



20
accounts, would be created for beneficiaries' counterpart contribution, with initial deposits of
CFAF 100 million each from the Govemnment. EDM, and ACI. The project accounts would be
managed by AGETIPE, EDM and ACI, respectively, and operated under terms and conditions ac-
ceptable to IDA.
3.19   Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly by AGETIPE, PCU, EDM and
ACI. The applications would include details which clearly identify the amounts withdrawn for
each beneficiary from the Special Account. All replenishment requests would be fully documented
except for: (a) contracts of less than US$500,000 equivalent for civil works, US$150,000 equiva-
lent for goods, US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firm services, and US$50,000 equivalent for
individual consulting services; and (b) operating costs which may be claimed on the basis of
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by
AGETIPE, PCU, EDM, and ACI for review by periodic IDA supervision missions and external
auditors.
3.20   AGETIPE management fees based on the works and studies carried out by AGETIPE for
the MCC, the District of Bamako, and the municipalities would be provided to AGETIPE, through
the AGETIPE management fees subcomponent and the Special Account managed by AGETIPE.
The average rate of the management fee would be less than 5%. AGETTPE's accounting will in-
clude an urban project management fee.
3.21   Tax regime. The project, with the exception of the water supply component implemented
by EDM, would be exempted from taxes (Value Added Tax, Stamp duty, Tax on insurance con-
tracts, and registration fees) but not from duties paid on imported materials (cement, wood, for
example), products (included petroleum products), spare parts, and equipment (except for the
equipment imported temporarily for project execution). All contracts for works, goods, and con-
sulting services would be bid on duties included-basis, except for temporarily imported equipment.
In exchange for the amount of duty paid on subprojects, the Government would contribute coun-
terpart fund foi the infrastrucLure and historic components. The water supply component would be
exempted from taxes and duties as indicated in the Decree No. 96-1011, dated June 20, 1996
(Arrete MFC-SG-CAB).
E. MONITORING AND REPORTING
3.22   During the period up to credit effectiveness, the beneficiaries would be trained to operate
the reporting system which would be set up just before credit effectiveness. The beneficiaries and
AGETIPE would provide data on their components within 15 days of the end of each quarter to the
PCU. PCU would combine this information with its own data on the centrally implemented com-
ponent to produce quarterly progress reports. These would be submitted to the PCC, the donors,
and IDA. The progress report would cover the status of each civil works contract, the status and
timing of procurement for each contract, implementation of TA, studies, and training activities,
commitments against funds budgeted for subprojects, the status of all bank accounts, cost recovery
for services, sale of plots, franchising, land titles delivered, and general municipal finances. The
progress reports would also contain action plans for each component for the coming 12 months,
updated each quarter.
3.23   Special monitoring mechanisms are put in place and will be updated to assess the effec-
tiveness of the city contracts and project agreements, especially in revenue collection for the mu-



21
nicipalities and the District of Bamako, ED.M s income, and ACI's sale of plots with secured land
titles. Monitoring and performance indicators for the project are shown in Annex 9.
3.24   A mid-term review of the project would occur three years after credit effectiveness. This
would be a joint exercise of the Government, beneficiaries, IDA, and other donors, designed both
as an assessment of past experience and a forward-looking analysis of any changes or remedial
actions that may be needed to achieve the project objectives. The mid-term review would cover the
project components, implementation arrangements, and financing mechanisms, including specifi-
cally: (a) progress of physical implementation of infrastructure improvements; (b) timeliness and
efficiency of procurement of works and consultancy services; (c) effectiveness and impact of TA at
the central and local levels, (d) the maintenance component; (e) the extent to which municipalities
have maintained adequate staffing for the project; and (f) performance of the beneficiaries in mak-
ing counterpart funds available. In addition to the mid-term review, annual joint implementation
reviews would be carried out based on the monitoring and performance indicators.
F. ACCOUNTING AND AUDrITNG
3.25   The beneficianres and AGETIPE (the municipalities, the District of Bamako, PCU, EDM,
and ACI) would establish and maintain project-related financial accounts for their respective com-
ponents. The accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound and internationally recog-
nized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. Each beneficiary would prepare
annual statements of account and audit reports covering the project components for which they are
responsible, with the exception of AGETIPE which would prepare its statements and audits half-
yearly. These reports would be submitted not later than two months after the end of the financial
year. PCU would consolidate the financial and audit reports with its own annual financial state-
ment reflecting the financial performance and position of the project, by each beneficiary and as a
whole.
3.26   An independent auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to IDA on such statements would
be provided within two months for the half-yearly report, and within four months of the close of the
fiscal year for the annual reports. Special accounts, project accounts, maintenance accounts, and
SOEs would be included in the audits and specifically addressed in the audit reports. The auditor's
report would also include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting systems and intemal con-
trols, the reliability of SOEs as a basis for credit disbursements, and compliance with financial
covenants. The foregoing accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should pro-
vide adequate and timely information to IDA for project supervision. The audits will be submitted
to the PCC, each beneficiary, the donors, and IDA. Auditors acceptable to IDA, with TORs ac-
ceptable to IDA, would be appointed prior to credit effectiveness. Project accounts, AGETIPE,
ACI, the District of Bamako, and the concemed municipalities will be audited by the same auditor.
EDM will have the same auditor for IDA projects.

4. JUSTIFICATIONS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS
A.    GENERAL
4.1    This chapter discusses the economic and social benefits, poverty alleviation, environmental
impacts, and the risks associated with the program and the project. The project will have several
direct, tangible and measurable benefits, as well as important but unquantifiable benefits.
B.    BENEFfTS AND ECONOMIC RETURNS
4.2    The project's direct, measurable benefits are based on quantifiable benefits arising mainly
from user cost savings and incremental benefits. Economic and financial justifications, including
ERR calculations and sensitivity analysis, arc estimated in Annex 10 for the infrastructure mainte-
nance, roads, sanitation, transport stations and markets, historic cities, water supply, and land de-
velopment for housing components. The results are summarized as follows:
(a)    Overall, the project would register a positive impact on municipal finances. Net
revenues (project revenues minus expenditures) through 2005 would reach CFAF
2.7 billion, with CFAF 1.7 billion generated by the District of Bamako (63%) and
the remaining by the other six beneficiary cities. These net revenues represent
36% of total new municipal revenues from the project, with rates of 19% to 76%
among the individual cities. Additional costs generated by the project include the
municipal contribution for the maintenance of the project-financed roads and
drainage (5% to 15% of current revenues), debt payments for CFD and KfW-
financed markets and transport terminals, and improvement of municipal man-
agemtrent operations fer the three larger cities (Bamako, Sikasso, and Mopti-
Sevare). These additional expencitures are balanced by the new revenues: crea-
tion of the urban contribution (tax), increase of patente tax (license fee) collection
through registries, and actions to improve the rates of rent and fee collection in
municipal markets and transport terminals. Total new revenues would amount to
CFAF 7.6 billion, with CFAF 4.8 billion (65%) generated in the District of Ba-
mako (Table in Annex 10);
(b)    The maintenance subcomponent would have a minimum ERR of 12%, although
the final results are expected to be much higher. Actual ex-post ERRs for mainte-
nance in the PWCB (AGETIPE) project have ranged between 14% and 60%; 1.5
million inhabitants will benefit from improved maintenance;
(c)    The road subprojects show for the main subprojects in Bamako an ERR ranging
from 73% to 91% foi reihabilitation with a NPV of US$3.40 million and 41% to
67% for construction, with a NPV of US$16.00 million; the other subprojects
would be selected with an ERR of at least 12%; the benefits are based on the de-
crease in vehicle-operating costs, with and without benefits from reduction of the
transport time;
(d)    The subprojects to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods would
have, based on subprojects implemented in similar areas in Bamako and assessed
ex-post in the AGETIPE project, an ERR of at least 15%; these benefits are calcu-



23
lated concomitantly with the water supply component and they affect seven neigh-
borhoods, or about 50,000 inhabitants;
(e)    Marketplaces and transport stations show an ERR ranging from 14%% to 51%
depending on the city and type of construction, variations of investment costs and
values of rent, and fee collection rates; for the IDA-financed transport stations, the
NPV is US$1.70 million;
(f)    The ERR for the water supply component is calculated by estimating the incre-
mental benefits resulting from the sale of the water supplied by the addition of the
water transmission and distribution network through this project; the ERR for the
scenario of tariffs increase agreed on during negotiations is estimated at 12.0%
with a NPV of CFAF (60 ilionl.oi), using a 12% discount rate; the ERR would be
10% with 15% increase in investment cost, and 8% with 15% increase in total
costs; the first 20m3 of monthly water consumption are currently billed at 80
CFAF/m3, and consumption above 20 m3 is billed at 198 CFAF/m3; for the eco-
nomic viability of the project, to cover operating costs, these tariffs would require
a 30% increase in 1998, a 10% increase in 1999 and 2000, 20% increase in 2001,
and a further 10% increase in 2002. The water from fountains is currently billed
to the final consumer at CFAF 250/m3 to CFAF 1000/m3. Different scenarii on
tariffs increase are in the project files. This component will affect at least 160,000
inhabitants;
(g)    The land development for housing component shows an ERR of 43% for the base
case, ranging from 13% to 56%, with 10% decline or increase in rental values; for
15% cost increase thc FRR is 43% (60% in the Second Urban Project); the NPV
is US$6.40 million for the base ase, 50,000 inhabitants will live in the first Pro-
gram of 5,000 plots to be developed. It is expected that two other programs of
5,000 plots each (100,000 inhabitants) would be developed with the credit before
its total reimbursement.
4.3    The project's direct, tangible but unquantifiable benefits are:
(a)    Improved and more transparent sector management, including more effective
monitoring, planning, and programming;
(b)    Increased private sector participation in urban infrastructure services, such as
markets, transport terminals, waste collection, and public works,
(c)    Support for an urban policy consistent with overall macroeconormic objectives, in
particular as a complement to rural development, increasing the competitiveness of
cities, and alleviation of poverty;
(d)    Improvements in drainage, sanitation, waste management, and water supply
would reduce water-bome morbidity and infant mortality, contribute to better
health and thereby raise the productivity and income of all urban residents, espe-
cially the poor; the lack of basic sanitation presents a direct and indirect health
hazard to the affected population; a large percentage of diseases affecting the
population are water bome and are transmitted through contact with contamined



24
water, a direct result of poor existing sanitation; for example, there were more
than 15,000 cases of diarrhea, dysentery, and intestinal infections im the region of
Mopti in 1994, and 100 cholera deaths in 1995; this situation continued in 1996,
with over 70 deaths reported in the first half of the year;
(e)    The drainage works would also generate economic benefits in the form of less
damage to property, reduce loss of industrial and commercial tumover, lower loss
in stocks of goods, and prevent damage to infrastructure; and
(f)    The historic cities component in Timbuktu (IDA-financed) has two parts: create
an architecture and masonry workshop to train around 150 masons in the local and
traditional methods of building construction and restoration, and improve the land-
scape around the three major mosques of Timbuktu dating back to the 15'" cen-
tury. These mosques, which are a major tourism attraction, have been maintained
by the inhabitants through yearly addition of banco, a local earthen plaster; how-
ever, in the past few years a lack of resources has led to increasing neglect; due to
the political conditions in Northern Mali, maintenance and restoration of the
mosques were neglected and there has been a gradual loss of skills. The workshop
will train students and masons in the maintenance and restoration of the mosques
as well as other buildings within and outside Timbuktu. The landscaping around
the mosques is necessary to prevent the steady degradation of the mosque walls
caused by constant contact with wastewater from adjacent households, as well as
to improve pedestrian and vehicle traffic in the adjacent streets and create a more
open area around the mosques to welcome visitors and tourists and attract foreign
revenues. The potential foreign exchange revenue was estimated at US$10.00
million net a year for th., vhole of tllc Djenne-Mopti-Bandiagara-Timbuktu area,
the most touristic region in Mall.
C. IMACr ON EMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY
4.4    The project targets the poorest neighborhoods in Bamako where 50% of the population live
below the poverty line, and the regonal capital cities, especially in the North where 75% of the
population are below the poverty line. The project's water supply and sanitation subcomponents
will benefit the poor, the women, and children who are without access to clean, affordable water
and waste-disposal facilities, mainly in Bamako and Mopti. The urban infrastructure improvement
and market programs provide basic infrastructure services that will improve the living conditions
of the urban poor. Furthermore, the use of labor-intensive works subprojects will create around
200,000 person-months of direct jobs (or 4,000 permanent jobs for five years), of which 70% are
for unskilled workers. As demonstrated in a survey conducted during the mid-term review of the
ongoing PWCBP, about 400,000 person-montli. i,direct jobs would be created. The use of new
management tools will help the municipalities better prioritize their investment and target poor ar-
eas.
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMACT
4.5    The proposed project is classified as Category B. It is expected to have a significant posi-
tive impacts on the environment through improvements in water supply and sanitation, drainage
and flood control, sanitation in the industrial area of Bamako to protect the Niger river, and solid



25
waste management. The environmental assessment was preceded by an audit of the impacts from
the First and Second Urban Projects, which indicated that the previous projects greatly contributed
to improving the environment in Bamako.
4.6    The main environmental impacts identified include:  (a) pressure on groundwater re-
sources, due to the increased use of wells by the population; (b) disruption of natural water flows
in small watersheds due to the construction of roads; (c) health effects from unsafe water supply
from shallow wells in three Bamako neighborhoods; (d) risks of water pollution caused by the
proximity of technical and sanitary usages of water in the marketplaces and transport stations, and
pollution from motors used oils. The project will integrate actions on public health and urban envi-
ronmental management through: (i) improving environmental components such as water supply in
Bamako and Mopti-Sevare, the pilot sanim.:tion plan in Mopti-Sevare, and the masterplan for solid
waste in Bamako; (ii) implementing awareness programs on the urban environment at national and
local levels (municipalities and communities), and developing a sanitation strategy for Bamako;
(iii) mitigating environmental impacts of sub-components (roads, marketplaces, and transportation
terminals), as needed, with special attention to urban aspects.
4.7    The environmental management plan includes five types of mitigation measures, which are
detailed in Annex 11. They include: (a) specific mitigation measures for subprojects, to be further
detailed in their executive studies; (b) additional investment in environmental actions, including
drainage, landscaping, the protection of outfall areas of drainage channels in the Niger river;
(c) environmental awareness and capacity building at all levels (specially at the community level)
and training of trainers; (d) regulatory measures to control the drilling and use of wells, and the
creation of coordinating bodies at Mopti and Bamako, involving the government, communities,
and providers and users of environmental services; and (e) a monitoring plan, including environ-
mental and health indicators.
E. CAPACIry BULDING
4.8    The project would develop the capacity of the local governments in the following areas:
urban management, investment programming and contracting, fee collection, and urban infrastruc-
ture maintenance. The project would also extend the development program for construction con-
tractors and consultants started under the PWCBP to the regions. It would open new opportunities
for small- and medium-scale enterprises in the secondary cities to undertake public works and
services, such as management of marketplaces and transport stations. It would also strengthen the
technical capacities of the firms already involved in the AGETIPE project. It would develop the
skills of local consultants. It would reinforce the capacity of Malian masons for restoration of
historic monuments and houses.
F. RISKS AND MANAGEMENT
4.9    The principal project risks stem from the possibility that the Central Government may be
unable to implement the urban policy reform and decentralization, or to remove obstacles to the
mobilization and allocation of adequate financial resources for the municipalities. The risks stem
also from the inability of local governments to increase their revenue base and tax collection and
mobilize adequate financial resources for infrastructure maintenance and counterpart funding.
These risks are mitigated by the strong sense of ownership demonstrated by the Central and local
governments during project preparation, the planned close monitoring of performance indicators of



26
the municipalities and the public investment programs, and prolonged and close coordination with
other donors. They are also mitigated by: (i) the implementation of the Economic Management
Operation which plans a program of fiscal reforms to increase domestic resource mobilization;
(ii) the instruments set up by the project to improve resource mobilization (fiscal mapping, new tax
or fee on urban occupancy, and privatization of marketplace management); (iii) the institutional
support to local governments; and (iv) on the counterpart side, the annual programs of civil works
to be financed by the project will be a function of the funds mobilized and spent by the local (or
Central) governments for urban infrastructure maintenance.
4.10   For the water supply component, the main risks are: (i) the failure of EDM to implement
the installation and operation of the water supply network; however, the ongoing investments to
increase water treatment capacity, financed by a credit of FF50.00 million from the CFD, and to
rehabilitate the Selingue dam financed by IDA, demonstrated that EDM has the capacity to suc-
cessfully implement large physical works; (ii) water consumption would be lower than expected
due to economic conditions or low demand for service connections; this risk would be mitigated by
introducing an extension social connection program; (iii) another risk is that a significant percent-
age of customers could refuse to pay their bills; this risk is mitigated by the fact that EDM com-
mercial service, its billing and collection division, is currently implementing a system to detect non-
payments in a timely manner and institute a service shut-off within a short period of time, reducing
the losses; (iv) an uncontrolled expansion of inadequate water operations in secondary towns could
jeopardize EDM's financial viability; this risk could be mitigated by a systematic review of EDM's
investment plan by IDA; and (v) a final risk is that the long-term financial viability of EDM could
be threatened by its inability to raise tariffs to cover expenses and to keep up with inflation. This
risk is minimized by the commitment of the Government to allow EDM to raise its water tariffs to
cover operating costs and generate a reasonable return on investment. Continuing coordination
with other donors is necessary to mitigate -11 the abov"-meritioned risks.
4.11   For the land development component, the main risk stems from the fact that ACI would not
be able to find land to be developed or to be entrusted with the land development operations. The
commitment of the Government and the 750 ha of land (foi 15,000 plots; the 5,000 IDA-financed
plots being the first program) entrusted to ACI before negotiations mitigate this risk. The second
risk is that this land could be occupied by squatters. This risk is minirnized by the strong Govem-
ment authority demonstrated in land management in the recent years.

REPUBLIC OF MALI
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
URBAN SECTOR POLICY LETTER
LETTRE DE POLIT7QUE SECTORIELLE URBAINE
Approved by the Government of Mali on Wednesday, September 25, 1996
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.    This statement of Mali's urban development sector policy constitutes the framework for the sector's
programs and projects and is intended to coordinate the activities of all potential stakeholders (central and
local governments, private sector, civil society, partners in development).
2.    Mali's history teaches that prior to the modern era, the network of human settlements (including
hamlets, towns and cities) was marked by vigorous trade on the banks of its two great rivers, the Niger and
the Senegal, and in the trans-Saharan areas, which has made such a large contribution to opening the
country up to broader horizons.
3 .    The prosperity of the different empires and kingdoms in our country (the Mali Empire, the Songhai
Empire, the Peuhl Kingdom of Macina, the Bambara Kingdom of Segou, the Kenedougou Kingdon, etc.)
was largely based on a network of urban centers, in which cities such as Timbuktu, Gao, Djenne, Segou
and Sikasso have each played an important role.
4.     The colonial penetration starting in 1850 led to disturbances in the political and economic
organization of the region, particularly since it promoted the growth of coastal cities to the detriment of
those located inland.
5.    Notwithstanding, urban development continued in Mali, and intensified with the country's new
administrative and economic organization in the wake of Indeperdence in 1960.
6.    However it was only in 1981 that Mali adopted its first urban development instrument called
"Main Guidelines for National Urban Development and Housing Policy in the Framework of Land Use
Planning".
7.    This policy has made it possible to create a momentum for urban managenent marked by:
i.    greater sensitivity to the phenomenon of urbanization; and
ii.   the adjustment of urban planning tools, abandoning the "compartmentalized" approach that
had prevailed until then.

However current and forecast political and socioeconomic realities call for new approaches based on the
lessons leamed.
8.     Addressing the issue of urbanization in Mali is a formidable challenge today, owing to the size of
the human, material, and financial resources that will have to be mobilized and, above all, to the need to
persevere steadfastly in these efforts. This is the prerequisite for achieving effective and lasting results.
9.     Mali in the year 2000 will still be a long way from the socioeconomic turning point where the
urban population becomes the majority, but current national trends are clear enough to demand greater
attention to control over town and country relations. Better inter-sector coordination of govemment action
will make it possible to cope better with the situation and to consolidate the results already obtained.
10.   The choice, then, is an urban development policy built on opportunities in an integrated and
controlled process based on appropriate actions, given the basic constraints.
2.   GENERAL PROFILE OF URBAN GROWTEH
11.   Mali is one of the largest countnres im Africa south of the Sahara, with an area of some 1,241,230
kIn, close to 7,000 km of borders, and seven neighboring countries.
12.   It is currently subdivided into eight administrative regions (Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, S6gou,
Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal, and the district of Bamako).
13.    Out of a total population of about 9 million, close to 2.4 million live in urban areas, and the urban
population is growing quickly. For example Bamako, the capital, which had a population of just 320,000
in 1972, has seen its population triple in two decades, reaching a figure of close to 1 million today. Three
smaller cities (Segou, Mopti and Sikasso) will soon cross the 100,000 threshold and two others (Gao and
Kayes) will break the 50,000 mark. The other towns will have under 40,000 residents.
14.   From Independence to the present, the government's political detennination to decentralize has led
to the creation of at least 20 local jurisdictions, i.e.:
i.     19 urban communities each administered by an elected municipal council;
ii.    the district of Bamako, consisting of six of the urban communities mentioned above, with
mixed status: the same administrate status as the other eight regions, as well as local
government.
15.   The decentralization policy recently introduced in the country favors its reorganization into new
groupings, i.e. "regions" and "circles" (the current regions and circles are simply administrative districts),
and the urban and rural communities.  The conditions for independent administration of these new
decentralized entities have already been laid down in Law 93-008 of February 11, 1993.



31                                Annex I
Page 3 of 21
16.   While the process of decentralization is still being worked on, there are major constraints on
current urban development with respect to:
i.    land tenure legislation;
ii.    supply and demand for building lots;
iii.   access to decent inexpensive housing;
iv.    the supply and quality of urban services;
v.     municipal finances.
17.   Land tenure legislation is govemed by Law 86-91/AN-RM of August 1, 1986 (the Code Domaniel
et Foncier). Under this Code, the government is virtually the only owner of the land, with property titles
held by local governments and private parties accounting for less than 2% of the total. Property rights,
particularly from the standpoint of urban development, are "provisional" (letter of assignment, occupancy
permits, etc.) while the purchase of new land for different uses is subject to lengthy and onerous
procedures.
Since the events of March 1991, criticisms have been made of the Code, particularly by the holders of
customary rights and local governments. A national seminar was held in November 1994 which
recommended that the Land Tenure Code be revised, which is now being done.
18.   Today, in order to develop an urban property, land or real estate developers are required to obtain
from the govemment:
i.    the assignment or surrender of the necessary land;
ii.    approval of building plans.
The govemment services in charge of land management, topography, urban development, and construction
are generally all involved. In practice, the administration's overall efficiency in responding to developers is
poor and it takes a great deal of time to obtain a decision, particularly because of lack of coordination
among the services.
This partially explains the scant supply of building lots when compared to demand. Although lots
established by the government (the chief developer) were sold at relatively affordable prices, real estate
speculation has grown up over the years and, with it, unauthorized building, particularly in Bamako where
the pressure is strongest. The need to combat speculation, difficulties in recovering development costs, and
the need for greater transparency in allocating the lots that have been established, led in 1992 to the
establishment of the Agence de Cessions Immobilieres (AC1) [Land Auctioning Agency].
A special program to rehabilitate unauthorized settlements, called "Save our Neighborhood" has been in
operation in Bamako since 1993, as an initiative of the district council to:
i.    provide ownership security (by regularizing land tenancy rights);
ii.    improve the standard of living in outlying urban areas and control unauthorized building.
19.   In the process of building housing, self-construction continues to be the rule for two main reasons:
i.    the housing provided by real estate developers (both public and private) is scarce and too
expensive for most people;



32                                Annex I
Page 4 of 21
ii.    the construction of unauthorized housing has become part of working-class strategy to
escape the constraints of a rental housing sector that is badly organized and not well
regulated. Tenants' rights are very poorly protected despite some regulations in the sector:
(a) Decree 130/PG-RM of August 29, 1967, which sets ceilings on rents for existing
buildings; (b) Decree 146 of September 27, 1967, which regulates housing rentals in the
Republic of Mali; and (c) Inter-Ministerial Order 95-0833/MFC-MUH of April 27, 1995,
which defines the conditions under which Articles 92 and 93 of the General Tax Code will
be applied.
But self-construction, as it operates today, is marked by:
i.     a boom in unauthorized construction: no building permits, and, particularly, unauthorized
occupation of land belonging to the central and local governments;
ii.    excessive construction time, principally because families lack funds and, since they are not
eligible for bank loans and there are no other suitable financing mechanisms, they are
forced to build at the same pace as their savings capacity;
iii.    use of unsuitable technologies which result in major wastage of construction materials;
good building practices are not codified or are not known by masons and other workers
who are the main agents in self-constnictioin,
iv.    environmental problems, which are often serious, caused by poor quality urban services
which are linked to inadequate infrastructure and facilities, and are very unevenly
distributed in urban spaces.
20.    The standard of living in urban environments depends essentially on the availability, proximity and
quality of services, which demands higher investments in infrastructure and basic community facilities.
In recent years, investments of this kind have grown considerably in Bamako and in all the regional
capitals, particularly with the establishment of the Agence d'Execution des Travaux d'Interet Public pour
l'Emploi (AGETIPE) [Public Works Executing Agency], which as a delegated contract manager, has
considerably improved the efficiency with which resources are used.
Despite this growth in investments, some serious problems must still be addressed if sustainable urban
development is to be achieved. They include:
i.    insufficient or no maintenance of existing infrastructure and facilities to capitalize on the
investments already made;
ii.    weakness in municipal management capacity;
iii.   lack of control over municipal financing, marked by inability to recover the costs of urban
services;
iv.    scant participation by the private sector in managing facilities and in constructing basic
infrastructure.



33                                Annex 1
Page 5 of 21
21.   As the result of uncontrolled growth and the twofold increase in the ACrVs developments, housing
in Bamako has spread rapidly on the right bank of the river Niger and in the Sevare and Medina-Coura
zones (community of Mopti-Sevare), creating an urgent need for drinking water which the two
municipalities are unable to provide unaided, given their current financial straits.
22.   The serious environmental problems that are being encountered more frequently in Malian cities
are partly the result of the new forms of urban management that make the government the main player in
public sanitation and safety. This situation is a major setback in view of Mali's urban tradition that
demanded that individuals take responsibility in exercising public obligations.
23.   The wealth of Mali's monuments, artifacts, and non-material heritage has nourished the history and
lore of the African continent, in both the Arab and Westem worlds. Protection of this heritage was an
unwritten rule, consecrated by tradition.
Under written regulations to safeguard this heritage, the law has required civil society to participate
alongside decentralized government agencies (Law 85-40/AN-RM of July 26, 1985, on the protection and
promotion of the national cultural heritage).
Consequently, the local communities have taken responsibility and actions to safeguard their cultural
resources through the establishment of local committees to protect the cultural heritage, under the following
instruments:
i.    Order 003/MSAC/DNAC of January 3, 1989, establishing regional and local cultural
heritage committees;
ii.    Decree 89-428/P-RM of December 28, 1989, placing the cultural and natural sanctuary of
the Bandiagara Cliffs on the list of heritage sites;
iii.    Decree 92-245/P-RM of December 18, 1992, placing the old cities of Timbuktu and
Djenne on the list of heritage sites;
iv.    Decree 93-208/P-RM of June 11, 1993, establishing Cultural Missions in Timbuktu,
Djenn6 and Bandiagara.
With respect to the world heritage, Dejenn6 and Timbuktu were registered under numbers 212 and 213 at
the 12th session of the World Heritage Committee on December 9, 1988, and the Cliffs of Bandiagara
under number 320 at the 13th session on December 15, 1989.
The extent of the task to safeguard and promote the cultural heritage is a formidable challenge. While the
non-material heritage and cultural identity is threatened by the globalization of communications, the
monuments are threatened by time, weather and pillaging.
It is now recognized that sustainable human development is grounded in the realities and cultural
experience of the habitat. Safeguarding the cultural heritage is therefore an action to preserve the internal
development dynamics of a nation: originality, plurality, and humanity are the basis for harmony and the
wellspring of development of this kind.



34                               Annex I
Page 6 of 21
24.   Decentralization will be an important opportunity to rectify the situation and special attention
should be paid to the effective expression of all cultural values that have contributed to Mali's well-being
over the ages and which can continue to contribute to more harmonious urban development in the country.
25.   However there are major constraints on the dynamics of urban management today which could
jeopardize sustainable urban development, particularly:
i.    poorly defined town and country relationships which are managed with no thought to the
strengths and weaknesses of the different poles of development and therefore have no
possibility of being guided by mutual enrichment;
ii.    high population growth in the cities, in a context of scant land allocation and housing
production, which very often lies at the heart of the current explosion of unauthorized
building and cities that continue to sprawl unchecked;
iii.   insufficient and poorly distributed urban services which often suffer from serious problems
of accessibility (physical and economic) and quality;
iv.   insufficient financial resources with poorly-allocated spending (too much on personnel and
too little on municipal services);
v.    an institutional environment that is out of step, particularly with current decentralization
requirements;
vi.    a cultural heritage threatened with degradation, with consequences that jeopardize
harmonious human development.
3.    OBJECTIVES AND  STRATEGIES OF THE  URBAN  DEVELOPMENT  SECTOR
POLICY
26.   The general objective of the urban development sector policy is to lay the groundwork for
improving living conditions, particularly the struggle against urban poverty, in the general context of
decentralization.
27.   The specific objectives are to:
i.    set the stage for better control over urban growth;
ii.    help to improve living conditions in cities by stepping up the fight against urban poverty;
iii.   promote the national cultural heritage as a vehicle for more harmonious urban
development.



35                               Annex 1
Page 7 of 21
3.1    OBJECTIVE 1. BETTER CONTROL OVER URBAN GROWT:H
28.   The main guidelines of the national urban development policy in the area of land management have
provided an opportunity for defining and applying in Mali:
i.    urban regulations that form the urban development master plan and the urban development
sector plan;
ii.    operational urban development tools, with the main ones being land subdivision,
rehabilitation, restructuring and urban renewal.
Despite the noble goals pursued in those regulations, their impact is very weak on urban development in
general, mainly because there are not enough urban development instruments, and few operations are
actually carried out in comparison with the enormous needs, which are continually mounting.
29.   Thus, in point of fact, cities are developing unofficially, in a horizontal fashion that reduces the
capacity for public investments in community infrastructure and facilities and the quality of basic urban
services.
Cities are managed as independent units, with no organized structural relationship with their surrounding
rural environment or with the country's other urban centers.
30.   In short, urban development has virtually been left to the government alone. Communities and civil
society exercise very little direct responsibility, which lessens the chances of laying the foundation for
sustainable urban development.
Stratet 1. Entrenchment of the decentralization process
31.   The National Conference held in the wake of the political events in 1991 determined that
decentralization would be one of the core elements in the new democratic process.
Clearly, decentralization is the best opportunity for achieving true local democracy, which is a basic
condition for responding better to public demands, since it involve citizens and makes them more
responsible for the management of business that concems them, through their elected representatives on the
community level.
Following this approach to development, the 1995-1997 Action Plan of the Ministry of Urban Development
and Housing has been crafted around decentralization, in the strong conviction that urban development can
only have a sustainable impact:
i.    in a comprehensive approach that includes increasingly larger spaces;
ii.   in a participative context in which all the urban stakeholders are involved, with the
municipalities fostering and coordinating local initiatives, which are the key factor in
change;
iii.    with a revised Land Tenure Code that will help to strengthen decentralization.



36                                Annex 1
Page 8 of 21
32.   Major steps have already been taken in this direction, and others are under way, including:
i.    the laws and decrees already in effect or in the process of being approved, i.e.: (a) Law
93-008 of February 11, 1993, which determine the conditions for independent local
administration; (b) Law 95-022 of March 20, 1995, on the functions of local goveniment
employees; (c) Law 95-034 of April 12, 1995, on the Municipal Code of the Republic of
Mali; (d) Decree 95-210 of May 30, 1995, which determines the electoral qualifications
and powers of local representatives; (e) Law 96-025 of February 21, 1996, on the special
status of the District of Bamako; (f) Decree 96-119/P-RM of April 11, 1996, which
determines the electoral qualifications and powers of the representatives of the District of
Bamako; (f) Decree 96-084/P-RM of March 20, 1996, which determines the terms and
conditions under which decentralized government services will be made available to the
municipalities; and (h) law on the principles of the structure and management of local
governments;
ii.   the national and regional land management plans (draft already available) which, as frames
of reference and consistency, are the instruments for dialogue between the central and local
government and the other stakeholders in development to translate the exercise in renewal
of the system for planning, programming and managing development into reality;
iii.   zoning to negotiate the establishment of certain new communities (rural and urban)
according to the wishes of the people, which will be self managing in the different
geographic and socioeconomic spaces that will be created;
iv.    revision of the Land Tenure Code to give the public and the communities greater
responsibility for managing their land resources.
33.    The decentralization process thus launched is continuing to be entrenched under the momentum of
the decentralization mission, with the main goal of building a more dynamic partnership between the central
and local governments, the private sector and civil society in order to strengthen democracy in Mali.
Strateat 2. Development of a network of secondary cities
The future plans (national and regional levels) for development will provide an opportunity for building up
the regional subsystems, in a mutual alliance that will favor the emergence of support points (large
population clusters or urban centers) to create a genuine process of settlement-development.
It is this phenomenon of concentration that highlights the modem city; it is the consequence of development
in general and urban development in particular. Cities are not only potential markets for farm products,
but are also the vanguard for scientific and technological progress that supports urban and rural activities
alike.
Aware that urban development efforts have focused exclusively on the city of Bamako since Independence,
the government is now opting for a planned policy to build up the secondary cities.



37                                  Annex 1
Page 9 of 21
35.    To support this development it will be necessary to:
a.     Prepare and implement national and regional development plans in a way that will provide future
urban and rural communities with suitable tools for controlling their resources and designing their
different development programs.
b.     Develop a secondary urban network (mainly cities of over 10,000) with the necessary linkage:
i.     upstream, to the capital Bamako, which is the nerve center of the country's political and
socioeconomic system and is home today to at least 50% of the total urban population;
ii.    downstream, to the rural production zones that are the mainstays of national wealth.
c.     Make specific efforts to improve the road links between cities and to build and maintain rural roads
to improve access to urban markets and services.
Strategy 3. Better urban management
36.   In the current stage of the development of Mali's cities, urban planning must be strengthened and
redirected in order to enhance coordination between public and private action in building community
infrastructure and facilities, in developing extension areas and in their operation, with a view to delivering
higher quality services.
The strategy is mainly intended to ensure:
i.     consensus on the establishment of facilities and services, particularly by protecting the
rights-of-way necessary to build systems;
ii.    equitable distribution of services in the urban space, thus improving accessibility in
outlying areas, which are generally the most needy;
iii.   facilitation of urban activities by promoting transportation services inside cities;
iv.    better environmental protection.
Under the decentralization initiative, the communities have full control over land tenure in their localities,
with the possibility of obtaining their own asset base and designing a policy for the establishment and
management of urban facilities.
37.    However with regard to the tools currently in use it should be noted that:
i.     existing urban development instruments are largely out of step with decentralization and
land tenure activities, which translates into protracted periods for the preparation and
approval of projects (5 to 7 years), since the situation on the ground is evolving more
quickly every day;
ii.    investment choices are often overly rigid in light of objective needs which are changng
rapidly;



38                                Annex I
Page 10 of 21
iii.   neither local governments nor the general public have sufficient ownership of those tools.
38.   Urban planning will be improved as a consequence of the following:
a.     The simplification of tools, through the updating of instruments such as the Urban Development
Code, the Practical Guide to Urban Management, the Practical Guide to Land Management, and
the Urban Development Reference Plan, by:
i.    facilitating the establishment of urban data bases, with particular attention to the main
urban and housing indicators;
ii.    helping to prepare multi-annual investment and maintenance programs for community
infrastructure and facilities and to promote land management;
iii.   tracking progress in cities over time and helping to prepare short and medium-term
development strategies.
b.     De facto control over the most important or most vulnerable land reserves (since the planning
document is limited to "structuring" the urban space.), with particular stress on the layout of
primary and possible secondary networxs and the location of said reserves.
c.     Agreement between the decision makers and all the local stakeholders in identifying priority actions
in a truly dynamic partnership.
39.    The success of the program will depend on bolstering skalls through training in the use of civic
management tools (for mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants), elected representatives,
administrators, and citizens.
3.2    OBJECTIVE 2. IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONS IN CITIES
40.    Sustainable urban development cannot be obtained without meeting the essential needs of the
public, particularly the poorest groups. Cities are, in particular, the places where conflicts of interests arise
and where there is a continuing need for negotiation and arbitration. The coordinated action of all players
is necessary to pursue the goal of sustainable development at the service of all individual and collective
interests.
Strategv 4. Strengthening the partnership between the central and local governments and the private sector
41.    The normal functioning of urban activities requires clear rules of the game for the different
partners, which are chiefly the central and local governnents and private interests. Urban management is
grouped into the following action priorities, with each level having its own intemal demands:
a.     Planning and programming, with a strong requirement for consultation with all potential
stakeholders to reach appropriate decisions regarding:
i.    investment priorities;
ii.    ways and means of implementation.



39                                 Annex 1
Page 11 of 21
b.     Execution, particularly steering, control, and implementation.
c.     Maintenance, which is indispensable to preserve the investments.
42.    Programs and projects initiated on the public level fall within the purview of the central or local
administrations; taking charge of them requires:
a.     A contractor: ministry, decentralized service or municipality;
b.    Implementing agencies: increasingly from the private sector; despite the continuing involvement of
public services, particularly on the design-control level, physical implementation is increasingly in
the hands of businesses and, in recent years, with strong growth in the role of small and medium-
sized enterprises and economic interest groups.
However partnerships of this kind now call for a redefinition of roles and a broader field of
communications among all urban stakeholders.
43.    The appearance of delegated contractors (AGETIPE, ACD) on the scene since 1992 and current
investment practices point particularly to the difficulties that the municipalities encounter in negotiating
projects, especially owing to the absence of programming (choice of projects, investment priorities,
allocation of resources, maintenance of works). Specific measures, such as training for local government
officials (mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants, technical officers, etc.) will be used to
strengthen their capacity to contract municipal works. The transfers of powers and resources from the
central government to the local govemments currently under way will pennit these measures to be defined
more closely.
44.    The private sector will continue to be supported by facilitating true professionalism, without which
it will be impossible to provide better quality services at lower cost. In this dynamic, associative and
participative management of urban development will be supported by organization of the community
around specific or combined interest groups, to foster the emergence of a civil society that is increasingly in
charge and aggressive in establishing economic structures such as cooperatives and economic interest
groups.
45.    Government administration will be rescaled, based on a specific institutional development program
to strengthen communities and the private sector.
Strategy 5. Larzer local receipts and better management of communitv resources
46.    One of the fundamental conditions for successful decentralization clearly lies in the financial self-
sufficiency of communities. However at present local governments have few sources of income and no
potential for the self-financing of investments. This situation is the result of low taxation and insignificant
income from marketable services, although the potential for resource mobilization is large.
Therefore instruments have been adopted to increase the income of the local governments (Law 96-21 of
1996 on fiscal resources for local governments and Law 96 of 1996 on fiscal resources for the District of
Bamako and its municipalities) under a new strategy for sharing the tax pie between the central and local
governments.



40                                 Annex 1
Page 12 of 21
Special stress is now placed on revenue-generating facilities (marketplaces, road transport terminals) and
privatization of their management to help boost municipal income. Steps will be taken to ensure that the
municipalities obtain the maximum possible benefits from taxpayer identification with the goal of
improving efficiency in the collection of fees and taxes.
47.    In light of the weakness of the central govemment's financial base and the impossibility of making
massive transfers to the municipalities in the short term, and given the absence of local property taxes in
their own right and excessive tax concentration on the potentially largest taxpayers, a municipal tax will be
introduced to benefit urban communities, whose main objective is:
i.    in the short term, to permit the municipalities to finance the maintenance of community
works;
ii.    in the medium and long terms, to help increase urban resources.
Improvements in municipal financial and accounting management will be obtained beginning in 1997
through:
i.     preparation of a guide for community organization and management, once the
organizational audits underway are completed;
ii.    introduction of tax registers adapted to each municipality;
iii.    computerization of municipal accounting services;
iv.    taxpayer identification;
v.     establishment of compatible data bases that can evolve in future into a monitoring station
for local finances to help improve management of municipal potential in relation to own
efforts, particularly in the framework of national solidarity with regard to local
government;
vi.    organization of specific training for municipal personnel and elected officials: financial
management, mobilization of fiscal resources, etc.;
vii.   design of performance indicators to help measure growth in the effectiveness of financial
services such as: (a) mobilization of resources through taxes and commercial activities;
(b) percentage of capital spending on infrastructure and maintenance; (c) spending-to-
income ratio; and (d) rate of recovery of investment costs.
49.    Last, city contracts will be introduced to cover cases in which municipalities require reimbursable
loans to boost their investment capacity. The contracts will include:
i.     program estimates for new investments and for the maintenance of existing infrastructure
and facilities;
ii.    support services for management and financial resources;
iii.    criteria for measuring the performance of the municipalities.

Page 13 of 21
Strategy 6. Strengheninz municipal contract management capacity
50.    All municipalities are members of the Association des Maires de Mali (AMM) [Association of
Mayors] which is their voice on the national level. They have all encountered enormious difficulties in fully
shouldering their new authority and responsibilities under the decentralization process.
The municipalities are particularly ill-prepared for the tasks of planning, financial programming and
maintenance. This situation often gives rise to jurisdictional disputes regarding the choice of certain
investments and in their location in the urban space. Even more dramatic is the premature decay of many
investments made on behalf of the municipalities owing to the absence of minimum maintenance during
operation.
51.    Strategies are necessary to gradually involve the municipalities more closely in investment choices
and in effective participation in financing and maintenance.
From this standpoint, particular stress will be placed on:
i.     advisory assistance for the different local governments;
ii.    the strengthening of technical capacity to contract local works;
iii.    adoption of the model city contract to permit the municipalities to more clearly establish
the objectives of their different urban development activities, thus facilitating negotiation
of their commitrnents with the different partners in development;
iv.    training for municipal personnel (mayors, municipal councilors, city clerks, accountants,
technical officers, etc.).
Strategv 7. Greater efforts to protect and upgrade the urban environment
52.    The preservation and improvement of the quality of the urban environment is an indispensable
condition for sustainable urban development. Urban environmental problems urgently calling for solutions
stem ftom:
i.    insufficient basic services;
ii.    poor management of urban waste;
iii.    difficult access to land for most people.
The proliferation of unauthorized settlements, the very weak structure of most urban tissues, new and more
irresponsible environmental behavior, the weakening of the traditional ties of solidarity and mutual
assistance, are among the main causes and consequences of the environmental imbalance generally found in
urban centers, whose repercussions are being felt more and more in rural areas.

Page 14 of 21
53.    The types of activities required to address the situation include:
i.     greater emphasis on strategies to educate and sensitize the public to urban environmental
problems to obtain their support and effective mobilization in specific programs and
projects;
ii.    better land management policy and preparation of guidelines to improve access to land for
the vast majority of the urban population, with special attention to vulnerable groups;
iii.    greater emphasis on associative and participative management of urban waste through the
establishment of economic structures (cooperatives, economic interest groups, etc.).
StrategW 8. Specific measures to improve drinking water supplies
54.    One of the aspects that marks sustainable human development is better public health, and in view
of the impact of water-borne diseases on primary care, one of the most effective contributions is to make
more safe water available. The government has adopted a sustained policy to improve the health status of
Malians, through the provision of drinking water (master plan for water resources including an action
program for the period 1992-2001 by type of activity: agriculture, livestock production, potable water, and
implementation of a health, population and rural water project).
55.    Despite all the government's on-going efforts to produce and deliver drinking water in both urban
and rural areas, a great deal remains to be done. In Bamako and Mopti, in particular, supply lags far
behind demand.
56.   In addition to actions under way in other programs and projects, specific steps are required in the
short and medium terms in those two cities to attain the following objectives:
a.     To address the pressing and immediate need for water in the community of Mopti-S6vare and the
district of Bamako.
b.     To detect and tap groundwater as an altemative source of water for Bamako and its vicinity in the
event of heavy pollution of the Niger river.
c.     To study water supplies for the district of Bamako up to the 2010 horizon and introduce water
rates that will make for financial balance in the water sector.
57.    To improve the quality of service, particularly good management and maintenance of installations
and other investments, the management capacity of the Societe Energie du Mali (EDM) [Mali Energy
Company], particularly its Water Branch, will be bolstered.

Strateg 9. Development of labor-intensive employment, with stress on the promotion of suitable
technologies
58.    Since AGETIPE was established in 1992, labor-intensive jobs have grown rapidly. The impact of
different interventions in the employment situation is beyond doubt. However, in the field there is a
growing need to increase local value added.
These concerns range from the pricing of local construction materials to the maintenance of investments, to
greater professionalism in consulting firms and among local entrepreneurs, and better management
(compilation, processing and dissemination) of technological information, ensuring that it is made as widely
available as possible. This reflects, in short, a significant need to promote alternative technologies geared
to specific national and regional circumstances.
59.    Steps in this direction will mainly focus on:
a.    Pursuit of decentralization in AGETIPE's activities to bring it even closer to the municipalities,
with the future establishment of other agencies to make for greater effectiveness in management
and fewer difficulties in coordination.
b.    Pursuit of technical assistance and on-going training for the private sector, particularly consulting
services and building and civil engineering companies to improve their organization and
management performance.
c.     Strengthening of job creation capacity, especially through the choice of more appropriate
technologies and special stress on:
i.     boosting the capacity of consulting services and local entrepreneurs to manage contracting,
observing the rules of the game, and using locally available materials;
ii.    producing and distributing practical guidelines for contractors (choice of investment
opportunities) and workers (implementation technologies);
iii. encouraging effective production and large-scale use of local materials.
d.    More transparent market management through increasingly healthy competition among consulting
services and among entrepreneurs, with continuing demands to improve the quality/cost ratio.
e.    Expeditious payments to companies and consulting firms.
3.3  OBJECTIVE 3. MORE HARMONIOUS URBAN DEVELOPMENT
60.    Since sustainable development is grounded in human realities and cultural experience, the action
plan of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, approved on July 4, 1995, has made the cultural
dimension the prerequisite for all sustainable socioeconomic growth, supported particularly by the example
of different grassroots social entities in the country (communities, extended families) which have known
down the ages how to shape their course based on patterns fixed in the collective memory through different
means of expression.



44                                  Annex I
Page 16 of 21
Many human groups in Mali are still able to live fully in the present, illuminated by the past, to better
prepare for the future. However this inheritance is partly threatened today with "degradation" and physical
disappearance. Specific measures are indispensable to address the situation.
61.    Many human groups across the country are living with constraints and looking back with nostalgia
to their still-recent past, which is rich in individual and collective identity values on the local and national
levels.
In the decentralization process under way, public debates and statements by local and national authorities
reflect a strong determination to lift the country's different human settlements out of the cultural anonymity
into which many have sunk over the years. This would doubtless breath new life into the nation by setting
the stage for the expression of cultural plurality in unity, based on the exceptional human legacy of the
Mali of yesterday.
In particular, this would involve forms of local architecture and expression and appropriate models of
communication to regain the strength necessary to safeguard and promote the local and national cultural
heritage.
62.    From this standpoint, special efforts will be made to open the country up to the outside, fortifying
the national contibution to universal culture and improving access to the country's different historic sites.
Strategy 10. Protecting restorin and promoting historic cities and monuments
63.    The plan of action to protect and promote Mali's historic cities and monurnents prepared by the
Ministry of Culture presents a strategy to achieve this general objective through effective actions in the
field, under the control of the government, and vith the active and responsible participation of civil society,
whose fundamental concerns are the springboards for action.
64.    To effectively and efficiently implement the different actions in a coherent framework:
1 .    the central government will provide institutional support, particularly to create a more
receptive context for these activities;
ii.    the Cultural Missions will be responsible for coordinating execution of all protection and
conservation activities on the local level, providing guidelines for the implementation of the
World Heritage Convention;
iii.   the Local Heritage Protection Committees will be responsible for organizing the
comnmunity to participate in the work of restoring, maintaining and operating the cultural
infrastructure, and for sensitizmg the public to the need to protect archeological sites;
iv.    the Cultural Associations will assist the entities responsible for protecting the heritage in
executing the work and in promoting cultural infrastructure such as museums and
documentation ceiters.



45                                Annex 1
Page 17 of 21
65.   The specific actions involve:
a.    Promotion and conservation of historic cities and monuments through the establishment of
protected zones and restoration.
b.    Establishment of site museums and documentation centers to preserve cultural objects and prevent
pilfering, theft, and illegal trade.
c.    Development of traditional skills.
d.    Appropriate linkage with tourism promotion on the national level.
66.   Special attention will be paid to the cities and sites classified as part of the world heritage:
i.    Timbuktu, its three famous 14th century mosques, and its mausoleums and cemeteries
through: (a) restoration and protection of the mosques; (b) rehabilitation of cemeteries and
mausoleums; and (c) development of tourist circuits and urban tourism facilities;
ii.    Dejenn6 and the 2nd century B.C. archeological site of Djenne-Djeno through:
(a) protection and promotion of the site; (b) construction of the Djenne museum;
(c) preservation of the typical architecture of the mosque; and (d) sanitation of the city;
iii.    The Bandiagara Cliffs cultural and natural sanctuary through: (a) rehabilitation of the
camp site, construction of a link road to the Bandiagara-Sevar6 axial highway and
development of the cultural sites in the Songho zone; (b) development of walking trails in
the Sangha zone; (c) establishment of a documentation center for the Dogon culture inl
Bandiagara.
4.  ACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR
POLICY
4.1 ACTION PLAN TO CONTROL URBAN GROWTH
67.   To attain the specific objective of controlling urban growth, the government undertakes to
implement institutional measures and regulations to:
a.    Decentralize socioeconomic and cultural activities, enhancing effective participation by local
governments, particularly through the transfer of authority over the design and control of
development actions in their localities;
b.    Develop a network of secondary cities that will serve as links between the capital and the main
rural production centers;
c.    Strengthen the management capacity of the cities to prepare and introduce appropriate urban
management tools that will permit them to take effective control over their development;
d.    Strengthen the capacity to provide land and promote real estate development with greater
involvement by the private sector and civil society.

4.2  ACTION PLAN TO IMPROVE URBAN LIVING CONDITIONS
68.     To attain the specific objective of improving urban living conditions, particularly in the most
deprived neighborhoods, the government undertakes to:
a.       Strengthen and develop partnerships among the different stakeholders in urban  development
(central and local governments, private sector, civil society, partners in development, etc.) for
better programming of development actions.
b.      Take steps to improve local revenues and the quality of their management: transfers of funds,
creation of urban taxes, privatization of the management of commercial facilities, etc.
c.       Strengthen the techmical capacity to contract community works for better monitoring of the
execution and maintenance of basic and revenue-generating infrastructure: advisory assistance,
signature of city contracts, training for elected representatives and municipal officers, etc.
d.      Work to improve the urban environment, through better sewage treatment and domestic waste
disposal, and combat of industrial pollution: support for strategies to educate and sensitize the
public, support for associative and participative management of household waste, etc.
e.      Facilitate the introduction of housing financing mechanisms, giving as many families as possible in
each income group access to housing (serviced lots or accommodations) under conditions that will
ensure replenishment of the financing after a reasonable cycle (better tum-over) and hold new
government financing obligations to the strict minimum.
f.      Improve land management policies taking account, inter alia, of access to land for the majority of
the population, particularly women, with special stress on the simplification of land access
procedures.
g.      Enhance and/or strengthen urban infrastructure and services with special stress on the provision of
potable water and the use of labor-intensive techniques in execution of the works.

71.    This Urban Development Sector Policy Statement is based on the need to achieve sustainable
urban development.
It will therefore serve as a guide for all activities to promote the harmonious development of urban areas
from the spatial, social, cultural and economic standpoints, all in a true spirit of national solidarity.

REPUBLIC OF MALI
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SUBPROJECTS
1.     Miethodology
Evaluation criteria for the various subprojects of the Mali UDDP are based mainly on the net
benefit stream for the econonic analysis and on the corresponding net revenues for the financial analysis.
Economic intemal rates of return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) are included as indicators. The
discount rate for calculation of NPV is 12%, the current standard rate which reflects the opportuity cost
of capital. All costs and benefits are expressed in 1996 prices, and were actualized and compared over a
period of 20 years (30 years for water supply). Investmert expenditures as well as revenues from fees or
tariffs are presented net of duties and taxes. ERR's do not include indirect costs such as interest,
depreciation and debt service. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken and is individualized for each of the
subprojects included in this analysis. To ensure simplicity, consistency and transparency, no shadow
pricing was used. The ddteunination of revenue and benefits vary considerably according to the
dharacter of the sector concemed; therefore, the indicators retained are described inmividually for each of
the specific sub-programs. Evaluation tables for each sector and per town are in the Project Files.
2.     Mumcipal M _intenance Subcomponent
The District of Bamako and eight regional capitals will be participating in the projected UDDP
investments, (roads and drainage, markets and transport stations, sanitation). An estimated 1.5 million
inhabitants in these cities will benefit from the works plarnned. Upon completion of the investments, the
respective local governments will be responsible for operation of revenue-generating projects and
maintenance of the physical works. At present, however, the financial situation of Malian local
governments is precarious; 1994 municipal accounts were in deficit in all but one of the cities (Mopti-
Sevar6 registered a positive balance). To ensure that local governments benefit fully from the potential
impact of the UDDP, a series of accompanying measures will seek to reinforce and improve local
management and revenue collection capacity. These measures include the creation of a new resource
(urban tax), improvement in the collection of existing resources (patente, market and transport fees), and
renovation of the management of revenue-Senerating eqjuipment. The creation of the urban tax would
enable local governments to mobilize their financial contribution for maintenance of road, drainage and
public lighting works financed by the project (5 to 15% of current revenues). The forecast of urban
contribution (tax) revenues is based on the estimated nunber of occupied houses in each city, with an
average tax rate per house of CFAF 2,000-5,000 per year.
Overall, the project would register a positive impact on municipal finances. Total new revenues
would amnount to 7.6 billion current CFAF (5.3 billion constant CFAF), with 65% generated in the
District of Bamako (Table 10.1). Net revenues through 2005 (revenues minus expenditures, resulting
direcdy from the project), would reach 2.7 billion current CF.F (1.9 billion constant CFAF), with 63%
in the District of Bamako and the remaining in the other beneficiary cities. The net result represents 36%
of total municipal revenues from the project. Overall, additional costs generated by the municipal
subprojects (municipal contribution for maintenance; debt payments for CFD- or KFW-financed
markets and transport terminals; improvernent of municipal managnent operations) would be largely
balanced by this new municipal income.

3.     Urban Road Subprojects
The urban road rehabilitation and construction subcomponent includes rehabilitation of existing
roads, construction of new roads, drains, bridges, traffic signals and road signs to improve traffic flow.
Cities induded for IDA finanang of this subcomnponent are the Distnct of Bamako, Segou, Sikasso,
Mopti-Sevare, Gao and Kayes. In the Distnct of Barnako, an estimated 17.5 kmn of paved roads will be
constructed and 10.3 km of road rehabilitated.
Evaluation cntena. For the District of Bamako, road works proposed in this project will lead to an
improvemnent of traffic conditions. Two main types of benefits can be identified: (1) increase of
transport speed, due to improved road conditions, leading to a reduction of transport time as well as a
decrease in vehicle unit operating costs (UOC); (2) other benefits which result from better roadway
surfaces, leading to lower car maintenance and repair costs, less wearing out of tires, etc... In Bamako,
extensive studies of traffic flows, unit costs of vehicle operation and time cost for vehide passengers
were prepared. The results of these studies, as well as network maps identifyng key links and
deficiencies and the impact of the priority projects are contained in the Project File.
Results. The applied rate for annual O&M costs of road and related infrastructure is 5% of the
investment amount. The ERR results indicate a 91% rate of rehun for road rehabilitation and 67% for
new road construction. The net present values are 1.7 and 7.9 billion CFAF, respectively. Sensitivity
analysis was conducted, by modifying total costs (investment and O&M - + 20%) and the benefits
hypothesis (20% increase of UOC, no time gain benefit). The results of the sensitivity analysis result in
ERR ranges of 73 to 85% for road rehabilitation and 41 to 58% for road construction (Table 10.2).
Specific detailed traffic counts and vehicle operatng costs were not available for the regional
capital cities. The investmnent subprojects will be selected on the basis of their importance to complete
and better integrate the local road network, C improve Ua&ffic flows, to reduce flooding and to provide
better access to residential communities or to neighborhoods with econonic activities. When specific
works are prepared by AGET1PE, orly those subprojects vith an ERR of at least 12% will be
inVpleneited.
4. Samtation Subcomponent
The sanitation comnponent consists of the construction of wells and gutters to collect wastewater
and prevent contamination of groundwater, and a grassroots campaign to educate the public on sanitary
and health measures. Total investments costs for sanitaton are CFAF 3.05 billion, with 1.5 billion in
Mopti, 650 million in Bamako (including studies for the industrial zone sanitation), 500 nillion in
Timbuktu (istoric cities component) and 400 million in Djenme. This componnet will improve the
general health of the population in Mopti-Sevare, Djenne, and Timbuktu by providing access to basic
sanitation, providing for the proper disposal of sewage and waste waters, and increasing awareness of
sanitary measures to avoid contaminabon. A large number of cases of diarrhea, dysentery, and intesinal
infections were reported in 1994 in the region of Timbuktu (4,000) and Mopti-Sevar6 (15,000+); the
vast majority of these can be attributed to contamination from poor disposal of household waste waters.
The lack of basic sanitation in Mopti-Sevare also led to a severe outbreak of cholera in 1995, with 700
cases and 100 deaths reported in the second half of 1995 alone The situation is continuing in 1996;
cholera is hardly present in other parts of Mali and is largely attributable to poor sanitary conditions
unique to the regions of Mopti-S&vare, Djenne, and Timbuktu. The provision of basic sanitation will
thus reduce water-bome morbidity and infant mortality. It will also improve the productivity and income
of the beneficiary population by reducing time spent caring for sick family memnbers, seeldng medical
help, as well as by reducing time spent away from productive, wage-earning activities.

5. Marketplaces and Transport Stabions
The market subcomponent includes the rehabilitatioi of markets in 4 cities, for a total of
7 projects.  The market in Mopti-Sevare, "Bas Fonds" is a project of CFAF 107.8 million
(US $213,000), to be financed by IDA. The projected works for transport stations in 5 cities include a
total of 6 projects. IDA will finance the projects in Bamako, the Medine station and the Djikoroni Para
station (total CFAF 768 million or US $1.5 million) and in S6vare, the Lyc6e station (total CFAF 504
million or US $1 million). These works involve the rehabilitation of existing stations, or the
displacenent of existing stations to more appropriate locations.
Evaluation Criteria. The rehabilitation of the markets in the regional capitals is geared to improving
the conditions for presentation and sale of goods and services by merchants. In particular the density of
market spots and stalls will be reduced, passageways m the market improved, and drainage works
constructed; the latter will also protect merchants from flooding and decrease losses from damaged or
destroyed goods. Municipal bus stations are important centers of economic activity, particularly in the
regional capitals. The works planned in the UDDP will organize and improve the controls of vehicle
parking and passenger loading, as well as the flows of vehicles, for both passengers and merchandise.
Mumicipal resources from the fees and taxes associated with markets and transport stations should be
increased, particularly through higher collection rates. The works in the markets and stations are
expected to benefit 1.5 million inhabitants. The costs of these projects include capital investment costs,
operating costs (personnel, vehicle, tickets) and maintanance expenditures (2% of inftiastr rs).
Benefits generated by the market consist of incremental revenue calculated from market operations; the
benefits generated by the stations consist of increnental revenues calculated frorn transport flows and
collection of transport fees and taxes.
Results. The ERR for the base case for the Mlopti market is estimated at 19%, with a NPV of 37 million
CFAF (Table 10.3). Sensitivity analysis was conducted, by modifying investment and O&M costs
(+10%), andthe benefits hypothesis (+10% revenue collection, -10% revenue collection). The sensitivity
analysis results in ERR ranges of 14 to 24%. The ERR for the base case of the transport stations are
37% for Bamako and 14% for Sevar6, with NPV of 754 and 46 million CFAF, respectively. Sensitivity
analysis was conducted, by changing investment and O&M costs (+10%), and the benefits hypothesis
(full collection of potential revenues). The sensitivity analysis leads to ERR ranges of 32% to 51% for
Bamako and 12% to 33% for S6var6. These ERRs are underestimated, as no data was available to
estimate the induced increases in economic activity which are likely to occur from implemerntation of the
project.
The results of analysis for markets and stations not financed by IDA are not as positive, partly
due the dispanty of the cost of some of the rehabilitaton works and induced maintance requiremnents,
compared with the weaker potential to collect revenues. To increase the profitability potential of these
municipal investments, the project proposes different solutions: training for local officials and agents to
improve markets and station operations; pnvatizaton of management, through concession, affermage or
other options. The viability of these operatons will depend greatly on the actions introduced to improve
revenue collection.
6.     Histoiic Cities Component
The two sub-parts of this component are: (1) creation of an archtecture and rasonry
workshop to train 150 masons a year over three years on local and traditional methods of building
conAstrucon and restoration; and (2) improverent of the landscape around the three major mosques,
which date to the XVWh cetury and serve as a major tourist attraction. The mosques have been



Annex 10
85                                   Page 4 of 21
maintained by inhabitants through yearly addition of banco, a local earthen plaster; however, in the past
few years, the lack of resources and skills has led to increasing negJect in the maintenance and restoration
of the mosques. The architedural workshop will provide for the taining of students in the maintance
and restoration of the mosques as well as other buildings within and outside of Timbuktu. The
landscaping around the mosques is necessary to prevent the steady degradation of the walls of the
mosques caused by constant contact with wastewater from adjacent households, as well as to improve
pedestrian and vehiide traffic in the adjacent strees and improve the landscape. It would also create a
more open area near the mosques to welcome visitors and tounsts.
The ERR's for these two sub-projects are not quantfiable as it is impossible to value the
cultural, historical, and religious significance of the mosques. The sub-component would benefit the
local economy by increasing the appeal of the area to tourists and attract foreign currency eamings.
That potential was estimated at $10 million a year for the whole of the Djenn6-Mopti-Bandiagara-
Timbuktu area. It also can be assumed that the architectural workshop would have the following
benefits: (1) assure the future safeguard and upkeep of the mosques and of other buildings of cultural
and historical importance in Mali; and (2) benefit the local and regional construction industry and
economy through the addition of skilled and trained workers.
7.      Fnancial Analysis of EDM
The analysis of the situation of the Mali electric and water company, Energie du Mali (EDM)
includes a quick examination of past financial perfomiance, and the presertation of the financial
forecast, which estimates the impact of the investmeits of this project on the equilibrium of water sector
operaions.
Past Financial Performance        Past finanual perfomiance of EDM, for the water sector and for all
operations are presaited in Tables 10.4A (income Statement) and 10.4 B (Balance Sheet). These results
are summarized in the table below:

As the table above indicates, the past financial performance of EDM has bese difficult, at best.
For the operations of the water sector, there has been little evolution in the volume amount of water sales,
given the lack of investments to increase water production capaaty. The decline in water sales in 1994
may reflect the initial reaction to the tariff increases of 1993 and 1994. Thus, despite the 10% decline in



Annex 10
86                              Page 5 of 21
volume of sales, 1994 water revenue increased by 15%. In 1995, volume sales retumed to their level of
1993; however, as more of these sales were based on the social ;ariff of 80 CFAF/m3, the average tariff
declined by 2%, to 190 CFAF/m3.
For consolidated EDM operations, slight profits were registered in 1993, and again in 1995.
For three years in a row, since 1993, operating income was greater than 2 million CFAF. This
improvement in the operating balance is also evident in the results of the operating ratio, which was
greater than 1.0 in 1991 and then reached its current value of 0.87. The net results of 1995 may
translate the first impacts of the management contract and the financial restructuring program. Despite
water tariff increases (+32% in July 1993, + 10% in February 1994), the water sector has registered a net
loss since at least 1987. Electricity tariffs were increased by 19% in 1994. The consolidated 1994 net
losses were significant (-3.2 million CFAF), due principally to two factors: (1) the devaluation of the
CFA Franc and (2) the provisions for questionable client debts, which had been previously
underestimated. The CFA Franc devaluation led to an increase of 45% of petroleum products and to a
doubling of debt service (as EDM bears the exchange risk). CFD debts to the Malian government have
since been canceled and this cancellation is in the process of being integrated into EDMs accounts (for
CFAF 16 billion).
The value of fixed assets increased considerably in 1994, resulting from the integration of the
water production assets into the books. The return on average net fixed assets in operation for at least
two years was about -2% in 1991, 1992 and 1994, but registered positive retums of over 4.5% in 1994
and 3.5% in 1995. The current ratio has also improved since 1991, but EDM suffers from liquidity
problems due to the high rate of chent receivables, 17.5 billion CFAF in 1995, or the equivalent of 7
months of billing.
Dselgahion Globale de Gestion. From January 1995, the managenent of EDM was transferred to a
consortium of French and Canadian conpanies (SHEC), composed of SAUR, EDF, Hydro-Qu6bec and
CRC-SOGEMA. This management delegation contract will operate for a period of 4-5 years, financed
by IDA and the CFD. Included in the objectives of the management contract is the modernization of the
following services: commercial activities (billing and revenue collection), accounting, managemnent of
stodcs, computer network for management of client accounts. These projects include an important
training program for EDM personnel.
Water Tanffs. Water charges are based on the volume of water consumed; household, public fountain
and enterprise connections are metered. The current rates are 80 CFAF/m3 for the first 20 rn3 consurned
per monthly billing period; 198 CFAF for 21 to 60 m3 and 286 CFAF for amounts above 60 rn3. The
price billed by EDM for water fountains in 80 CFAF/m3, although the price charged to the final
consumer is generally established at 250 CFAF/m3, or higher.  An industrial rate of 30,000
CFAF/month plus a single price of 198 CFAF/m3 is available, but only 10 companies in Bamako have
elected to be billed on this basis.
The history of water tariffs (Table 10.5) underlines the rarity of water tariff increases. Three
tiers tariffs based on tranches of monthly consumption were introduced in November 1985; however,
after this increase, tariffs were not modified for another eight years, until 1993. Although the "social
tariff' for the first tranche of consumption was not nominally increased in July 1993, the tranche itself
was modified, with the ceiling lowered from 50 mn3 to 20 tn3. The two higher levels of tariffs were
increased in tenns of both the tranches and the price. In early 1994, a second increase of 10% was
implemted for the two superior tranches. The social price as well as the price billed to operators of
public water fountains was not changed.



Annex 10
87                              Page 6 of 21
As a result of the stagnation of water tariffs, the difference between average water tariffs/rn3 and
the average cost of producing water increased from 1986 to 1992 (Table 10.6). This difference led to a
widening of the "tariff deficit" from 18% in 1986, to almost 59% in 1992 (currert CFAF). The tariff
increases implemeited in 1993 and 1994 have greatly reduced this deficit to 16% in 1993 and 6% in
1995. The water tariff per cubic meter for residertial service in Mali is well below that of neighboring
countries. One of the conditions of this credit is the implemeitation of new water tariffs before June 30,
1998, as well as any other measures to ensure the equilibrium of water sector operations by June 30,
2001. As part ofthis strategy, a tariff study is being initiated byEDM.
Billing and Collection. The inadequacies of EDMs billing and collection system are one of the targets
of the managemert contract. In 1995, a separate Commercial Division was created to revise the entire
chain of meter reading, billing and collection. In 1994-1995, client receivables were equal to at least
seven months of billing. As of June 1996, cumulated unpaid bills for State and Administration clients
(excluding military) was reduced to only 2.5 months.
Since 1995, the actions of the Commercial Division have included: creation of four commercial
agencies in Bamako with specific client files (regional agencies are being created); installation of the
software program "Galat6e" to improve client and payment follow-up, with a dense network of
computers in the commercial agencies; a building-to-building census of every meter and connection in
Bamako and the regions; implementation of a rotation plan for meter readers; more rigorous cutoff
actions for unpaid accounts; decentralization of minor repairs to the commercial agencies; more stringent
follow-up on canceled subscribers. Since the beginning of 1996, revenues have been collected at levels
higher than the previous year (by 8-10%), particularly in Bamako.
Accounting and Auditing Since at least 1993, EDMs auditors have identified three major problems
which prevent certification of the accounts. These renmarks are: (1) lack of a reliable inventory of fixed
assets, as well as discrepancies between files; (2) reservations on the status of client receivables; and
(3) reservations on accounts of consumption advances paid by clients for new accounts.
One of the obligations of the management contract is to resolve these outstanding issues for the
1996 fiscal year, in order for 1996 accounts to be certified. For the first problem, a full invertory and
study of EDMs fixed assets was undertaken in 1995; the results of this inventory will be integrated in
EDMs accounts in 1996. The client receivables and client advances for consumption are in the process
of being resolved by the Commercial Division, on a case by case basis (see above).
Financial Projections
General. Financial projections were prepared for EDMs water operations, on the basis of the results of
the report "Etude sur la restructuration financiere de la socie& Energie du Mali", finalized in July 1995.
The projections are prepared in currert CFAF, with annual domestic inflation esiimated at 4% and
external inflation at 2.5%. The results of the financial projection are in Tables 10.7A, 10.7B and 10.7C.
Water Production. Water production estimates are based on on-going and projected works to increase
production capacity both in Baniako and the regions. In 1998 and 1999, 10,000 m3 and 9,000 m3 of
additional daily production capacity will become available in Bamako, with the completion of the water
treatment plant financed by the CFD.
Svstem Efficiency. Actual water losses in 1994 were 35% of production and 30% in 1995. As part of
the conditions of this credit, EDM will be implementig a plan to reduce leakage to less than 22% by



Annex 10
88                              Page 7 of 21
2001. A diagnostic study of the water network will be undertaken im 1997, in order to formulate a plan
of action to improve systemn efficiency.
Income Statement Revenues. With the construction of the distribution network and the addition of
15,000 individual connections in Bamako, revenues from water activities should increase by 22% in
1998 and 13% in 1999. Increases in water sales in the following years are estimated at 5% to 6% per
year, for all of Mali.
Tariffs. Tariff levels in the projections have been detemiined in order to balance water sector accounts
by 2001 and to ensure continued account balance once EDM begins repaying IDA and CFD debts; this
would require a 30% increase in the average tariff in 1998 (to 253 CFAF/m3), a 10% increase in 1999
and 2000, a 20% increase in 2001, and a further 10% increase in 2002. A tariff study will be conducted
by EDM as part of the requirement of this credit, to determine viable tariff rates for each tranche, in
order to reach financial equilibrium within the required time period.
Expaenses. Operating costs (maiAly electricity and chemicals) and repairs and mafftenance (mainly spare
parts) are assumed to increase in proportion to the quantity of water supplied. Following a reduction in
personnel costs in 1995, this item is expected to increase by 5% annually in the following years.
Common operating costs (such as administration) allocated to water operations are expected to increase
at about 5% per year.
Receivables. Uncollectible revenues are estimated as a percentage of revenues, 10% in 1997, and 5% of
water revenues in the following years.
Depreciation. Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis at an average annual rate of
4.5% of average fixed assets. In addition, EDM calculates provisions for renewal of new investmrat,
also at a rate of 3.3%. From 1995 to 1999, the cost of the management contract (DGG) is included in
fixed assets, and depreciated over a period of five years. The annual cost is divided proportionally
between electricity and water sales revenues.
Income Tax. Income tax on profits is the higher of: (1) 45% of operating result or (2) 0.75% of total
revenues, in accordance with national legislation on business tax.
Interest on borrowing. Interest accumulated during construction is capitalized. Interest on CFD loans
which have been cancelled to GOM are no longer counted in the debt. The debt cancellation will be
int~rated into the 1996 accounts of EDM, although the modalities for this operation have not yet been
finalized with the Ministry of Finance.
Balance Sheet and Funds Flow Statement Fixed Assets. Fixed assets are increased by transfers as
works on these elernents advance. EDMs fixed assets have not yet been revalued following the
devaluation of the CFAF in 1994. These projections do not take account of the revaluation.
Receivables. Client accounts reflect the plan of EDMs financial retruturing to bring receivables to the
level of 2 months average billing by 1998.
Borrowing. The proposed project will be funded by an IDA credit of US $7.6 million and a CFD credit
of a!out FF 34 million. Ihe IDA credit will be on-lent to EDM over penod of 20 years, with a five-year
grace period and an initial interest estimated at 7.70%. The CFD credit will be leit directly to EDM,
for 19 years, with 7 years grace, and a 2% interest rate. Other outstanding debt for the water sector
include an OPEC loan for the Bamako water network, the CFD FF 50 million loan for the Bamako

water treatment plant (currertly being disbursed) and 10% (or 2 mn SDR) of the 1982 IDA loan for the
electricity and water network.
8. Water Supply Component - Economic Analysis
The water supply component will include the following works: (1) installation of a transmission
and distribution network to add 15,000 individual connections in Bamako; (2) addition of 77 water
fountains in Bamako, to improve living conditions in the poorest neighborhoods; (3) installation of a
transrmission and distnbution network for 1,000 individual connections and 38 water fountains in Mopti;
(4) the construction of three reservoirs on the southern side of the city of Bamako. The works to be
constructed are expected to have a thirty year life.
Average consumption of water per connected household is estimated to be 35 m3/month. The
first 20 m3 are currently billed at 80 CFAF/m3, and consumption above 20 m3 is billed at 198 CFAF/m3.
For the econonic viability of the project, to cover operating costs, these tariffs would require a 30%
increase in 1998, a 10% increase in 1999 and 2000, a 20% increase in 2001, and a further 10% increase
in 2002. Given the high demand for water in the neighborhoods that will be supplied through this
project, the network is expected to remain fully utilized at the levels estimated in this analysis throughout
its thirty-year life. This addition to the network will increase the total capacity by 8,171,000 rn3 in
Bamako and 664,000 m3 in Mopt in 2002. Due to system leakage 20% of the water distributed is
assumed to be lost.
An estimated 275,000 inhabitants are to benefit from these works. The economic rate of return for the
water supply component is calculated by estimating the incremental benefits resulting from the new
water transmission and distribution network of this project.
Costs. The costs for this component are comprised of the capital investment costs and the incremental
operating costs. The incremental operating costs do not include indirect expenses such as depreciation,
taxation, and debt service. A four percent annual increase in operating costs is assumed until 2002,
when the system becomes fully operational.
Benefits. The benefits are the incremental revenue eamed from the sale of water supplied by the project,
which is a proxy for consumers' willingness to pay for water. It is assumed that without this project, the
distribution of potable water would remain at its current levels.
Results. The ERR for the project is estimated at 12% with a net present value of (60 million) CFAF
using a 12% discount rate (Tables 10.8 A and 10.8 B). This project component has other benefits such
as time savings, improved sanitary conditions. improved health, reduction in water-bome diseases such
as dysentery, cholera, and typhoid. These advantages will be observed for the water fountains to
improve living conditions in Bamako's poorest neighborhoods, as well as the connections in Bamako, and
the connections/water fountains in Mopti. Sensitivity analysis was tested for a 15% increase in
investment costs and total costs, a 15% decrease in production yield, 10% non-payment by subscribers
and for a two-year delay in implementation. The ERR's for these sensitivity runs range from 8 to 12%.
Risks. The main risk of this sub-component is the failure of EDM to implement the installation and
operation of the water supply network.. However, the ongoing investment to increase water treatment
capacity, financed by a credit of FF 50 million from the CFD demonstrates that EDM has the capacity
to successfully implement large physical works. Another risk is that a significant percentage of
customers will refuse to pay their bills. This risk is mitigated by the fact that EDM's commercial service
(billing and collection division), is currently implementing a system to detect non-payments in a timely

manner and institute a service shut-off within a short period of time, reducing the losses incurred by
unpaid bills. A final risk is the long-term financial viability of EDM being threatened by the inability to
raise tariffs to cover its expenses and to keep up with inflation. This risk can be minimized if the GOM
permits the utility to raise its water tariffs to cover operating costs and generate a reasonable return on
investment. Continued Bank supervision and governmental support is necessary to mitigate all the above
mentioned risks.
9.     Land Development for Housing Component
The land development for housing subcomponent includes two sites in Bamako: Baco Djikoroni
Sud financed by IDA, where 5,000 plots will be developed with sites and services and auctioned off by
ACI, and Yrimadio, where 5,000 partially serviced plots will be prepared.
Evaluation cntena. The benefits of these developments include better access by urban populations to
municipal and pnvate services (water, electricity, transportation), higher quality of housing, a greater
stake by local residents in the urban environment through accession to property, and savings in repair
and rehabilitation costs, due to less water damage with improved drainage and road works. Many of
these benefits may not be direcdy quantifiable, but are partially reflected through the differential of rental
values. The Baco Djikoroni site is to be developed without occasioning any displacement and re-housing
of local residents. The applied rate for annual operation and maintenance costs is 7% of the investment
cost. Anticipated benefits are measured comnpared to the differential of the estimated rental value of
these housing sites, with and without the project. Differential rental values are a proxy for estimating the
increase in the value of land wealth. An expected 50,000 inhabitants will benefit from this component.
Information on projected costs and benefits were either collected during the course of the
feasibility study, or projected on the basis of existing data (from the Bamako 10-Year Investment
Program). The results of these analyses are contained in the Projeat File.
Results. The results for the base case indicate a high level of economic justification for these works, with
an ERR of 43% in both sites. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, by changing investment and O&M
costs (+ 15%) and the benefits hypothesis (+10% Rental Value, -10% Rental Value). The results of the
sensitivity analysis result in ERR ranges of 13 to 56% for Baco Djikoroni and 15 to 55% for Yrimadio
(Table 10.9).

REPUBLIC OF MALI
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
IMPACT ENVIRONNEMENTAL
The Urban and Environmental Context
1.    In 1995, the urban population of Mali was 2.25 million, out of a total population of 9 rnillion. The
rate of increase for the urban population is about 5% per year, compared with 2.5% for the country as a
whole. By the year 2010, the urban population will probably be 7 million. Bamako currently has 900,000
inhabitants, and is likely to have 1.9 million by 2010, and the total for the country's other cities will
increase from 1.4 million to 2.5 million. Urban poverty is increasing at a rapid pace, and employment
opportunities are few. The resources of the 14 municipalities affected by the project are meager, as are
their financial and management capacities (i.e. human and physical resources), and this is true of both
Bamako and the secondary cities. The quality of infrastructure and superstructure varies greatly from one
city to another, and even from one district to another within the same city. The real estate market operates
unsatisfactorily, in spite of recent innovations by ACI (Agence de cessions immobilieres: the Land
Auctioning Agency). The environment is in a delicate condition in all of the cities, but the situation varies
from one city to another and from one district to another within the same city. The main damage to the
environment comes from the disposal of rainwater and from water-table pollution (particularly in Bamako
and Mopti). The lack of basic infrastructure is especially harmful to the poor, and affects public health. In
Mopti, there are frequent epidemics (of cholera and dysentery), with high morbidity and death rates.
Environmental Assessment
2.    Overall, the proposed project will have a very positive impact on the environment, because of the
nature of certain components (particularly water supply and sanitation), and the sustainability of project
activities resulting from institutional changes, the introduction of cost recovery, and training and awareness
programs. The environmental assessment was preceded by a diagnostic study of the impacts of the First
and Second Urban Projects, which had very positive effects on the environment in Bamako. The project
will have the following two main types of environmental impact: (a) on spatial aspects of the environment,
as a result of the components relating to the planning of housing land and to roads and drainage; (b) on
health, mainly due to the water supply component and the wastewater and solid waste disposal
subcomponents. The main issue in urban environmental problems is the behavior of the inhabitants in such
inadequately serviced cities, since they are mostly from rural backgrounds and eam low incomes.
3.    The main project impacts can be summarized as follows: (a) pressure on natural water resources,
since the population is accustomed to drawing its water supply from the aquifer via wells; (b) disruption of
natural water flows by the construction of roads; (c) direct water supply from shallow boreholes in three
districts of Bamako; (d) risks to water in transport stations and marketplaces resulting from the proximity
of technical or health facilities, and risks to water due to the dumping of used motor oil. The project will
combine public health activities with the management of the urban environment through the following
measures: (i) upgrading of certain environmental activities such as water supply in Bamako and Mopti-
Sevare, the strategic sanitation plan for Mopti-Sevar6, and the strategic solid waste management plan for



104                                 Annex 11
Page 2 of 7
Bamako; (ii) awareness programs with regard to the urban environment at national and local levels (i.e. in
municipalities and communities), and preparation of a sanitation strategy for Bamako; (iii) where necessary,
mitigation of certain effects of project subcomponents (i.e. urban roads, marketplaces, and transport
stations), together with improvements in environmental quality whenever possible, particularly in the
subcomponents relating to roads and the trading infrastructure.
Mitigation Measures
4.     The mitigation measures planned in the project concem the following five types of action, which are
detailed in the attached table:  (a) the inclusion in subproject implementation studies of detailed
environmental assessments and mitigation measures, regardless of the other environmental studies provided
for in the project, which include the strategic plan for the management of solid waste in Bamako and toxic
pollution from industries in Bamako, and the environmental enhancement of historic sites and settlements;
(b) capital investment for the improvement of the environment, such as drainage, landscaping, the protection
of outfall areas of drainage channels in the Niger River, etc.; (c) very widespread, ongoing training and
awareness programs at all levels, particularly in individual city districts, and training of trainers;
(d) institutional measures for preventing the construction and use of wells, and establishment of consultation
and monitoring mechanisms in Mopti and Bamako, with representatives of the Government, communities,
users, and service providers; (e) a monitoring and supervision plan, with all relevant indicators, including
health. Providing for mitigation measures and their monitoring and supervision will require a budget of
about US$600,000, and this is included under the "Studies" subcomponent of the water supply component.
The Institutional Framework for Environmental Management
5.    In principle, the main partners will be those parties most directly concerned with the problems in
the field; namely, the Secretaries General of municipalities, and the technical staff of other bodies, i.e.
AGETIPE, EDM (Energie du Mali), DNHPA (the National Directorate of Public Health and Sanitation),
DNHE (the National Directorate of Water Resources and Energy), and ACI (the Land Auctioning Agency).
MUH (the Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing) will play a leadership role through the Project
Coordination Unit. As regards legislative and regulatory aspects, and although the use of this latter type of
mechanism must be approached with great caution (since it is difficult to operate and its effectiveness
cannot be taken for granted), close links must be maintained with operations at national level (i.e. the
NEAP), in order both to draw lessons from them and to increase staff awareness, particularly with respect
to the experience acquired as the project progresses. Environmental activities will have to be coordinated,
and the Project Coordination Unit should assume this role, or else delegate it to one of the partners referred
to above, provided that the one selected is motivated and concemed. Every year the environmental aspects
of the project must be reviewed and a report issued containing a certain number of monitoring indicators.
This would be done in parallel to the work performed on the basis of the urban data prepared using the IPE
(Inventaire pour la Programmation des Infrastructures et Equipements: the Infrastructure Planning
Inventory). Such indicators could relate to health (e.g. pollution and epidemiology) and also public
infrastructure, with reference to health (water supply, sanitation, drainage, and clinics) and socioeconomic
issues (marketplaces, transport stations, and schools). In this latter case, the IPIE should be used (i.e. the
urban database and indicators of individual infrastructure).
