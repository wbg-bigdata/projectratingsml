MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:  Program Completion Report on the Kingdom of Morocco Structural
Adjustment Loans I & n (Loans 3001-MOR and 3463-MOR)
Attached is the Program Completion Report for the Kingdom of Morocco Structural Adjustment
Loans I & I (Loans 3001-MOR and 3463-MOR) prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office. Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
The PCR gives an adequate account of Morocco's adjustment experience. The two SAL. were an
integral part of the country's comprehensive economic reform program, which was supported by several IMF
standbys and by nine adjustment operations from the Bank, for a total of US$1.8 billion between 1984 and
1992. SAL I was the seventh operation of the nine; SAL U was the last one and was approved more than two
years after SAL I had been closed.
By the time the SAL I program was launched in 1988, reforms were well underway in several sector
and major macroeconomic disequilibria had already been corrected. Thus, the two SALs could be focussed
on a handful of remaining weaknesses in the reform process with reatively few and simple conditions
attached. The goals of the SALs were to increase growth, to strengthen creditworthiness and, more especially
in SAL U, to achieve a more equitable distribution of welfare. The focus of the action programs was on fisal
reform, public investment efficiency and private sector development, trade liberalization, external debt
management and the articulation of a poverty reduction strategy.
Solid ownership of the overall reform program and a circumscribed set of conditions contributed to
the smooth implementation of the SALs. In terms of outcomes, the SALA contributed significantly to fiscal
reform and to further trade liberalization, and they helped restore Morocoo's creditworthiness. Also, progross
was made towards laying the basis for addressing social issues in earnest. On the other hand, targeted
increases in public investment spending in priority sectors were not achieved and the overall GDP growth rate
fell much below expectations. On balance, the outcome of the SAL. is ratod as satisfactory and the
sustainability of the reform process as likely. The institutional impact of the SAI was modest.
Morocco's decade-long adjustment process has resulted in remarkable improvements in
macroeconomic indicators, combining successful stabilization with modest growth. Yet, the growth rate has
been too low to remedy the unemployment problem and has been lower in the post-1988 SAL period than in
earlier years. Industrial growth has been especially disappointing. The SAL. will be audited by OED with
special attention to these issues.                                 1      /

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOANS I AND II
(LOANS 3001-MOR and 3463-MOR)
PREFACE
The first Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) to Morocco was approved by the
Board on December 1, 1988 for an amount of US$ 200 million. The loan was closed on
schedule after the whole amount of the loan was disbursed by the closing date, December 31,
1989.
The second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL II) to Morocco was approved by
the Board on April 30, 1992. The loan was closed on schedule after the whole amount was
disbursed by the closing date, December 31, 1993.
This Program Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Country Operations
Division of the Middle East and North Africa Region (MNICO) (Parts I and III) and the
Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during March 1994. The basic information
is drawn from the President's Reports (P-4867-MOR) and (P-5637-MOR), the loan agreements,
supervision reports, internal Bank papers and documents provided by the Moroccan authorities.
The report has also benefitted from numerous discussions with IMF and Bank staff members
who have been involved in the Moroccan adjustment program.

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOANS I AND II
(LOANS 3001-MOR and 3463-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.          Morocco's adjustment program began in earnest in 1983 with the onset of the
financial crisis.  After nearly two decades of conservative economic management since
independence in 1956, the boom in phosphate prices during 1975-1977 increased export revenues
substantially and led to an unprecedented expansion of government expenditures. This signalled
the beginning of a new era and an end to the conservative fiscal policies of the past. However,
the boom in phosphate prices was short-lived. The ensuing terms of trade reversal, the second
oil shock, and the increase in international interest rates led to the fiscal crisis of the eighties.
2.          During the period leading up to the need for reform, Morocco's external debt
grew dramatically from US$ 1.8 billion in 1975 to US$ 13.4 billion in 1983 with an increasing
proportion being owed to commercial banks. By 1982 Morocco's external and budget deficits
had both reached around 12% of GDP. With the increase in international interest rates,
combined with a prolonged drought during the early eighties and a decline in the productivity
of public investment, Morocco could not shoulder its debt service burden. The debt to GDP
ratio had reached 96% and the debt service ratio had reached almost 40% in 1983. It was now
apparent that a comprehensive program of economic reform was needed.
3.          Morocco's reform program consisted of stabilization measures on the fiscal and
monetary front combined with structural adjustment measures in trade, industry, agriculture, the
public enterprise sector and education to promote a supply response in the economy.
Macroeconomic imbalances were addressed by reducing government expenditures including
public investment. Improvements in the terms of trade, appropriate exchange rate policies and
trade liberalization, as well as improvements in weather conditions led to better performance in
GDP growth and in the current account. Structural reform facilitated trade and helped boost
non-traditional exports. In addition, a series of debt rescheduling agreements with both official
and private creditors reduced its outflow of resources. Thus, by the time the SAL I program
was launched, Morocco had already undergone a period of extensive reform. During this
period, it was aided in its efforts by several stand-by arrangements with the Fund as well as by
a number of sectoral adjustment loans from the Bank. These loans prepared the ground for
SAL I.



'V
4.          The SAL I program was initially seen as the first of two or three macro-economic
adjustment operations which would be needed in Morocco in addition to various sectoral
adjustment programs. It was launched to help Morocco continue its long-term adjustment efforts
with the goals of improving Morocco's creditworthiness and of increasing growth through higher
and more efficient investment. A number of measures were taken on the fiscal/ budgetary front
to improve revenue collection and to increase government investnment in key areas. These
measures along with trade liberalization and measures taken to improve debt management were
also to improve Morocco's creditworthiness. The elements of the SAL I program complemented
the government's own vision and efforts, the requirements for second tranche release were few
and simple, and thus the program itself was implemented successfully. Continued reschedulings
and external support also helped the authorities in reaching their macroeconomic goals. The
whole amount of the loan was disbursed and it was closed on schedule.
5.          However, Morocco's average growth rate in the post SAL I years did not increase
but rather, declined from an average of over 5% during 1985-1988 to under 2% during 1989-
1993. While a great deal of the variability in GDP growth stems from the variability in
agricultural value added, the average growth rate for non-agriculture GDP also fell from 4 % to
3% in the same time period. It is difficult to isolate the SAL I program's direct effect on
growth given the importance of past policy actions and exogenous factors. While Morocco's
creditworthiness depends on a variety of factors not directly related to the SAL I program,
budgetary reform, trade liberalization, and the measures undertaken to improve information
management on foreign debt helped to improve Morocco's attractiveness to external creditors
and debt management. The most important contributions of the SAL I program however, have
been the impetus provided for further trade liberalization and the emphasis on fiscal reform
which led to a revamping of the tax structure in Morocco. The Bank played an important role
in these two areas without which reform would probably have been slower.
6.          An innovative feature of the SAL I program was the adoption of a set of
macroeconomic targets that were to be monitored during the program. Deviations from these
targets were supposed to trigger policy discussion with the Bank and possible corrective action.
While many of these macroeconomic targets were met in practice, their usefulness is
questionable in the context of Bank SALs whose duration is generally very short. First, the
indicators were mostly a set of endogenous variables, not within the government's direct control.
Divergence from these indicators in the short run may not even be a reflection of government
policy, but of other factors. In addition, these variables were subject to a great deal of
measurement error and they are betters indicators of the direction of government policy over the
long run rather than as tools to be used for fine tuning the economy. Second, even when
divergences are due to government policy it is hard to separate out the effect of previous versus
current policies as well as the effect of exogenous factors. Also, these indicators did not fonn
part of Bank conditionality in Schedule 4 of the loan agreement and thus were not binding on
the government.



7.          Though SAL II was approved over two years after the first SAL closed,
discussions with the government continued on various reform issues. In parallel, a SECAL for
the financial sector was approved in the intervening period. The SAL II program had a
somewhat different focus from that of SAL 1. While the goal of increasing growth remained,
the Bank put more emphasis on private sector development and poverty alleviation than it had
in the SAL I program. Morocco's debt problem and the issue of international creditworthiness
had been resolved by continued debt reschedulings in 1990 and 1992 at the London and Paris
Clubs, and by continued macroeconomic stabilization and trade liberalization.  Like its
predecessor, the SAL II program was implemented successfully. The whole amount of the loan
was disbursed and the loan was closed on schedule.
8.          Along with trade liberalization and continued macroeconomic stabilization, SAL
II also aimed to protect core investments in the economy and to provide public investment
complementary to private investment to achieve its growth objective. It is too soon to estimate
the beneficial effects on growth of the SAL II investment program, which targeted infrastructure
and social programs. As long as investments in key sectors are maintained the growth effects
could be positive. The SAL II program also played an important role in pushing for greater
private sector involvement in areas traditionally reserved for the government in Morocco.
Another major contribution of the program was in focussing the Moroccan government's
attention on the issue of poverty alleviation. The Bank worked with the authorities to establish
a database on the poverty situation in Morocco through the Living Standards Measurement
Survey (LSMS) and various studies, and on the preparation of a strategy for poverty alleviation.
9.          The SAL II program contained a set of targets that were to be monitored during
the program that included not only the macroeconomic ones used in SAL I but also a set of
indicators for the social sectors. The relevance of the indicators used for the social sectors are
also debatable since they were not all monitorable on a timely basis and their selection did not
achieve the desired objective of targeting the poor. Given that a detailed analysis of the social
issues was undertaken, and that a strategy for poverty alleviation has been developed in
consequence, these targets for the social sectors did not add much to the SAL II program.
10.         In conclusion, the two structural adjustment loans of the Bank, SAL I and SAL II,
were implemented successfully though they did not meet all their objectives. SAL I played an
important role in promoting further trade liberalization in Morocco, and in reform of the
budgetary/fiscal system. The program also helped, along with Bank technical assistance, to
improve debt management in Morocco. However, average growth in the post SAL I years was
actually lower than in the pre-SAL I years. The SAL II program reflected the Bank's changing
priorities in Morocco as it emerged from its financial crisis yet continued with low growth: it
played a crucial role in focussing government attention on poverty alleviation, continued trade
reform, private sector development, and investment in the social sectors to enhance long term
growth. The fact that Morocco's reform program had started five years before the first SAL
was approved, and that several Bank SECALs had been approved in the interim, meant that
reforms were well under way when SAL I was negotiated. It also meant that SAL conditionality



vi
could be more simple and thus easier to meet. The Moroccans already had a coherent vision of
their goals and the Bank complemented their reform program by highlighting crucial areas for
adjustment and by providing it with various instruments. Thus, borrower ownership, a well
established reform program, economic and political stability, relatively simple loan design, and
a productive relationship with the Bank made implementation of the SAL programs relatively
easy.

A. BACKGROUND
11.         From independence in 1956 until the mid-1970s, Morocco pursued relatively
conservative economic policies with investment growing slowly over the years and an annual
GDP growth rate of 4%. During this period, primary products, and particularly phosphates,
with which Morocco is substantially endowed, accounted for about 90% of merchandise exports.
A boom in phosphate prices during 1975-1977 which increased public sector revenues, led to
a substantial expansion of the public investment program. From 1973 to 1977 investment
expenditures rose from about 17% of GDP to about 34%. Defense expenditures related to the
Western Sahara conflict, also escalated.
12.         After the terms of trade reversal in the late 1970s, with phosphate prices falling
and oil prices rising, the increase in public sector expenditure was sustained by recourse to
external borrowing as was true of many developing countries during this period. This strategy
was encouraged by the availability of foreign financing at exemely attractive terms. During
this period, the budget deficit grew to reach about 13% of GDP in 1981 and 1982 and the
current account deficit reached 12%. Morocco's foreign debt grew from US$1.8 billion in 1975
to USS 13.4 billion in 1983. Total external debt was at 96% of GDP while the debt service
ratio was almost 40% in 1983. More than 60% of the debt was at non-concessional rates, with
over 40% owed to commercial banks (negligible a decade earlier).
13.         In view of the dramatic deterioration of the macroeconomic situation, a
stabilization program was launched in 1978 but was interrupted due to a severe drought and
social pressures. Another adjustment program was launched in the context of the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) of the IMF in 1980 but this program was also interrupted after food riots in



2
Casablanca. Government expenditures had now reached 37% of GDP. During 1980-81 the
Bank attempted to negotiate a SAL program; however this effort failed. The high debt stock and
the interest rate increase in the early 1980s, both combined with a severe drought in 1980-84,
brought about a debt crisis in early 1983 with interest payments alone accounting for 20% of
exports and with no access to commercial borrowing.
14.         In response to the financial crisis, the Moroccan authorities began a program of
comprehensive economic reform strongly supported by its international partners, and a series
of reschedulings at the Paris and London Clubs, a process that was to last several years. During
1983 - 1992, this program was supported by seven Stand-by Arrangements (SBAs) with the
Fund, seven Sectoral Adjustment Loans (SECALs) and two SALs with the Bank (see Table 1).
The SECALS consisted of two loans for trade and industry (ITPALs I and II), two for
agriculture (ASAL I and II), one for public enterprises (PERL I), one for education (ESAL) and
one for the financial sector (FSDL). World Bank adjustment loans alone amounted to US$
1.065 billion. In addition to macroeconomic stabilization, the Moroccan reform program
consisted of a series of measures to liberalize and increase efficiency in trade and industry,
agriculture, education, and the public enterprise sector. In addition, restrictive monetary and
fiscal policies were employed to contain aggregate demand.

15.         Stabilization of public finances was achieved by cutting govemment expenditures
and particularly public investrnent. In addition, as oil prices fell, the governnent imposed an
oil levy which generated revenues of about 2.7% of GDP. As a result of these measures the
fiscal deficit fell from 12% of GDP in 1983 to under 5% in 1987 and 2% in 1993 despite large
interest payments on government debt. The decline in international petroleum prices, and the
rebound in agricultural production combined with demand management policies served to
improve the current account of the balance of payments substantially from a deficit of 12% in
1983 to under 5% in 1988 and 2% in 1993 (before debt rescheduling). In addition, GDP growth
during the period 1983-1988 averaged around 4.5% while inflation remained under 5%. The
striking improvement in macroeconomic indicators between 1981-82 and 1987-88 is shown in
Table 2 and Figures 1-4 (from pages 4 to 6).
16.         Structural reforms during 1983-1988 led to a more efficient productive sector.
The substantial reforms of the trade and industrial regime gave rise to productivity gains in
capital and labor and a shift in trade flows. ' By substituting quantitative restrictions with tariffs,
by eliminating anti-export biases, and by simplifying administrative procedures, total trade, and
particularly exports of
manufactured goods,

17.         As mentioned before, during the pre-SAL adjustment period, the Bank was heavily
involved in the Moroccan reform program. A number of studies conducted by the authorities
with Bank assistance enabled them to gain a good understanding of the economic issues. An
example of this is the three year study on indusial incentives and export promotion which was
initiated in 1979 and which served as the basis for the Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment

Loans (ITPAs). Fund and Bank programs complemented each other providing a good mix
between stabilization at the macro level supported by the IMF and structural, supply-response
enhancing, sector level reform supported by Bank SECALs. For example, trade and price
liberalization were harmonized with fiscal and monetary measures (so that a reduction in import
duties was associated with a reduction of the real effective exchange rate.) The negative impact
of lower trade taxes was compensated for by a gain in domestic taxes through the establishment
of a value added tax.
B(I THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY SAL 1
18.         The Bank SALs came in at the second stage of Morocco's adjustment process; the
SAL I program was designed to address weaknesses in the Moroccan reform program. While
macroeconomic stabilization had been largely achieved, the growth rate was still low. During
1983-88 macroeconomic stabilization had been achieved primarily by cutting govermnent
expenditures and particularly investment. The remaining adjustment came from a reduction in
expenditures  on  wages,
goods  and  services.            Frwo 2*: Dobt,wvW Rao 1I, d Gross. vrv2 1USD43

19.          Budgetary problems remained given the weak fiscal system leading to a substantial
build-up of domestic payments arrears. Structural weaknesses in the area of public finance had
at times slowed the pace of
reform (for example, the

impediment to  obtaining
external financing. Total
external debt remained at 94% of GDP, and the debt service to exports ratio at 26% in 1988.
The lack of foreign and public savings and the rise in domestic interest rates signalled the danger
of crowding out private sector investment. These weaknesses were an impediment to higher
growth in Morocco.
20.          Thus the two broad goals of the SAL I program were to increase the growth rate
and to improve creditworthiness. Since the deteriorating quality of the public capital stock
represented a constraint to attaining higher growth, raising the level and efficiency of public
investment  expenditures

mn IM to                              the adjustment program. It
aimed to do this by
targeting increases in a
core investment program

investment in areas crucial

Measures to be supported under the program served to lower marginal tax rates, improve the
allocative efficiency of the tax system, and to improve tax incentives for productive investment.
It also aimed to enhance the equity of the tax svstem and to raise collection rates. Trade
liberalization had already led to significant improvements in the incentive regime, though the
pace of liberalization had slowed somewhat in 1986 for fiscal reasons. The SAL program
continued this reform to provide clear pricing signals for investment and production decisions
and also to enhance government credibility in the area of trade reform.
21.         As the external debt burden continued to be formidable, the elaboration of a
robust debt management system was warranted to monitor the complexities of the rescheduling
arrangements of the past, inform policy-makers as to the relative merits of different restructuring
options, and enable the formulation of a strategy governing external debt policy in the future.
The SAL provided the institutional reforms and technical assistance necessary for the
implementation of such a system.
C() EVALUATION OF SAL I
22.         Overall the SAL I program in Morocco was completed satisfactorily. The success
of the program is evaluated by considering the objectives of the Bank's program, the areas of
intervention chosen by the Bank and the specific policy tools targeted. In this context, the
following issues are examined:
(i)    Were the SAL-related requirements including the conditionality implemented as
envisaged?;
(ii)   Was the conditionality appropriate in terms of the stated objectives of the SAL
and in the context of the overall reform program of the government which the SAL was intended
to support? Did the conditionality achieve the intended goals?;
(iii)  Were the economic indicators chosen to monitor overall compliance with the
program the most suitable? What was the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy?;
(iv)   What was the effect of the external environment-- did it facilitate/ make it more
difficult to meet the goals outlined in the SAL program?
Each of these issues will be discussed in turn in the context of the overall macroeconomic
situation of the economy. This section will conclude with a summary of the strengths and
weaknesses of the program and the lessons to be learned from it.



23.           As mentioned previously, the two stated objectives of the policy reforms
comprising SAL I2 were to (a) increase growth through higher levels of more efficient
investment  and   (b)  to
strengthen    Morocco s
creditworthiness   while                       Figure 5: Govemment Revenu, and Expenditure

objectives were divided
between the conditions of
Board presentation (release of first tranche) and the conditions of second tranche release in the
following manner:
(a)           Conditions of Board presentation: (i) public investment: simplification of
budgetary management policies and systems, rationalization of public investment programming
including agreement on the contents and level of the target investment program for 1988-89; (ii)
fiscal system: revision of corporate tax rates,adjustment of the VAT on selected commodities,
presentation of a more equitable personal income tax to Parliament, and the promulgation of
investment codes; (iii) trade liberalization: the elimination of import licensing requirements on
over 500 products, the repeal of exchange restrictions on foreign investments, and the
strengthening of the export insurance scheme; (iv) external debt management: elaboration of an
action plan establishing an external debt management system in collaboration with the Bank.
(b)           Conditions of Second Tranche Release: (i) public investment: implementation of
the Target Investment Program (TIP) by ministry for 1988 and beginning 1989, and preparation
of an action plan (including implementation timetable) satisfactory to the Bank for the interface
between budgetary management information systems of all relevant ministerial departments; (ii)
fiscal system: approval by the Council of Government of the draft law instituting a national chart
of accounts, as well as a regulatory framework pertaining to the accounting profession; (iii) trade
liberalization: repeal of import licensing requirements on products corresponding to at least 120

tariff positions, and preparation of a circular satisfactory to the Bank for the simplification of
the customs nomenclature and tariff structure; (iv) external debt management: publication of a
circular satisfactory to the Bank mandating the registration of all external financing agreements
on public and publicly guaranteed debt.
(c)         In addition, continued macroeconomic stabilization was considered essential to the
growth objective and to the resolution of the debt problem.
(i)         Implementation
24.         In terms of actual implementation of the loan, SAL I was a success. The
government met the conditions for Board presentation of the loan as well as those for second
tranche release, largely within the expected time frame. The loan was fully disbursed and closed
on December 31 1989. Cofinancing of 13 billion Japanese Yen was provided by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, and of approximately US$ 140 million by the African
Development Bank.
(ii)        Achieving the Objectives
25.          Macroeconomic Stabilization: The macroeconomic situation was good in 1988
with GDP growth at over 10%. The budget deficit was reduced and the current account attained
a surplus. However, the situation in 1989 (the year the second tranche of SAL I was disbursed)
was worse than projected with GDP growth at 2.5%, an increase in the budget deficit and a
large increase in the current account deficit. In 1990 all three indicators improved though the
improvement in GDP growth was not sustained. Inflation was very low in both years at
under 3%.
26.          Growth: Elements of the SAL I program that were expected to affect the growth
objective were the TIP, fiscal reform and trade liberalization. The TIP, which increased
investment in the social sectors and in infrastructure and other measures related to public
investment were designed to improve the efficiency of public investment by reallocating
investment between sectors.  Only six ministries were included to facilitate monitoring.
Increased investment in infrastructure, by being complementary to private investment was to
raise overall growth. Investment in the social sectors was to improve the productivity of labor
and thus the economy's growth potential. As a result of the SAL I program investment in key
sectors did increase as there was a reorientation of government priorities; thus, we can say that
the intersectoral efficiency of government investment probably increased.3
27.          The TIP, which accounted for 2.4% of GDP in 1987 was to rise to 3% in 1990.
Government fixed investment accounted for 4% of GDP in 1987 and 4.5% in 1990. Thus the
3/However, the TIP did not address the issue of the efficiency of government investment within sectors. The
oveall efficiency of investment depends on both.



9
TIP accounted for about half of central government investment. The data show that total
investment in the economy was higher in 1989 and 1990, during the SAL years. Central
government fixed investment only rose by less than half a percentage point-- most of the increase
in investment was due to an increase in private sector (including public enterprise) investment
Thus the TIP which was to have increased central government investment by almost 1 % of GDP
did less in affecting its magnitude.  In addition, the data show  that average government
investment was in fact higher before the program years (5.4% of GDP in 1985 and 4.8% in
1986) than after (4.4%  in 1990, and 4.5%  in 1991). Private sector investment however, rose
in 1989 (18.4% of GDP) and 1990 (19.5% of GDP) in comparison with 1985-1988 (when it
averaged 16.7% of GDP).4 This seems to suggest that the TIP was not a particularly ambitious
program in that it did not increase investment a great deal.'
28.          The effect of the public investment program on growth since the program years
is difficult to assess. Apart from the fact that the effects of investment are often not obviously
discernible in the short run, other policies and exogenous factors play a role in determining GDP
growth. The latter effects may outweigh or obscure the effects related to increased investment
by the public sector. In fact, the average growth rate of real GDP in Morocco during the years
1985-1988 was 5.6% while the average for 1989-1992 was 2%. This variability was due to the
agriculture sector since the early nineties were very bad years while 1988 was a very good year
for agriculture. In addition, some of the (productivity increasing) effects of investment,
particularly in sectors such as education and health will take longer to show.
29.          In sum, though the targeted public investment program increased government
investment in some sectors of the economy, overall central government investment increased less
than envisaged. It is not possible to discern the long-run growth enhancing effects of the
program; in addition, the efficiency of investment within sectors has not been evaluated though
the efficiency of public investment in terms of choice of sectors was directly affected by the
target investment program. It is interesting to note that the (post SAL I) 1990 investment budget
was cut by 16% across the board, with no distinction being made between core and non-core
investments. This raises the question of how committed the government was in achieving SAL
I objectives vis a vis the TIP: if reforms are not sustained they will not have the long-term effect
desired. The SAL I program also excluded some ministries to facilitate monitoring. This
implies that the TIP (and the associated conditionality) was an important first step in improving
public sector investment but a more extensive program including public enterprise investnent
is probably necessary. Given the lack of separate published accounts for private and public
4/Though private investment rose it is not clear that this was the result of an increase in complementary public
investment so the increase cannot be attributed to more efficient public investment.
5/Note that only a fraction of what appeared in the public investment program (PIP) was executed,which
complicated the monitoring of the PIP. Thus by choosing a TIP, monitoring was made possible and the
essential investment needs of six ministries were protected.



10
enterprise investment the establishment of a consolidated, readily available database for public
enterprise and private investment should probably have been part of the SAL I program.
30.         The reform of the fiscal system undertaken in the context of the SAL I program
was essential to efficient public sector revenue management. Improvements on the revenue side
of budget management are crucial if the government is to undertake essential investment without
crowding out the private sector or resorting to inflationary financing. In this sense, fiscal reform
was complementary to the goal of increasing public investment in the context of macro-economic
stabilization. The reforms on the fiscal side to improve revenue collection and to lower the
corporate profits tax rate in the context of the SAL I program probably had a positive effect on
private sector investment. In the context of a sound macro- policy, the indirect effects of
improved revenue collection would be to reduce the crowding out effects associated with
recourse to domestic debt financing, while the effects of a lower profits tax are obvious. The
modification of the existing investment codes was meant to rationalize investment incentives and
reduce intersectoral disparities in the investment code both for revenue enhancing reasons, and
for increased efficiency in investment.
31.         The Bank played an important role in pushing for further trade liberalization in
the context of the SAL I program. Trade reform had resulted in an increase in export earnings
(including workers remittances) from 23% of GDP in 1980 to 32% in 1985 but since 1985
earnings have stabilized between 28% and 32% (see Figure 6). Further, trade liberalization was
expected to enhance export growth and by promoting private sector development, increase
investment and growth in the long run. Though it is not possible to quantify the impact of trade
liberalization on growth at this stage, this program was complementary with the other aspects
of the reform program.
32.         I m p r o v i n g
Creditworthiness: The other                       nhd asaOP)
major objective related to the
SAL program was improving
Morocco's creditworthiness in
the international market. One
aspect of this was improved
external debt management.         so ;                     FS
To this end, the Government
of Morocco committed itself                                 oa
in the context of the SAL to
the establishment of a debt o
management system  which           *0 81 82 13 96 65 86 97 88 89 90 91 92 93
would allow for a more
rigorous and reliable analysis
of the country's debt profile.
Under a plan of action formulated with Bank support, the Government undertook to establish



I1
a system of data collection, compilation and recording of all foreign public and publicly
guaranteed MLT debt public short term debt and private non guaranteed debt. As part of the
SAL, the Government published a circular instituting the obligation to register all public and
publicly-guaranteed debt contracts with the Treasury, as well as communicate all pertinent data
(commitments, disbursements, cancellations, amortizations and interest payments). It also
established a formal coordination committee among all agencies involved in the foreign
borrowing process.
33.         Better information management is a first step to improved debt management; thus
establishing a database was a priority. Discussions with government officials indicate that in
practice all external debt (public and publicly guaranteed) is currently registered. The process
of rescheduling through the Paris Club in 1990 in fact, not only aided Morocco by reducing debt
payments but also helped organize a great deal of the information available on debt. Thus other
exogenous developments plus Bank provided technical assistance in conjunction with the SAL
I initiatives helped improve the database on debt.
34.         However, what is equally important for debt management are the incentives for
borrowing from abroad and the ability of the economy to repay its foreign debt obligations. In
this respect, the overall structural reform program of the government has played an important
role since these two factors will be affected by the macroeconomic policies undertaken by the
government. For example, greater emphasis on investment and growth will increase the
country's ability to repay debt. Continued trade liberalization will, by increasing the openness
of the economy and by encouraging exports in the long run, have a positive effect on the
country's ability to service and obtain foreign financing. Rationalization of the investment code,
and the tax system should also help attract foreign direct investment and improve Morocco's
creditworthiness. Thus, better information management in the context of the government's and
the SAL program's overall policies (particularly the emphasis on growth of manufactured
exports) had a positive effect on debt management and the ability to repay foreign debt.
(iii)       Performance Targets Used
35.          A number of indicators were chosen to monitor progress during the SAL I
program. These were specifically: (a) the ratio of total gross fixed capital formation to GDP;
(b) the ratio of gross public and publicly guaranteed debt outstanding to total foreign earnings;
(c) the rate of real growth of manufactured exports; (d) the level of net foreign assets of the
Central Bank. The targeted figures were to represent minimum levels of performance;
significant divergence from the minimum targets were to be countered with remedial policy
action. These targets however, were not written into the loan agreement and were thus not
binding on the government. Macroeconomic performance was to be reviewed semiannually and
the indicators were to be used to assess the effects of policy reforms being introduced in the
context of the SAL. The values of the indicators for 1988 were reviewed before second tranche
release and those for 1989 were supposed to be reviewed before Board presentation of a second
SAL.



12
36.         The annual targets set in SAL I for 1988-92 were met in about two-thirds of the
cases as shown in Table 3. The target for the ratio of gross fixed capital formation over GDP
was exceeded in each year, the minimum value of the net foreign assets of the Central Bank was
exceeded in four out of the five years. The growth rate of manufactured exports was higher in
three out of the five years with the growth rate falling in 1991 and 1992. Public and publicly
guaranteed debt was almost on target.
37.         While macroeconomic progress and compliance with the SAL program must be
evaluated, it is difficult to choose a set of indicators that would accurately reflect the policy
stance taken by the government in the short run. The indicators chosen by the SAL I program
were mostly variables that were endogenous (not in direct government control like base money
for example), which are subject to fluctuations from exogenous factors, and the evolution of
which do not have much meaning in terms of signalling policy changes in the short run.
Therefore using these indicators to fine tune the economy (take corrective action) may not be
useful or feasible in the context of a SAL. In addition, when endogenous variables are targeted
(such as the real exchange rate), the control variables (such as aggregate demand management
and the nominal exchange rate) which must be managed appropriately to achieve the target, need
to be identified.
38.         In sum, the use of the performance targets as a signalling device before second
tranche release is questionable. For example, the growth rate of manufactured exports can be
affected by a number of things like aggregate demand management and the real exchange rate,
international economic conditions, and structural inefficiencies at the micro level. Real exchange
rate policy however, was not explicitly discussed in the context of the SAL. However,
estimations show that during 1980-93, 55% of the variance in the export to GDP ratio is
explained by variations in the level of the real effective exchange rate (REER).

39.           The ratio of total gross fixed capital formation to GDP is a good indicator of
investment trends in the economy. However, the SAL program focussed on the TIP directly and
on total investment only indirectly. While it is reasonable to monitor the growth rate of the TIP
(which is a government decision variable), the TIP formed only a small part of the overall
investment in the economy (11.4%  of overall investment in 1987).  Total public sector
investment could have been monitored. However, the SAL I program was designed to monitor
readily available data; since public enterprise data is presented jointly with private investment
data in Morocco, total public investment could not be easily monitored.
40.           As mentioned previously, an important element of the SAL I program could have
been to establish a database separating private and public sector investment. Readily available
separate statistics on private and public investment are essential in the formulation of the most
basic macroeconomic policy, particularly since they may respond to different incentives or have
differential access to resources. In addition, since the effects of government policy take place
over the longer run (there are lagged effects) any growth in the overall gross capital formation
figures probably reflected the effects of policies undertaken previously in the context of the
authorities' overall reform program. The investment indicator that the Bank used for monitoring
progress does show that overall investment, which was low compared to that in other comparable
countries, increased.

41.         A good indicator to use as a measure of a country's liquidity and ability to service
foreign debt is debt service over exports. The stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt was
chosen to signal any sudden jumps in the debt stock which would hamper Morocco's future
ability to pay. Given that future ability to pay also depends on interest rates and export earnings
among other things, perhaps these should have been taken into consideration too by monitoring
the debt service to export ratio. Even with no sudden jumps in the debt stock the debt service
ratio may rise signalling the onset of problems. In 1989 export earnings fell, mainly due to the
recession in Europe and the stock of debt increased-- both effects tending to increase the ratio,
whereas in 1990 the opposite occurred.
(Iv)        External Environment
42.         In the second half of the eighties phosphate prices rose so that Morocco's
(merchandise) terms of trade regained their 1980 level and were even 8% higher by 1989. At
the same time, oil prices continued to fall. These were both positive developments for
Morocco's budget and current account deficits. Also, rescheduling of external debt continued
during this period and official foreign creditors were willing to extend the necessary foreign
financing. These actions helped Morocco move closer to regaining its creditworthiness.
Agriculture performed very well in 1988, and moderately well in 1989 due to adequate rainfall.
This reduced the food import bill and had a positive effect on the trade balance.
43.         In conclusion, Bank conditionality was in general appropriate in the context of the
government's reform program. The target investment program represented a first step towards
increasing the efficiency of public investment, but represented a small proportion of total public
sector investment. However, a more comprehensive improvement in the allocation of public
sector investment would have been harder to implement and would probably have required more
time than was available in the context of the SAL. It would also have been harder to monitor.
Trade liberalization was an important element of the reform program and SAL I successfully
continued the work begun in the ITPAs. Tax reform was another area in which the Bank played
a pivotal role.
Lessons Learned
44.          SAL I was successfully implemented. The success of the program was probably
due to the following factors:
(i)         Timing: The Bank's first SAL came at a time when government reforms were
well under way and the authorities' overall reform program was obviously 'owned' and
sustainable (politically and economically). It also came after a series of sectoral adjustment
programs by the Bank. One of the reasons for this was that the Moroccan government was
organized around strong sectoral ministries which meant that it had been more efficient to build
a dialogue with the government through SECALS. In addition, several Fund programs were
simultaneously working on macroeconomic stabilization. This had helped establish the basis for



15
the implementation of an overall SAL which required significant inter-sectoral cooperation
among the ministries.6 The Bank often provides adjustment loans to countries that are at a less
mature stage in their reform program (sometimes with a less defined vision of their own ends)
which makes it harder to achieve success.
(ii)        Content: The conditionality of SAL I itself was politically feasible and
complemented the government's own vision.
(iii)       Content: There were few actions the government was supposed to take before
second tranche release, and these actions were simple. This is different from other loans where
the conditionality is sometimes overwhelming in its complexity, the sheer number of things that
the government is required to do before tranche release, and where the changes required are
more substantive. While this is an argument in favor of simplicity when designing loans, (i.e.
have few conditions), it must also be remembered that this was possible partly due to (i) above
and also that in some countries, conditionality that is not more extensive may have no impact.
For example, one of the conditions of second tranche release was the publishing of a circular
requiring the registration of public and publicly guaranteed debt. This condition was easy for
the Moroccans to satisfy whereas it did not assure implementation of the condition ex ante. In
many countries this may not be sufficient to ensure compliance.
D(D  PROCUREMENT. DISBURSEMENT AND MONITORING OF SAL I
45.         The conditions for withdrawing the proceeds of SAL I were similar to those
applied to other policy-based loans. The loan was administered by the Central Bank and the
Ministry of Finance. Proceeds of the loan were used to finance the full foreign exchange costs
(c.i.f.) of eligible imports procured after ICB. Ineligible items were those financed from other
sources, goods intended for military or paramilitary use and luxury items. Both public and
private sector imports were eligible for financing. Private sector contracts under US$ 5 million
each, including petroleum products, would be awarded on the basis of the nornal purchasing
procedures of the buyer, which are based on price quotations in international markets.
Procurement of petroleum products and foodstuffs were limited to an aggregate of US$ 50
million. Public sector imports under contracts below US$ 5 million up to an aggregate of US$
20 million were awarded in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to
the Bank. Contracts for all other goods were procured through ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
46.         Disbursements for contracts procured after ICB were made against appropriately
documented withdrawal applications. Disbursements against other items were made on the basis

of Statements of Expenditures from the Central Bank- detailing individual transactions in a riven
period, together with a certification of payment of the amounts involved and of their eligibility
under the loan.
47.         The total amount of the loan was withdrawn over a one year period. The second
tranche of the loan was disbursed as expected; second tranche release was approve(i on 18th
September 1989 and by October 10, 1989 the loan was fully disbursed. An initial audit report
for the loan was supposed to be prepared simultaneously with the one for SAL II. However,
this was not done. The program supported by SAL I was monitored by the Country Operations
Division of the Middle East and North Africa Department I of the MENA region.
B(II) THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY SAL II
48.         During the interval between SAL I and SAL II the Bank and the Moroccan
authorities continued a fruitful dialogue which included the approval of a sectoral adjustment
loan for the financial sector. Though total expenditures of the central government increased by
about 1 % of GDP from 1988 to 1992, government revenues increased more, as a result of a
series of measures undertaken to rationalize the tax system. In consequence, the budget deficit
continued to fall in the post SAL I period reaching around 2% of GDP in 1992. The current
account deficit fell from its level of 3.5% in 1989 to under 1% of GDP in 1990 but rose again
in 1991 and 1992 to around 1.5%. The real exchange rate remained stable during this period
while exports fell on average in 1991 and 1992.
49.   The outbreak of the Gulf war largely explains the slowdown of export growth and the
higher current account deficit in 1991. This came about as a result of an increase in Morocco's
oil import bill, a decline in its earnings from tourism, and a curtailment of its export market.
However, these negative consequences were outweighed by the generous compensation Morocco
received from the Arab states for its participation in the conflict. In 1991 Saudi Arabia forgave
Morocco's entire debt obligation of around US$ 2.7 billion. This was equivalent to almost 25%
of its Paris Club debt. In addition, Paris Club deals in September 1990 and February 1992,
saved Morocco approximately US$ 1 billion in 1990, US$ 900 million in 1991 and US$ 600
million in 1992. Gross foreign exchange reserves had reached five months of imports. These
developments on the external debt front prompted the government to target ambitious
macroeconomic objectives: convertibility and a balanced budget by 1993.
50.         Despite progress on the macroeconomic front and the substantial stabilization
achieved, Morocco still faced major challenges. There was concern that Morocco be aided to
achieve a viable balance of payments by 1993 and that the fiscal effort be consolidated and
strengthened in the second half of the 1990s when the commercial banks' rescheduled debt falls
due. Increased government savings and a sustainable budget deficit were crucial to ensure a
stable economy and to promote private sector development. In view of the growing rate of
unemployment in Morocco, higher private sector investment has become even more important
in that it was expected to help relieve the unemployment problem. GDP growth however,



17
continued to be low, declining from an average of 4.4% during 1983-88 to 2% during 1989-92.
Non-agriculture GDP growth remained constant during the two periods at around 3.6 %.
Achieving high growth was (and remains) particularly important given the high unemployment
rate reaching around 15% in urban areas. Though expenditure allocations for health and
education increased from 5.3 % of GDP in 1987-88 to 6.2 % in 1991-92 and the poverty situation
has improved considerably, Morocco's welfare indicators including child and maternal mortality,
nutritional status, access to safe water, and illiteracy remain much lower than those for countries
with similar per capita incomes.'
C(I) EVALUATION OF SAL 11
51.         The stated objectives of the SAL II program were to support the govermnent's
objectives of achieving higher growth, strengthening private sector development with higher
private investment, increasing external creditworthiness, and achieving a more equitable
distribution of welfare in the context of continued macroeconomic stabilization. To this end, the
interventions of the SAL II program were in the following areas: budgetary reform and private
sector development, trade liberalization, and the articulation of a poverty reduction strategy.
The specific policy tools in each area to meet the stated objectives were divided between the
conditions of Board presentation (release of first tranche) and the conditions of second tranche
release in the following manner:
(a)         Conditions of Board presentation: (i) private sector development and budgetary
reform: a real increase in the 1992 Finance Law for the six ministries targeted, discussion with
the Bank of reform proposal for investment incentives, submission to the Bank of TORs for a
study analyzing the areas where the private sector could intervene for the provision of public
services; (ii) trade liberalization: elimination of quantitative restrictions on 460 tariff positions,
implementation of a number of actions concerned with simplification of trade procedures,
reduction of the maximum customs duty to 40%, reduction in the number of tariff rates,
undertaking the first phase in the elimination of industrial reference prices, elaboration of
methodology to impose variable levies on agricultural products; and (iii)  erv reduction:
increase in investment by central and local governments in social sectors, monitoring of priority
indicators, preparation of TORs for a study on the impact of agricultural policy changes on the
revenue of low-income households, TORs for a study on the influence of public social spending
on low income households, and on the sources of vulnerability (including costs of safety net
programs) for low income households.
(b)         Conditions of Second Tranche Release: (i) Rrivate sector development and
budgetary reform: adoption of the 1993 Finance Law increasing investment credits at least 5%
in real terms for 1993 for the six ministries targeted, realization of the related investment
objectives for 1992, and submission to the Council of Government of the draft texts dealing with
71World Bank, "Kingdom of Morocco, Poverty Adjustment and Growth, ' Report No. 11918-MOR, January
1994.



18
reforn of the investment incentives system (rationalization of incentives to eliminate distortions
caused by different sectoral codes), completion of the study regarding private provision of public
services, increase in investment credits; (ii) trade liberalization: reduction of the maximum
customs duty to 35 %, eliminate all quantitative restrictions (except some products), elimination
of all industrial reference price, introduction of variable levies or other stabilization measures
for some agricultural products, implementation of mutually agreed measures aimed at improving
trade efficiency and logistics and implementation of other trade simplifying measures; and (iii)
poverty reduction: completion of a profile of the target population for the social strategy on
LSMS and other date sources, refinement of the monitoring system for social indicators,
development of a strategy for low-income households, increase in investment credits for health,
education and rainfed agriculture, based on study of low-income households done before Board
presentation, definition of policy and investment strategies, elaboration of a strategy for the
expansion of social services, examination of system of transfers to low-income households.
(i)         Implementation
52.         In terms of actual implementation of the conditions, SAL II can be regarded as
successful. The govermnent met the conditions for Board presentation of the loan as well as for
second tranche release mostly within the expected time frame. Cofinancing of approx. US$ 140
million was provided by the AfDB, and of 100 million ECU by the European Commission.
(i)         Achieving the Objectives:
53.         Macroeconomic Stabilization and External Creditworthiness: In terms of the
macroeconomic framework, which was consistent with the IMF's program, Morocco's priorities
remained to increase growth, improve its fiscal stance and attain balance of payments viability.
The Treasury's deficit was reduced to 1.7% of GDP in 1992 and to 2% in 1993. Monetary
growth slowed and inflation declined to 4.9%. Balance of payments viability was expected to
increase foreign direct investment and to help Morocco return to voluntary lending. In fact there
was a sharp increase in foreign direct investment and this coupled with the February 1992 Paris
Club rescheduling increased net inflows so that by 1993 Morocco's gross official foreign
exchange reserves which had been as low as the equivalent of one week of imports in 1985 had
reached half a year of imports. In early 1993 Morocco took the last steps in liberalizing the
exchange system for current account transactions.
54.         Growth and Private Sector Development: One of the main tools to enhance
growth was the Social Target Expenditures Program (STEP) (See Table 4). The SAL II policy
matrix defines the targeted increase in expenditures in the chosen sectors as the average yearly
growth rate in the three year period ending in 1993 and this was how these indicators were



19
monitored. Table 4 shows that these targets were not met in 1993.8 The public investment
program undertaken in the context of the second SAL targeted the same ministries as under
SAL I; a measure which allowed for continuity and ease in monitoring. In addition, greater
attention was paid to the allocation of current expenditures and to local communities. By
targeting a real increase in investment in the social sectors and in infrastructure, the SAL II
program like its predecessor was attempting to realign government priorities and thus increase
efficiency in public investment as well as improve the growth prospects for the economy by
investing in improvements in human capital and infrastructure. These objectives were sound and
the redirection of investment served a purpose. However, the Bank program could not ensure
that the use of funds within sectors was efficient; a factor that should be considered if the aim
is encourage growth in more efficient investment whether intersectorally or intrasectorally.
Also, the targets were defined as credit allocations in the Finance Law which made monitoring
easy; these may differ from the investments actually made.

1993 is given by: (I +.Ol*rl)(1+.Ol*r2)(1+.Ol*r3) = (I +.OI*c3)3.
55.           Budgetary measures undertaken under the SAL II program were also aimed to
promote private sector development and hence growth. Fiscal discipline was necessary for
macroeconomic stability and, by reducing crowding out of the private sector was expected to
encourage private investment.While the public investment program was to provide
complementary infrastructure to private investment, the SAL program included a study to
identify areas in which the government could disengage from the provision of services that could
be provided by the private sector.  However, it was agreed that the study which had to be
completed before second tranche release would not cover the problem of cost recovery.

dramatic.



20
56.            The study undertaken in the context of SAL II, by doing a sector by sector
analysis, has been very helpful in practice since it suggest definite areas in which the government
can begin taking action in rationalizing public expenditures and it also promotes positive
government action in favor of the private sector. However, it does not address the issue of
whether or not the private sector should/could enter activities the government is involved in that
are not identified by the study. A complementary approach would be to emphasize that the
policy and regulatory environment in all sectors is suitable for the development of private sector
provision. In this case, the assumption is that regardless of whether or not the government is
involved in certain economic activities, once the policy and regulatory system is "right" (the
right price incentives are there, there are no barriers to entry, contracts are enforceable, there
is enabling legislation, etc.), the private sector will automatically invest in profitable (or
potentially profitable) areas, and where the public sector is inefficient, replace it. In other
words, the "market" can identify areas where investments should be made.
57.          The investment codes in effect prior to the SAL II program provided for seven
distinct sectoral investment codes. This resulted in significant distortions in the incentive regime
and therefore in resource allocation. SAL II supported reforn of investment incentives to
promote efficiency in private sector investment by requiring that a draft text of a revised system
without distortions be submitted to the Council of Govermnent before second tranche release.
While this was done, the code was not required to be, and has not yet been, adopted by the
government.
58.          Continued trade liberalization and facilitation under the SAL II program consisted
of the elimination of all quantitative restrictions, reduction of the maximum tariff to 35% and
a simplification of the tariff structure, a simplification of trade related procedures, and reduction
of industrial reference prices to 10% of 1992 domestic industrial production. When the second
tranche of SAL II was released the average level of effective protection had been substantially
reduced. In addition, trade was greatly facilitated due to the simplification of customs and trade
procedures. These policy reforms were intended to reinforce past liberalization and to increase
growth by promoting exports. Since trade liberalization began in Morocco, exports have in fact,
increased. The fastest growth has been for manufactured goods and services -- the increase in
the growth of manufactured exports however, has been compensated by a decline in that of
phosphates and fertilizers. Though trade liberalization has brought about a diversification of
exports, sustained and high growth in exports has not been attained (See para. 69).9
59.           Povertv Alleviation: Another goal of SAL II was to aid the government in the
reduction of poverty in Morocco. To this end, three expenditure categories in the STEP with
long-term effects on poverty were identified and government spending (investment and non-
salary recurrent credits) was reallocated by targeting real increases for selected categories. Both
investment credits and real non-salary recurrent credits increased for the social sectors on the
9/Figure 6 showed the evolution of exports of goods and services in Morocco.



21
whole, but less than targeted. As mentioned before, Table 4 shows the investment targets and
actual expenditures. Real non-salary recurrent credits for health increased less than targeted in
1993. However, the share in basic education and health in recurrent credits increased by almost
I % to 4% of the non-interest recurrent budget during 1990-93.
60.          The shortfalls in social expenditures are compensated for if relevant parts of a
broad ranging DH 6 billion drought relief program launched by Royal Order in March 1993, as
well as the expansion of the public works employment program in non-irrigated areas are taken
into account. In addition, increases in expenditures were slow because the ministry of health
and education did not have the capacity to absorb the large increases of the previous years. In
1994, investment allocation for primary and secondary education remained frozen in nominal
terms, investment for health rose 25% and investment for defense 66%. It is interesting to note
that a World Bank financed study on capital expenditures by the Ministry of Education held the
view that the investment allocations had not been used efficiently.'" While the results of these
investments are not yet visible, a comparison of Morocco with other developing countries
(including five fast growing East Asian economies) shows that government expenditure on
education (5 % of GDP) is higher than the average for developing countries. This suggests that
it may not be the level of government expenditure in this sector that has constrained
improvements in educational attainment but rather the nature of expenditure/investment including
the distribution among different categories of education in at least this sector.'1
61.          As part of the poverty alleviation strategy of the authorities, the SAL program also
focussed on establishing a database on the poverty situation in Morocco. As part of the
preparatory work for SAL II the authorities implemented an ambitious LSMS. In addition, SAL
II supported the preparation of three studies which examined the relation between public policy
and three fundamental aspects of poverty: income, social conditions, and vulnerability to shocks.
These studies analyzed (a) the effect of public policy agricultural services (including rural
infrastructure) and pricing on the poor; (b) the effect of public expenditure in social services on
low income groups; (c) the effect of public transfer programs (including feeding programs and
public works) designed to provide a safety net for the poor on their income. To improve the
database, regular surveys with an expenditure or income component as a core module were to
be undertaken at intervals of about three years. A set of quickly available indicators providing
indirect information on both income and living conditions were collected and published
regularly. As a result of these studies a poverty alleviation strategy has also been developed by
the authorities with Bank assistance. Though the eventual goal is to implement such the strategy
to date no action program has been adopted.

62.          SAL II took the appropriate measures regarding poverty alleviation under the
circumstances existing in Morocco. At the time of preparation of the SAL II program, there
were no statistics on the poor allowing detailed analysis of the extent and the severity of poverty.
Neither had the beneficiaries of public expenditure in the social sectors been identified. Thus
government policies had not addressed the issue of poverty alleviation. SAL II aimed to reduce
poverty by (a) encouraging higher growth, and (b) first identifying and then using direct
measures to improve the condition of the poor (for example by improving access to health care
and education). The SAL II program thus played an important role in focussing government
attention on poverty alleviation though more attention should probably have been paid to the
beneficiaries of the increase in public expenditures for the social sectors. It also helped to
increase the efficiency of government expenditures in the social sectors through the studies (a)-
(c), and by creating a database which would allow targeting of social expenditures.
(iii)        Performance Indicators Targeted
63.          The SAL II program included two sets of indicators that were to be monitored
during the program and deviations from which were to be used as signals for possible remedial
action. The first set of indicators included the four macroeconomic targets monitored under
SAL I plus a new one: foreign direct investment. The second set contained some social
indicators, namely, (i) non-salary public recurrent expenditures per primary pupil, (ii) non-salary
public recurrent expenditures on health services, and (iii) the proportion of births attended by
health personnel in rural and urban areas. Most of the targets in the first set were met during
the SAL II program.'2
64.          Any shortfalls in the targets for 1993 were due more to exogenous factors rather
than to policy related causes. Table 5 shows the macroeconomic targets and realized values.
The recession in Europe was cited as the main cause of the shortfall in export growth in the
early 90s. Though the economic situation in Europe certainly had an effect on exports, perhaps
more attention should have been paid to the REER relative to Morocco's competitors. During
the SAL period both the REER and the export to GDP ratio remained fairly stable. Also, there
are indications that labor productivity in Morocco's competitor countries (Asia) has increased
more rapidly.'3 During the same period, the REERs of Malaysia and Indonesia depreciated

65.           The usefulness of the set of social indicators is even more debatable than that of
the first set.   Firstly, it is difficult to choose the "correct" three social indicators, i.e., those
that can accurately describe social conditions. Secondly, social change occurs over the longer
run; thus targeting three broad indicators has little meaning in the context of a SAL.14 Third,
setting a minimum level of non-salary recurrent expenditures for health and education may not
be the proper way to achieve the desired objective of reaching the poor. For example, in the
case of publicly provided health care, the main problem was the disparity in the proportion of
14/Note also that the indicators are based on credit allocations as defined in the Finance Law which may differ
from investments actually made.



24
public expenditure going to urban versus rural areas. About one third of total public health
expenditures was absorbed by the two university hospitals located in Rabat and Casablanca that
serve the higher income groups. Proposing an increase in health expenditures may have had no
effect no effect on poverty at all since it does little to ensure that rural access to health services
is improved. A recent study shows that the top quintile benefitted from 40% of the expenditures
of the ministry of health, while the 40% of the population at the bottom the income scale were
receiving less than 20%.'5 Elimination of poverty requires that the distribution of social
services provided by the government be skewed in favor of the poor.
66.          The indicators monitored were to correspond to existing budget categories to allow
easy monitoring. In the education sector SAL II aimed at the redirection of spending towards
primary education, and targeted an increase in budgetary allocations to this effect. However, it
is interesting to note that in Morocco the expenditure on primary education is not separated in
the budget from the expenditure on the first stage of secondary education.
67.          The third indicator relating to the proportion of births attended by health personnel
was not monitorable as required and implied by the SAL II program. Neither was it made clear
how this target was going to be met. Also, accurate data on births are only collected every five
years. According to the 1992 survey, 31% of births were assisted by health personnel, and 25%
by a nurse or midwife. From 1987-92 the proportion of assisted births had increased from
26%to 31% -- an average of 1.2% p.a., compared with a targeted 3.5% p.a. However, it must
be noted that during the SAL II period little attention was given to the social indicators because
of the LSMS and various studies that were being conducted. Staff felt that given the nature of
the detailed work that was being undertaken on the poverty situation in Morocco, little value was
added through the monitoring of the indicators chosen for the SAL II program.
68.          In addition to these indicators deemed to be under direct government control, four
indicators were to be monitored for tracking changes in welfare: (1) male/ female gross primary
education enrollment rates and primary completion rates; (2) number and percentage of children,
aged between 0 and 5 years seen in health facilities who suffer from moderate to severe
malnutrition; (iii) contraceptive prevalence rate; (iv) urban and rural unskilled wages; (v)
producer and wholesale prices for principal rainfed crops. Since most of these indicators evolve
only very slowly tracking them in the context of the SAL program did not seem to add value to
the program.
(iv)         External Enviromnent
69.          During the SAL II program there were some unfavorable developments. During
1992 a severe drought led to a 29% contraction in agricultural value added and a 3% real decline
in overall GDP. In addition, the recession in Europe continued to hurt export growth.

des Finances, Delegation de la Commission des Communaut6s Europeennes, 14 avril 1993.



25
However, tourism receipts recovered following the slump during the Gulf war improving the
current account deficit. The gains from the 1992 Paris Club rescheduling allowed further
reserve accumulation to five months of imports. The European recession and the drought
continued in 1993 so that GDP growth was almost nil and the growth rate of total exports was
slightly negative. However, the growth of direct foreign investment to over US $ 500 million
in 1992 and to almost US $ 600 million in 1993, was promising.
70.         In conclusion, SAL II continued with the emphasis on budgetary measures and
also helped the government to focus on social sector issues and to develop a poverty alleviation
strategy. Incentive structure reform continued with trade liberalization. However, the low
growth performance and low efficiency of government investrnent within the social sectors
signals the need for continued work in these areas.
Lessons Learned
71.         A number of lessons can be drawn from the SAL II experience in Morocco:
(i)         As was the case for SAL I, implementation was successful because the ground had
been well prepared for SAL II. The objectives related to the SAL II program were consistent
with the Moroccan government's goals.
(ii)        SAL II conditionality was simple and feasible in the given time frame.
(iii)       The use of social indicators did not add much to the SAL II program. The targets
used were either not monitorable in the given time frame, or were not targeted to the poor. The
indicators for tracking welfare did not have much meaning in the one-year context of the SAL.
(iv)        To affect change in social conditions, it is important to preserve continuity in
government policy. In this respect, the potential value added by SAL II which carried over the
emphasis on public investment in the social sectors from SAL I, could be high once the problem
of inefficiencies in investment in the social sectors is addressed. It remains to be seen whether
the government is truly convinced of the need to raise both the efficiency and the magnitude
of investment in these sectors.
(v)         The Bank can play a crucial role in the improvement of social conditions by
pushing for the establishment of the necessary database and by engaging in intensive dialogue
on social sector issues. In Morocco, the Bank's emphasis on these issues helped bring poverty
alleviation to the forefront of the Government's agenda.

D(I) PROCUREMENT AND MONITORING
72.         SAL II was carried out through three categories of procurement based on the
value or nature of the contract.  For contracts exceeding US$ 5 million simplified ICB
procedures were followed. Public sector procurement valued below the 1CB threshold were
carried out following the standard procedures of the purchasing institutions acceptable to the
Bank. Private sector purchases below the ICB threshold followed established commercial
practice; quotations from eligible suppliers from at least two countries were required. Special
procedures applicable to the respective commodity market were followed for procurement of
commodities traded in international commodity markets. These, however, did not preclude the
use of other channels of competitive procurement that offered better delivered prices. The
Borrower was also allowed to seek disbursements for imports under pre-existing contracts
(except sole source purchases) awarded through the above procedures.
73.         A total amount of US$ 275 million was withdrawn over a one and a half year
period. There were no problems with the timely submission of eligible documentation in
accordance with procurement procedures and disbursements were made smoothly. An initial
audit report for the project was carried out by the Inspection Generale des Finances in July
1993 and the auditor's report was unqualified. The audit report for the second tranche of SAL
was completed in June 1994 and has been received by the Bank. Implementation of the program
supported by SAL II was monitored by the Country Operations Division of the Middle East and
North Africa Department I of the MENA region.
CONCLUSION
74.         The Bank played an important role in Morocco's reform program which started
in 1983. It intervened first with a number of SECALs to prepare the ground for the two SALs
approved in December 1988 and April 1992. The SAL programs addressed key outstanding
issues in Morocco. Their main contributions were the emphasis on trade liberalization, reform
of the fiscal system and on focussing the government's attention and efforts on poverty
alleviation. Due to the Bank's and other donors' efforts in Morocco's adjustment process,
Morocco's external debt problem has also been resolved. The dramatic improvement in the
macroeconomic indicators on average is shown in Figures 1-4. However, growth continues to
remain susceptible to exogenous shocks (such as the weather, recession in trading partners and
regional tensions). Since 1989-94 GDP growth as well as export growth has been very low
averaging just under 3 %. As mentioned before, this has exacerbated the growing unemployment
problem in Morocco.
75.         The major challenges facing Morocco are (i) to increase long-run growth rates
with an export-based, outward oriented growth strategy, (ii) to achieve balance of payments and
fiscal sustainability in an era when net inflows to Morocco have diminished, (iii) to mobilize
domestic savings and private sector investment by focussing on financial sector development,
and (iv) to achieve improvements on the poverty and social fronts.

II. OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION OF SAL I AND SAL Il
SAL I and II were part of medium-term macroeconomic adjustment operations based on
sustained and durable growth. The loans sought to continue the adjustment efforts that had
begun in 1983, through a program of structural reforms affecting the budget, foreign trade and
industry, management of the external debt and formulation of a social development strategy to
improve the living conditions of low-income households.
The main medium-term macroeconomic objectives of SAL I and SAL I were as follows:
- faster growth of GDP;
- sustained reduction in the budget deficit compatible with the objectives of price stability
and investment fmancing at a reasonable cost;
- continued liberalization of foreign trade, supported by a flexible exchange rate policy;



28
- formulation of a forward-looking external debt management strategy;
- recovery of balance of payments viability in 1993 with a view to convertibility of
the dirham.
For the purposes of evaluating the performance of Morocco's economy during the
adjustment program, the following key macroeconomic indicators were identified and agreed
with the World Bank:
- total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in relation to GDP;
- gross public external debt in relation to foreign exchange earnings;
- real growth rate of manufactured exports;
- net foreign assets of the issuing institute; and
- direct foreign investment.
In addition, in the social arena, social indicators to assess the key determinants of living
conditions, such as wages and salaries, enrollment rates in primary education and the proportion
of births attended by public health personnel, were agreed with the Bank. Changes in these
indicators were to be tracked under SAL II.
II. SAL CONDITIONALITIES
The main components for SAL I and SAL II were as follows:
SAL I:            - budget policy reforms
- trade and industrial policy reforms
- policy reforms regarding management of the external debt.
SAL II:     - continuation of foreign trade reforms
- public finances
- social component.
A.   SAL I Conditionalities
1.    Rgarding budget policy
The reforms of taxation and investment included the following measures:



29
1.1   The fiscal measures aimed at improving the taxation system by broadening the tax base,
lowering rates and increasing equity.
The main measures that were to be taken in this connection involved in particular:
-     a reduction in corporate taxes (imp6t sur les societes - IS), with the introduction
of a minimum payment and earlier tax payment deadlines;
-     regulation of commercial transactions effected in cash;
-     increase in the national solidarity tax;
-     elimination of VAT exemptions for selected commodities and higher rates for
others;
-     submission of texts on the general income tax (IGR) to the Parliament;
-     [establishment of] a single taxpayer identification file (identifiantfiscal);
-     preparation of the general accounting standardization code and its submission to
the Parliament;
-     regulation of the accounting professions.
1.2  Investment: The measures relating to investment include:
-     inmproved budgeting procedures through a reform  of the credit carryover
procedure and introduction of the new nomenclature, so that the work programs
could be streamlined;
-     preparation of an action plan for the implementation of an integrated budget
information management system by the offices of the Ministry of Finance;
-     continued application of the principles established under the PERL with regard
to budget transfers to public enterprises;
-     revision of the current exchange risk system to limit the related costs to the
Treasury;
-     the establishment in 1988 and 1989 of the Target Investment Program for
investments to be made by the Ministries of Agriculture, Public Works,



30
Transport, Housing, Education, and Public Health. The TIP monitoring system
used 1987 as the base year. The main indicators were as follows:
*     total credits for 1988-90 (net of transfers to public enterprises, with the exception
of those to the Regional Agricultural Development Offices (Offices RWgionaux de
Mise en Valeur Agricole - ORMVAs) and the Casa Airport Office (Office des
Aeroports de Casa - OAC) were estimated at DH 19.3 billion in constant values;
*     total payments were expected to fall from DH 1.3 billion at the end of 1987 to
DH 0.9 billion at the end of 1990;
*     from 1988-1990, gross fixed capital formation under the TIP was to reach DH
14.4 billion;
*     the share of the TIP in GDP was to rise from 2.00% in 1987 to 2.80% in 1990
(DH 5.4 billion);
*     the share of investments by the Ministries of Health and Housing was to increase
from 6.4% in 1987 to 8.1% of the total TIP in 1990.
The TIP monitoring system also included other sectoral indicators, in particular the ratio
of CED [controleur d'engagements de depensel - approved commitments to total credits, the
commitment/payment ratio, etc.
2.    Trade and industrial policy reform
The planned reforms sought to rationalize the incentives structure, simplify the tariff
system and trade procedures, and promote exports and industrial investments. They involved
in particular:
- the elimination of quantitative restrictions;
- tariff reform;
- the launching of studies to improve the export environment;
- a study on the measures necessary for industrial expansion;
- preparation of a foreign trade law;
- simplification of international trade procedures.
3.    Extemal debt management police reforn
These reforms sought to improve external debt management and were to result in the
establishment of a formal coordination system to ensure the smooth running and tracking of the
external debt, along with the dissemination of a circular mandating the registration of all external



31
financing agreements on public and publicly guaranteed debt as well as private loans with terms
of more than one year.
B.    SAL II Conditionalities
1.    Continued foreign trade reforms: Beyond the adoption of the foreign trade law that
provides a legal framework to ensure even, moderate and equal protection, these reforms were
to include the following measures:
- tariff reform: This includes a gradual reduction in tariff items (quotites), reduction in
the maximum ad-valorem customs duty from 45% to 40% and ultimately 35%, and the
establishment of a protection mechanism;
- non-tariff restrictions: These consist of the elimination of all quantitative restrictions
on exports, with the exception of a negative list agreed with the Bank, elimination of all
industrial reference prices, except for 10% of the value of industrial production, and the
establishment of variable levies (prelevements) and other stabilization measures for agricultural
products and their derivatives: meat, milk, grains, sugar and vegetable oils;
- foreign trade promotion measures: These include essentially a study on the logistics and
efficacy of foreign trade, effectiveness of the single merchandise declaration (declaration unique
de marchandises - DUM), and finalization of documents other than the DUM, with a view to
the simplification and standardization of foreign trade procedures. Foreign trade promotion also
includes the effective implementation of the selective inspection of containers with a view to
reducing port transit time as well as the acceptance by Morocco of the GATT system for
determining the customs value.
2.    Public finance: The actions to be undertaken were as follows:
- Investment expenditures by the State and local communities were to satisfy needs in
economic and social infrastructure necessary for development of the private sector. In this
regard, the 1992 and 1993 finance laws were to include an annual increase of 5% in real terms
of investment credit for the six ministries: Agriculture, Transport, Public Works, Education,
Public Health and Housing. These growth rates were average minima for 1990-93, calculated
retrospectively.
- The draft texts on the investment incentive system reform were to have been submitted
to the Council of Government before the disbursement of the second tranche of the loan;



32
- A study on the possibilities of reducing budgetary charges for selected public services
that could be provided by the private sector'.
3.    Social Component: The actions decided on included:
- joint determination with the Bank of the profile of the target population for the social
strategy based on the National Household Living Standards Survey (Enquete Nationale sur le
Niveau de Vie des Menages - ENNVM) and other sources of data;
- improvement in the system for monitoring social indicators;
- development of a social development strategy for low-income households;
- evaluation of the functioning and rates charged by SEGMA hospitals and the possibility
of expanding and improving the system;
- public expenditures for health care should improve the efficiency of the existing
infrastructure through an increase, in real terms, of at least 15% for 1992 and 1993 in budget
allocations for "equipment and miscellaneous" and "investment" by the Ministry of Public
Health;
- an increase of at least 10% in real terms of investment outlays and at least 15% in real
terms of non-wage operating expenditures per student for 1992 and 1993;
- increase of at least 5% in real terms in 1992 and 1993 of investment outlays for rainfed
agriculture;
- the carrying out of the following three studies:
study of the impact of public social spending on low-income households and the
possibilities of cost recovery in the social sectors;
*     study of the effect of agricultural policies on the income of low-income households;
*     study of the sources of vulnerability of low-income households and the adequacy and cost
of the various social protection programs.

IV. EVALUATION OF ACTIONS CARRIED OUT UNDER SAL I AND SAL n
A.   Macroeconomic evaluation
With a view to remedying a difficult situation from the financial standpoint, since 1983
the Moroccan authorities have been following an adjustment and economic restructuring policy
characterized in particular by financial rigor.
The economic policy adopted in this context meant measures to reduce total demand, with
a view to shrinking the deficits in the budget and the current account of the balance of payments,
along with measures to increase total supply, the efficiency of public and private enterprises and
export capacity.
The actions undertaken as part of the adjustment policy helped reduce the total Treasury
deficit, which fell from 12% of GDP in 1992 to some 5% in 1988. Likewise, the balance in
the current account of the balance of payments went from a deficit of 12% to virtual equilibrium
in 1988.
Although financial constraints made a significant recovery in the volume of public
investment impossible, the vitality of private investment nevertheless markedly increased total
GFCF beginning in 1989. The ratio of GFCF to GDP rose from 20.5% in 1988 to nearly 23%
on average in the following years.
Another of the constraints recognized just before the implementation of the SAL was the
sharp increase in external debt charges. Accordingly, the authorities, in conjunction with the
World Bank, targeted better management of the public debt. As a result, the outstanding balance
of the external debt was brought down from 2.9 times current receipts in the balance of
payments in 1988 to 2.5 times in 1993.
The period covered by SAL I and SAL n (1988-1993) was marked by unfavorable
domestic and external circumstances due in particular to the negative impact of the Gulf war and
the recession in the world economy, together with a slowdown in international trade and a
resurgence in protectionism, as well as by two successive years of drought (1992-1993), which
took a heavy toll on Morocco's economy.
Despite these adverse occurrences, thanks to the continuation and consolidation of the
adjustment and restructuring process, the balance of payments moved in a favorable direction,
despite the fact that rescheduling was ended and the dirham became convertible for current
international transactions as of January 1993.



34
Efforts to enhance balance of payments viability met with particular success with regard
to the promotion of manufactured exports, foreign private investment and the volume of external
assets. Thus:
1.    The annual growth in real terms in exports of manufactured products was some 13 % on
average between 1988 and 1993. Growth was admittedly higher during the period from 1988-91
(more than 19%) than from 1991 to 1993 (6%). This is due essentially to the sluggishness in
external demand during the second period in the wake in particular of the recession that was
more severe in the economies of partner countries. Nevertheless, the average rate of 13% is
largely higher than the average rate of 10% for commitments made under SAL I and SAL II.
2.    The deficit in the current account in the balance of payments was reduced substantially,
from an equivalent of 4.4% of GDP in 1989 to some 2% of GDP in 1993. Concurrently with
a reduction in the deficit of the current account, foreign investment increased on average in
dollars 35.2% on an annual basis between 1988 and 1993, rising from US$129 million in 1988
to US$584 million in 1993. Importantly, average growth for the period covered by SAL II was
39%, thus largely exceeding program objectives.
Given this favorable turn of events, the share of the current deficit in the balance of
payments financed by foreign investment flows rose from 22% in 1989 to 62% in 1991 and
114% in 1993.
3.    Lastly, the substantial increase in external assets represents a major qualitative
improvement in the balance of payments, since from US$523 million or the equivalent of one
month of imports of goods and services, the volume of foreign exchange reserves rose to
US$3.824 million in 1993, i.e. the equivalent of some six months of imports of goods and
services. These levels clearly exceed the objectives of SAL I and SAL II.
The total volume of foreign trade during the SAL program increased markedly, from
38% of GDP in 1988 to 40% in 1992.
Morocco's new trade policy, which makes the country's economy highly outward-
oriented, had a modest impact on foreign trade indicators . Thus, the ratio of exports to GDP
fell from 16% in 1988 to 14% in 1992. The average annual change in the total value of exports
did not exceed 4%. For the period in question, this unfavorable picture was due largely to the
poor sales of phosphoric acid, which was a main factor in the decline of exports by 5% over
1988 and the climatic conditions that prevailed throughout almost the entire period from 1989
to 1992.
With regard to the rate of economic growth, although the recovery of financial equilibria
and the bringing of inflation under control demonstrate that the objective of stabilization was
achieved, economic growth was nevertheless quite satisfactory until 1991, i.e. more than 5%



35
on average per year. However, this trend was cut short by the drought of 1992 and 1993 and
by the 1992 recession in Europe.

B.    Tax reform measures
1.    Corporate tax (IS)
1.1   Reduction in the tax rate
Corporate taxes were lowered as follows:
1988: from 45 to 40%;
1993: from 40 to 38%;
1994: from 38 to 36%.
1.2  Introduction of a minimum payment
The minimum payment for the corporate tax changed as follows:
1987: progressive schedule based on turnover, miscellaneous and financial eaniings as
well as grants and subsidies received:



36
0.30% for the tranche between DH 1 and DH 1,000,000
0.50% for the tranche between DH 1,000,001 and DH 10,000,000
0.75% for the remainder.
The minimum payment may not be less than DH 1,500 or greater than DH 100,000.
1990: retention of the same schedule with a raising of the ceiling to DH 150,000.
1992: introduction of a single 0.5% tax and elimination of the ceiling on the amount
due.
1994: the minimum payment in a deficit fiscal year is imputable to the tax surplus in
relation to the payment for the following fiscal year.
This credit can be made up to the third fiscal year following the deficit fiscal year.
1.3   Shortening of the tax payment deadlines
As of January 1, 1990, the tax is paid in the form of estimated payments based on the
tax liability for the previous fiscal year.
In addition, as of 1992, the deadline for the payment of assessments stipulated on the tax
rolls (droits emis par voie de role) was shortened from three to two months.
1.4   Regulation of commercial transactions carried out in cash
With a view to reducing tax fraud and evasion, the 1990 finance law stipulated that
expenditures relative to selected charges for which the amount is equal to or greater than DH
10,000 and for which payment cannot be evidenced by an unendorsable crossed check (chkque
bare [sic] non endossable), commercial paper or bank draft are deductible up to only 75% of
their amount.
1.5   Elimination of tax exemptions for certain financial agencies
The policy to expand the tax base has meant the elimination of tax exemptions as of 1988
for the Bank Al Maghrib, the banques populaires regionales, as well as the Caisse Nationale de
Credit Agricole.

2.    National Solidaritv Tax
As of 1989. income and earnings totall) and temporarily exempt from the corporate tax,
IBP (imp6t sur les benAfices professionelles) and TPI (tare sur les profits immobiliers) became
subject to a national solidarity tax cparticipation a la solidariie nationale) at the rate of 25 %.
3.    General income tax (IGR): Revisions to the nontaxable threshold for wages and salaries
Prior to 1979, the nontaxable threshold for purposes of the income tax (then known as
the prelevement sure les traitements et salaires - PTS) was set at DH 3,000. At that time, it was
raised to DH 6,000 and then DH 8,400 in 1988.
With the introduction of the general income tax (imp6t general sur le revenu - IGR) in
1990, the exemption threshold was raised to DH 12,000, and then DH 15,000 by the 1993
finance law and DH 18,000 by the 1994 finance law.
For the record, the nontaxable threshold made effective in 1994 exempted 240,000
people.
4.    VAT: Elimination of exemptions and increase in rates for certain commodities
4.1   Elimination of exemptions
1988: The following became taxable as of January 1, 1988:
- milled rice, rice flour and semolina and starches (farines de fculents);
- mineral substances;
- straight and composed feedingstuffs and their components to be used for cattle feed;
- credit operations of the banques populaires.
1992: As -of January 1, 1992, credit operations carried out by the CIH (Credit
Immobilier et Hotelier) became taxable at the rate of 14%, with the exception of credit for low-
income housing construction.
4.2   Increase in VAT rates
1988: As of January 1, 1988, the rates for the following commodities were increased:
- coffee went from 7% to 14%;
- transport went from the reduced rate of 7% to 14%;



38
- sales operations for foodstuffs or drriks to be consumed in situ and the provision of
lodging by hotels classified as h6tels a voyageurs and restaurants operating in such hotels were
subjected to a tax of 14% instead of 12%.
1990:
- matches became taxable at 19% instead of 7%.
1992:
- credit, bank and exchange agents were taxed at 14% instead of 12%;
- operations carried out by insurance brokers became taxable at the rate of 14% instead
of 7%.
5.    Revision of IBP. IGR and IS exemptions under the investment codes, effective May 4.
1988
The 1988 investment code reform sought to maintain incentives for the investment phase
(regarding customs duties, VAT and the registration fee) and reduce incentives for the operating
phase (IGR, IBP and IS).
The reform consequently decreased tax exemptions on earnings through a change from
total exemption to a partial exemption of 50% of the amount of the tax. It also reduced the
duration of the exemption - to five years from the previous 10 to 15 years. The following
investment codes were affected: the export code, the artisanal investments code, the industrial
investment code, the tourism investment code, the maritime investment code, the fixed asset
investment code, the mining investment code, the code governing vocational training graduates
and the private education investment code.
6.    Accounting reform
The following three texts were finalized, adopted and published in the Official Bulletin.
6.1   Chart of Accounts
Law No. 9.88 regarding the accounting obligations of merchants, which extends the new
chart of accounts to businesses, was promulgated by Dahir No. 1.92.138 of December 25, 1992
and published in the Official Bulletin of December 30, 1992.



39
6.2   Association of Chartered Accountants
Law No. 15.89 regulating the auditing profession and establishing an Association of
Chartered Accountants was promulgated by Dahir No. 1.92.139 of January 8, 1993 and
published in the Official Bulletin of February 3, 1993.
6.3   Auditing Degree
Decree No. 2.89.519 of July 16, 1990 establishing a national auditing degree was
published in the Official Bulletin of September 19, 1990.
C.   Budget measures
1.    Achievements under SAL I
SAL I had the following main objectives:
- improvement in management bodies and budget procedures;
- increase in public investment, in particular with regard to economic and social
infrastructure.
For the first aspect, the following actions were undertaken:
* reorganization as of December 28, 1988 of the Budget Departnent, improving the
organization of the budget function, in particular through the consolidation of the operating and
investment budgets, along with better monitoring of external financing;
* establishment of the new budget nomenclature as of January 1989 and the streamlining
of work programs, resulting in more flexible budget procedures, modernization and greater
transparence of the State budget;
* formulation of an action plan for the establishment of an integrated budget information
system. The system is now being implemented;
* establishment of a procedure for carrying over credits that enables the ministries to
continue to make expenditure allocations without the need for prior formalities.
With regard to the investment program, the quantitative objectives were achieved overall.
The volume of funds made available to the six ministries affected by the TIP was as a whole
consistent with projections agreed during preparation of the program, for both 1988 and 1989,
and which achieved 100% and 95%, respectively, of projections.



40
Likewise, the key budget performance indicators (credit approved by the CED'credii
available, payments by the Treasury on credits approved by the CED) were in accordance with
the projected levels: the commitment rate was 91 % in 1988, as against the projected figure of
93%. In 1989, the actual rate was 96%, as against the 95% projected. The ratio of payments
on commitments was 66% in 1988, as against the 57% projected. In 1989, that rate was 54%,
as against the 61 % projected.
Moreover, Treasury payments due (expressed in months) were reduced to the projected
level of three months.
Likewise, GFCF of the TIP was 96% of the original target for the two years covered by
the program.
As a share of total TIP investments, investments by the Health and Housing ministries
were 6.44% in 1988, as against the 5.80% projected, and 5.26% in 1989, as against the 6.9%
projected.
stly, TIP investments totaled DH 3,942,000,000 in 1988 (2.8% of GDP) and DH
5,017,000,000 in 1989 (2.64%). The figures for 1990 were not calculated because the
monitoring indicators changed under SAL II.
2.    Achievements under SAL II
2.1   The average annual increase in investment budget allocations for the period from 1990
to 1993 was targeted at 3.31%.
This commitment was achieved and even exceeded, as the figure was 5.4% for the
period.
- With regard to investment credits by the Ministry of Public Health, the annual average
increase was 10.67%, as against the 15% targeted in real terms. This shortfall was due
primarily to the fact that the intensity of expenditures by the local communities was not
maintained in 1993 (down from DH 162,400,000 in 1992 to DH 53,000,000 in 1993).
- Budget allocations for "miscellaneous equipment and expenditures" of the Ministry of
Public Health increased some 16.85% on average per year, as against the 10.67% targeted;
- The non-wage operating expenses of the Ministry of Education increased annually by
30.26% in real terms during the same period, as against the 19.215% targeted in the matrix of
measures;



41
- Investment expenditures for primary and secondary education increased annually by
20.74%, as against 6.56% in real terms during the period covered by the program;
- With regard to investment expenditures for rainfed agriculture, the original assumptions,
which would have meant an annual average increase of 3.31 %, were largely achieved, since the
increase in such spending was 4.62%.
With the exception of the Ministry of Public Health, performance in resource allocation
for investments in economic and social infrastructure both as a whole and by ministry was better
than expected, despite the unexpected circumstances that occurred during the years covered by
the program, namely a drought during two consecutive years, the Gulf war and an unfavorable
international economic outlook.
2.2   Study on the participation of the private sector in the provision of private
services(part:civation du sector prive aux Drestations de services publics - PSP-PSP)
SAL II included an overall analysis of public services currently provided by the State
and an assessment of the possibilities of partial or total transfer of those services to the private
sector.
The study was conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works,
Vocational Training and Higher-Level Training. [sic]
The Moroccan authorities are now reviewing the conclusions of the study.
2.3   Reform of the investment incentive system
The reform of the investment incentive system sought to standardize and simplify existing
investment codes, incorporating them into a single code. The reform was to be an intermediate
stage toward achieving the ultimate goal of standardizing the provisions of the codes under
ordinary law.
A first draft of the single code was prepared. The draft makes certain social sectors
eligible, in addition to those now specified by the codes.
Moreover, all direct equity investments by the State provided for by the current codes
(bonuses, investment in infrastructure) were eliminated.
The draft single code, which is now being finalized, is only one component of the reform
of investment incentives.

D.   Measures undertaken with re2ard to the external debt
In accordance with the commitments made by Morocco under the Structural Adjustment
Loans concluded with the World Bank (SAL I and SAL II), the External Debt Management
Division carried out a number of actions to improve the system for monitoring and managing
the external debt.
A coordinating conmmittee representing several departments was established to ensure the
smooth running of the system for tracking the country's external debt.
In addition, Circular No.3/6250 of July 27, 1989 issued by the Minister of Finance
establishing the obligation to register all contracts in respect of loans and regular transactions
with the Department of Treasury and External Finances, regarding all data relative to the
external debt of the entities in question, was disseminated on a large scale to all parties involved
in the external debt of the country.
Following that circular, a file of external loan contracts was established, making it
possible to register and centralize all loan contracts still effective. A procedure was also
established for processing the data covering the country's foreign commitments as a whole after
they are sent to the Treasury Department.
Moreover, the Division of Balance of Payments and Bilateral Relations, in conjunction
with a systems company, designed and introduced a computerized debt management system to
address both management needs as well as statistical requirements. A training plan for all
higher-level staff of the Division was also formulated to support the system, whose
implementation is expected to begin in June 1994.
In tandem with these actions, the Division acquired the human and physical resources that
enabled it to further enhance its management capabilities.
As a result of these measures and actions, the objective of full control of the structure
and amount of Morocco's external commitments was achieved.
Following the end of the rescheduling process, Morocco is now in a strong position to
move toward more active management of its debt based on market mechanisms, with a view to
a lasting improvement in the profile of the country's external debt and a reduction in the related
charges.
E.    Evaluation of foreign trade reforms
Liberalization of foreign trade was one of the main objectives of the structural adjustment
program begun in 1983. The structural reforms taken in this regard involved a recasting of the



43
trade and industrial policies through the elimination of quantitative restrictions, rationalization
of customs duties, revision of the system protecting domestic production and simplification of
foreign trade procedures.
1.    Elimination of quantitative restrictions
The gradual liberalization of imports that began in 1984 continued during the period
from 1988 to 1982 and initially saw the transfer of a number of commodities subject to import
authorization (list B) to list A of the General Import Program (duty-free products for
importation). Thus, between 1988 and 1982, some 1,400 commodities were made duty-free for
importation. As of March 1992, the General Import Program was replaced by a limited list of
commodities subject to an import authorization representing less than 9% of the total value of
imports.
Law No.13/89 relating to foreign trade promulgated in December 1992 echoed the
principle of duty-free imports and exports and, consequently, the elimination of quantitative
restrictions, except in order to safeguard health, security, public order or the like, or to protect
a fledgling production for a limited period.
With the publication of the so-called 'negative" list (Order No.1308-94 of April 19,
1994, published in the Official Bulletin of July 6, 1994), only some ten products meeting the
criteria given in Article 1 of the foreign trade law now remain subject to import or export
quotas.
As part of the implementation of the foreign trade law, the following were prepared for
commodities and their derivatives (other than meat and milk):
- a draft reference price arrete;
- a methodology for calculating variable import levies.
However, because the liberalization of these commodities was postponed by a year and
because of the need to replace the protection system based on reference prices with the customs
equivalents recommended by GATT, the measures fornulated are to be reviewed as part of the
effort to adapt the foreign trade law to the provisions of the Final Uruguay Round.
Thus, the liberalization scheduled in 1994 for basic agricultural products (grains, sugar,
oilseeds) and their derivatives was pushed ahead until 1995 to await the establishment of the
protection system based on customs equivalents instead of the reference price system established
by the foreign trade law.
For energy products, liberalization was moved forward to January 1, 1995 in order to
enable the offices in question to prepare the supplementary measures regarding:



44
- price indexing for petroleum products;
- formulation of a text on the conditions governing trade in energy products;
- standardization of taxation.
2.    Tariff Reform
With regard to tariff reform, the principle of using the customs duty as a sectoral and
non-fiscal policy instrument was adapted.
The liberalization of foreign trade was accompanied by improvements in the customs
schedule through a gradual reduction in the number of tariff items (from 26 to 10) and a gradual
lowering of the ceiling rate for import duties. Thus, the maximum customs duty was lowered
from 45% in 1988 to 35% in 1993, with the exception of certain agricultural products that are
still taxed at 40% and 45%, plus the PFI (general import tax) of 15%.
For basic commodities (grains, sugar, oilseeds, meat and milk) and their derivatives,
maximum protection will be ensured in accordance with the Moroccan proposal to GATT.
Already, in anticipation of the GATT provisions, an official order setting import duties
for animals and animal products (meat, milk and derivatives) was published and became effective
on October 1, 1993.
3.    Reference prices for industrial products
It had been agreed with the Bank to limit reference prices for industrial products to only
10% of the value of industrial production.
This commitment was respected, as certain reference prices that had been in effect prior
to 1992 were eliminated and replaced by others, in particular for textiles and apparel, with a
view to supporting liberalization of that sector.
The list of products currently subject to the reference price system was agreed with the
Bank and represents 10% of the value of industrial production.
4.    Simplification of foreign trade procedures
Simplification of foreign trade procedures took the form of:
- adoption of the standardized system for the classification and codification of
merchandise using an eight-digit number in 1992, establishment of the single declaration of
nierchandise and reduction in port transit time for cargo;



45
- new import and export forms were prepared and will be put into use as soon as the
official order regulating import and export modalities in application of the foreign trade law is
published;
- the establishment of the SADOC computer system: brief declarations and DUMs are
now registered automatically at the computerized offices;
- the elimination of the systematic inspection of containers: evaluation reports in this
respect were sent to the World Bank through the UNDP representative in Rabat;
- adoption of the International Road Transport convention and the convention on
multimodal transport linkages, as well as adoption of the GATT system for determining the
customs value (customs value code): the Customs Authority organized training programs to
familiarize its higher-level staff as well as those at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the
Ministry of Trade and Industry with the system.
Under SAL II it was also agreed that a study on the logistics and efficiency of foreign
trade would be carried out.
The objective of the logistics and efficiency study of foreign trade is to identify and
implement measures that reduce the cost of logistical procedures (liaisons) for operators and that
boost the efficiency of commercial transactions and improve information flows, through the
simplification of channels and elimination of additional charges that penalize domestic operators
in relation to their foreign competitors.
The terms of reference for the study include three modules for logistical procedures: the
administrative channel, the banking channel and the multimodal transport channel.
The work of the consultants carrying out this study was supervised by committees
composed of representatives of the public and private sectors.
Only the reports on the administrative and banking channels were submitted.
For the transport component, the expert engaged in that connection has not yet submitted
his report to the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
When all the reports have been finalized, they will be reviewed by a commission of
public and private stakeholders in foreign trade.
However, with regard to support for exports, the actions undertaken as part of the SAL
programs are still limited and because they are not of as much interest to the Bank as are
liberalization and reform of protection, proposals of possible measures for supporting the export



46
sector need to be explored with the Bank, particularly in view of the new outlook for
international trade characterized by increasing competition on the inernational market, in
particular following the Final Uruguay Round.
These measures would include:
- a study on market diversification;
- an export promotion component.
5.    Establishment of a safeguard mechanism
In accordance with Article 15 of Law No. 13/89 governing foreign trade and its
implementing decree, an import consultative commission was set up in July 1993 to report to
the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The commission gives its opinion on charges brought by
enterprises regrading unfair business practices.
The commission presents its opinions to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which can require
the violator to pay antidumping or compensatory penalties if it finds that there is sufficient
evidence of dumping or subsidy.
The commission consists of representatives from the government and the private sector
(Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture, Artisanal Production, sectoral trade
associations). It held its first meeting in early November 1993 and thus far has reviewed two
formal claims relative to antidumping measures.
F.    Social component
In addition to the above-mentioned increase in budget allocations to the Ministries of
Public Health, Education and Agriculture for rainfed agriculture, the following actions have been
taken:
1.    Determination with the Bank of a profile of the target population for the social
develogment strategy
This work was carried out by the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Economic
Incentives in the conjunction with the Bank. The main source of data in developing the profile
is the 1990-91 National Household Survey. However, changes in household living conditions
were studied in conjunction with a consumption and expenditure survey made in 1984-85.
2.    The carrMin2 out of three studies planned with the Bank, namely:



47
a study of the impact of social public spending on low-income households and the
possibilities of cost recovery from other areas of the social sectors; the study was carried
out under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. It showed that, despite the
considerable efforts made by the government in the social sectors, major efforts are still
needed in both the mobilization of additional resources for greater satisfaction of needs
and the refocusing of social public spending toward the poorest socioeconomic groups,
particularly in the rural areas;
*     a study on the effect of agricultural policies on the income of low-income households;
the main objective of the study was to evaluate the impact on household living standards,
changes in agricultural policy following the implementation of the structural adjustment
programs in the agriculture sector, i.e. changes in the agricultural price policy, including
prices for imports, and changes in the structure and levels of public expenditure in the
agriculture and rural sector.
The study was carried out under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agricultural Development.
*     a study on the sources of vulnerability of low-income households and on the adequacy
and cost of various social protection mechanisms; the study was carried out under the
supervision of the Ministry of Economic Incentives. It identified the sources of
vulnerability of low-income households, i.e. drought, sudden changes in prices and cattle
epidemics. It made it possible to look at the Government's efforts with regard to safety
nets. These would include National Assistance, National Promotion, the school meal
program, distribution of weaning flour (farine de sevrage) and compensation for the three
basic food stuffs; sugar, vegetable oil and flour.
3-.    Formulation of a social development strategy for low-income households
The basic document for this strategy was finalized by the Ministry of Economic
Incentives in conjunction with the Bank and was submitted to the Council of Government at its
meeting on June 9, 1993. The document was submitted to the Bank for the release of the second
tranche of SAL II.
The strategy was based primarily on the preliminary findings of the three above-
mentioned studies.
The social strategy first of all seeks to safeguard macroeconomic equilibria. It therefore
gives priority to the reallocation of public resources to the underprivileged social segments. Its
central aim is to expand access by the underprivileged to basic social services so that they can
acquire the skills necessary to play a productive role in the economic development process.



48
The priority areas of the strategy are as follows:
- potable water and sanitation;
- basic health services and mother and child health care;
- primary education and literacy, particularly in the rural areas;
- low-cost housing; and
- social protection.
With a view to the implementation and monitoring of the social development strategy,
an interministerial committee was established by circular of the Prime Minister on April 18,
1994. The secretariat function will be provided by the Minister for Economic Incentives. The
circular specifies the priority programs of the strategy for which sectoral action plans are to be
prepared.
4.    Evaluation of the SEGMA hosDitals built
In the health sector, a study to evaluate the operations and charges of the new SEGMA
hospitals and the possibility of expanding and improving the system was carried by the Ministry
of Public Health.
V.  RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
During implementation of the SAL I and SAL II structural adjustment programs, ongoing
contacts between the Bank and the Moroccan authorities involved in the project were maintained
with a view to monitoring all actions that were to be undertaken during the period. These
relations were fruitful and made it possible to:
- ensure compliance with the timetable of measures that were to be taken and to make
the necessary adjustments to the timetable;
- ensure compliance with procedures and commitments made in this regard;
- monitor project progress in accordance with the implementation timetable.
