                   that are potential suppliers of the goods re-
                   quired."
2.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) shall be
awarded:
      (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower's public
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of
such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found
acceptable by the Bank; and
      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded
on the basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations obtained
from suppliers from at least two (2) countries, except that direct
contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines.

submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, two (2)
conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a description of the
advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other
Page  10
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

tion and information as the Bank may reasonably request to support

the Loan Account are to be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure.
                          SCHEDULE 4

                  of Schedule 1 to this Agreement
1.    Macroeconomic Framework
      Continued maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic
framework, consistent with the objectives of the Program, as
determined on the basis of indicators acceptable to the Borrower and
the Bank.
2.    Trade
      (a)   Reduction of the maximum import duty applicable to every
item of goods (except for certain agricultural goods selected on the
basis of guidelines acceptable to the Bank) imported into the

percent (35%) of the c.i.f. (port of entry) price of such item of

applicable to all goods other than certain goods selected by the

industrial goods except for certain industrial goods representing
10% of the total value of domestic industrial production during the
Fiscal Year ending on December 31, 1992, as calculated on the basis
of guidelines acceptable to the Bank. For purposes of this Section,
the term "reference price" means the minimum value of an item of
goods on the basis of which import duties and taxes applicable to
such items are calculated.
3.    Investments
      (a)   Carrying out of a public investment program for the

program for the Fiscal Year ending on December 31, 1993, both of
which are acceptable to the Bank and are designed to strengthen the
social sectors and provide the infrastructure required for private
sector development, as determined on the basis of investment targets
acceptable to the Bank.
      (b)    Presentation to the Council of Government of the
Borrower, of a draft law, which the Bank agrees is designed to
provide a rational and efficient system of investment incentives.

designed to enable the Borrower to monitor and evaluate, on the
basis of indicators acceptable to the Bank, the development of its

Bank agree are appropriate for the improvement of the quality of
life of the Borrower's low-income households.
