SECGN STRUCTURALn AI2USTMUENT LOAN (SA,L-11)
Laan -arid Proga Su.Mgmu
The Kingdom of Morocco.
Amnounk           US$275 million equivalent.
20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
fliminilAn:       Norocco's  economic  reform program  aims  at  achieving  a
sustainable increase in the rate of economic growth in order
to ensure employment opportunities and acceptable living
standards for its growing population, while enhancing external
creditworthiness. The proposed SAL would support the last
phase of the Government's stabilization and adjustment program
of action within a macroeconomic framework which permits the
achievement of the Government's objectives. The loan would
focus on the following areas:   (i) a public expenditure
rationalization component which would support private
investment through providing the necessary infrastructure,
encouraging the private sector to supply some of the services
hitherto supplied by the public sector, and promoting a
dynamic  role  for  private  investment;   (ii) a  poverty
alleviation component which would support a shift in budget
expenditure priorities toward the social sectors and the
implementation of a poverty alleviation strategy for the
nineties; and (iii) the continuation of the trade reform
program and the simplification of foreign trade procedures.
EmHnnlf           The principal benefits of the adjustment program resulting
andl9:           from the acceleration of economic growth through increased
factor  productivity  would  be:    a  rise  in  employment
opportunities and living standards for the growing population;
the development of an outward-oriented private sector; and
continued improvement in external creditworthiness with a view
to restoring voluntary access to commercial borrowing. Two
main risks can affect the success of the project. The first
relates to the consolidation of the macroeconomic progress
already achieved. While the fiscal deficit has been reduced
substantially over the last decade, further progress is



- ii-
required at a time when foreign financing of the deficit
through rescheduling is going to disappear. The Government is
committed to further fiscal efforts which will be finalized as
part of the 1992 Finance Bill. The second area of potential
risk is the economy's vulnerability to external shocks from
droughts, oil and phosphate price changes as well as increases
in  international  interest  rates.    Given  the  country's
excellent macroeconomic and export performance in the past
years,  there is some cushion to face these shocks.   In
addition, oil import and phosphate export prices have
historically moved in an almost parallel cycle.
Esiatteu          The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed in two
tranches:
Dki2U3OHMMM:    US$138 million upon loan effectiveness, which is expected to
take place by May 1992, and the remaining US$137 million after
the completion of a number of key actions upon which success
of the program depends.  Release of the second tranche is
planned for early 1993.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
SECOND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$275 MILWON
TO THE KINGOM Qf MQRQCGO
IBTRODUQMON
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL II) to the Kingdom of Morocco in an amount
equivalent to US$275 million to provide financial support for the Government's
economic reform program. The loan would support the last phase of a structural
adjustment program aimed at achieving more rapid growth and a more equitable
distribution of welfare.   The loan would have a term of 20 years including
five years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.   The African
Development Bank will provide cofinancing.
PARTE
THFO 19808: A DECADE OF ADJUST-MENT AND) REFORMS
2.          During the 1980s, Morocco achieved commendable macroseonomic results
and moved closer to being a private sector-led, outward-oriented economy.
Effective demand management, exchange rate realignments, and sweeping reforms of
incentives allowed the economy to take advantage of a fairly favorable
international environment, particularly in the second half of the decade, and to
attract the support of the international financial community. But infrastructure
and social services have lagged behind. A redirection of investment priorities
towards these sectors has become critically important.
3.          Morocco has abundant natural resources including the world's most
easily accessible phosphate reserves, vast areas of arable land, extensive
coastlines well suited for tourism, and considerable maritime resources.
However, much of these resources have not been adequately developed. Per capita
income is still below US$1,000 in spite of the rapid growth of the second half
of the eighties.
The Nacroeconomic Results Speak for Themselves
4..         Mo-.rocco has one of the lowest inflation rates among developing
countries. Blespite the recovery in economic activity that took place in the
second half of the 1980s, inflation remained below 51 until 1990, when it
increased to 6.71 following a nominal devaluation and higher oil prices. The
current account turned around in the second half of the 1980s, moving from a
deficit of almost 81 of GDP in 1984 to small surpluses in 1987 and 1988.
However, it slipped back to deficits of 3.61 of GDP in 1989 and 0.81 in 1990.
The transitory deterioration of the current account in 1989 reflected mainly a



- 2 -
fall in phvsphate exports because of a contractual dispute with Morocco's main
buyer of phosphoric acid. The low current account deficits have allowed debt
indicators to improve systematically:   the ratio of debt outstanding and
disbursed (DOD) to GDP dropped from 1071 in 1986 to 931 in 1990, and the ratio
of debt service to exports from 36X to 231 (after reLciheduling).
5.          The second half of the 1980s was also an exceptior-' period of growth
for the Meroccan economy, with real GDP growth averaging about 4.81 a year from
1985 to 1989. Partly because Morocco complemented stabilization measures with
structural reforms, growth suffered less than it did in countries that relied on
stabilization alone. Agriculture performed remarkably well despite the droughts
in 1985 and 1987, in part because of changes in producer incentives supported by
two Bank adjustment loans. Even though the sector represents less than 201 of
GDP, it has contributed almost one-third of growth in the latter part of the
eighties.
Protress Towar4 a Private Sector-led. Outward-oriented Econom'
o.          Between 1980 and 1989, manufacturing exports increased from 12X to
221 of total exports, including nonfactor services.  Despite this shift in
structure, exports remain narrowly based on a few products: fish, processed
foods, phosphate derivatives, and clothing, which is fast becoming Morocco's
primary export. But there has been diversification within these categories.
Phosphate-derived products, only 91 of phosphate exports in 1972, soared to 641
in 1988. Processed foods (canned fruits and vegetables, fish, juices) increased
from 161 of agricultural exports in 1972 to 47X in 1988. The higher share of
finished products in total exports means that exports are less vulnerable to
exogenous developments and more responsive to economic incentives.
7.          The industrial sector response to the reforms has also been positive.
Manufactured goods increased from 151 of total production in 1982 to 251 in 1988.
The rate of investment has increased in export-oriented sectors, with their share
in total fixed investment growing from less than a quarter in 1984 to over a half
in 1988. Investment in textiles doubled as a proportion of total investment in
1984-88, with a parallel increase in the ratio of exports to total production.
The new, stronger class of entrepreneurs that emerged in the 1980s has expanded
its activities beyond manufacturing to investments in modern agriculture-based
exports and services.
Fiscal and Mone     Restraint and Exchanae Rate Realignment
8.          After years of budget deficits above 101 of GDP, the Government is
bringing under control one of the most difficult remaining macroeconomic
imbalances. The share of the budget deficit in GDP fell from historical double-
digit levels to 4.41 on a cash basis in 1989 and 3.41 in 1990.1  Government
expenditures were reduced from an average of 331 of GDP in the first half of the
1980s to 281 of GDP in 1989, mostly through cuts in public investment. Although
the cuts initially were needed, they were so drastic that basic social and
material infrastructure was hardly maintained (paras. 15-16), endangering both
private sector activity and social stab-lity. Since 1988, public investment has
expanded, with the support of SAL I, to ensure a core minimum of spending
(para. 33). Revenues, which had temporarily dropped to 191 of GDP in 1986 when
3/    After grants, the deficit was only 0.41 of GDP in 1990.



- 3 -
the value added tax (VAT) was introduced, have recovered to about 23X of GDP, a
level higher than that reacned before reform.
9.          Monetary and credit policies also contributed to the restoration of
internal and external equilibria.   Tight control of the monetary aggregates
throughout the decade supported the fall in the inflation rate, from over 12X in
1981, to around 31 in 1989, and provided financial stability. Credit ceilings,
interest rate controls, and selective credit policies were among the monetary
instruments used.  Because of the need to finance a lzrge budget deficit, credit
was squeezed and banks were forced to invest a large share of their liabilities
in low-interest government bonds. By and large, selective credit policies and
interest rate controls were successful in avoiding excessive crowding out of
?rivate investment. As inflation dropped and real interest rates2 increased
from -5X in 1981 to 81 in 1988, savings responded promptly.
10.         Fiscal and monetary restraint was supported by exchange  rate
realignment to better reflect the relative opportunity costs of tradable and non-
tradable production, supporting the economy's export drive. The real effective
exchange rate (REER) depreciated by a total of 33X in 1980-89, depreciating from
1979 through the end of 1985 and then remaining stable until 1989. After the May
1990 nominal devaluation of 9.25X, real exchange rate indexes were at one of the
most depreciated levels since the 1970s (see Figure 1).
SweeRin   Reforms of Incentives
11.         Accompanying the macroeconomic stabilization program has been an
impressive reform of the incentives structure aimed at bringing about a shift
from administered to market-determined incentives. The domestic economy has been
gradually exposed to external competition through a reduction of both tariffs and
the scope of quantitative import restrictions.  At the same time, most domestic
price controls have been removed and trade monopolies are being gradually
eliminated. Consumer subsidies have been reduced in scope and magnitude. A
major tax reform was implemented to increase tax buoyancy and decrease
distortions in relative prices. A public enterprise rationalization program was
also implemented in the second half of the 1980s (see Part II for a description
of the structural reforms).
A Fairly Favorable External Environment
12.         Although in the first half of the 1980s international prices for both
phosphate and oil fell, the net effect was a deterioration in terms of trade
until 1986.  Phosphate prices recovered significantly after that, while oil
prices  continued to fall.   As  a consequence,  Morocco's  terms of trade
(merchandise only) regained their 1980 level and were about 8X higher by 1989.
Adequate rainfall after 1987 gave an additional exogenous boost to overall
growth. The fall in world oil prices and the strong agricultural production
during most of the second half of the 1980s, led to a drop in import values in
the period following trade liberalization. Crude oil imports decreased from 81
of GDP in 1985 to 31 in 1989. Food imports decreased from 4X to 3X of GDP.
V/    These refer to the 6-month deposit rates.

Support from th6 Inteunational Financial Community
13.         Following several traditional reschedulings with the Paris and London
Clubs, Morocco concluded new agreements that brought the country closer to
balance of payments viability.    The agreement witlh the London Club has two
parts. The first consists of a block rescheduling of the entire US$3.2 billion
owed to commercial banks. The bulk of the debt was rescheduled with a 20-year
maturity, including a 10-year grace period, saving Morocco about US$700 million
a year in 1990, 1991, and 1992. 'Zhis part of the agreement also provided a
waiver for buy backs of Moroccan debt on the secondary market. The seconQ part
of the deal, conditional on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF,
provided for further possible negotiated debt reduction. This possibility is no
longer being pursued by the Government since recent economic performance allows
it to achieve viability without recourse to debt reduction. In addition, in
September 1990, Morocco obtained from the Paris Club a rescheduling of 100l of
principal and interest of eligible debt falling due between January 1990 and
March 1991 amounting to US$1.3 billion. Furthermore, in February 1992, the Paris
Club rescheduled US$1.25 billion representing ar&uzrs as of January 31, 1992, and
maturities falling due from February 1, 1992, to December 31, 1992. Repayment
terms have been the same for both reschedulings: 20 years, including 10 years
of grace, for official development assistance loans; and 15 years, including
8 years of grace, for commercial credits of more than 1 year. in total, the
Paris Club deals saved Morocco approximately US$1 billion in 1990, US$900 million
in 1991, and US$600 million in 1992.
14.         In 1991, Saudi Arabia forgave Morocco's entire debt obligation
amounting to around US$2.7 billion. This is equivalent to almost 25X of the
Paris Club debt. The cancellation of this debt results in a dramatic improvement
in the country's creditworthiness indicators, especially after 1992.  It has
prompted the Government to target ambitious macroeconomic objectives:
convertibility and a balanced budget by 1993.
1mlogment Generation and the Development of Infrastructure have Lagged Behinb
15.         Despite Morocco's macroeconomic achievements, it is facing major
challenges. While GDP growth was exceptional in the second half of the eighties,
unemployment remains very high, at around 15X i.t urban areas, and anecdotal
evidence suggests large wealth imbalances. The labor force grew at 3.21 per year
owing to the demographic momentum inherited from earlier periods. Since the rate
of increase of the labor force will not drop much below 31 until the late 1990s,
the economy must sustain a high growth path just to avoid severe social stress
triggered by critical levels of youth unemployment.
16.         Essential to the country's development is the rehabilitation and
development of infrastructure, critical to support private sector activity.
While the civil service is large and represents 75X of non-interest current
expenditures, basic public investment is inadequate.  Up to 60% of tertiary
roads, more than 45% of the total road network, were deemed in bad condition in
1988, compared with 401 five years earlier. As a result of accumulated delays
in maintenance, most of these roads now need extensive rehabilitation before they
can receive regular maintenance. Telecommunications and utilities have become
increasingly deficient in critical areas. By the end of 1986, Morocco had less
than one line per 100 inhabitants, compared with two per 100 inhabitants in
Algeria and Tunisia, and five in Turkey. The existing network meets less than
601 of expressed demand (with waiting time for new connections averaging



- 6 A
six years), and it is of poor quality.  Modern communicat..on sr 'Ices necessary
to compete in interrational markets are virtually unavailable.
The Need to Provide Social Services is Immense
17.         Morocco's welfare indlicators are much lower than those of countries
with similar per capita incomes. Child and maternal mortality, nutritional
status, access to safe water, illiteracy, urban employment, and child labor are
critical poverty issues.3 In particular, 55X of males and 78X of females are
illiterate.  Quite apart from equity considerations, illiteracy, through its
effect on labor qualifications, is a big handicap for Morocco's expanding export
sector. As for infant mortality, this is higher than countries at comparable
income levels:  73 per 1000 live births.  Moreover, there is wide disparity
between urban and rural areas, with a range of 50 to 198 deaths per 1000 live
births.   Both the volume and the "quality" of some social expenditures are
inadequate (para. 45).
PART If - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
AND THE CHALLENGES OF THE 199
18.         During the last decade of the twentieth century, Morocco faces three
related challenges: (1) to develop an efficient private sector; (2) to resume
normal external financial relations; and, most critical, (3) to achieve a more
equitable distribution of welfare. To contribute to these objectives, SAL-II
proposes to support the Government's objective to ensure the reallocation of
public expenditures to respond to critical social needs and to further strengthen
private sector development.  .he proposed loan would also support the elaboration
of a poverty reduction strategy for the 1990s. Together with the increased
public provision of social services, private sector growth, through employment
and income generation, would contribute to a more equitable distribution of
welfare. SAL-II would also support further liberalization of the trade regime.
Increased competition from abroad under stable macroeconomic conditions and the
recent liberalization of the financial sector are the best guarantees for dynamic
and efficient private entrepreneurial activity.
19.         Consistent with the foregoing, and with the Bank's strategy and
lending program, SAL-II would focus on four components:   (1) macroeconomic
framework; (2) public expenditure rationalization; (3) the articulation of a
poverty reduction strategy; and (4) trade liberalization. The macroeconomic
framework is consistent with the IMF program (para. 93). The following sections,
and the matrices as well as the Letter of Development Policy in the annex,
describe the Government's adjustment program. A selected set of the measures
presented constitute specific conditions for second trancbe release (see
Part III). They have been selected on the basis of two considerations: (a) they
are critical to get the program completed; and (b) tney are easily monitorable.

20.         An important objective of the first SAL, presented to the Board in
1988, was to reinvigorate the economy by bringing average growth above the 3.31
of the preceding years. During 1988-90, growth improved to almost 5X a year.
A second objective was for SAL-I to serve as the starting point for a series of
operations that would help restore Morocco's access to international financial
markets by the mid-1990s. Morocco is now close to balance of payments viability,
and creditworthiness indicators have improved significantly. The ratio of debt
outstanding to GDP and that of debt survice to exports have both met the
improvements anticipated under the first SAL.   Most of the macroeconomic
indicators targeted under SAL I have been met (Table 1), and some have been
surpassed. The few transitory deviations, such as the low level of foreign
assets in 1989, were discussed with the Government, which took corrective
measures to bring the economy back to its projected path.

Nacrosconomic Priorities
21.         Morocco's macroeconomic priorities for the first half of the 1990s
are to inctease growth, improve the fiscal stance, and attain balance of payments
viability. Higher growth would increase opportunities to bring larger groups of
the population into the development process so that they could share. its
benefits. Fiscal discipline contributes to domestic and external macroeconomic
stability and to private sector development by avoiding private sector crowding

out and providing a credible macroeconomic framework, particularly important
during a period of structural reforms. Balance of payments viability, strongly
supported by fiscal adjustment, would help Moroaco return to voluntary lending
and increase foreign investment during the 1990s.
22.         High_er growth.  The growth rate of GDP should accelerate from about
4X in the second half of the 1980s to over 51 a year by the end of the 1990s
(Table 2).   The two main sources of the increase in growth would be the
productivity gains resulting from the reforms, and the expansion in the share of
private sector investment in GDP by four percentage points over 1990-98. A
public investment program of about 4.41 of GDP would provide the physical and
social infrastructure needed to sustain this growth. 'The resulting expansion of
national income would in turn allow both an increase in per capita consumption
growth to 2.2% a year by the late l990s, and an improvement in Morocco's savings
mobilization. The systematic growth in private consumption, in both rural and
urban areas, would help alleviate social pressures.

23.         Sustainable budget deficit.  Expansion of private investment, both
domestic and foreign, requires a stable macroeconomic environment. A necessary
condition for macroeconomic stability is a low and predictable budget deficit
with financing that is compatible with a viable balance of payments, low
inflation, and greater private sector access to bank credit. For 1992-95, this
would mean a budget deficit of about 0.41 of GDP (Table 2). Although difficult,
it is attainable: in 1990 the budget deficit on a cash basis was already down
to 3.41 of GDP. This fiscal effort should be consolidated and strengthened in
the second half of the 1990s, when the commercial banks' rescheduled public debt
comes due. The Government's enhanced contribution to the increase in national
savings is, therefore, critical for both domestic private sector development and
an improved current account (Table 4).



- 9 -
24.         Balance of -ayments viability.   Achieving a viable balance of
payments by 1993, which would be sustained thereafter, is another cornerstone of
Morocco's macroeconomic stability. It hinges on completing the trade reforms and
increasing creditworthiness.   As exports grow and diversify following the
completion of the trade reforms, the resource gap would be reduced from 6.11 of
GDP in 1990 to 3.61 by 1995.   And as foreign investment expands and voluntary
projezt-related financing resumes with improved creditworthiness, the composition
of capital inflows would improve. The resulting balance of payments viability
will greatly facilitate the transition to full convertibility of the dirham, now
envisaged for 1993, further strengthening confidence in the economy.
25.         The significant external adjustment should take place early on,
before convertibility is implemented and when principal repayments are relatively
low due to recent reschedulings. The reduction in the resource gap, supported
by appropriate fiscal and exchange rate policies, will obviate the need for
exceptional financing after 1992 and allow Morocco to face the more stringent
debt service requirements in the second half of the decade. Under the most
likely scenario, net exports would grow vigorously in response to the trade
reform. Exports--benefiting from both fiscal and monetary policies consistent
with the necessary real effective exchange rate to maintain a constant non-
interest current account, and the trade reform- -would grow at high rates,
reaching 8.51 in 1993.4 In the mid-1990s, export and import growth rates, while
still exceeding GDP growth, would be compatible with a manageable resource gap
maintained at about 3.61 of GDP and a non-interest current account surplus at
3.61 of GDP. The reduction in the resource gap, together with a fall in interest
payments on foreign debt from about 61 of GDP (before debt relief) in 1988-89 to
about 3.6X in 1994-98 (Table 3), would bring the current account deficit to less
tharn 11 of GDP in the mid-1990s.
26.         As noted earlier,  our current assessment  shows  that  further
commitments for exceptional financing, such as reschedulings or debt reduction,
would not be required beyond those already obtained.   The financing of the
capital account reflects the latest rescheduliig agreement reached (see
para. 13), which cover arrears as of January 31, 1992 and maturities falling due
between February 1 and December 31, 1992, for the Paris Club, and in 1990-97 for
the London Club. Debt obligations to Saudi Arabia for around US$2.7 billion have
been eliminated.
27.         Beyond 1993, external financing requirements should be within the
limits that Morocco can expect through normal access to official and private
sources. First, as the reforms are completed, direct foreign investment would
increase from US$217 million in 1990 to almost US$800 million a year in the
second half of the 1990s, about 1.51 of GDP. Given foreign investors' growing
interest in Morocco, this is a reasonable estimate. In fact, it could reach even
higher levels in coming years, especially if the privatization program is
successful. Second, gross medium- and long-term disbursements of public and
publicly-guaranteed debt, which averaged US$1.4 billion annually in the 1980s,
would increase to about US$1.75 billion a year in 1991-98 (US$430 million from
private creditors, US$540 million from bilateral creditors, and about US$780
million from multilaterals). Because repayment obligations are expected to be
_/    Although this is lower than recent export growth,  it starts from a
significantly higher initial export base. International experience shows
that such a drop in export growth rates should be expected.

about US$1.5 billion a year, net disbursements would be low and declining, but
enough to cover both the declining current account financing requirements and a
systematic buildup of foreign reserves.
28.         A smaller resource gap would reflect the country's increased savings
mobilization effort and hence the narrower investment-savings balance. The
largest contribution toward narrowing the resource gap would come from fiscal
discipline, which would add around 4X of GDP to the national savings rate over
1991-98 (see Table 4).

Indicators to Assess the Outcome
29.         The set of macroeconomic indicators monitored under SAL-I (para. 20)
would continue to be monitored under SAL-II, to help ensure that the economy
remains within the desired growth path. The list of monitored indicators would
be expanded to include direct foreign investment, a key government target for the
1990s. The five indicators, whose targeted paths are presented in Table 5, are
as follows:
(a)   the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP;
(b)   the ratio of gross public and publicly guaranteed debt
outstanding to total foreign exchange earnings;
(c)   the real rate of growth of manufactured exports;
(d)   the net foreign assets of Bank Al-Maghrib; and
(e)   direct foreign investment.
30.         These indicators would be reviewed semiannually. Deviations from the
projections in Table 5 would t-igger discussions with the Government to identify
underlying problems and explore corrective policy measures. In the past two
years, this monitoring of macroeconomic indicators has facilitated discussion
among the Government, the IMF, and the Bank (para. 20). As a result of the lower
foreign exchange earnings, particularly of tourism, due to the Gulf crisis, the
ratio of external public debt to foreign earnings increased to 2.5 in 1991.
Similarly, direct foreign investment dropped below the 1990 level and is expected
to recover in 1992. The indicators included extend beyond the duration of SAL-II
in order to provide continuity to the economic dialogue in the context of the
Bank's overall lending program.

B. PIBLIC RXPVDIT
31.         The  Bank's  support  to  Morocco  in  ensuring  adequate  public
expenditures to promote private sector and social development follows a two-
pronged approach:  (a) devising a framework for the level and allocation of
expenditures; and (b) ensuring the quality of projects at the microeconomic
level. The public expenditure component of the proposed SAL-II, in line with
SAL-I, focuses on the first of these two issues by defining a level of public
investment and a minimum allocation for critical social expenditures to
complement the development of a poverty reduction strategy.
32.         The second aspect of this strategy, dealing with the quality of
public investment, is addressed through other parts of the lending and sector
work program at three levels. First, infrastructure needs, such as ports and
roads, are supported through specific operations, including the two recently
approved Ports Sector and Fifth Highway projects. The quality of infrastructure
investment in agriculture is being addressed in the Agricultural Sector
Investment Loan (ASIL). Second, the quality and adequacy of social expenditures
are being addressed through operations in health (Health Development and Health
Sector Investment Projects), basic education (Rural Primary Education and Rural
Basic Education Project), vocational training and skill development (Vocational
Training I and II Projects), nutrition (sector work on Food Security and
Nutrition), and employment services. In addition, the proposed SAL will lead to
two comprehensive Social Priority Sector Loans, providing support for a broad
range of critical human capital investments against a background of retargetting
of expenditures and resource mobilization policies.
Progress to Date
33.         SAL-I supported the Government's objectives: (a) to maintain a
minimum level of central government investment (Target Investment Program--TIP)
consistent with an increase in government gross fixed capital formation from 3.51
of GDP to 4.2Z by 1991, and (b) to strengthen investment planning and budgeting
to improve the management and efficiency of public investment expenditures.
34.         These two objectives have been met. First, quarterly reviews of the
TIP have shown that the targets set under SAL-I have been attained despite a
large budget reduction in 1990. Payment orders approved by the Treasury General
increased from 2.61 of GDP in 1988 to an estimated 3.31 in 1990 for the six main
ministries5  (see para. 37).   Second, new budget preparation and control
procedures have considerably improved the efficiency of the public investment
process. Payment delays were reduced from four months in 1984 to one and half
months in 1989. The budget staff can now monitor the evolution of commitments,
payment orders, cash disbursements, and performance ratios over the course of the
year. Assessments of the use of investment appropriations are obtained within
two to three months from the end of the quarter, and unused but committed credits
are automatically carried over to the following year. As a result, the ratio of
payment orders to investment authorizations continued to improve, from 301 in
1986 and 501 in 1987, to 651 in 1989 and 1990.  These efforts have been
complemented by a new budget nomenclature. The budget office and the offices of

the comptroller of commitments and expenditures (CED) and the Treasury General
have been gradually computerized. The Bank's Public Administration Loan (PAL)
has provided institutional support, technical assistance, and training programs
to support the public expenditure program of SAL-I.
35.         SAL-I also supported a major fiscal reform that increased fiscal
revenues by about two percentage points of GDP between 1987 and 1989. The reform
eliminated the cascading effect of indirect taxes by introducing the VAT system;
simplified direct taxation; reduced maximum corporate rates from 52.8X to 44X;
and made direct taxation more. equitable.   The elimination of a number of
exemptions to the VAT broadened the indirect tax base. The General Income Tax
was introduced in 1989, replacing the existing schedular system by a uniform
income tax schedule and reducing the highest marginal tax rate.   Fiscal
exemptions from profit taxes were shortened from 10 to 5 years and the exemption
rate reduced from 100l to 501 for all sectors (except for some regions) other
than export-oriented activities. Finally, as part of the stand-by agreement with
the IMF (para. 93), revenue options have been agreed upon. These include a tax
on the National Phosphate Company (Office CharlfIen des Phosphates, OCP), an
increase in the minimum corporate tax, and an extension of the VAT to retailers.
Projram to Be SuMported by the SAL
36.         The public expenditure component of SAL-II would include three
elements to support the desired acceleration in private sector development.
Firs,1  the public investment program would be extended to include those
expenditures transferred from the central budget to local communitits.  Second,
private investment would be promoted through SAL-II's support of the reform of
investment incentives, which will rationalize fiscal incentives to invest and
eliminate the exemptions that encourage tax evasion and distort resource
ailkCAtion.   Third, the possibility of private sector provision of basic
infrastructure will be explored.
The Public Investment Plan
37.           The authorities and the Bank have developed a common view of
central government investment priorities over the medium term. The plan covers
investment expenditures of six core ministries6 and is consistent with the
overall macroeconomic prospects of the country over 1992-95.7
38.         SAL-II would support the authorities' decision to protect the core
investment  necessary  to  support  private  sector  activity.       Investment
appropriations for the core ministries (including transfers to local communities)
would be kept at least constant relative to GDP in the period covered by the
proposed operation, with 1990 as a base year.   The macroeconomic framework
envisages further reductions in the budget deficit in the coming years. In this
context, the proposed loan would support a shift in budget spending priorities,
by ensuring that a minimum investment in infrastructure is maintained throughout
the budget reduction process envisaged for 1992-93 and social spending even
hI    The six ministries covered under SAL-I and SAL-II are Agriculture and
Agrarian Reform; Public Works, Vocational Training and Staff Training;
Transport; National Education; Health; and Housing.
i/    The budgetary impact of the proposed measure is summarized in para. 81.

increases (see paras. 50-53). The public investment plan would require payment
orders to increase in nominal terms by an average of DH 750 million a year,
stabilizing at about 3.252 of GDP. The public investment plan would be reviewed
for second tranche release, when the 1993 Finance Bill is prepared, keeping in
mind the perrormance of important macroeconomic indicators.
Investment Incentives
39.         Investment incentives were revised under SAL-I to reduce their fiscal
costs.  In 1988 tax holidays were significantly shortened.  There is still
considerable room for improvement, however. Seven differeni: codes, covering
industry, tourism, exports, real estate, maritime, mining, and handcrafts,
address investment incentives. The ad hoc incentives provided in these codes,
with tax exemptions, no ex-post controls, and different criteria for approval,
have resulted in si-nificant distortions in resource allocation. They have also
unintentionally favored real estate speculation since corporate tax and tax
exemptions for capital gains make investment in other sectors relatively
unattractive. Furthermore, the cost of these codes to the Government in revenue
foregone is substantial.8
40.         SAL-II would support the administration's efforts to reform  the
system of investment incentives. The results of a study carried out by the
Government have prompted the authorities to call for either the unification of
the existing codes in one single text or the elimination of the sectoral
investment codes altogether. If the latter approach is adopted, any investment
incentive would become part of the fiscal legislation, granted independently of
the sector and location in which the investment is made. Either system would
eliminate the distortions inherent in the sectoral approach to investment
incentives, ensure greater transparency and reduce budgetary costs by eliminating
cash outlays in the form of interest rebates and other subsidies. The draft
texts spelling out the new system will be submitted to the Council of Government
before second tranche release.
An Expanded Role for the Private Sector
41.         Some of the services now offered by the Government could be offered
by the private sector, thus increasing efficiency and reducing the burden on the
budget. The proposed SAL would support the Government's efforts to encourage
private sector provision of services as part of its long-term reform program.
This strategy is consistent with the objectives of (a) reducing fiscal imbalance
without exerting excessive fiscal pressure on the economy, and (b) promoting the
role of the private sector as the engine of economic growth. The SAL program
would include a study to identify areas in which the private sector could promote
services, including higher education and road and port infrastructure. The study
would draw on current work undertaken for the preparation of the Transport Sector
Master Plan, higher education financing reforms, and the authorities'
privatization program.

C.  POVT REDUCTION SaAMT¢Y
42.         The Government and the Bank concur that increased priority needs to
be given to reducing poverty and promoting social development. This new emphasis
flows from two considerations: that the concern with stabilization in the 1980s
did not allow sufficient attention to living conditions and poverty; and that
some poverty-related problems are more severe in Morocco than in countries with
comparable income levels.
43.         There is some evidence of reduced poverty since the early 1970s,9
but it is difficult to link this directly with policy choices. The pattern of
growth pursued prior to the 1983 crisis was biased against income-generating
activities for the poor: incentives favored urban and industrial activities over
rural and agricultural activities, and agricultural support was oriented
primarily toward irrigated areas and relatively large farmers. Moreover, one of
the major poverty-reducing instruments--food subsidies--led to higher transfers
to upper-income households than to lower-income households.10
44.         Measures of social conditions suggest that Morocco has low health and
educational status for its income level.  In infant mortality and literacy,
Morocco performed significantly worse than countries at comparable levels of
income (para. 17). Information on school enrollments for Morocco show that rural
inhabitants and girls in particular have low enrollment rates compared with other
groups. One rural boy out of three and two rural girls out of three never star
school.
45.         In Morocco, poor welfare indicators reflect a failure to catch up
from initially low levels of health and education/status coupled with increasing
needs resulting from population growth, ratner than stagnant social conditions.
Equally important, poor social conditions in Morocco are not a reflection of low
aggregate public spending on the social sectors. Total public spending on social
sectors (health and education) was 6X of GDP in 1988, a reasonable level by
international standards. However, when examined separately, it becomes clear
that public spending on health, at about 0.9X of GDP, is very low by
international standards, significantly lower than countries that have good health
indicators.   Social services have problems of quality at all levels and
inadequacy of total resources is only part of the problem; allocation within
social expenditures and the efficiency of resource use also play a role.
Progress to Date
46.         While some trends in poverty are clear, there is a severe lack of
information on its characteristics and determinants.   An important recent
development has been the implementation of an ambitious Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS) by the Direction de la Statlstique as part of the
preparatory work for SAL-II. Much less progress has been made in improving the
availability of indirect indicators of living standards (for example, urban and
rural unskilled wages and regular measurement of unemployment).

47.         The Government's explicit concern with poverty is only recent. But
other policy measures indirectly affect the poor. The following developments are
important:
(a)   The recovery of growth in the late 1980s, which included an increase
in agriculture production and moderate growth in urban employment,
probably brought some income benefits to the poor.
(b)   The shifts in the incentive structure--trade liberalization, real
exchange rate depreciation, and increasing real interest rates--
could be expected to have helped the poor through increased
incentives to agriculture and to labor-intensive activities in urban
areas.
(c)   Social spending was squeezed in the fiscal retrenchment of the mid-
1980s.   Cuts were made affecting the quality of services and
increasing in-kind contributions by beneficiaries. Rural education
enrollment rates fell, and hospital occupancy rates, a major
indicator of the use and productivity of health services, also
declined.
(d)   Total budgetary transfers to the population declined, largely
because of the reduction in food subsidies. The reduction in food
subsidies prcbably hurt some of the poor, especially in urban areas.

48.         Tackling both income and social aspects of poverty will be a long-
term task. SAL-II will initiate action in three areas to continue throughout the
1990s: first, initial, broad reallocations of public spending toward activities
likely to have a strong impact on both income and social aspects of poverty;
second, provision of information and analysis; and third, support of the
Government's formulation of a poverty reduction strategy in its next five-year
plan. It is anticipated that the joint analytical work and the Government's
strategy will provide the framework for future Bank support for poverty
reduction. Future investment lending, especially in agriculture and the social
sectors, would be based on coherent economy-wide and sector-wide analysis of the
effect of the Government strategy on poverty reduction.
49.         The choice of public spending as the principal area for initial
direct action is based on a preliminary assessment of policy likely to be of most
importance to poverty reduction in the 1990s. A recent Bank report ("Morocco:
Reaching the Disadvantaged") emphasized the pivotal roles of investment in
primary education, nutrition surveillance and family planning in meeting this
challenge. In addition, in Morocco, stabilization has been largely achieved,
incentive reform is in its final phases and labor market distortions appear to
be moderate. Although greater understanding of these areas is needed, there is
a presumption based on international experience that the incentive reforms
undertaken to date--which will be largely completed under this SAL--will be
taking the country on to a more labor-demanding (and thus poverty-reducing)
growth path. Moreovrer, it is important that the focus be on concrete actions and
on areas in which policy can likely be improved significantly. Public spending
is a priority, and there is enough information to justify support for a broad
reallocation of spending. Further fine tuning of expenditures will be undertaken
as information becomes available.



- 17 -
50.         Actions in public ggending and finance. Three expenditure categories
with a relatively strong long-term effect on poverty have been identified:
primary education, health, and nonirrigated agriculture.   Spending would be
reallocated by  targeting  real  increases  for  selected  categories.    The
reallocation would be complemented in the education and health sectors by cost
recovery through user charges and/or insurance, and loan-based transfers at
higher service levels.
51.         The Ministries of Public Health and Education have been targeted for
real increases in investment spending. In education, primary enrollment rates
fell despite expansion in services in the 1980s. The most pressing problem is
the low quality of services, due in part to low absolute levels of nonsalary
recurrent spending. To redress this, real nonsalary recurrent expenditures per
primary pupil (Grades 1-6) would be increased by at least 15X a year in each of
the two budget years covered by the proposed SAL, thereby allowing the injection
of educational materials needed to improve service quality. To increase coverage
and meet the increase in school-age children, investment in primary education is
targeted to grow by 10X a year in real terms. In health, there is a generalized
problem of limited service coverage, because of low levels of investment in the
face of a continuing high rate of population growth, and low service quality
because of insufficient medicines and materials.   To increase the level of
service, the Government had already increased the health investment budget for
all expenditure categories by 201 in 1991 and has committed itself to raising it
by an average of 15X per year in real terms in 1990-93, a period of substantial
budget deficit reduction.   To improve quality,  real nonsalary recurrent
expenditures will be increased by at least 151 a year over 1990-93; this will
bring the ratio of nonsalary to personnel expenditures from its current value
(2:8) back to the ratio prevailing at the beginning of the 1980s (3:7).11
52.         Agricultural spending was selected as the public spending category
that most directly affects the incomes of the poor. Nonirrigated agricultural
investment spending is used as a proxy for spending categories likely to have a
greater impact on the poor, given that at least two-thirds of the poor live in
rural areas, and the vast majority depend directly or indirectly on rainfed
agriculture. Inveetment in non-irrigated agriculture will be maintained at least
constant as a share of GDP--currently at about 0.51.  The beneficiaries of
spending on irrigation services are relatively better-off farmers.>
53.         The categories selected for priority spending have been grouped under
the Social Target Expenditure Program (STEP).   The program corresponds to
existing budget categories to allow easy monitoring. Spending monitored will
include: (a) central and local government budgetary allocations for recurrent
and investment expenditures in the agreed categories; (b) the utilization of the
allocated investment credits for central government ministries (ratios of payment
orders to budgetary appropriations); and (c) the timely execution of the
investments delegated to local governrments. The STEP would be reviewed at the
time of the preparation of the 1993 Finance Bill to ensure that the SAL-supported
nI   Nonsalary recurrent expenditures by the Ministry of Public Health do not
include NGOs in the budget item "Umatrlel et d6penses dlverses".
12/   Irrigated agriculture is mostly the responsibility of the National
Irrigation Offices (ORMVAs), which are semi-public entities.



- 18 -
targets are achieved. Further reviews will be undertaken in the context of the
two Social Priority Sector Loans.
54.         Thre6 planned studies on the social sectors and agricultural
interventionis (see para. 56) would provide a basis for refining public spending
allocations for 1993 by the time of the second tranche release. There is no
conditionality on spending allocations for 1992 transfers (for example, feeding
and public works programs) because there is insufficient information on their
effectiveness. Evidence from other countries suggests that such spending could
be a valuable means of making transfers to the poor and can reduce vulnerability.
One of these studies would provide the basis for any agreements on spending in
safety net programs for 1993.
55.         Development of the information and anal!tical base.  Developing a
system to disseminate useful information on social conditions and starting some
focused analysis could prove to be some of the more lasting contributions of the
proposed SAL-II toward reducing poverty. The resulting information could support
refinements in the initial actions on public spending for the second tranche of
SAL-II, provide the basis for longer-term measures, including the preparation of
a poverty reduction strategy, and set in place an effective system for monitoring
changes in living conditions. The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)
provides an essential base. It will be used to develop a poverty profile (of
income and social aspects of poverty by activity, location, region, and so forth)
and to provide guidance on refining a set of monitoring indicators. This work
will then form the basis for preparing a Poverty Assessment and a strategy to
support poverty alleviation in Morocco.
56.         SAL-II would support the preparation of three studies which would
examine the relation between public policy and three fundamental aspects of
poverty: income, social conditions, and vulnerability to shocks. The studies
would analyze: (a) the effect of public agricultural services (including rural
infrastructure) and pricing on the poor; (b) the effect of the provision of
social services on social conditions, including the availability and use of
primary education and health services; and (c) the effect of public transfer
programs designed to provide a safety net for the poor on the vulnerability of
income to shocks. This will include feeding programs and public works.
57.         While the LSMS will provide valuable information on the conditions
of the poor at the beginning of the decade, further improvement of the
information base is essential to track short- and long-term changes.   Two
distinct, complementary approaches would be undertaken.   First, regular, if
simpler, surveys with an expenditure or income survey as a core module would be
undertaken at intervals of about three years. Second, a set of quickly available
indicators that provide indirect informatLon on both income and living conditions
would be collected and published regularly.   The system of gathering and
producing data--some of which would require fresh data collection--would be
developed during SAL-II. A subset of the indicators would be monitored in a
manner similar to that used for the macroeconomic indicators. These indicators
include the spending categories within the STEP and the status indicators in
Table 6.

58.         Social policy will be formulated as part of the development of a
poverty reduction strategy by the Government. An inter-ministerial Commission



- 19 -
was formed in June 1991 with the responsibility for preparing this strategy,
which is intended to become a core part of the next Five-Year Plan. The strategy
will be ready by the second tranche release.  The three areas selected for
support and analysis under the SAL (para. 56) will feed into the development of
the strategy, and the Bank will make available any international experience
relevant to the work of the Commission.

Progress to Date
59.         Following the 1983 crisis, the Government embarked on a far-reaching
trade liberalization program to correct the structural distortions that had hampered



- 20 -
economic performance. Supported by two Bank-financed Industrial and Trade Policy
Adjustment Loans (ITPA I and II) and SAL-I and ASAL-II, Morocco has since undertaken
trade policy reforms, significantly reducing the level and variance of protection
through changes in customs duties and in nontariff restrictions.
60.         Nontariff restrictions were substantially reduced, and the list of
prohibited imports (List C) was abolished. During the initial stages of reform, the
Government established a close dialogue with industrialists to gain their support
for the liberalization program and decided to eliminate import restrictions
gradually. This approach has led to the removal of import licenses on many products
through their transfer from List B to List A, which is the category of freely
importable goods.13 The share of freely importable goods in total nonoil imports
more than doubled, from less than 392 in 1983 to more than 88X in 1990; the share
of freely importable tariff positions, barely 50X in 1983, is presently more than
802. The most kmeaningful indicator is the share of domestic manufacturing output
protected by restrictions: it decreased from 601 in 1983 to 401 in 1986, and 202
in 1989. The liberalization of imports continued in 1990, when more than 400 tariff
positions were transferred from List B to List A.
61.         Import tariffs have been reduced and rationalized.  Between 1983 and
1990, uniform taxes [the Special Import Tax (SIT) and the stamp duty] declined
sharply, from 252 to 12.5X.   In parallel, the maximum customs tariff rate was
reduced from 4002 in 1983 to 452 in 1986. During the same period, the unweighted
average of tariff rates declined from 362 to 262, and the coefficient of variation
was cut nearly in half.
62.         The tariff structure, while much improved,  needs further reform.
Finished goods are more strongly protected by tariffs than are inputs.   The
combination of tariffs, exemptions, and SIT add tip to an average tariff of 362 for
consumer goods, 252 for intermediate goods, and 202 for capital goods; this results
in high levels of effective protection. Although the average production-weighted
tariff rate in the manufacturing sector is 282, 422 of the manufacturing sector is
protected by customs tariffs in the highest range.
63.         Similarly, despite considerable progress, quantitative restrictions
still provide higher protection to certain subsectors (Table 7). In 1990, over one-
third (342) of agricultural products were still on List B. Goods that benefit from
quantitative restrictions also tend to be heavily protected by higher tariff rates.
More than two-thirds of the goods on List B are subject to the 352-45% tariff rates.
Also, -many goods on List B (602 of tariff headings) are not imported. Furthermore,
industrial reference prices are listed for 367 tariff headings. Several of these
prices, initially set in local currency, have been completely eroded by inflation,
thereby reducing their protective effect.   However, producer pressures on the
authorities are intensifying as List B becomes shorter. Industrial reference prices
constitute a nontariff barrier which increases protection and decreases
transparency.
JJ/   Every year, a Programme Gdn6ral des ImportatIons (PGI) is published
containing two lists, A and B.   All products in List A are fully
importable; products in List B require an authorization from the relevant
ministry. List C, which has been eliminated, listed prohibited products.

Program to be Supported under the SAL
64.         The Government's objective is to build on the progress already achic- U
in trade liberalization and to complete the trade reform.   These efforts a-..
critical not only for preparing Morocco for Europe after 1992, but also for
achieving balance of payments viability and the convertibility of the dirham.
Continuing trade liberalization now is particularly arduous, for two reasons.
First, the international environment is dominated by the difficulties of the Uruguay
Round of GATT negotiations and the failure to reach a stand on the fundamental
question of agricultural subsidies. Second, the remaining tariff and nontariff
barriers represent the hard core of protectionism in the economy. Most of the few
products remaining on List B, for example, are those still restricted in developed
countries or covered by international agreements, such as the Multi-Fiber
Arrangement (NFA).

65.         Given the central role of government savings at the macroeconomic level,
trade reform will be constrained by the need to protect revenues from a shortfall
in 1992-93.   The measures supported under the trade component are designed to
ensure: (a) a decrease in prote-tion and more transparent and homogeneous trade
incentives; and (b) the facilitation of foreign trade through the removal of
nonprice rigidities that obstruct export and import activities.   The nonprice
rigidities would include problems in transportation, which affects international
competitiveness, and exporters' ability to respond to the new incentives resulting
from trade reform as well as simplification of customs and port procedures.
66.         Eliminating nontariff restrictions  (quantitative  restrictions  and
industrial reference prices) is the most important step in the trade reform. All
quantitative restrictions (QRs) are being fully eliminated in two stages in 1992.



- 22 -
The first stage, which includes 460 tariff positions, was implemented in
February 1992, before negotiations.   The second stage will be implemented in
December 1992 before second tranche release. A short negative list containing
products not freely importable because of security or national health reasons would
also be adopted. The elimination of all reference prices for industrial products
could result in the closing of manufacturing firms, given the fact that all QRs will
be eliminated by December 1992. The eventual elimination of reference prices has
been announced to the private sector, and to this end the system will be
rationalized and monitored jointly by the Bank and the authorities.   By second
tranche, reference prices would still be applied to a maximum of 10 of manufactured
production.
67.         Because of the lack of a C(ATT agreement on agriculture liberalization,
and Morocco's proximity to Europe, a few agricultural products would be subject to
a variable levy based on historical weighted averages of international prices.
These are cereals, oil seeds, and sugar, along with their main derivatives. Meat
and milk products will have a tariff equivalent applied which will be reduced
following the GATT calendar. Until now all of these products have been subject to
quantitative restrictions and thus isolated from world prices. The adoption of a
variable levy for these three products would make domestic producers more sensitive
to changes in international conditions. At the same time, it would protect basic
agricultural products during the transition to a more open world trade system, when
Moroccan producers will be able to compete with nonsubsidized farmers.   A
methodology to determine the variable levies for these products has been defined by
the Government and is acceptable to the Bank.
68.         To complement international agriculture liberalization, the Government
plans to complete the liberalization of domestic trade. This program includes the
liberalization of:   (i) prices and marketing of all products at all stages of
oilseed _roduction,  including  production,  collection,  transformation,  and
consumption. This also implies permitting the installation of new factories, the
elimination of refining quotas, and the liberalization of oilseed collection. This
liberalization coupled with the elimination of import quotas, implies the de facto
elimination of the oilseed monopoly, a very strong political power in Morocco;
(ii) mM& marketing and meat prices which have been regulated by the Ministry of the
Interior for national security reasons; and (iii) sugar imports to importers,
traders, and industrialists as well as the liberalization of prices for all products
and subproducts at all stages of production. This implies the abolition of the
existing monopoly for sugar imports.
69.         The tariff reform program has been designed to reduce the effective
tariff protection while taking into account the fiscal constraints in the medium-
term framework. It involves: (a) a reduction of the maximum tariff rate from 45X
to 351, excluding the SIT;14 (b) the introduction of a minimum tariff rate, while
maintaining exemptions subject to international and bilateral conventions as well
as those granted under the investment code, temporary admission, and export code;
and (c) a reduction from 26 to 9 in the number of tariff rates.
70.         Trade siUlification.  To facilitate foreign trade and make Moroccan
exports more competitive, there is an urgent need to simplify and standardize
foreign trade documents and customs and port procedures. The transit time of import
containers tlhrough the Port of Casablanca, for example, is more than 15 days, as
J4/ With the exception of a few agricultural products.



-23 -
compared to several hours in modern West European ports. The program supported
under the SAL is a key complement to tariff reform and the reduction of non-tariff
barriers, which will allow economic operators to respond better to changing economic
demands. The SAL-II program supports the design and implementation of five measures
to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of foreign trade transactions.
First, documentation would be simplified and a unified customs form adopted to
expedite existing procedures. Second, a system of selective checks and in-factory
inspection would be adopted to reduce the time containers take to leave the port.
Third, the Moroccan Government will adhere to the GATT customs valuation agreement,
in order to make import valuation less discretionary, and to reduce delays and
disputes with Customs. Fourth, the SAL will support a comprehensive assessment of
the Moroccan foreign trade administration and trade logistics system, through a
trade efficiency  and logistics  study.    Finally,  the  implementation of the
international road transport convention (TIR), will contribute to increasing the
degree of competition in, and the efficiency of, the transport sector.
PART III - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. COMPONENTS AiD CONDITIONALITY
71.         SAL-II components are described in Part II.  In addition to supporting
the macroeconomic framework described in Annex 2, the proposed loan would assist
reform initiatives in three policy areas: public expenditures, poverty reduction,
and trade reform.
72.         The adjustment program supported by the proposed SAL-II is described in
the  attached  Government's  Letter  of  Development  Policy  (Annex  1).    The
implementation schedule of the policy conditiorality is described in the matrices,
which are attached to that Letter.
73.         Thu macroeconomic framework and the financing plan for 1992 to 1993 are
in line with the objective of reaching balance of payments viability by 1993. The
short-term macroeconomic performance criteria, agreed under the IMF standby, are
consistent with the framework explained in Part TI(A). The Letter of Development
Policy includes five projected macroeconomic indicators that would be monitored
closely. The results of this monitoring will be included in the reviews of policy
implementation and economic performance.   The results of the review will be an
important criterion for satisfying the conditions for the release of the second
tranche of the proposed SAL II.
74.         Release of the second tranche would be conditioned upon the Bank' s being
satisfied with the overall progress achieved in carrying out the reform program.
In addition, some of the measures described in the policy matrices are critical for
the success of the program and, therefore, have been selected as specific conditions
for the release of the second tranche. These measures consist of the following:
(a)   maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, as determined on
the basis of the 5 indicators listed in the Letter of Development
Policy;
(b)   reduction of the maximum tariff to 35, elimination of quantitative
restrictions on all products (except for an agreed list, which would be



- 24 -
exempted for security reasons). and reduction of reference prices to 10l
of 1992 domestic industrial production;
(c)   carrying out in 1992, and adoption for 1993, of a public investment
program designed to strengthen the social sectors (as determined on the
basis of the STEP objectives outlined in the matrix attached to the
Letter of Development Poliey - LDP15), and facilitate private sector
development (as determined on the basis of objectives outlined in the
matrix attached to the LDP);
(d)   presentation to the Council of Government of a suitable legal framework
designed to provide a rational and efficient system of investment
incentives (see para. 40); and
(e)   application of procedures to monitor the social sectors on the basis of
agreed indicators (Table 6), and development of an agreed strategy to
improve the quality of life of less favored groups.
75.         The proposed loan does not provide financial resources for technical
assistance.   However,  since its implementation is complex and will require
strengthening the Government's technical and administrative capacity, technical
assistance will be sought from bilateral and multilateral grants (logistic study,
and poverty strategy studies). The terms of reference for this assistance have been
designed by the Government in close coordination with the Bank.
B. LOAN AMOUNT. COFINANCING. AND TRANCRING
76.         The proposed loan to the Kingdom of Morocco is for US$275 million
equivalent. This amount has been determined on the basis of Morocco's balance of
payments needs and prospects. The macroeconomic achievements of the past years have
allowed the Government to envisage balance of payments viability and convertibility
by 1993. These objectives will require sizeable reserves to face the transition in
1992-93. The proposed SAL and its cofinancing constitute an integral part of the
country's external financing program. The loan would be disbursed in two tranches,
US$138 million in the first tranche and US$137 million in the second one. The first
tranche would be available upon loan effectiveness, envisaged for May 1992. The
second tranche would be available upon meeting second tranche conditions. The
African Development Bank would provide cofinancing of about US$80 million.
C. IMPACT OF THE SAL: BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
77.         The expected benefits from the structural adjustment program are the
consolidation of macroeconomic stability, the achievement of balance of payments
viability, the resumption of voluntary lending, and the attraction of large foreign
investment inflows. The trade reform should generate the export growth necessary
1J/ These targets could be revised if, on the basis of the results of the
three social sector studies to be carried out during the reform program,
such a revision would be warranted and the Government and the Bank agreed
on the new targets.

to meet the foreign repayment obligations that will come due at the end of the
1990s.  An economy that is more open to foreign competition will be pushed to
increase its productivity. In addition, more homogeneous protection should benefit
agricultural development.
78.         The public expenditure program should support an expansion in both
domestic and foreign investment. The provision of basic infrastructure has been
shown  to promote  private  domestic  investment  in Morocco.16   Moreover,  the
opportunity for private investors to provide some of this infrastructure is an
additional incentive to the private sector.   Finally, the rationalization of
investment codes will ensure that incentives to invest in new productive activities
in Morocco will not favor some sectors over others.
Social Impact
79.         The social component has been desigrted to complement the reforms on
trade and public finance supported by the proposed loan. This component should
ensure that the overall economic strategy increases the participation of the poor
in development in the 1990s.   It should help create greater income-generating
opportunities for the poor and increase their capacity to respond to expanding
employment through improvements in human capital.
80.         Although the trade liberalization program should have a positive effect
on social conditions in the future, through job creation and the expansion of labor-
intensive activities and the elimination of rents, it might lead to some short-term
disruptions. One of the objectives of the social component is to assess whether
such disruptions have significant welfare costs, which groups are potentially
vulnerable and whether existing mechanisms provide an adequate safety net.
The Budgetary Cost of the Adiustment Program
81.         The fiscal effort required to implement the reform program being
supported by SAL-II is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outl4ned
previously. The fiscal impact of the public investment program, and of the trade
reform proposed in the SAL, is illustrated in Table 8 for 1992-93. The investment
program for the six ministries covered by the SAL requires an average increase in
budgetary expenditures of about DH 705 million a year. The trade reform, which
combines the reduction of tariff rates with the gradual elimination of quantitative
restrictions (QRs) on imports, is expected to lead to a modest increase in customs
duties--DH 187 million a year--mostly as a result of greater import volumes.
Overall, the reform package is expected to carry a budgetary cost of about DH 620
million a year on a net basis, corresponding to less than 0.3X of GDP. This cost
is consistent with stabilization objectives and balance of payments viability.
Risks
82.         The Government has been steadily implementing structural reforms for
many years. The proposed SAL-II would support the completion of the last major
reforms required to achieve steady growth.   Whether this is indeed the last
adjustment effort can best be judged by whether the country is able to end
rescheduling and resume normal international financial relations. That this might

be the last adjustment program needed is supported by the market's perception that
Morocco could be one of the new success stories.

83.         The country's vulnerability to external shocks is, however,  a
continuing and important concern. Its macroeconomic performance is strongly
influenced by changes in phosphate and oil prices and in international interest
rates. The adjustment program should reduce this vulnerability as the country
diversifies its sources of foreign exchange earnings through the development of
new export products and as its debt declines as a share of GDP and of export
earnings.
84.         A drop in international phosphate prices and a simultaneous rise in
oil prices would create serious balance of payments problems for Morocco. And
the Government could find it politically unsustainable to sacrifice growth to the
levels that might be required. But this situation is unlikely to occur for two
reasons.   First, historically, oil and phosphate prices have moved along
complementary paths. Second, although OCP is a public enterprise, its transfers
to the Government have not risen and fallen with phosphate prices.   It has
generally retained dividends for investment purposes when phosphate prices have
been high. The increase in Government savings, which would result from a lower
deficit, would mitigate the impact of these events on the balance of payments,
resulting in a domestic imbalance substantially smaller than might be expected.
85.         Another risk relates to the consolidation of the macroeconomic
progress already achieved. While the fiscal deficit has been substantially
reduced over the last decade, further progress is required at a time when foreign
financing of the deficit through rescheduling is going to disappear.   The
Government is committed to further fiscal efforts which have already been adopted
in the 1992 Finance Bill.



- 27 -
86.         Opposition to bott. trade reform and the elaboration of a social
strategy for the poor is likely. The trade reforms will lower protection, which
will affect the rents and profitability of certain industrial subsectors. The
liberalization of agricultural imports could bring greater variability to
domestic consumer prices. And the type of social expenditure measures supported
by the proposed SAL are geared to benefit the poor, not the middle classes. The
demonstrations in Fes and Rabat, in late 1990, were basically promoting middle-
class interests: the poor tend to be less vocal. But the risk of reforms being
reversed is small. The trade reform has been gradual, the Government has been
committed to it since 1983, and it has the support of an increasingly powerful
export lobby. The Bank's approach on social actions has likewise been gradual,
and it is now strengthened by the administration's awareness that the poverty
issue needs to be tackled to ensure the success of the medium-term development
strategy.
D. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
87.         The Ministry of Finance and the Bank Al-Maghrib (the Central Bank)
will be responsible for loan administration. The proposed adjustment operations
would be carried out through three categories of procurement based on the value
or nature of the contract.   For each, different methods of procurement,
documentation requirements, and Bank review procedures apply:
(a)   For large value contracts (exceeding US$5 million) of the public and
private sectors, simplified IGB procedures would be followed.
(b)   Public sector procurement, including public enterprises, valued
below the ICB threshold may be carried out following the standard
procedures of the purchasing institutions, which should be
acceptable to the Bank.
(c)  Private sector purchases valued below the ICB threshold may follow
established commercial practice. Quotations from eligible suppliers
from at least two countries would be sought (except where direct
contracting is appropriate).
(d)   Special procedures applicable to the respective commodity market
would be followed for procurement of commodities traded in
international commodity markets. However, these procedures would
not exclude other channels of competitive procurement that may offer
better delivered prices and be acceptable to the Bank, such as ICB,
locally advertised bidding, or international shopping linking the
delivered prices offered to those quoted in the relevant commodity
market at the time of delivery.
(e) Borrower may seek disbursements for imports under existing contracts
(except sole source purchases) awarded through the procedures
prescribed above.
88.         Following the appraisal and the clearance of standard bidding
documents, there would be no further reviews by Bank staff of particular bidding
documents or procurement decisions prior to contract awards to avoid delaying
transactions. The use of the loan for petroleum products and foodstuffs would
be limited to US$82.5 million equivalent, or 30X of the loan amount, provided



- 28 -
that the aggregate amount of withdrawals for petroleum producte does not exceed
US$27.5 million equivalent, or 10 of the loan amount.
89.         The loan would finance 100l of the foreign cost for eligible imports
(military and luxury imports would be excluded). The Central Bank would be
responsible for preparing and submitting withdrawal requests. The loan would be
disbursed in two tranches of US$138 million and US$137 million each. Withdrawals
from the second tranche would only be made upon fulfillment of required
conditions projected to be by early 1993. The closing date for the proposed loan
would be December 1993.   Retroactive financing limited to US$55 million
equivalent, or 20X of the loan amount, would be allowed for eligible expenditures
incurred before the signature of the Loan Agreement, but after July 2, 1991.
90.         Disbursements  for eligible contracts  above the equivalent of
US$5 million each would be made against fully documented withdrawal applications,
following standard procedures employed in adjustment lending. Disbursements for
eligible contracts below the equivalent of US$5 million each would be made on the
basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) from the Central Bank detailing
transactions in a given period, and of a certification of payment of the amounts
involved. Supporting documentation for the SOEs would be retained by the Central
Bank for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the
period in which the last disbursement was made and would be made available for
review by the auditors and Bank staff upon request. Withdrawal applications
would be consolidated and submitted in amounts of not less than US$1 million
equivalent. Contracts under US$50,000 equivalent would not be eligible for Bank
financing.
Accounts and Audits
-il.        The Central Bank would maintain records of all transactions under the
loan in accordance with sound accounting practices.  All accounts would be
audited annually by independent auditors in accordance with the Bank's auditing
Guidelines. Audit reports would contain explicit certification that claims
submitted under SOEs were made in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The annual
audit reports would be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the
close of each fiscal year.
Coordination with Other 4_encie
92.         The AfDB. Lending to Morocco by the African Development Bank (AfDB)
is increasing, included the cofinancing of SAL-I and would also include SAL-II.
Staff of the AfDB collaborated closely with the SAL-II appraisal mission,
participating in key mission meetings with the Government. AfDB staff also
participated in negotiations in Washington.
93.         The IK. An IMF standby agreement was approved on January 31, 1992,
covering a fourteen-month  period which expires  at end-March 1993.    The
Government's efforts supported by the arrangement are focused on attaining a
viable budgetary and balance of payments position by 1993 and promoting a
sustained economic growth. In order to achieve these objectives, the program
includes a comprehensive set of measures aimed at promoting investment and
raising productivity and restoring domestic and external financial stability,
involving a restrained monetary policy with the reorientation of credit toward
the private sector and a significant stengthening in the budgetary position. In
the area of fiscal policy, the Government is committed to a prudent wage policy,



- 29 *
limiting recruitment, and phasing out of subsidies. On the revenue side, the
measures aim at further increasing the elasticity of the tax system, broadening
the tax base, reducing the distortions resulting from tax exemptions and
improving tax and customs administration. The effective implementation of the
program is expected to enable Morocco to establish currency convertibility for
current account transactions in 1993.
94.         IFC'8 Relation with the Countxy.  Morocco is the eighth largest
beneficiary of IPC financing. Since Morocco joined IFC in 1962, the Corporation
has approved US$473 million in financing for 19 companies and financial
institutions, of which US$255 million was for its own account and the remaining
was for syndicated loans from other international financiers. From an initial
concentration in a few sectors--cement, development fiAince, and mining--IFC's
involvement has moved on in the eighties to a wider range of activities covering
textiles and construction materials as well as service industries in tourism and
shipping. IFC has also provided advice on capital market reforms and foreign
investment promotion. As the economic liberalization proceeds, a new generation
of activities would be added to IFC's operations.   These could include
privatization of public sector companies and new investments in hitherto public
infrastructure projects such as telecommunications, and gas and oil pipelines.
PAE  I* -Q E  BANK QPERATIONS
A. EXPERIENCE WITH PAST ADJUSTMENT LDING
95.         Since the balance of payments cris'.s in late 1983, the Bank has
provided Morocco with significant amounts of new money on a net basis. More than
half of the Bank lending has been in the form of six sectoral adjustment loans
and a structural adjustment loan.   Two Industrial and Trade Policy Loans
(ITPAs I & II - Ln. 2377-MOR, dated March 19, 1984, and Ln. 2604-NOR, dated
July 29, 1985) supported the reduction of protection in a wide range of
industrial subsectors and reorientation of incentives away from domestic markets.
The second loan also supported financial reforms aimed at mobilizing domestic
savings and increasing the efficiency of financial intermediation.   Action
programs under each loan were successfully implemented, although under the second
ITPA a measure that would have reduced trade taxation was delayed about nine
months.    Two  Agricultural  Sector Adjustment  Loans  (Ln. 2590-MOR,  dated
July 29, 1985,   and   Ln. 2885-MOR,   dated   December 4, 1987)   supported
rationalization of public investment programs within the sector and
liberalization of pricing and marketing to foster efficient growth. The adverse
social consequences of a reduction in consumer subsidies were minimized through
a detailed targeted program of food subsidies supported by USAID. The first loan
was successfully executed and disbursed six months ahead of schedule. Progress
on the second loan was slower, due mainly to delays in the implementation of the
targeted food subsidies program, the preparation of an optimization plan for the
sugar sector and the development of a plan of action for the oil seeds sector.
All conditions were met in November 1991 and the third and final tranche of this
loan was released in early December.
96.         An Education Sector Loan (Ln. 2664-MOR, dated May 9, 1986) was aimed
at restructuring sector expenditures so as to reduce the budgetary burden of
education at all levels, while making education more equally accessible to all



- 30 -
segments of society. Physical execution of the loan was satisfactory as was the
initial implementation of the new nine-year basic education cycle, the core
action of the program. But progress toward developing a satisfactory structure
of sector expenditures, including finding a viable formula for accommodating
higher education expansion, has been mixed and the restructuring is taking longer
than originally anticipated. Additional sector analysis and discussions are
under way.  The Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan (Ln. 2820-MOR, dated
July 27, 1987) supported measures to promote financial and administrative
autonomy of a large number of enterprises through enterprise restructuring and
policy reforms designed to change government-enterprise relations. Progress
under the reform program was generally good and the studies are now complete,
except for some of the sector surveys that were to provide the basis for further
restructuring efforts.
97.         A Structural Adjustment Loan (Lxn. 3001-MOR, dated December 2, 1988)
supported further progress in the liberalization of the trade regime begun under
the earlier ITPA operations, laid the basis for the sound internal management of
Norocco's debt, and assisted the Government in reestablishing priorities for
public investment and ensuring adequate funding. A comprehensive macroeconomic
framework was also developed with the Government. The SAL program was executed
satisfactorily and according to the schedule anticipated at appraisal.  The
performance results were better than the macroeconomic indicators selected under
SAL-I (para. 20). A Financial Sector Development Loan (Ln. 3365-NOR), supporting
the reform of the financial sector, was approved on June 3, 1991. It aims at a
major liberalization of the interest rates, strengthening prudential policies of
the banks, providing more autonomy to the Central Bank and reducing gradually the
borrowing privileges of the Treasury.
98.         On balance, experience with adjustment lending to Morocco has been
positive. The sectoral approach to adjustment has permitted the design and
phasing of operations in a manner that has allowed affected constituencies to
adapt the scope and pace of reforms, while accomm.datir.,; the absorptive capacity
of client ministries.  The loans have also provided suitable fora for the
dialogue on sector issues, which has produced viable policy frameworks for
project investments. Institutional autonomy promoted under the sector loans is
intended to enhance the efficiency of enterprises (particularly public
enterprises) that benefit from Bank-financed project assistance. The SAL helped
to integrate sector-specific discussions with the Government and to address
issues - such as expenditure shortfalls on essential public investments - that
were not amenable to a sectoral approach.
B. STRATEGY FOR THE 1990s
99.         our strategy for the 1990s is based on the following objectives:
(a)   finalize the adjustment lending (in parallel with the IMF program)
through SAL-II to support the remaining phases of the macroeconomic
reform;
(b)   subsequently, deliver an investment-oriented program, principally in
support of Morocco's three essential development priorities, namely:
(i)   assistance to the social sectors, in line with the Social Plan
supported by SAL-II;



- 31^
(il)  direct and  indirect  support  to private  sector  growth,
particularly to exporters; and
(iii) further liberalization of policies in a number of activities
(e.g., transportation, housing, municipal development) which
were not covered under the SAL programs;
(c)   tackle environment issues with special emphasis on the need for the
establishment of a far reaching water management program and the
eradication of industrial pollution; and
(d)   finance high priority infrastructure projects (telecommunication,
roads, etc.), which have a direct bearing on economic growth.
100.        This last adjustment operation will be complemented by a significant
social program. The situation of the poor, and vulnerable and the structural
issues in employment, education, and health call for a strong Bank program in the
social sectors. Interventions have been designed to improve the efficiency of
social programs.  Sector work on social expenditure priorities, the role of
women, and vocational training has been recently completed. The results of this
work define the main lines of future lending to Norocco. Ongoing lending in
rural primary education seeks to expand access for underserved populations and
to encourage the enrollment of girls. A health sector investment loan will help
to rehabilitate basic health services and provide first-level referral
facilities, especially for maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition,
and emergency services.  SAL-II will support the design and adoption of the
social sector strategy, which will be followed by additional investment
operations in the social sectors.
101.        In the follow-up loan in basic education approved by the Board in
FY91, greater attention will be given to expanding lower secondary education
opportunities and improving education quality for underserved populations.
Employment issues will be addressed through support for measures and financing
schemes that encourage links between training and productive sectors, stimulate
private investment in human resources, and promote labor mobility. Thus the Bank
has begun preparation of an FY93 project to develop, on a regional basis,
employment services and skills training. At the same time, the Bank will review
the regulatory framework for labor mobility and employer hiring responses to
market opportunities. Since many of the poor are women, ways will be explored
to provide them with systematic training that will ease their entry into the job
market. The Government is also working with the Bank, and with Japanese grant
fund support, to overhaul its food security and nutritional assistance strategy,
and find further ways of rationalizing rural education expenditures so as to
enhance quality and increase enrollments.  At the same time, the Bank is
supporting the design of a new health insurance system and new student loan
schemes, to increase social sector resource mobilization. These and related-
policy measures, building directly on the poverty reduction strategy to be
prepared by second tranche release of SAL-II, will be initially backed by a
proposed FY94 Social Priority Sector Loan, a large sector investment loan with
a heavy emphasis on incremental recurrent costs. This would be complemented by
subsector-specific investment loans in the social sectors of health, education
and employment and a Second Social Priority Sector Loan in FY95.
102.        The phasing out of adjustment lending and the return to a program
based only on investment operations to sustain future development raises the



32 -
question of how to manage the transition. The decline of disbursements from
adjustment lending to zero after 1993 would be partially compensated for by an
effort to increase investment lending. But with rising amortization payments,
total net disbursements would turn negative by 1994.   This trend can be
attenuated by streamlining project execution.
103.        After the implementation of the adjustment program, Morocco should
see an acceleration of economic growth through higher private investment and
increased factor productivity that will result from the development of an
outward-oriented private sector and the provision of basic infrastructure for
private sector activity. The acceleration in growth, which will go hand in hand
with the implementation of a poverty reduction strategy, should bring about a
rise in employment opportunities and living standards for the growing population.
The consolidation of a current accounit surplus after achieving balance of
payments viability should continue the improvement in external creditworthiness
and eventually restore voluntary access to commercial borrowing.
104.        In conclusion, it is worth stressing again that Morocco's progress
on the macroeconomic and debt fronts is impressive. After a final effort in
1992, there is an excellent chance that Morocco can resume normal financial
relations with the outside world and end the process of rescheduling. This could
trigger a further rise in the confidence of domestic and foreign investors and
accelerate outward-oriented growth driven by private investment. This positive
scenario is threatened by pent-up social needs and the substantial inequalities
of Moroccan society.   But if these needs are addressed under continuing
macroeconomic stability, in parallel with decentralization and privatization
efforts, the probability of success can be maximized. This is the basic strategy
that the proposed adjustment program is designed to support.

SECOND «TUCTURAL ADlMEQ   LoAN
LETFER OF DEVELOPMENT POICY
April 8, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President, The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. President:
The current outlook for the Moroccan economy is more promising than
at any other time in the last ten years. A good record has been established in
terms of growth and price stability, while at the same time the current account
and fiscal deficits have been reduced through the stabilization programs and the
structural reforms introduced since 1983.
Structural reforms in the productive sectors, notably agriculture and
industry, as well as the achievements in the liberalization of the economy, have
contributed to improved investment efficiency and significant growth in GDP per
capita during the second half of the eighties. Reforms in other areas, such as
education, the fiscal system, public health, public expenditures and the central
administration, have allowed both current and capital public expenditures to be
more efficiently allocated, to address the needs of develop snt and improve
access to social services. Finally, the ongoing reforms in the financial sector
have contributed to improved savings mobilization and resource allocation through
greater competition and the modernization of the financial system.
The progress achieved since 1983 has been encouraging and has given
us the incentive to manage the final phase of adjustment successfully so that we
can establish the condit ~s for sustainable high growth.  It is particularly
important that the economy, particularly the private sector, rise to the
challenge of the significant changes occuring in the international and regional
arenas. To meet these challenges, it will be necessary to sustain the current
increase in domestic and foreign private investment. This can only be achieved
through consolidating macroeconomic stability, completing trade reform, providing
the minimum infrastructure to support the expansion in productive activities, and
providing basic social services to enrich the human capital and improve the
quality of life of lower income households. A further condition for private
investment growth will be to reduce the budget deficit. This is a key element
to control inflation, free resources for the private sector and ensure investment
financing at a reasonable cost. It is also important to complete the reforms of
the public enterprise sector. Public enterprises that have been restructured or
privatized will be capable of providing the support and the quality of services
needed for the private sector to grow and to be modernized.
Both the growth and the balanced budget objectives will take into
account the need to attain balance of payments viability and to end reschedulings

in 1993. This is a pre-condition for the mobilization of voluntary financing,
especially in the form of private foreign investment, and for the alleviation of
foreign debt constraints.
To achieve these objectives, the Government proposes to pursue
restructuring efforts within a macroeconomic framework sustainable in the medium
term. The Government has therefore designed a program of reforms of public
expenditures, and foreign trade; it will also devise a social strategy plan. To
carry out the program, the Government is seeking the support of the World Bank
in the form of a Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL-II).
The Government is committed to implementing the policies and actions
described below and in the accompanying attachments, to achieve the objectives
of the program outlined in this letter. In this context, it plans to conduct
consultations with the Bank and the other cofinancing partners of SAL-II to
review the progress of the economy under the reform program. The program of
reforms in trade, public finance, and social sectors is described below.
MEDIUM-TERM NACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
The principal medium-term macroeconomic objectives are:
*     Acceleration of GDP growth rates, resulting from improvements in the
level and productivity of investment.
*     Sustained reduction in 'he_ public sector deficit, consistent with
the objectives of price stability and the financing of private
investment at a reasonable cost.
*     Balance of Dayments viability by 1993. allowing a rapid transition
to the convertibility of the dirham.   Continued current account
improvements can be achieved if both fiscal stabilization and
further liberalization of foreign trade are accomplished, thereby
reducing the need for foreign loans and increasing integration into
the world economy.
This macroeconomic framework, which has been extensively discussed
by the Government with the World Bank and the other parties cofinancing SAL-IT,
will serve as a performance milestone for the semi-annual consultations in the
context of the proposed loan. Th,e purpose of these consultations will be to
compare the actual results with the agreed objectives. If divergence between the
target and actual figures were to jeopardize global macroeconomic equilibria, the
Government would take remedial actions.
In order to help assess the economy's performance during the
adjustment process, five key indicators have been selected that reflect the
overall strategy of the program. The figures for these indicators are presented
in the Attachment. These indicators are:
(a)   The ratio of total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) to GDP;
(b)   The ratio of total gross public and publicly-guaranteed external
debt outstanding to exports of goods and services;



Page 3 of 13
(c)  The real growth rate of manufactured exports;
(d)  The level of net foreign assets of the Central Bank; and
(e)  The level of Direct Foreign Investment.
PROGRA1M F ECONOMIC POLTCY REFORM
The achievement of the macroeconomic objectives expressed by these
five indicators will depend on the implementation of a set of economic policy
measures in the areas of public finance, foreign trade and industry, and on the
articulation of a social strategy plan, all of which comprise the action program
supported by this second Structural Adjustment Loan.
Public Finance Reforms
In this second phase of the structural adjustment program, the
Government would like to strengthen the economic and social infrastructure
necessary for the development of the private sector as well as to improve the
incentives for the expansion of private investment.
The Government is aware that the achievement of these economic arid
social objectives requires a decrease in the budget deficit and an increase in
gross capital formation during the SAL-II period.   In this context, the
Government will continue to include in the budget only high priority projects
which give high economic returns.   The Government will also pursue its
decentralization policy by transferring to local government the responsibility
for certain expenditures such as the construction of rural schools and the
implementation of non-irrigated agricultural, health, and rural electrification
projects. Finally, the reform of the investment coles, described below, will
allow the rationalization and increased efficiency of the existing incentive
system while reducing the fiscal burden.
The Government's priorities in infrastructure and social services
will be reflected in the public expenditures program supported by SAL-II. The
investment credits contained in the Finance Bills for 1992 and 1993 will allow
the maintenance in real terms of the payment orders for the six ministries
inclu'ded under SAL-1I, including the transfers to local government. In addition,
the Government will explore the possibilities for increased private sector
participation in providing infrastructure and social services.
The Government intends to reform the investment and export incentives
system to simplify it, as well as to increase its transparency and efficiency,
and to reduce sectoral distortions and its fiscal costs. This reform will entail
either the replacement of the existing codes with a unified text or the complete
elimination of the investment and export codes. Measures to stimulate imestment
would be introduced in the fiscal system. These measures would include the
gradual reduction of tax rates and/or the generalisation of accelerated
depreciation allowances or a system of tax-free investment reserves.   In
particular, this reform will take into account the rationalization of customs
tariffs, including a reduction of the level and dispersion of tariffs as well as
the progressive reduction of exonerations. The investment incentive reform will
also involve a program of development of industrial zones as well as

the improvement of the infrastructure necessary for investment so as to reduce
the share of land in the total cost of projects.
A Social Strat -y for the Loyer Income Households
With the completion of the structural adjustment process, the
Government will row place increasing priority on fulfilling social development
objectives. The Government is committed to devising a long-term social strategy
plan whose policies and measures will be implemented during the forthcoming
economic and social development Plan. Three aspects of this framework will be
covered under SAL-II:   (a) the collection of information and its analysis;
(b) the reorientation of public expenditure to favor social sectors; and (c) the
formulation of a social strategy plan aimed at improving the living standards of
lower income households.
The Government recognizes that information on lower income households
should be collected and analyzed in order to better understand their
vulnerability. The 1990/91 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) is an
excellent source of critical informatioL; about these households. The results of
the survey will be analyzed, with the World Bank, to define a preliminary profile
of lower income households. This preliminary profile will be converted later
into a full-fledged profile of the social strategy target population using the
LSMS detailed.results and other sources of data.
The Government will also improve the understanding of the situation
of these lower income households by undertaking three studies using LSHS results,
which examine the effects of various public policies on these groups. The first
study will analyze the impact of agricultural policies; the Government will
discuss the results of the study and, together with the Bank, will define the
policies and investment strategies deemed necessary.  The aec   study will
examine the structure and the incidence of social public expenditures on lower
income households. In light of this study's results and the objectives of the
social strategy, the Government and the Bank, will determine the modifications
needed for social public expenditures. The thirt study will address the sources
of vulnerability of lower income groups to external shocks, and the efficiency
and cost of existing social protection measures. The results of this latter
study will lead to revisions in the existing social transfer systems and the
composition of public social expenditures.
The Government will set up permanent institutional mechanisms for
regular monitoring of the status of lower income households.   Monitoring will
be based on a series of short- and long-term social indicators to assess living
standards, such as salary levels, basic education participation rates, and the
proportion of births attended by Ministry of Health personnel (Table 2, Annex 2).
Continued monitoring of these indicators will allow policies to be adapted to
better meet the needs of lower income households.
To improve the quality of basic services and the access of the
disadvantaged to such services, the Government will reorient public expenditures
to those activities that have a strong impact on lower income households. In
health, public expenditure allocations for both investment and non-salary
recurrent expenditures will increase by at least 15X per year in real terms from
1990 to 1993.   In education, during the same timeframe, public expenditure
allocations for investments in primary schooling and non-salary operating costs
per primary pupil will increase in real terms by at least 101 and 151,



A NE1
Page 5 of 13
respectively. In rainfed agriculture, Government investments over the same
period will be increased in real terms by at least S 'per year.
These budgetary increases will be complemented by short-term actions
aimed at cost-recovery.  In health, the number of SEGMA hospitals has been
enlarged and an increased hospital tariff structure was approved. In order to
reduce the budgetary burden resulting from the present system of State financed
tuition grants, the Government is exploring alternative possibilities for
financing students' tuition costs and living expenses.
Upon completion of the above studies, the Government will discuss
with the Bank the need for revising the budget allocation targets of the Social
Target Expenditure Program for primary education, health, and rainfed
agriculture.
Finally, the Government will encourage the lower income households
to participate in the Moroccan economy by helping them to take full advantage of
income-generating opportunities. To this end, the Government will develop a
global strategy that will be the focus of social sector policies and will provide
crucial guidance for development policies throughout the nineties.
The Government has set up an Interministerial Commission as the
institutional mechanism needed to ensure this objective.  Its work, based on the
results of the above studies, will support the preparation of the next economic
and social development plan.
Trade Polic Reforms
The pronounced expansion of exports of manufactured goods included
in the macroeconomic framework suggests intensified participation by the private
sector. The Government therefore intends to complete the liberalization of
foreign trade which it started in 1983, simplify trade procedures, and increase
the efficiency of the transport sector in order to achieve the following
objectives:
(a)   to further reduce the level and dispersion of effective protection
and complete the rationalization by 1993 through (i) reducing the
maximum customs duty to 351;1 and (ii) reducing the number of tariff
rates to nine;
(b)   to ensure greater transparency and to rationalize protection through
the following measures:
(i)   the elimination of all remaining quantitative reetrictions in
1993 except for a limited list of products as specified in the
Foreign Trade Law.   Industrial reference prices will be
reduced in 1992 and 1993 for all but the equivalent of 10 of
total industrial production, in a few particularly sensitive
sectors.   The Government intends to pursue its efforts to
rationalize and reduce industrial reference prices with a view
to eliminating them; and
1/   With the exception of certain agricultural products.



Page 6 of 13
(ii)  for the agricultural sector, five basic agricultural products
will be submitted either to variable levies (cereals, sugar,
oilseeds) or tariff equivalents (meat and milk), based on a
methodology agreed to with the Bank. This methodology will
take into account the evolution of world prices for these
products.   For those products with tariff equivalents, a
reduction of 24Z of consolidated tariffs over ten years will
be implemented, starting January 1, 1995;
(c)   to facilitate and to reduce the costs of foreign trade transactions
by standardizing and simplifying administrative procedures, and
reducing delays. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Trade will
supervise a trade efficiency and logistics study. Mutually agreed
upon recommendations will be implemented at the earliest
convenience; and
(d)   to improve the efficiency of the transport sector (road, rail, sea
and air) in order to foster economic, and particularly export,
growth. To this end, competition in the transport sector will be
increased, particularly by implementing the TIR agreement.
The Government believes that the policies and measures described in
this letter will enable the country's economic and social objectives to be
attained. To facilitate the smooth implementation of the program, the Government
requests a Second Structural Adjustment Loan.
