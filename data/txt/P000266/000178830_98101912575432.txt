UPPER VOLTA
VOLTA NOIRE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE RURAL SECTOR
1.01      Upper Volta has an area of 274,000 km2 and a population of 5.9 mil-
lion (1981) growing at an annual rate of 1.6%, with urban population growth
estimated at 4%. While average population density is 20/km2, it rises to
80/km2 in parts of the central plateau, where over half of the population
lives. The urban population represents some 8%; the main towns are Ouagadou-
gou, the capital (275,000), and Bobo-Dioulasso (135,000). Per capita GNP was
US$180 in 1979, which puts Upper Volta among the 25 poorest countries of the
world. The proposed project would be located in the agriculturally favorable
southwest, in an area with a rural population density of 18/km2, and per head
incomes lower than the national average.
The Agricultural Sector
1.02      The agricultural sector is the dominant sector of the economy,
providing a livelihood for 80-90% of the population and producing almost 40%
of GDP and nearly all exports, with cotton and livestock leading the list.
Practically all agriculture is rainfed. Crop farming, under shifting cul-
tivation, produces 25-30% of GDP and 60% of recorded exports. Livestock
contributes 10% to GDP and 30% to exports. About 8% of the land, or 2.2
million ha, is cultivated each year. The basic foodcrops, sorghum, millet and
maize, account for about 90% of the cultivated area and 80% of production
value. Cotton, groundnuts, sesame, rice, and vegetables account for most of
the remaining cultivated area and production value.
1.03      Although the country is relatively flat, there are pronounced regional
differences in climate and soils. The climate changes gradually from sahelian
in the north, with average rainfall of 600 mm, to savannah in the south,
with average rainfall of 1,200 mm.  The low and erratic rainfall in the
north results in unreliable harvests and greater reliance on livestock for
survival, and consequently low population densities. There is also a striking
contrast between the central plateau and the western and southwestern regions.
On the plateau, crop farming is at a subsistence level because of population
pressure, over-exploited soils and unreliable rainfall, whereas in the west
and southwest soil and rainfall conditions are more favorable, population
density is lower, and production more market-oriented. The sahelian droughts
of the early 1970s emphasized these differences: in the north and center, they
virtually eliminated cotton production and reduced grain production by as much
as 35%; in the west and southwest, they affected production much less severely.
1.04      Cotton is the most important cash crop and a major export.  Produc-
tion began in the early 1950s and had reached some 36,000 tons in 1969/70.
During the following drought years, production stagnated at around 30,000
tons annually, but has since increased, with favorable weather in 1979 con-
tributing to a record output of 78,000 tons. Over 80% of this cotton was
produced in the western regions, and 40% was produced in the project area.



-2-
1.05      The livestock subsector, while of great importance to the economy,
faces serious constraints, mainly due to overgrazing, insufficient watering
facilities, the growing competition of foodcrops and the tsetse challenge
in the south. The forestry subsector, which provides firewood, building
poles, fodder, and a range of food and medicinal products, is threatened
by the reduction of the vegetative cover due to agricultural encroachment,
overgrazing and bushfires, shifting cultivation, and uncontrolled settlement
of migrants. The foodcrop subsector also faces considerable problems.
Upper Volta has become a substantial importer of grain; food-aid imports
amounted to 65,000 tons in 1979, about 7% of consumption. Self-sufficiency
in grain production is achievable in years of adequate rainfall although
marketing problems may inhibit the transfer of grain from surplus to deficit
areas. But, given the almost total reliance on rainfed cultivation, trying to
reach this goal in poor seasons as well poses difficult technical problems.
Sector Strategy and Bank Group Lending
1.06      Government strategy for the rural sector gives priority to (a)
developing rainfed agriculture by promoting improved farm practices and
integrating cropping and livestock activities; (b) stepping up migration from
the densely populated and relatively infertile north central plateau to areas
in the west and southwest which have lower population densities and better
agricultural potential; (c) expanding swampland and irrigated agriculture,
thus helping to protect the nation against the impact of major drought; and
(d) ensuring national self-sufficiency in foodcrops by these means.
1.07      Fertilizers are becoming an important factor in maintaining food
security. Increasing at 30% per year, use on cereals has reached 9,000 tons
and would need to rise by some 3,000 tons/year over the next five years to
assist meeting food requirements. Whereas the subsidy on fertilizers used on
cotton has been readily financed as a deduction from the producer price, the
increasing usage on cereals, and increasing level of subsidies (64% in
1981/82) in the light of rising world prices, has led to a situation where
Government has been unable to meet the costs, through its budget. However,
it has been able to effect ad hoc arrangements with donors, and intends to
allocate funds from the Stabilization Fund. During negotiations, Govern-
ment confirmed that the financing of the subsidies up to the 1981/82 season
was about to be finalized, and that the requirements for the 1982/83 season
would be met by external and internal sources. Government also indicated at
negotiations that it had, in accordance with obligations under the Second
Bougouriba Agricultural Development project (Credit 1097-UV), increased the
price of NPK fertilizer ex-central warehouse from CFAF 40/kg to CFAF 55/kg,
thereby reducing the subsidy to 57%. Government also confirmed its strong
interest in pursuing discussions with the Association and CCCE, concerning a
proposed Fertilizer and Food Policy credit, which would seek to assure the
financing of fertilizer supplies, whilst necessary price adjustments were
being made in an orderly and closely monitored fashion. The objective would
be a progressive reduction over five years of the subsidies to a level
supportable without external finance.

1.08      Bank Group Lending for agriculture has been in line with this
strategy and with a 1977 Presidential Decree which established rural develop-
ment as a priority sector. Five agricultural development projects have been
successfully completed. There are also five ongoing IDA-assisted agricultural
projects; all of which are located in southwestern Upper Volta: the West
Volta Agricultural Development Project (Credit 706-UV for US$3.6 million,
Credit 706-5-UV for Can.$3.0 million and Special Action Credit 49-UV for
US$3.0 million equivalent), the Livestock Development Project (Credit 557-UV
for US$6.0 million); the Forestry Project (Credit 982-UV for US$14.5 million);
the Niena Dionkele Rice Development Project (Credit 1013-UV for US$6.5 mil-
lion); and the Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project (Credit
1079-UV for US$16 million equivalent). They are being implemented satisfac-
torily, although the swamp drainage Niena Dionkele project has run into
serious technical problems of rice varieties, and the Livestock project had
difficulties with its group ranch component which necessitated a redesign.
The first two named projects are discussed at para. 2.12. The proposed Volta
Noire and Hauts-Bassins projects, whose appraisal reports are being processed
concurrently, are intended to build upon the West Volta project, which covers
both the Volta Noire and Hauts-Bassins areas. A Koudougou pilot project aimed
at testing improved farming approaches for the central plateau is also planned
for consideration by the Executive Directors shortly, and a research and a
further area development project are in the early stage of identification.
1.09      The five completed agricultural development projects represent
the first phase of Bank Group involvement in the rural sector. The Cotton
Project (Credit 225-UV) was successfully completed in 1977 with a rate of
return of 37%, and was the predecessor to the West Volta Agricultural Develop-
ment Project. The Rural Develoment Fund (RDF) Project (Credit 317-UV) was
started in 1972 and the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) confirmed that
the project had been successful in implementing a variety of scattered sub-
projects including wells, village storage facilities, bottomland development,
anti-erosion measures, small irrigation schemes and feeder roads. The rate
of return was re-estimated to be 19% compared with an appraisal estimate of
16%. The Drought Relief Fund Project (Credit 422-UV, approved in 1973), using
the RDF organization, successfully developed clean water supplies for 105
villages and built grain storage facilities and feeder roads. The PPAR noted
that the project's components had already been introduced under the RDF
project and that its main contribution was to put the RDF organization to a
test by giving it additional responsibilites, which it carried out satisfac-
torily. No rate of return was calculated for this project. The second RDF
project (Credit 640-UV, approved in 1976) was successfully completed in
December 1981. It continued the development of bottomlands, wells, and
anti-erosion works in the central plateau region of the north. A third RDF
project was negotiated in December 1981. The Bougouriba Agricultural Develop-
ment Project (Credit 496-UV for US$8.0 million and Special Action Credit 50-UV
for US$1.5 million equivalent) after a slow start was successfully completed
in 1980 with an estimated rate of return of 15% compared to the appraisal
estimate of 68%, now seen to be overly optimistic. It included infrastruc-
ture of 650 km of feeder roads, 119 village wells, 33 sector and subsector
warehouses, vaccination yards, and headquarters building.

Principal Agricultural Institutions
1.10      The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) has as its executive head
a Secretary-General who has under him national agricultural and livestock
support services including adaptive research. Parastatal marketing organi-
zations come under the responsibility of MRD, together with eleven semi-
autonomous Regional Development Organizations (ORDs), which cover the entire
country except for the lands adjacent to the three Volta rivers, which are
largely depopulated mainly because of riverblindness and are administered by
the Volta Valleys Development Authority (AAVV). Except in the case of those
ORDs in areas with externally-financed projects, the ORDs lack adequate
finances; however the heavy cost of maintaining an ORD is most readily justi-
fied in areas where economical technological packages exist readily usable by
farmers on a wide scale - that is, presently, only in the southwest. The
Ministry also suffers from inadequate budgetary allocations, and from a
shortage of trained personnel, in particular economists, and also accountants,
giving rise to difficulties in preparation of projects and policy analyses,
and in financial control during project execution.  Under the proposed proj-
ect, technical assistance at field level is included for monitoring and
finance (para 3.13); in addition, the Association is discussing with Govern-
ment the possible provision of support, training, and technical assistance
(economists and accountants) at central Ministry level.
1.11      An active program of agricultural research is undertaken by
externally-supported specialist institutions for cotton (IRCT), for irrigated
crops (CERCI), for sorghum and millet (ICRISAT), and these and other fooderops
(SAFGRAD and IRAT). The recent creation of the Voltaic Institute for Agri-
cultural and Livestock Research (IVRAZ) to coordinate research programs is
intended to give new focus to the need for research to ultimately result in
recommendations valid at farmer level; the Association is discussing with
Government possible support to IVRAZ.
1.12      Agricultural credit is being pursued by the National Agricultural
Credit Bank (CNCA) established on August 21, 1980, with a subscribed capital
(50% paid-up) of CFAF 1,300 million (US$6.2 million) held 54% by Government
or official Voltaic institutions, and 46% by the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO), the French Caisse Centrale (CCCE), and the West African
Development Bank. IDA has financed technical assistance for CNCA, which has,
in line with IDA recommendations, concentrated upon setting policy norms for
agricultural credit, training, and control of funds, and has successfully
completed its initial program in these areas. Day-to-day credit operations
continue to be the responsibility of the ORDs, particularly for selection,
disbursement and credit recovery. The Banque Internationale des Voltas, the
Banque Internationale de Commerce, Industrie, et Agriculture, and others
provide on a consortium basis short-term credit for the purchase of annual
inputs, and for the cotton marketing campaign.
1.13      Marketing:  Cereals are marketed mainly by private traders who
purchase grains in producing areas and sell them in the main consumption
points.  The system works fairly efficiently, with most farmers being able to
sell any excess production without difficulty. Government sees a need for a



- 5 -
floor pricing policy to ensure farmers receive a minimum return, and price
ceilings to keep consumers prices to affordable levels. Government sets
official consumer and producer prices, but does not enforce them as such;
rather it attempts to influence market prices through the National Cereals
Agency (OFNACER). OFNACER is however handicapped by a rigid policy of uniform
pricing throughout the country, insufficient financial and transportation
resources, and inadequacies in management. Nevertheless, it was able last
season, to offer to purchase cereals at the official price throughout the
country, and although it did not meet its purchase quotas, it may have induced
traders to offer higher prices than they would have otherwise. On the other
hand, Government through OFNACER, has sold food aid in urban markets at
official consumer prices, and this has caused producer prices paid by traders
(which are usually above the official producer prices) to be lower than they
would have otherwise been. The Bank has advised Government that it considers
that the role of private traders should be maintained, as at present, and that
OFNACER's role should be limited to marketing emergency stocks, selling food
aid to drought-stricken areas, and improving market information.
1.14      Cotton marketing, ginning and export is undertaken by a well-
functioning organization, the Voltaic Textile Fibre Company (SOFITEX), 63%
owned by Government, and 37% owned by the French Textile Fibre Development
Company (CFDT) who provide technical support and receive a commission of 1.5%
on all exports. The medium-term outlook for SOFITEX is currently good,
as recent currency changes have raised the price received in CFAF for cotton,
and the real dollar price for cotton is expected to increase in coming years.
Most of the world price increases would need to be passed through to producer
prices (paras 6.03 and 6.09). The current processing capacity of SOFITEX
is 95,000 tons of seed cotton, and should suffice for the next five years.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Government would review ginning
capacity in 1984 (para. 8.01). SOFITEX's significance transcends the cotton
sector since it imports fertilizers and insecticides for sale at subsidized
prices, not only for cotton (fertilizers and insecticides) but for cereals
(fertilizers) as well. Its performance in this role has assured prompt
delivery of inputs to farmers and thus contributed to the success of projects
in the southwest. The system is under strain however, especially for areas
not producing cotton, because of delays by Government in reimbursing SOFITEX
for the subsidy element for fertilizers used on cereals (see para. 1.07).
1.15      Seed Production.  The responsibility for technical oversight of seed
production nominally rests with the Directorate of Agricultural Services (DSA)
within the MRD, whose services are suppos'ed to assess the quantities required
by the ORDs, organize the production at multiplication centers, distribute and
certify seed.  DSA has not been able to fully discharge these responsibilities.
IRAT, CERCI, and IRHO are responsible for producing foundation seed of cereals
and groundnuts, and the ITTA grain legume team at Kamboinse is advising on the
multiplication of cowpeas. Seed is multiplied by four of the ORDs on their
owll farms, and elsewhere by seed farmers. Greater use of improved seeds has
been hampered for a number of reasons, including pricing policy, extension



- 6 -
attention, adequate liaison with research (for example recommendations on
locality choice are not known) and lack of attention to farmers' preferences,
for example palatability. Research results demonstrate the advantage of new
over local varieties in terms of yield, season length and drought resistance,
given proper husbandry practices and proper selection of locality and sites,
but not otherwise. Under the project, particular attention will be paid to
seed production (para. 4.14), and the factors affecting uptake.
Il. THE PROJECT AREA
Location and General Characteristics
2.01      The project area is identical wth the assigned territory of the
Volta Noire ORD, in the west of Upper Volta, covering an area of 33,100 km2
and a rural population of 589,000. The headquarters of the ORD is located at
Dedougou, and there are six agricultural sectors. The West Volta Agricultural
Development Project (Credits 706-UV, 706-5-UV, and Special Action Credit
49-UV), which also covered the Hauts-Bassins ORD, provided for the development
of the area with programs for cotton and fooderop development; staff training;
provision of a new ginnery; small-scale irrigation schemes; agricultural
credit; central and regional support activities; village grain stores and a
womens component. The results of this project are discussed in paragraphs
2.08 to 2.13 below. Details of roading, water supply, education and health
conditions (all of which are poor) and of land features are described in
the preparation report.
Farming Systems
2.02      There are two climatic zones in the project area, with rather stark
differences. The northern area, covering the sectors of Nouna, Kougny and
Tougan, is sudano-sahelian, with rainfall of about 530-740 mm per year. It
is suitable for sorghum and millet cultivation, and also groundnuts. The
southern area, covering the sectors of Dedougou, Solenzo and Boromo, is more
fertile with rainfall around 660-960 mm per year. Cereals including maize,
legumes, yams and cassava are grown, and this area is in the most important
cotton producing zone in Upper Volta. Only a very small amount of cotton and
maize can be grown in the northern area. Rainfall distribution throughout the
project area during the cropping season is unreliable, with, on average, one
year in three being unfavorable, a factor which is taken into account in
production forecasts.
2.03      There are 60,000 farmers in the project area, of whom some 24,000
have already been reached under the first project, and of whom 14,500 have
adopted improved practices. Altogether some 268,000 ha are cultivated with
about 80% under cereals, and in 1981 some 26,000 ha was under cotton, mostly
in the south. Farmers who have migrated to the south of the project area from
the central plateau send cereals to relatives who stay behind; following a
poor season on the central plateau, such farmers decrease their cotton produc-
tion in favor of cereals, in order to help reconstitute the granaries of their
relatives.



-7-
2.04      Cultivation is generally manual, but there are increasing numbers
of farmers using oxen and equipment. There are now some 9,700 equipped farms
in the ORD, with 60% in the south. In the south, maize is an increasingly
important cereal. Cotton remains the dominant cash crop in the south, and
covers almost 25% of the area cultivated. Cotton has stimulated the use of
chemical fertilizers on cereals, both directly and indirectly through rotation.
Cotton farmers generally get higher cereal yields, and their cereals produc-
tion appears to have risen following the development of cotton.
2.05      In the north, cotton cannot be grown, and the cash crop has been
groundnuts, although this crop has declined due to marketing difficulties and
only covers some 7% of the area cultivated. Cash crop development is also
hindered by yields for cereals which are on average about 40% below those of
the south. Consequently, farmers must allocate larger areas to their subsis-
tence crops to assure their food supply. Nearly 90% of the area cultivated is
therefore under cereals and only in exceptional rainfall years is any surplus
produced. Eighteen percent of farms are equipped with animal traction,
compared to 22% in the south.
2.06      In analyzing the farming structure of the area, a distinction is
drawn between farms, which represent the total situation of a large family
having fields and a common granary which are additional to the fields and
granaries of the farmers who are members of the large family. The concept of
farm, which embraces both the collective and individual fields, has been used
in assessing areas under cultivation, especially cereals area.  The concept of
farmers has been used in analyzing the demands upon the extension service
which must aim to get its message through to those who take decisions on
farming practices.  Farm and family size are fairly similar in both the north
and south. For lack of more precise statistics, the numbers of both farms and
farmers is taken to increase by 10% in the next five years, resulting in the
following figures:

2.07      Livestock:  Cattle and other livestock numbers are not accurately
known, estimates of cattle in the area for example range between 140,000
and 320,000. Most of these animals are in itinerant herds managed by Peul
herdsmen, and consisting mainly of animals owned outright by them, but also of
an important number of animals owned by farmers and entrusted to the herdsmen
for management. Health of the itinerant herd has been materially assisted by
annual vaccination compaigns funded under the Livestock Development Project
(Credit 557-UV), but the Livestock Service has found it more difficult to
respond to specific calls for treatment of sick draft oxen.
Previous Projects in the Area
2.08      The West Volta Agricultural Development Project, which covered the
Volta Noire and the Hauts-Bassins ORDs, has been successful in extending the
work of the preceding Cotton Project to stimulate more general agricultural
development in the area. The completion report on the Cotton Project (Credit
225-UV, approved in 1970) noted that substantial improvements in farming
practices had occurred, but that the extension message should be broadened to
cover foodcrops as well. The West Volta project did this, whilst maintaining
the impetus of cotton production. It has established a well-trained and
enthusiastic extension service, and has laid the foundations for further
development.  The impact on agricultural production has been significant and
has provided a satisfactory rate of return (see para 2.11 below).
2.09      Most of the physical targets of the project have been met by
end-1981, with the construction of 75 village grain stores, a training center
at Bobo-Dioulasso, and a new 20,000 tons ginnery at Dedougou. Components
not directly under the control of the two ORDs were less successful, however,
with only about 10% of the targets of the irrigation component met, and slow
progress in stimulating women's development; both reflecting organizational
problems. The component for support of the Ministry of Rural Development, and
the component to carry out studies and surveys, followed by pilot projects to
help new settlers, were not implemented, as detailed terms of reference were
not agreed between Government and the financing source concerned.
2.10      The rainfed agriculture program has followed a multi-crop approach
directed at both cotton and foodcrops.  Monitoring and evaluation have been
adequate for cotton, but weaker for foodcrops. For cotton, reliable estimates
are available on production and supplies of inputs. After reaching 35,000
tons in 1979/80, when weather conditions were very favorable, production in
1981/82 in the Volta Noire area fell to an estimated 24,000 tons, compared
to the before-project situation of 19,800 tons. 1981/82 results were low
because farmers switched to cereals production (para 2.03). It is difficult
to forecast to what extent this phenomenon may occur in the future; the
analyses of the ongoing and proposed projects are based upon 1981/82 production
of 24,000 tons representing the stable end situation for the ongoing project,
or an increment of 4,200 tons over the without-project situation. Cumula-
tive (non-adjusted) incremental production in the Volta Noire area over the
five years of the project to date is 30,000 tons compared to 29,000 tons at
appraisal. Yields have risen from 700 kg/ha to 900 kg/ha, largely through
increased application of fertilizer and insecticides, and early sowing.



- 9 -
For cereals, fairly reliable estimates exist for the application of inputs,
and these, together with an allowance for improvements in cultural techniques,
have been used to estimate the project induced production. Cereal yields are
estimated to have increased by 12% over the five years, and Volta Noire
production is estimated to have risen in 1981 by 17,000 tons/year, 5,000 tons
in the north and 12,000 tons in the south, compared to the appraisal estîmate
of 18,000 tons.
2.11      A recalculation of the Volta Noïre rate of return, using rates for
the cost of family labor consistent with recent analytical work (para 7.04(cj),
gives a result of 22%, compared to the appraisal estimate of 32%. Using the
appraisal assumptions for family labor unit costs, the return is 11%.
2.12      There are four other projects whicb have contributed or are to
contribute to the stimulation of Acc-omic dei looment in the area.  To re-
inforce the emphasis on foodcrops production, the French-financed Foodcrops
Project (Projet Vivrier) has financed a multiplication farm for improved
cereals seeds, additional extension agents, the construction of additional
village grain stores, using a low-cost design and self-help, and has also
financed fertilizers for use on cereals. The benefits of this infrastructual
build-up will accrue in further years, and the proposed project will follow up
its activities as appropriate. The Livestock Development Project has reduced
the incidence of animal disease considerably in the area. The Second Education
Project would construct 70 young farmers centers, and it is hoped that the
fruits of this project would soon begin to be seen in increased agricultural
productivity. Finally, the Second Rural Development Fund project has financed
a small amount of construction of anti-erosion works in the north of the ORD,
and this has succeeded in bringing back into production land which was previ-
ously too degraded for cultivation.
2.13      The West Volta agricultural project's major institutional achieve-
ments have been to organize and train the extension staff, under the training
and visit system, to separate out commercial functions from extension, and to
continue to see that annual inputs have been available; these elements have
combined to meet production goals. At the same time, the ORD has undertaken
successful initiatives for cost recovery of input distribution, and in promot-
ing informal cooperatives known as village groups, which are participating in
marketing, input and credit administration, and supporting communal activi-
ties. Experience shows that more attention could be given to reinforcing the
links between farmers, extension, and research, in order to encourage two-way
flows of information; that the operations of the extension service could be
further and progressively streamlined to increase its coverage further; and
that the integration of livestock and agriculture could be carefully given
increased emphasis. Organizationally there is a need to simplify objectives
and responsibilities, and to give increased attention to financial management,
both as to control over expenditures, and in further ensuring the success of
the cost recovery program, which the ORD initiated in 1980/81. These points
have been key elements governing the design of the follow-up project.

III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01      Following Government's request for a follow-up project in the area
and recognizing the unexploited potential that would still exist at the
successful conclusion of the ongoing project, the proposed project was iden-
tified by IDA in 1979. It was prepared in 1980 on behalf of Government by
consultants financed by FAC/CCCE, who submitted their report in July 1981. A
joint IDA/CCCE/FAC mission pre-appraised the project in May 1981. Appraisal
took place in September-October 1981.
3.02      This five-year project would build upon the success of the ongoing
project in expanding production and în fostering village group responsibility.
The current technical package, focused on manual cultivation and input use,
has been successfully adopted by some 14,500 farmers (of the 60,000 farmers in
the region) and still has scope for further incremental production from the
more receptive remaining traditional farmers, as well as continuing to improve
the techniques of those farmers already reached. The main themes of the pro-
posed project would be (a) to encourage improved manual cultural techniques
amongst traditional farmers; (b) to promote the integration of livestock and
agriculture, with the aim of fostering the use of organic fertilizer to
counter decreasing soil fertility, and the use of animal traction to remove
labor bottlenecks for weeding and transport of output and inputs; (c) to
promote as far as possible and closely monitor any measures which may lead in
the longer term to cheaper alternatives to present chemical fertilizers,
including the use of organic fertilizers, of rock phosphates, of crop rota-
tion, and research aimed at finding cheaper valid fertilizer formulations;
(d) to encourage the use of inputs including selected seeds in order to allow
further production increases by more advanced farmers; and (e) to foster
further village groups on the lînes of those already created, and to test a
small literacy program for some of these groups.
3.03      In defining project content, particular attention has been given to
the need, in view of Government's difficult financial position, for agricul-
tural development projects to recover their ongoing costs, in order to ease
the demands on Government budgetary support at the end of the project imple-
mentation period. The separation of the input distribution system from exten-
sion activities and the introduction of a cost recovery margin on inputs, are
important innovations which have been introduced under the ongoing project.
Also important have been the increased involvement of farmers or farmers'
groups in the distribution system at village level.
Summary Description
3.04      The project would specifically provide for:
Agriculture and Livestock Development
(i) full extension services to 22,000 new farmers and to continue, on a
reduced basis, extension services for the 24,000 farmers already
reached in order to further increase foodcrop and cotton production;



- il -
(ii) a program of adaptive research;
(iii) integration of livestock themes into the general extension message;
(iv) construction of contour bunds on 2,000 ha in the north, in order
to reduce soil erosion of light soïls;
Village Group Development
(v) an increase of village groups to 500 from 290, to continue develop-
ing farmers' responsibility for their own affairs;
Supplies and Credit
(vi) continuation of inputs and credit, with village level administration
being undertaken by village groups;
(vii)  production of improved seeds for sorghum, maize and groundnuts
through the recently established seed farm and through contract
farmers;
Management, Senior Training, and Monitoring
(viii) providing vehicles and a house for management needs; technical
assistance; training for senior Voltaic staff; and increasing
the effectiveness of monitoring;
Studies and to be Approved
(ix) undertaking studies, and establishing a mechanism for appraising and
implementing small subprojects to be identified and approved during
the course of project execution.
Detailed Features
3.05      Extension:  The extension service was successfully reorganized to
the training and visit system during the ongoing project, and expanded in
size, although this had not been foreseen at appraisal, to 125 extension
agents, or one agent for 424 farmers. The project will test less intensive
extension methods and progressively reduce staffing levels to 100 general
agents. The project would finance a light truck for the service chief, an
audio-visual vehicle, sundry other equipment, the salaries of the necessary
contractual staff, and the ongoing training of extension staff and farmers
representatives, for which 6 small training buildings would be constructed
and equipped (one for each sector).
3.06      Applied Research:  Research is required to test new varietal and
husbandry recommendations and to attempt to develop alternative cheaper
fertilizer formulations. To do this and to improve the links between research
institutes, extension, and farmers, two research substations would be started
under the project, and managed by the ORD, in cooperation with ICRISAT and



- 12 -
SAFGRAD at To, and with IRAT at Solenzo. The substations would test the
validity of research results through on-station testing/demonstrations, trials
by farmers, and through the extension service's program of demonstrations.
The project would finance initial soil testing, an office-store, fences,
junior staff housing, equipment, inputs and salaries for the substations, and
a contribution to the overheads of the research institutes relative to their
formal cooperation with the program.
3.07      Integration of Livestock Themes.  As major contributors to agricul-
tural progress, greater attention would be paid to production of manure, and
feeding and the health of draft oxen, as well as continuing to safeguard the
health of itinerant herds. The Livestock Service would assign a qualified
livestock assistant as Livestock Coordinator for the ORD, and six veterinary
nurses as sector coordinators, to work with farmers' sedentary herds. They
would work through agents nominated by villages, who would be trained in
livestock themes relevant to farmers. The project would finance training of
village agents, who would be supplied with some simple equipment, a vehicle
for the coordinator, and a small amount of other equipment needs.
3.08      Contour Bunds:  Experience with contour bunding for erosion control
and increasing soil fertility has been successful in the north of the project
area and in other similar zones in the country, financed under the Second
Rural Development Fund Project (Credit 640-UV). A program to construct bunds
on a further 2,000 ha would be carried out under the project. Farmers would
contribute their iabor for finishing off and subsequent maintenance. The
project would finance tractor operating costs for initial bund construction
and plowing, together with the costs of a four man surveying team, and a
tractor operator and a driver.
3.09      Village Groups:  An impressive feature of the ongoing project has
been the enthusiastic response of villagers in forming village groups (in-
formal co-operatives). There are now 290 active groups providing focal points
for extension, they undertake cotton purchasing, input distribution, and credit
administration, and operate collective fields and grain banks and use returns
from these activities for purposes such as dispensary building or well mainte-
nance. Under the project, an expanded but still small service consisting of
6 agents, together with the general extension staff, would seek to foster a
further 210 groups, and to test, at 36 villages, the feasibility of using this
structure to promote literacy, using existing educational material in local
languages prepared by the Functional Literacy Directorate in Ouagadougou. The
project would finance a light truck and other equipment, the salaries of
contractual staff, the construction by the groups of 1,250 maize cribs and of
200 warehouses for use in input distribution and as grain banks, material and
instructor training for the literacy program, and costs of supervision by the
Literacy Directorate.
3.10      Supplies and Credit Services:  The ORD's supplies and credit
services have started to apply a margin on supplies sold for cash, and an
additional margin for items sold on credit, during the course of the ongoing
project, in order to assure the recovery of costs. The supply service costs



- 13 -
are kept to a minimum because most fertilizer is distributed as back loads at
the time of cotton purchasing, and village groups are responsible for village
level administration of both credit and input distribution. Under the proposed
project, the ORD Supplies and Credit Services would become self-accounting,
permitting a more accurate determination of costs, and creating the possibility
of passing a soundly functioning supplies service, in a subsequent phase, to
full or partial farmer management, or even to private enterprise. The project
would finance the costs of renewing the service's fleet of two heavy and two
light trucks, and of building five further subsector warehouses, and some
minor equipment costs. All other overhead and operating costs of the service
are excluded from project costs and are to be by PY4 totally recovered from
beneficiaries (para 4.10); CCCE intends to finance some of these costs should
this prove necessary in PYs 1-3. The project would also finance incremental
quantities of agricultural inputs (mainly 3,450 tons of fertilizers and
140,000 liters of insecticides, which would be financed mainly by commercial
banks), and of veterinary inputs; and costs of 7,700 sets of animal traction
equipment and oxen, of 45 village grain mills, and of working capital for
30 village cereal banks in the north of the area.
3.11      Seed Production.  A seed farm was established in 1981 near Solenzo,
financed under the Foodcrops Project (para. 2.19). Production from this unit,
which would be expanded in size to 25 ha, would increase to 9 tons of improved
sorghum seeds, 16 tons of improved maize, and 19 tons of improved groundnuts.
In addition the unit would be responsible for arranging for production by
contract farmers amounting to 13, 15 and 30 tons of seed for each of these
crops. For the seed farm operation, the project would finance some small
construction costs complementary to those already effected by the Foodcrops
project, a pick-up vehicle, inputs of foundation seeds, fertilizers, and
insecticides, and staff other than laborers. Sales of output would finance
operating costs excluded from project costs - casual and permanent labor, and
vehicle and sundry operating costs.
3.12      Management, Senior Training, and Monitoring:  The project's manage-
ment would be undertaken by the Volta Noire ORD which needs to have visitors
quarters, and three houses for technical assistance staff. These would be
financed by the project, together with 10 vehicles for headquarters and sector
staff, and the technical assistance posts of technical and financial coordina-
tors (10 man-years), and audit costs. For Senior Training the project would
finance five 9-month study courses abroad, 10 short study tours, and on-site
courses from the Pan-African Development Institute's branch in Ouagadougou.
For Monitoring a team of ten enumerators will collect data, which would be
supplemented by the basic records kept by extension agents regarding the
farmers they are dealing with. A central staff of five would summarize this
data and ensure that regular quarterly reports on project activities are
prepared in a suitable form. The project would finance a four-wheel drive
vehicle and mopeds, equipment, five years of technical assistance> consul-
tancy, satellite or aerial analyses, and salaries of contractual staff.

3.13      Studies and to be Approved:  US$407,000 would be reserved for
studies, to be approved by the Association, CCCE or FAC as appropriate,
related to rural development in Upper Volta. Included amongst such studies
would be preparation of a program for migrants into the project area, and of
an expanded literacy program. US$550,000 would be reserved for execution of
an approved test program for migrants, and for small development actions pre-
pared during the life of the project, in response mainly to requests expressed
by farmers or villagers. These small projects would be approved by the
Association in line with the criteria set out at para 4.16.
3.14      Technical Assistance:  As there is a shortage of suitable Voltaic
staff, the project is likely to require technical assistance in general agri-
culture, and monitoring. External finance would allow for possible inter-
national recruitment for three key posts mentioned at para. 3.12 - technical
coordinator, financial coordinator, and monitoring coordinator (fifteen man-
years), at an average man-year cost of US$100,000. The coordinators would
also be responsible for training national staff, and after two years, the
need for continuing assistance would be reviewed with Government. Consulting
services mentioned at para. 3.13, auditing, and services, including photo-
interpretation mentioned at para. 3.12, (59 man-months) estimated to cost
US$670,000 at a man-month cost of US$11,000, are also included in project
costs, to assist amongst other things in preparation of pilot settlement
activites, and other projects.
Cost Estimates
3.15      Project costs, net of identifiable taxes and duties (from which the
project would be exemptl/), are estimated to be CFAF 6,636 million (US$22.1
million), of which CFAF 3,011 million (US$10.0 million) or 45% represent
foreign exchange requirements.
1/   Government indicated at negotiations that, in order to improve fiscal
management, regulations may be introduced revoking the present tax
exemption of projects, but if so, disbursement claims would continue to
be made on the basis of the tax-free situation, and the Treasury would
reimburse the project for the tax element.

3.16      Costs estîmates are based on prices and quotations obtained dur-
ing appraisal in October 1981, and revised to allow for anticipated price
increases to May 1982. Physical contingencies added to base costs are 15% for
civil works and farm equipment, and 10% for vehicles, non-farm equipment and
operating costs. Base costs plus physical contingencies were increased
overall by some 30% to a'llow for expected price inflation. Prices of NPK
fertilizer, urea and superphosphate, which are influenced by oil prices, are
expected to încrease more rapidly than international prices generally; local
inflation has been at higher than international levels, but is expected to
decline in line with international inflation. The following annual rates have

(US$6.8 million) would finance 31% of net project costs. Co-financing would
be by CCCE (US$1.9 million equivalent; 9% of project costs); a FAC grant
(US$1.2 million equivalent - 5% of project costs); and IFAD (US$7.9 million
equivalent - 36%). CCCE financing arrangements are expected to be in a three-
year tranche, followed by a two-year tranche, repayable over 20 years follow-
ing a ten-year grace period; interest would be at 1.5% p.a. during the grace
period, and then be raised to 2% p.a. IDA would act as cooperating agency for
IFAD in administering and supervising the IFAD loan, which would be on stan-
dard IFAD terns - repayable over 40 years following a ten-year grace period,
with interest at 1% p.a. External finance would effectively cover 100% of
foreign exchange costs (US$10.0 million), and US$7.8 million representing 64%
of the local costs of US$12.1 million. It would be a condition of effective-
ness that all conditions required for the effectiveness of the FAC grant and
IFAD credit, and the initial availability of CCCE finance, other than effec-
tiveness of the IDA credit, had been fulfilled (para 8.01). Upper Volta would
contribute 19% of project costs, 4% being from beneficiaries. A consortium of
commercial banks in Upper Volta would finance, under Government guarantee,
certain incremental input needs totalling about US$3.3 million equivalent to
14% of project costs. The lead bank in the consortium has verbally indicated
that this finance ls likely to be forthcoming.  Other incremental input needs
amounting to 1% of project costs will be supplied by private traders or through
a Ministry purchasing agency. Government confirmed during negotiations that
it would assure the financing of any of these transactions should this prove
necessary (para 8.01) - however, it is assumed that the financing of ferti-
lizer needs (para 3.18) will be adequately addressed, and it is anticipated
that no call would be necessary on Government finances for incremental input
requirements.

3.18      As just indicated, no call on Government finances is anticipated
for incremental input requirements. However, two sets of expenditures not
included in the definition of project costs must also be incurred, in rela-
tion to the project. The first set relates to recurrent costs of extension
needed to maintain the level of output already achieved, estimated at US$3.0
million in current terms over the life of the project. To meet this, Govern-
ment will need to directly budget US$0.9 million, and France, which has
provided general budgetary support to Government in recent years, is expected
to make US$1.3 million equivalent available to meet the balance. Government
agreed at negotiations to undertake to meet the costs of allowances for civil
servants assigned to the project, of salaries of contractual staff in the
headquarters management and accounting team, and other operating expenses
except those for applied research and anti-erosion works (para 8.01). The
detailed cost tables note the extent to which it is anticipated that French
finance will cover certain of the costs. The second set of expenditures
relates to the total inputs used in the project area, estimated to cost
US$31.7 million in current terms over the five years of the project. Assuming



- 18 -
that subsidies on fertilizers are reduced broadly as anticipated under the
Development Credit Agreement for the Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development
project (Credit 1097-UV), and that subsidies on insecticides for cotton are
maintaîned at about 50% of costs, we anticipate that beneficiaries could and
would directly pay US$20.0 million equivalent for inputs. Subsidies on cotton
inputs, estimated at US$9.2 million, would be paid in the first instance by
SOFITEX, although indirectly the costs are borne by cotton farmers in the form
of a lower producer price for cotton. The remaining costs, subsidies on
fertilizers used on cereals, are estimated at US$2.5 million, and would be the
responsibility of Government. At negotiations, Government confirmed its
strong interest in pursuing discussions concerning a proposed Fertilizer
credit, with the objective of an orderly reduction of subsidies over a period
of five years, to a level supportable without external finance. Under this
proposal, external finance would be provided during the transitional period,
and the effects of price changes upon output, farmers incentives, and consumer
prices would be carefully monitored, and reviewed annually with the financiers.

3.19      Because Upper Volta has difficulty in prefinancing expenditures,
an amount of SDR 300,000 (US$330,000), advanced from the IDA credit and
the IFAD loan, would be deposited in a special bank account under the joint
control of the ORD Director and the project's Financial Coordinator (para
4.03). As with other Upper Volta projects, the IDA/IFAD share of disburse-
ments would normally be made from the special account and reimbursements made
by IDA/IFAD to this account. Reimbursement applications, which would be docu-
mented as described at para. 3.22, would also be accompanied by (i) a state-
ment of movements on the account since the previous applications, with the
balance certified by the bank holding the account, and (ii) a reconciliation
showing that the balance represents the original amount deposited in the
account less payments awaiting reimbursement, or small working advances.
Should any disbursements be made for expenditures not allowable under the IDA
credit and IFAD loan, Government would redeposit the corresponding amount.



- 19 -
Assurances to these effects were obtained at negotiations (para 8.0l). The
opening of the account would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para
8.02). It is currently estimated that the funds of the ongoinig project will
be exhausted in the September quarter of 1982. As signing of the IDA credit
or IFAD loani may occur after this, retroactive financing of up to SDR300,000
(US$333,000) would be available to ensure that the funding of othierwise
eligible expenditures is not *jeopardized.
Procurement
3,20      Construction under contract (totalling US$0.2 million) would be by
competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA or
France. Experîence in Upper Volta has shown that works in rural areas of the
size anticipated do not attract international firms.  Materials for construc-
tion of warehouses by villagers or for force account construction (totalling
US$1.1 million) and vehlicles and equipment (totalling US$0.6 million) and
milling eqipment (totalling US$0.2 million) would be procured under inter-
national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with IDA guidelines for
contracts above CFAF 25 million (US$83,000), by local competitive bidding for
contracts between CFAF 25 million and CFAF 5 million (US$16,700), through
local competitive shopping for contracts under CFAF 5 million, and through
procedures satisfactory to France for contracts equivalent to US$0.3 million
to be financed wholly by France. Animal traction equipment (totalling US$3.4
million) will be procured through the partly IDA-financed parastatal, ARCOMA,
which produces competitively priced equipment suitable for Voltaic conditions.
Such procuremefit would, however, require the agreement of IDA that prices
remain reasonably competitive, prior to placing firm orders with ARCOMA. Any
procurement for agricultural equipment other than from ARCOMA would be as for
other equipment mentioned above.  Oxen and cereals for village grain banks for
which credit was granted (totalling US$4.0 million) would be purchased directly
by farmers in local markets. Incremental annual inputs of most fertilizer and
insecticides (totalling about US$3.4 million) would be procured as part of
bulk orders by SOFITEX through limited international tendering advertised and
open to suppliers in, and supplies from, all Bank member countries. This
methcd has been shown to assure the timely supply of competitively priced
products to Upper Volta. Procurement for other incremental annual inputs
(totalling about US$0.6 million) would be by Government under its procedures,
by private traders, or under procedures satisfactory to FAC or CCCE. Technical
assistance, audit services, bursary awards, and the reimbursement of research
institute expenses (.totalling US$2.8 million) would be arranged under pro-
cedures acceptable to IDA, FAC or CCCE. Local staff salaries and aperating
expenses totalling US$5.0 million would only be disbursed in accordance with
an annexed schedule in the Credit Agreement detailing the posts concerned,
their unit costs, and eligible operating expenses, or in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to France for expenditures equivalent to US$0,2
million to be financed wholly by France. Procurement arrangements for sub-
projects to be idenitified (US$0.8 million) will follow the same principles as
those discussed above, Bidding documents and proposed awards for contracts
estimated to cost more than CFAF 25 million (US$83,000) will require prior
approval of IDA, and are expected to result in prior review of over 80
percent of contract value.

Disbursements
3.21      The proposed IDA credit of SDR 6.1 million (US$6.8 million) and the
proposed IFAD loan (Volta Noire portion) of SDR 7.1 million (US$7.9 million)
would be disbursed in the ratio of 40:60, except for technical assistance
(other than aerial surveys), for which the ratio would be 100:0, as follows:

In the liglit of experience under the ongoing project, it is expected that
the credit would be fully disbursed over six years (Annex 2), or one year
earlier than the average experience in Upper Volta. The average reflects
delays experienced in start-up of new as distinct from follow--up projects.
3.22      Applications ftn withdrawals from the credit would be fully docu-
mented, except for scheiuled salaries, operating expenses, credit for oxen,
and labor and sundry expenses for force account construction, which would be
submittted with certified detailed statements of expenditures, whose support-
ing documentation woiljd be retained for verification by the project auditors
and for inspection ini Ehe course of project supervision. Bulk orders for
force account construction materials would be fully documented, and analytic
accounting used to establish unit costs (para 3.23).
Accounts, Audits and Reports
3.23      During the ongoing project, the project accounts have received
satisfactory audit reports, although a need for tighter financial manage-
ment had been identified. Furthermore, the ORD's own accounts, which were
inspected by international auditors for the first time in November 1981,
require substantial upgrading. Government would require the ORD to continue
to keep records consistent with sound accounting practices and adequately
reflecting its operations and financial position. The Financial Co-ordinator
(para. 4.03) would supervise a program to improve the ORD accounts. In
particular, accounting arrangements would be reorganized so that, from PY3
onwards at the latest, separate accounts would be kept for the supplies service,
agricultural credit, all other project activities, and the ORD in general to
ensure easier identification of project costs and disbursements. Assurances
as to this reorganization were obtained at negotiations (para. 8.01). As
with other agricultural projects in Upper Volta, the various project and ORD
accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
Certified copies of the audited accounts and the auditor's report would be
sent to IDA within six months of the end of each financial year. The audit
would comment upon the appropriateness of the accounting system and internal
controls, say whether IDA and IFAD funds had been used for their intended
purpose and confirm that the summary statements of expenditure against which
disbursements were made correctly reflect the detailed records kept by the
ORD. Assurances as to the above were obtained during negotiations (para 8.01).
3.24      As at present, the ORD would prepare annual budgets and work pro-
grams and submit them for approval by MRD and the ORD Board of Directors,
and to IDA for information.  The ORD would also prepare quarterly and annual
progress reports (including key monitoring indicators) and a project comple-
tion report with a format and content acceptable to IDA. The project comple-
tion report would be submitted te IDA not later than six months after the
closing date of the credit. Assurances on the above were obtained from
Government during negotiations (para 8.01).
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
4.01      The proposed project would be under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), but in contrast to the ongoing project
which also covered the Hauts-Bassins area, the proposed project would be



- 22 -
confined to the Volta Noire area.  (A separate project would cover the Hauts-
Bassins area). The Volta Noire project would be executed by the Volta Noire
ORD, headquartered at Dedougou, whose director would be the project director.
The existing, satisfactory, organizational structure is shown at Annex 3.
Farmer Participation
4.02      Building on growing farmers' interest, further farmer participation
in the project would be generated by the extension staff supported by audio-
visual aids and rural radio broadcasts. During the ongoing project, extension
services were reorganized along the lines of the training and visit system
which has been tailored for local conditions. Extension staff are now respon-
sible only for giving extension advice. At the same time, farmers in many
villages have formed themselves into village groups or informal cooperatives.
These groups undertake cotton purchasing, from which they receive some reve-
nue, and also input distribution and credit administration. Some of the
groups also farm a collective field, to generate further revenue to be used
for meeting various village needs such as well maintenance, or dispensary
construction. The ongoing project and the associated Foodcrops project (para.
2.12) have constructed village warehouses to aid in input distribution, and
cereals marketing. Under the project, a pilot extension program would be
organized to work through the collective fields of village groups, testing an
approach which could form the basis of a much lighter extension structure
under a subsequent phase. A small specialized service working directly and
also through the agricultural extension agents, would assist existing village
groups to handle their current activities, and foster further groups, and test
approaches to village literacy activities at 36 villages. ORD management also
maintains close coordination with the programs for young farmers training, and
support to the groups of young farmers after training, financed under the
Second Education Project (Credit 956-UV), and would also consult that project's
management concerning optimum low cost designs for buildings constructed with
village labor.
Staffing and Training
4.03      During the project the ORD staffing levels would be altered to
increase the coverage of extension workers, to give greater support to vil-
lage groups, to encourage production of improved seeds, and to reduce recur-
rent costs. External funds would provide for three internationally recruited
ORD staff, occupying on the authority of the ORD director effective line
management positions of technical coordinator for five years (compared to
three technical posts covering the function under the ongoing projects) and
two new posts:  financial coordinator (five years), and monitoring coordinator
(five years). The continuance of a technical post reflects thie importance
under the project given to all aspects of farm production, including continu-
ing an emphasis on the northern area of the region, and increasing the seeds
program commenced under the Foodcrops project. The two new posts reflect the
weakness of the present ORD accounts (para 3.23) and the importance of estab--
lishing financially viable input and credît distribution services, and of



- 23 -
upgrading monitoring of project results.  Each of Lhe covrdînaLors woulid bD
responsible for grooming the next level of staff, from whom their successors
might be chosen; if possible in a shorter period than five years. The situa-
tion would be reviewed after two years. Funds would also be provided under
the project for bursaries, and training support from the Pan African Develop-
ment institute in Ouagadougou. Assurances were obtained during negotiaticns
that the positions of Technical Coordinator, Financial Coordinator, and
Monitoring Coordinator would be filled under conditions acceptable to TD_-
(para 8.01).
4.04      General Training.  All current extension agents have either received
basic training at the Matourkou school near Bobo-Dioulasso, or more usually,
on-the-job training, coupled with courses at the regional training certer at
Bobo-Dioulasso (this center has been financed under the West Volta project,
and would receive continued funding under the Hauts-Bassins project). The
center would continue to be responsible for recycling extension agents to
improve their technical knowledge, and their communication and extension
methodology skills. Separate courses would also be given for the specialist
livestock extension agents. The ORD's training service would be responsible
for programs specific to the ORD, such as training and visit organization
specific to the region, or to other services such as supplies, and for arrang-
ing appropriate training or explanatory seminars for leaders of village group
or other farmers representatives as necessary. The service would make use not
only of the project staff in giving training; they would seek out suitable
lecturers flrom the many research and other institutions in Upper Volta con-
cerned with rural development. Training for credit activities would be
undertaken in conjunction with the National Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA).
4.05      Senior Training.  The training section would also be responsible in
conjunction with the relevant management staff, for organizing senior training.
Senior staff needs would be catered for in four particular ways. First, a
series of in-house seminars to be organized in conjunction with the Pan-African
Development Institute's branch in Ouagadougou, at say six-month intervals,
would aim at the project-specific application of modern management practices.
Secondly, funds would be available from the government contribution to ongoing
project costs, for visits by senior staff--usually within Upper Volta--to
other projects and research institutes, to exchange views and keep abreast of
new developments which may be applied at project level. Thirdly, funds would
aiso be available for 9-month bursaries and study visits abroad. Fourthly
funds are available. under the Second Education Project for training of agri-
cultural project management staff, and the training section will make known
its needs to that project's manager.
Agriculture and Livestock
4.06      Extension services are now operating under the training and visit
methodology. Agents follow a fixed program each fortnight, which ensures
that they will visit 18 groups of 6 farmers during the period. Each group
is followed intensively for a period of two years, after which time new
"intensive" groups are formed, with the old groups changing over to a lighter
form of follow-up extension on Mondays of each week. Two major new extension
approaches would be tested under the project, again in a flexible manner, with



- 24 -
modifications being made as results are analyzed.  FirstLy, a less intensive
extension system will be developed, based upon the col1ectîv-  fields of
village or young farmers groups (para 4.02).  In due course ïÀs should permit
a more efficient extension organization.  Secondly, complemeÏ-ritng this group
extension, a system will be developed of responding to requests by indivLidual
farmers for advice on particular problems. These two approaches will allow a
phased reduction during the life of the project of the numbe: of extension
agents from 125 to 100, reducing recurrent cost implications «--nd permitting
increased emphasis on seed production and applied research aff moriitoring.
4.07      The head of extension would, with the technical cooilinator, be
responsible for the content of the extension program, includuf_- the integra-
tion of livestock themes in the program. He would be supported by four
specialists: livestock, seeds, research/demonstrations, and tiraining/audio
visual techniques. The head of extension and the technical ca'srdinator would
themselves be resporsible for the technical aspects relatïng ro the crops
grown in the region.  The head of extension and the chief of researchjdemon-
strations would be responsible for liaison with the researceh institutes.
4.08      A qualified Livestock Assistant at ORD headquarters  ancd a veterinary
nurse in each sector would be responsible for (i) ensuring that certain themes
(see para 5.13) or activities are correctly handled by the g-aîrai extension
agents, such as dealing with external parasites, general heakh information,
proper feeding, and use of manure; (ii) coordination within   'L iivestock
service as regards vaccination against infectious diseases af against tsetse;
and (iii) working directly with village groups on all aspects concernlig the
integration of livestock and agriculture.  These staff would be assigned within
the Livestock Department for project purposes and would work -s a daily basis
with ORD staff.  Assurances to this effect were obtained at  2agotiations
(para 8.01).
4.09      Two research substations would be established unde. -he project,
and managed by the ORD, one -n cooperation with IRAT at SoleznzD in the south
of the ORD, the other in cooperation with ICRISAT and SAaGRAI- at To ln the
north. The programs of both substations would cover ail cro-p; grown in the
respective regions.  The project's research/demonstrations sec- ion would
have three main functions.  First, to maintain close contacIL Ainth the rele-
vant research institutes (para 1.11), and undertake an appropriate adaptive
research program.  At least one formal meeting would be held -ach year with
each relevant institution, during the off-season, at which Jh  previîus
season 's experience would be reviewed, and any plans agreed         the coming
year.  The meetings would also be attended by representativ;s of the extension
service. Secondly, it would continue to operate the field -r:ais program, on
the ORD plots and on the fields of village groups, young fa    s groups, or
indivldual farmers.  The program would be based upon the di~-ussîons with the
research institutes and extension service.  A particular ef          iould be made
to initiate FAO fertilizer trials in the project area.  Thir:-,-9 the sectic-
would continue to operate demonstration plots both on ORD a--s' on 0fareners'
fields, and to support the extension agents in establishing z   demonstration
plots each.

4.10      During the ongoing project, extension staff were liberated from the
functions of input distribution, allowing them to concentrate upon extension
proper. Under the proposed project, supplies and credit services would be
formally established, and required to be self--financing by the start of PY4.
A margin for the ORD has already been introduced on fertilizer sales, of CFAF
5Jkg for cash sales (to be increased to CFAF 8/kg in 1982/83), and CFAF 10/kg
for credit sales. The principle of a minimum 7% margin in PYI on unsubsidized
prices would be extended to other items including veterinary supplies, which
would require a greater margin because of relatively higher distribution coste
and on selected seeds. The higher margin on credit sales reflects the higher
costs assacl2ted with such sales. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that Government would apply a mark-up of at least 7% of unsubsidized prices of
inputs other than livestock annual inputs and seeds in PYl, and increase this
if necessary to ensure defined full cost recovery by the start of PY4 (para
8.01). Government would also prepare and discuss a policy paper concerning
cost recovery principles to be implemented for livestock annual inputs and
seeds from the beginning of PY4 (para 8.01). The Financial Co-ordinator (para
4.03) would devote much of his energies to the supplies and credit services in
their initial years. The services would operate primarily through the exist-
ing network of subsector warehouses and would provide equipment (ox- and
donkey-drawn implements and carts) for cash or medium-term credit; and sea-
sonal farm inputs for cash or short-term credit (fertilizer, insecticides) or
cash only (ox feed).  The services will continue to support and give priority
where they exist to village groups who act as retailers of supplies and
credit, receiving part of the margin to be introduced for taking on these
responsibilities. Participating villages would also be encouraged to conl-
struct small warehouses using local materials, together with roofing and door
material provided by the project (para 3.08).
4.11      Oxen for which credit would be granted would be purchased directly
by farmers, with the credit accounting being handled by the credit service.
Veterinary and related supplies would be handled by livestock service staff
with selected items also available through the supply service warehouses.
The supply service would supervise the accounting and cost recovery program
for all veterinary supplies and for seeds. At negotiations assurance were
obtained from Government on the above terms (para 8.01).
4.12      Short-term credit smoothly functions mainly through SOFITEX supply-
ing fertilizers (for use on cereals as well as cotton) and insecticides to the
ORD on credit, with repayment being made after cotton purchasiing. Recoveries
from farmers are around 90% in the last five years.  Farmers are not required
to make a down payment and, for cotton farmers, instituting a down payment
would create a problem of cash control without increasing recovery rates. The
recovery rate for non-cotton farmers is currently satisfactory but will be
monitored separately (para 4.15). It was agreed at negotiations that the
differential prices for cash and credit sales should reflect an extra cost to
the farmer for credit purchases equal to at least 11% p.a. (see para. 4.13).



- 26 -
4.13      Medium-term credit recoveries in the ORD have also been satisfactory,
also around 90% in the last 5 years. Funds for medium term credit both for ani-
mal traction and village grain banks under the project would be managed by
CNCA on behalf of Government, on a revolving fund basis; Government would
require that CNCA would use repayments for further medium term lending within
the project area. Transactions at field level would be the ORD responsibi-
lity, using CNCA recommended procedures and under CNCA supervision. CNCA
would be entitled to receive 3% p.a. from repayment to cover its expenses, or
such higher amount as its auditors find as the real costs, calculated on a
basis acceptable to the Association. The ORD's credit service would also be
entitled to receive 2% from repayments.  CNCA lending terms would be adopted
under the project. The existing practices provide for a 20% dowm payment on
oxen but not equipment credit; the effective overall downpayment is 10%. In
the case of loans for animal traction, repayment is in four equal installments
after a one-year grace period; in the case of loans for working capital for
cereals banks in the north, repayment would be in two equal ïnstallments with
no grace period. Interest rates are 11%, the maximulm permitted under the
preferential schedule of Central Bank regulations. This rate compares with
the forecast domestic inflation rate in 1986 of 10%. Credit is made available
through farmers' groups. A group whose members as a whole were less than 90%
repaid for the second previous year would not be eligible for a further loan
until the arrears had been cleared. Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that credit would be granted under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association (para 8.01). These terms and conditions, as outlined above,
reflect national policies, and are summarized in a side letter to the Credit
Agreement.
4.14      Improved seeds production and distribution would be a major theme
of the project, building upon earlier work including that of the Foodcrops
Project (para 2.12). The head of seed production would be responsible for the
seed farm at Solenzo, which would be expanded to 25 ha, in order to produce
improved sorghum, maize, and groundnuts certified seeds (Rl) from foundation
seeds (G3) obtained via the National Seeds Service (cottonseed is produced and
distributed by SOFITEX). The service would also be responsible, when demand
exceeds its own production capacity, for choosing and supporting contract
farmers or young farmers groups, who would multiply seeds.  The National Seeds
Service would certify both the ORD and farmer produced selected seeds, give
technical support, and ensure that adequate supplies of foundation seeds are
available to the ORD. The supplies service would be responsible for account-
ing and administering the cost-recovery aspects of seed production (para
4.13).
Monitoring and Studies
4.15      The ORD's monitoring unit has been undertaking the surveys used for
establishing the impact of the ongoing project. This analysis however was
essentially through secondary data. Before start-up of the proposed project,
a more comprehensive baseline survey wou'd be undertaken in the 1981-82 dry
season under finance of the Foodcrops project. Principal fuinctions of the ORD



- 27 -
unit would be: (a) to improve the data base required for proper project
management; (b) to assess the incremental production induced by the project;
(c) to monitor the farm labor situation and farmers' returns generally, and
for the use of fertilizer in particular, stratified by different levels of
farmers. This aspect would include systematically gathering market informa-
tion; (d) in cooperation with adaptive research, to pay particular attention
to the situation of northern areas, and in particular to establish a more
complete view of the cropping and non-cropping activities of farmers in the
north, the scope for profitable productivity increases, the capaciPy f'r
credit reimbursement, and the economic justification for extension activities
in the north; (e) to assess roading priorities, taking into account the likely
related impact on production, and the relative cost of alternative roading
proposals; and in particular to review the situation of the Dedougou to
Bobo-Dioulasso road; (f) to monitor the maintenance of village buildings
constructed at differing costs under earlier projects including the Education
project, and villagers' maintenance performance, in order to establish the
optimum design for low cost structures to be built and maintained with village
involvement; (g) to closely monitor and propose solutions for possible diffi-
culties in cereal marketing; (h) to survey the use of rural radio; (i) to
prepare proposals for small subprojects to be implemented after approval by
IDA; and (j) to participate as appropriate in larger studies for which outside
consulting assistance may be employed. In view of the small size of the unit,
only essential data would be collected. The unit would work in close coordi-
nation with the monitoring units at the Hauts-Bassins and Bougouriba ORDs, in
particular in the design of common methodology where appropriate, and allocat-
ing tasks between units where appropriate to avoid double work.
4.16      Subprojects to be Approved would fall into two categories, the
first being small-scale actions demanded by farmers. The selection criteria
would be those applied by the Rural Development Fund in more northern areas:
(a) need as evidenced by a request from potential beneficiaries; (b) effective
demand as evidenced by a willingness on the part of such beneficiaries to con-
tribute in kind or in cash to the investment; (c) technical feasibility which
implies a design simple enough to be realized by local farmers under the tech-
nical supervision of staff of executing agencies; (d) economic efficiency,
which is deemed to be satisfied by a minimum economic rate of return of 12% on
productive projects and, for infrastructure investments by a design judged to
produce the lowest cost per beneficiary; and (e) social acceptability, which
means that the ORD must examine proposed subprojects taking account of the
larger social context to ensure their acceptance by target populations. The
second category of subprojects would be actions complementing the principal
project objectives. These actions would essentially seek to remove possible
constraints to project execution that may arise, or to improve the efficiency
of execution. Examples are (i) a test program for migrants; (ii) strengthen-
ing the functional literacy program; (iii) improvements in rural radio cover-
age; and (iv) assistance to remove possible marketing constraints.

V. PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
Regional Differences
5.01      Rainfall in the three northern sectors of the ORD area is not
suitable for cotton and maize, except in a few locations.  However, population
pressure in the north is not excessive, adequate fallow exists, and soils have
potential for yield increases, although within lower limits than further
south, but higher than in neighboring ORDs to the east and north. In general,
these differences result in the following cropping patterns in the two zones:

5.02      Under the ongoing project, cultural practices of farmers improved,
not only in the case of cotton, whose cultivation in general is characterized
by greater attention to sound cultural practices and higher use of fertilizers
and insecticides, but also in the case of cereals, in particular sorghum and
maize.  ln the case of foodcrops existing farmers in the ORD can be classi-
fied according to their level of improved practices; level I being those who
adopted in-row seeding (to get better population densities) and who weed
properly, often as a by-product of rotation with cotton which also gives a
residual fertilizer effect; level II being those who in addition apply ferti-
lizers to foodcrops, and level III being those who also use improved seeds.
These improvements are more widespread in the south of the pro,ect area.

roodcrops
5.03      Sorghum is the country's principal subsistence crop and is grown,
usually intercropped with cowpeas, by all farmers in the area. The potential
of improved husbandry techniques has been demonstrated by research. Yields of
traditional varieties have been shown to increase under research conditions,
by as much as 757 kg/ha (43%) with proper spacing 1/, by 164-296 kg/ha (15-
17%) with the addition of manure, 2/ by 72 kg/ha (15%) with better weeding, 3J
and by 19-44% with better plowing. 4/ The results of three years of FAO
trials carried out under farmer conditions in the Hauts-Bassins area (similar
to southern Volta Noire) have shown an average incremental yield of 528 kg/ha
using 110 kg/ha of NPK (14-23-14) and 50 kg/ha of urea. At control plots
representing good farming practices without fertilizers, 880 kg/ha were
obtained. Similar trials carried out in the Koudougou area (taken to be
representative of northern Volta Noire) have resulted in an incremental yield
of 404 kg/ha with 110 kg/ha of NPK (14-23-14) and 50 kg of urea. Control
plots representing good farming conditions without fertilizers, gave 503
kg/ha.
5.04      New varieties (139-2 and 139-4) have been developed by IRAT at Saria
and are recommended in the 750 to 1,050 mm rainfall zone, together with the
improved local variety S-29. For the northern zone with rainfall in the 600
to 800 mm range, the ICRISAT variety E-35-1 is recommended for fertile soils.
Demonstration plots of 0.1 ha have been recently set up in the project area,
resulting in a promising interest of local farmers for these new varieties.
However, adoption rate assumptions, based on experience of the ongoing Food-
crops project, are modest, reflecting amongst other things a preference by
farmers to retain some long-stalked varieties for use in thatching and as
animal fooder.
5.05      Millet is usually grown in association with cowpeas and sometimes
sorghum. Being particularly drought resistant and able to grow on relatively
poor soils, millet is the most important risk avoidance crop. However, the
area under millet is diminishing in the south in favor of maize, because of
millet's lower yields (varying from 540 kg/ha to 775 kg/ha with good husbandry
techniques and animal traction), its limited response to fertilizers, its
costly and difficult harvesting compared to sorghum, and to a lack of improved
varieties. IRAT is developing seven or eight local dwarf varieties. P-93 is
nearly stabilized while three other populations have already been tested.
They have a potential of 1,500 kg/ha but are not yet suitable for diffusion.
The millet area is expected to decline by 2,100 ha under the project.

5.06      In the south, maize which was hitherto grown only near the household
rompound, where soil fertility is highest, is now becoming important in the
farm system.  Fields at a distance from the household compound have been sown
with the new composite variety NCB, able to grow in relatively less fertile
soils. NCB grown with fertilizers can yield 3,300 to 4,700 kg/ha under
research conditions, which is only some 12% better than a local variety
selection, Massayomba. However, under less fertile conditions, NCB is expected
to show significant advantages over Massayomba, and therefore would be recom-
mended in such cases. IRAT 80, another synthetic variety, has produced
research yields up to 4,400 kg/ha, and IRAT's active maize research program
has resulted in several very promising hybrid varieties such as IRAT 98, 100,
and 102. However, hybrid seeds have to be renewed annually, which is too
costly for farmers; therefore hybrid seeds will not be recommended.  Three
years of FAO trials carried out in the Hauts-Bassins area, under farmer
conditions, have demonstrated an average incremental yield of 835 kg/ha from
the application of 110 kg of NPK (14-24-14) and 50 kg of urea. At control
plots representing good farming practices without fertilizers, 1,050 kg/ha
were recorded.
5.07      Rice is grown almost exclusively on bottomland areas as a food and
cash crop. Traditional yields vary greatly depending on the degree of con-
trol of water. The bottomlands program under the ongoing project has had
disappointing results. Average yields are about 650 kg/ha in unimproved
swamps, rising to 1,000 kg/ha if better cultural practices are followed. Most
used varieties are Durado, Gambiaka and IRAT-10. CERCI research station
yields range from about 2,000 kg/ha to 3,000 kg/ha. Under the proposed
project, only limited emphasis will be placed on rain-fed paddy production,
unless results of promotion of improved varieties in the Hauts-Bassins area
indicates that greater attention to rice would be warranted.
5.08      Cowpeas, a very short season legume crop, are grown exclusively in
association with cereals because of severe insect attacks in pure stands.
Storage losses can also be considerable.  However, treatment with insecticides
can give good control in both cases and yields in pure stands can reach
1,000 kg/ha.
5.09      Groundnuts are grown for subsistence only.  Cultural practices are
poor and yields range are about 300 kg/ha in the northern area and 700 to 800
kg/ha in the south. There are prospects for significantly increasing yields
through better husbandry and use of local rock phosphate. FAO-trials in 1979
comparing 250 kg/ha of local rock phosphate (containing 25% of P205) to
140 kg/ha of the imported single super phosphate (containing 18% of P205)
gave incremental production of 413 kg/ha with local phosphate, and 298 kg/ha
with imported phosphate, a 39% advantage to the local product. In Koudougou
under similar conditions to northern Volta Noire, trials produced incremental
yields of 465 kg/ha, compared to 412 kg/ha with imported phosphate. These
results need confirmation since earlier IRAT trials with local phosphate were
not as promising. There is presently no agreement on the best system for
applying the rock phosphate, whose response might be increased further by
improving solubility through acid treatments. In short, the potential for
raising yields over the long term by reducing soil acidity has still to be



- 31 -
fully demonstrated, and for this reason the applied research program under the
project will include further work on Voltaic phosphates. In the north the
traditional farmer obtaining 300 kg/ha (unshelled) should be able to increase
this to 380 kg/ha without fertilizer, while the most advanced farmers are
assumed to be able to obtain 790 kg/ha. Recommendations will emphasize
the short cycle TE3 and TS32 varieties. No particular emphasis would be
placed on groundnuts in the south.
5.10      Cotton production has increased under the first project by 4,300
tons/year to 24,000 tons (para. 2.10). Average yields rose by 28% from
700 kg/ha to 900 kg/ha. The progress is due to (a) the greater attention,
contrasting with all other crops, given to good cultural practices and higher
use of inputs, (b) effective technical support from the ORD, IRCT and SOFITEX,
and (c) assured marketing arrangements and provision of inputs and credits.
For the southern part of the project area, IRCT's active cotton program has
resulted in a promising new variety, L 299-10-75, whose fiber productivity has
been recorded to be 6.3% superior to MK73, which has replaced BJA. For the
northern zone, the variety SRIF4 will be recommended. Resulting from trials,
IRCT is particularly emphasizing timely sowing, pointing out that a three-week
delay will decrease the yield by 30 to 40% 1/. ULV applied pyrethroids have
also been intensively tested for the last insecticide treatments, resulting in
a 6 to 8% yield increase compared to conventional insecticides, even when
insect infestation is low. Under the project, cotton growing area is forecast
to increase from 26,000 ha to 29,000 ha and the average yield is estimated to
reach 1,050 kg/ha, 14% above the present level.
Crop Recommendations
5.11      Under the project, for cereals and groundnuts, three complementary
technical packages will progressively cover the basic crop recommendations,
allowing farmers to improve their production by moving from one stage to
another as appropriate. Package I would emphasize better husbandry techniques
with the aim of increasing the water retention capacity and controlling soil
erosion and soil degradation. Higher and better use of organic matter, better
plowing, seed treatment, in line sowing with proper spacing and on the contour
where applicable, thinning and earthing up of cereals, together with greater
use of cowpeas in mixed cropping stands, and good weeding would be the main
themes of the package. Package II would continue to emphasize husbandry
techniques but would also introduce fertilizer use, whose high costs require
careful crop and area selection to ensure optimum profitability. Fertilizer
would not be recommended where Package I has not been achieved successfully.
Package III would further add improved seed varieties, whose use is expected
to be profitable when associated with Packages I and II. Recommendations for
farmers to use animal traction can be made independently of the other cultural
recommendations, as once a farmer following package I recommendations or above
is in a position to make the capital investment needed to purchase animal
traction equipment, he will realize worthwhile benefits.

5.12      Whilst research results in Upper Volta indicate the outside limits
of possible yield increases, and are detailed in working paper C 1, judge-
ments on the increases under farmers conditions within the project area rely
mainly upon a survey under the ongoing project, discussions with farmers, ORD
personnel, and researchers, and particularly in the case of fertilizers, the
results of FAO trials under farmers conditions, in zones comparable to the
project area. The overall judgements are in summary:

The weighted average figures represent the traditional farmers in the north,

intensive extension effort.  No production increases from farmers who have
already improved their practices and who will receive less intensive extension
have been taken into account.

5.13      Livestock:  In addition to increasing the use of animal traction
in crop production, the project would encourage farmers to adopt basic animal
husbandry techniques and integrate livestock into the farming systems. The
project would encourage manure use, the fattening of old draft animals before
sale, castrations to improve the herd, and the use of by-products from feed-
ing. Benefits from this program, which is pilot in nature, are likely to
mature slowly and have not been estimated, but a start must be made, and,
certainly, the greater use of manure should not be difficult to achieve. In
addition, the Livestock service would continue the general services of the
Livestock project against major diseases and parasitic infections for the
itinerant herds.
VI. MARKETS, PRICES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Markets and Prices
6.01      Production Targets:  The project would aim at helping farmers
improve their productivity on the crops of their own choice, and thereby
reach an aggregate project-induced production value equivalent in PY5 to
15,000 tons/year of sorghum, millet and maize (compared to 17,000 tons induced
in PY5 of the ongoing project), of 900 tons of cowpeas, and of 6,500 tons of
cotton (compared to 6,500 tons induced in PY5 of the ongoing project). This
assumes some recovery in cotton area from the low level recorded in 1981. The
actual production mix would vary in the light of farmers' reactions and rela-
tive prices, and would also include groundnuts production, for which an attrac-
tive set of recommendations to be extended during the project, indicates a
potential for 900 tons of incremental production in PY5. However, as the
history of productivity gains for groundnuts is the weakest, this potential
has been excluded in setting the aggregate production value target.
6.02      Demand for Foodcrops:  According to FAO forecasts, production of
sorghum, millet, maize, and rice, which did not exceed 1.3 million tons in
recent years, would have to rise to 1.5 million tons by 1985 and 1.8 million
tons by 1990, to meet expected demand. Although these estimates may overstate
the increase required, future demand is likely to grow at least as rapidly
as population, whereas output, if past trends continue, will lag behind.
Therefore it is probable that food deficits will occur in Upper Volta's rural
north and in urban areas, not only in years of inadequate rainfall, and that
dependence on imported food and food aid will continue. The project would
help reduce these potential deficits, especially in normal years.
6.03      Marketing Arrangements:  In the north of the project area, cereals
and cowpeas production would be home-consumed or sold through local markets
for consumption in the area; and the increased groundnuts production would be
sold within the area through local markets or via private traders to the
official purchasing agency, the Price Stabilization Fund. In the south,
cowpeas would in general be home-consumed; most of the increased cereals
production however would be surplus to the region, and would be sold through



- 34 -
Drivate traders or to the official buyer, OFNACER, for consumption in cereals
deficient areas outside the region. Under the ongoing project, these marketing
arrangements were adequate for the production volumes. However, it is esti-
mated that the volume of cereals which would be surplus to the area would rise
from about 5,000 tons at present to about 12,500 tons under the proposed
project. There is no evidence of farmers having faced problems in marketing
their surplus production during the first project, and it is assumed that the
present marketing arrangements will be able to absorb the forecast increase in
this surplus, although there is an element of risk that difficulties may
arise. In order to improve its efficiency, OFNACER is receiving a considerable
quantity of external aid funds and technical assistance. This will increase
its capacity to purchase cereals at official producer prices. Further, under
the first project, some 40 village grain stores will have been constructed,
and a further 50 are being financed under the Foodcrops project. This will
considerably increase farmers' ability to store their surplus, and additional
stores would be financed under the proposed project. Overall, it is considered
that these two factors, village storage and increased OFNACER purchasing
ability, would ensure that the projected surplus production of the proposed
project would be able to be marketed without major difficulty and at reason-
able prices. The project would carefully monitor the situation and propose
solutions to difficulties that may arise (para 4.16).
6.04      The prevailing market prices used in the farm budgets (Annex 6) are
1981 prevailing prices increased by about 10% to give 1982 levels, allowing
for inflation and increased official producer prices. For cereals, the
official producer prices are, at present, CFAF 10/kg below market prices,
and the difference represents the average premium paid by private traders over
the year. The premium is often greater, and the monitoring unit will need
to systematically gather pricing information, as the future trend of these
prices will be important for decisions yet to be made on the future level of
fertilizer subsidies. At present, market prices offer a better than 2:1
incentive to use fertilizers on cereals, i.e. the gross income to be expected
from the additional output resulting from fertilizer use is more than twice
the level of outlay on the fertilizer. It is important that such an incentive
be maintained to encourage the use of fertilizers. At the same time, because
of Government's financial constraints, it is equally important that the level
of subsidy on fertilizers be reduced over the project period.
6.05      Cotton:  Cotton would be exported through the well-functioning
market organization of SOFITEX. The medium-term outlook for world demand and
prices is favorable. Ginnery capacity should be adequate through the project
period (para. 1.14), but will be reviewed in 1984. The future trend of cotton
prices relative to cereals will be important to maintaining cotton production
and its export earnings. Currently, returns per man-day for cotton are lower
than for maize (Annex 5), but recent and projected rises in world cotton
prices imply that cotton prices could be raised. As pressure on food supplies
is likely to keep local cereal prices buoyant, it is important that this
situation be kept under close review. The subject is discussed further at
para. 6.10.

Farm Incomes
6.06      Project area farmers are very poor, indeed extreme]y so in the
north, as indicated by the indicative farm budgets discussed below. There are
currently almost no non-farm employment opportunities available to the farm
population in the region, and the major alternative to farming is to emigrate
to the Ivory Coast in search of work. In general, this alternative is only
taken up by young unmarried males, and this factor is taken into account in
the labor analysis. Under the project, each participating family would
cultivate 5 to 6 ha of land. Mixed cropping would predominate. Family labor
would be sufficient to meet expected requirements, although there will be an
increasing amount of labor hiring, mainly within the village, during peak
periods, notably the harvest and weeding. Indicative farm budgets are at
Annex 6. Three budgets have been prepared for each of the two project regions.
The first shows the traditional farmer entering the extension system, the
second shows a manual farmer leaving the extension system, having adopted all
recommendations, and the third such a farmer who leaves the system equipped
with animal traction. As would be expected, the farm budgets show radically
different situations for the north and south. For the south, net farm incomes
would rise from CFAF 276,000 (US$920) to CFAF 349,000 (US$1,163) under manual
cultivation, a rise of 26%, or CFAF 342,000 (US$1,140) under animal traction,
a rise of 24%.  Animal traction farmers  incomes would show a greater rise
should they increase their labor input to the assumed improved manual level,
and cultivate a greater area. Whilst data for farm budgets needs improving
(as the monïtoring service is to do) the strong demand for credit for animal
traction equipment in the area confirms the attractiveness to farmers of
adopting animal traction.  If the targets were achieved, per head income from
crops would increase from US$71/year to US$89 and US$88 respectively.
Labor requirements would rise in all cases, but returns per man-day would also
rise from CFAF 524/man-day under traditional techniques to CFAF 541/man-day
under improved manual techniques and CFAF 592/man-day under animal traction.
6.07      In the north, the crop incomes are considerably lower.  Farm crop
incomes would rise from CFAF 141,000 (US$470) to CFAF 169,000 (US$563) under
improved manual cultivation, a rise of 13%, or CFAF 159,000 (US$530) under
animal traction, a rise of 7%. The per head annual figures are US$36, US$43,
and US$41 respectively. These are rather modest increases, and should be
analyzed in conjunction with the crop returns shown in Annex 5. Two factors
are important here. Firstly, it is clear from these crop returns that there
are considerable improvements in returns to be made from fertilizer. However,
the greater uncertainties of weather, the need for greater site and soil
selectivity, and high financial outlays have caused a forecast of relatively
modest increases in fertilizer usage in the north. This may change if the
proposed research program is successful in finding cheaper alternative fer-
tilizer formulations for use in the north, thereby increasing the returns and
lowering initial outlays. The increases in farm incomes shown in Annex 6 are
based only on the present fertilizer recommendations, and are therefore the
minimum improvement that can be expected. Under these projections, returns
per man-day are expected to remain constant, at around CFAF 390/day, which is
well above the estimated opportunity cost of labor of CFAF 170/day in the
north. Moreover it can be seen that the traditional farmer is only just
covering his subsistence needs, and in bad years he would not do so, and



36 -
therefore even on these minimum projections, he will consider the increase in
total farm income worth the additional effort.  Existing tradi:îonal farmers
may have reached a labor constraint to their increasing income simply by
expanding the area under cultivation, on fields dispersed from their family
compound. Cultivating such fields could yield quite low retur-us for each
man-day of effort, including travel and transportation time involved. In such
cases, the attractiveness of adopting improved techniques should be judged not
against the average return on existing fields under traditional methods, but
against the alternative of new remote fields under traditional methods. A
supplementary source of income for farmers in the north is through sales of
livestock, which are made to meet cash requirements, aithough it has not been
possible to obtain sufficient information to include this factor in the farm
budgets. In all cases, in both the northern and southern zones, the rise in
farmers' cash incomes is considerable, rising 3 to 5 times -in ':he north, and
increasing by over 50% in the south.  Overall, therefore, the package for the
north is considered acceptable, aithough it is acknowledged tnGt it is a
project risk that the degree of responsîveness of farmers in tnat region could
be lower than forecast.
Financial Implications for Government
6.08      An illustrative Government cash projection is given Jn Annex 7.  The
analysis indicates that the project will generate a cumulatîve negative cash
flow of some CFAF 2.1 billion (US$7 million) over the next t-,Tenty years,
because it is assumed (i) that in order to encourage producers, cotton will
not be heavily taxed; and (ii) that revenue flowing from indirect taxes would
amount to only 10% of incremental incomes. On the outflow side, it is assumed
that project costs will need to be maintained in PYs 6-10 at one-third of the
PYs 1-5 level, and that Government will finance input subsidies on incremental
quantities of fertilizers used on cereals whilst phasing the subsidies out
over a five-year period. However, no possible external support for the
phasing out period is taken into account, nor are the financirng requirements
for the non-incremental quantities shown. From years 21 on, the project is
assumed to generate a positive cash flow for Government, reflecting the fact
that the debt service of the IDA credit and IFAD loan will be negligeable in
real terms.
6.09      The cash flow estimate takes into account revenue from three
sources: the mark-up on inputs, cotton revenue, and taxation on increased
farmers' expenditures.  There is a mark-up on inputs sufficiei-t to cover
associated costs, and taxation on expenditures is estimated Le yield the
treasury 10% of project-induced incremental cash income.  Cot--o- revenue
arises from five separate sources as follows:
(a)  cotton levy of CFAF 4,500/ton of seed cotton paid into the "Develop-
ment Fund";
(b)  expcrt taxes of CFAF 1,000/ton of seed cotton equivalent;
(c)  SOFITEX dividends of CFAF 140 million per annum, af -w`hich 13% is
attributable to the project, or some CFAF 18 miljc
(d)  profits tax of CFAF 400 million per annum on average on SOFITEX, of
which 13% is attributable to the project, or some  iF-F 52 million;
and



- 37 -
(e) a payment by SOFITEX to ORDs of 10% of any '"above the line" profit
greater than 7.5% of turnover, estimated to be about CFAF 20 million
on average, of which CFAF 3 million is attributable to the project.
6.10      The gross revenue line obtained by projecting SOFITEX dividenids and
profits on the basis of current world prices and Voltaic producer prices, has
been decreased for Years 3 onwards, on the assumption that the warranted
increases in producer prices will be made, and thus cotton revenue will remain
a minor source of Government revenue, in order to maintain a high level of
producer incentive. Government confirmed at negotiations that it would
exchange views with the Association from time to time on the level of all
producer prices (para. 8.01).
6.11      The cash flow estimate does not take into account any payments to or
by the Price Stabilization Flnd with respect to cotton. The cotton stabiliza-
tion scheme aims to assure SOFITEX a minimum profit of 7.5% of turnover in
poor years. In good years, 75% of the "above the line" profit in excess of
7.5% of turnover is paid into the Stabilization Fund, and a further 10% is
paid to the ORDs in proportion to theîr cotton production, with the remaining
15% being retained by SOFITEX. Whereas payments have been made to SOFITEX by
the fund over the last four years, it is anticipated that SOFITEX will make a
transfer to the fund in FY1981, and that this situation will continue over the
next five years. No changes in this relationship are recommended, as the
scheme has worked satisfactorily.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
7.01      The proposed project accords with Government's objectives of raising
domestic food production, increasing exports, and improving the quality of
rural life. The principal direct benefits would be the increases in annual
crop production (para 6.01).  At PY5 the net value of this production would be
about US$8.8 million. The project cost per benefiting family is US$465, and
per inhabitant of the region, all of whom are affected to some extent, US$36.
7.02      The project agricultural extension service would directly benefit
with full extension services 22,000 of the 60,000 farmers in the area, and the
24,000 farmers already reached would receive follow-up extension. The present
per head incomes in the south are about US$80, reflecting the poverty of the
subsistance farmers. Farm incomes would increase, and improved nutrition and
better standards of living can be expected. Incremental annual on-farm employ-
ment at full project development would be about 4,300 man-years or about
29 days/year for each active adult. This labor would be provided by project
farm families from available unemployed time, but there would be increasing
amounts of labor hiring between families, particularly during the peaks. In
the north of the area, the poverty is even more marked, and the farm budgets
indicate that the per head annual crop income of traditional farm families
could increase from US$36 to US$41 with improved techniques and animal trac-
tion. The farmers in the northern area can continue to be reached with



- 38 -
minimal marginal costs. In view of the 12% rate of return for the north,
monitoring will pay particular attention to this area, in order to review
achievement of the objectives and propose modifications if need be, and the
adaptive research component will seek to establish what improvements in
extension recommendations may prove attractive to farmers.
7.03      The road improvements and maintenance foreseen in connection with
the Fourth Highways project, the feeder road content of which is included in
this project's economic costs (para 7.04), would benefit a substantially
larger group of people than the direct beneficiaries. Similarly, the live-
stock component would benefit all livestock owners in the area. The village
group support component would bring greater self-reliance to the villages of
the area, and would help to relieve the ORD of some of its present tasks.
The technical assistance component would improve the capability of Voltaic
nationals to operate and manage development projects. Finally, the anti-
erosion component would aîm to reverse the trend of declining soil fertility,
and bring back into production lands presently abandoned because of soil
degradation.
Economic Rate of Return
7.04      The project's overall rate of return is estimated to be 21 percent.
A separate, incremental, calculation for the more difficult northern zone
gives a rate of return of 12 percent. Economic costs and benefits have been
valued in constant March 1982 prices (Annex 8).  The main assumptions under-
lying the rate of return calculations are:
(a) Incremental Basis: The level of production estimated to be achieved
in 1981/82, under the first project, is assumed in the economic
analysis of the first project to remain constant thereafter, making
due allowance for rainfall variation. First project economic costs
thereafter are those needed for activities to maintain this level of
production, including both ORD costs, and road maintenance, and also
farm inputs of labor, fertilizers, seeds, etc. These are taken to be
the "without project" costs and benefits, and only costs and benefits
above these levels are ascribed to the second project.
(b)  Project Life:  Twenty years' with PY5 output assumed constant for
PYs6-20.
(c) Project Costs: Estimates are net of taxes but include physical
contingencies. The full cost of all project components other than
applied research, studies, and subprojects to be appraised has been
included; the costs of the Regional Training Center have been
apportioned 50:50 to the Hauts-Bassins and Volta Noire projects.
Costs are in constant 1982 values; in the case of fertilizers
projects, real price increases to 1986 are allowed for. In addition,
the costs of 165 km of new feeder roads over five years, and mainte-
nance of 800 km of feeder roads plus the new roads, have been
included. This work would take place under the Fourth Highways
Project or its successor. Incremental farm labor has been valued at



- 39 -
CFAF 245/man-day in the south, and CFAF 170/man-day in the north,
reflecting the present level of underemployment in the area. The
observed market rate for unskilled labor in the region is CFAF
350/day in 1982 prices, and the current minimum or 'reservation'
wage is estimated to be about CFAF 120/day. The rates used in the
analysis lie between these two rates, and are determined by the
estimate of the general level of employment over the year in the
with-project case. Project costs after the end of the disbursement
period are those estimated necessary to maintain the level of
production achieved: 33% of average ORD costs; 100% of farm inputs,
labor, and road maintenance costs; and replacement of agricultural
equipment every seven years. The standard conversion factor in
Upper Volta of 0.874 has been applied to reduce the value of local
salaries and other local costs.
(d)  Project Benefits:  Only incremental agricultural output of farmers
reached progressively over the five years of the project is measured
by the analysis. Of the foodcrops area farmed by those reached
by the extension service, it is assumed that after a year, some
14% will be being cultivated under Level I techniques, 24% under
Level Il techniques, 10% under Level III techniques; with 52%
remaining under traditional cultivation. Road user savings are
not quantified; the roads costs are simply regarded as a necessary
component of achieving the incremental agricultural production.
Economic prices for cereals and cowpeas are on an import parity
basis, and for those for cotton on an export parity basis, in 1982
values adjusted for projected real price increases to 1986;
(e) Separate Calculation for the North: Foodcrops benefits are valued
on the basis of import substitution relative to consumption within
the zone; and only costs above those otherwise necessary for the
project are included, tnat is half the extension service, ,llage
groups, and animal traction components, together with input and
labor costs relative to the production in the north. Road mainte-
nance costs are not included, consistent with the assumption that
output is not surplus to the zone.
Risks and Sensitivity
7.05      There are. no unusual technical risks in the project, although the
northern part of the project area presents a generally more difficult due to
lower rainfall and poorer soils, reflected in the benefit assumptions.
Project proposals are simple and have already been tested within the project
area and elsewhere in Upper Volta with success. The main elements of risk are:
(i) inadequate use of modern inputs, in particular fertilizers, due
either to (a) supplies of fertilizers being restricted by the
finance available for subsidies; or to (b) price increases of
inputs not being adequately compensated by increases in output
prices. A proposed Fertilizer credit is being discussed with
Government, which seeks to address these risk areas; in the northern
area, which has a lower rate of return, fertilizer usage assumptions
are modest.



- 40 -
(ii)  constraints in the marketing system due to an inabi`ity or unwil-l
ingness of private traders or OFNACER to purchase the expected
surplus. The strengthening of village groups will facilitate
marketing, and the monitoring service and provision of funds for
subprojects to be approved gives some flexibility to respond to
paricular marketing problems;
(iii)  the responsiveness of farmers, especially in the nor h where
incremental returns are smallest; monitoring and adapt_ve research
will pay particular attention to this risk;
(iv)  a shortcoming of the livestock and land husbandry practices to
counter the possible decline in soil fertility, resu -ting in gen-
erally lower yields in, say, years 10-20 of the proj,ct life; again
monitoring and adaptive research need to address themselves to this
risk area;
(v)  delays in funding of operating expenses which in future are the
responsibility of Government, to be forthcoming unider procedures not
previously tested. The Association is discussing w?i h Government
measures to strengthen the financial planning and control of the
Ministry of Rural Development, and the investment planning process
of the country generally.
7.06      These risks would affect the benefit stream.  The overall rate
of return would drop to 18 percent if fertilizers were not used on sorghum.
If soil fertility declined, resulting in incremental yields 15 percent lower
in years 10-20, the rate of return would fall to 15 percent, The other risks
are more general, and to test the sensitivity of the project to these,
switching values have been calculated, which indicate how far the variable
tested can differ from its expected value before the project becomes eco-
nomically unacceptable. These tests show that the project would withstand any
one of:
(i) a 15% decrease in total benefits;
(ii)  a 25% decrease in cereals benefits;
(iii) a 39% decrease in cotton benefits;
(iv)  a 18% increase in total costs;
(v)  a 39% increase in economic costs of inputs; and
(vi)  a 85% increase in the costs of family labor.
Thus the project remains economically viable under a range o-f unfavorable
circumstances.

(10)  that Government would apply a mark-up of at least 7% of the unsub-
sidized prices of all inputs including veterinary supplies but
excluding other livestock annual inputs and seed, in PY1, and
increase this as necessary to ensure full cost recovery by the start
of PY4; and would prepare and discuss with IDA a policy paper

the IFAD Loan on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Associa-
tion (para 3.17 and Section 7.01(c) of Credit Agreement); and
(iii) that the special account had been opened (para 3.19 and Section
7.01(a) of Credit Agreement).
8.03      With the above assurances and condition, the proposed project
would be suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 6.1 million (US$ 6.8 million).
