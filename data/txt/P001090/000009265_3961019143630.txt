MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed technical assistance credit to the Republic of Guinea of SDR 4.5 million (US$6.6
million equivalent), to help finance a Higher Education Management Support Project. The
Government will contribute US$0.7 million equivalent. The credit will be granted on standard
IDA terms with 40 years' maturity.
2.    Country Background.  Guinea is a country with 6.2 million inhabitants and a
population growth of 2.8%  per year (1993).  It has long been one of Africa's most
conspicuous underachievers. Guinea has one of the highest concentrations of mineral resources
in Africa (bauxite, diamond and gold) and a high agricultural potential. The mining sector
accounts for 22% of GDP, agriculture for less than 30%. Yet Guinea's per capita income is
only US$537, with low social indicators such as life expectancy (44 years), infant mortality
(133 per 1,000 live births) and adult illiteracy (76%).
3.    Education Sector Background and Issues.  The education sector in Guinea is
managed by two separate ministries--one for pre-university and vocational education (Ministere
de l'Enseignement Pre-Universitaire et de la Formazion Professionnelle JMEPUFPJ) and another
for higher education and research (Ministere de l'Enseignement Supnrieur, de la Recherche
Scienuifique, et de la Culture [MESRSCJ). Significant progress has been evident in the past few
years for the programs managed by MEPUFP. Under the Education Sector Adjustment
Program, primary school enrollments increased by over 70% during the period 1991-1994.
Pre-university budgeting processes and financial management procedures were greatly
strengthened. A highly successful redeployment of 2200 underutilized secondary school
teachers and administrative personnel to primary school classrooms took place in 1992-1993.
Yet if the sector is showing much greater signs of health at the primary and secondary levels,
similar improvements have not occurred for higher education, where key indicators continue
to deteriorate. Reforms in 1984 moved the subsector away from a heavy focus on agricultural
training but did not result in desired improvements to quality and relevance. The percentage
of female students in higher education declined from 19% in 1984 to under 6% by 1993. The
sector has been plagued by student strikes and low quality. This comes against the backdrop
of a weakening macroeconomic framework and the Finance Ministry's recent record of
sporadic disbursements to the sector.
4.    Management of the higher education institutions run by the MESRSC (two universities,
three training centers, and a number of research centers) is highly fragmented. The respective
responsibilities of the Ministry and the institutions have been ill-defined, with a great deal of
overlap, resulting in conflict and organizational inertia. This has contributed to a precipitous
decline in educational quality and the relevance of course content. The situation has been
further aggravated by the total lack of communications capacity within the sector, and the



2
absence of reliable statistical data. In an attempt to resolve the ongoing management and
pedagogic crises, the Government decided in 1989 to grant greater autonomy to the
institutions. This decision was only partially implemented because of limited financial and
educational management capacity and because the type and degree of autonomy to be granted
was not clearly defined. During the preparation of the proposed project, a number of working
sessions have been held in order to frame these issues, and a clear statement of policy has been
prepared. This policy highlights the development of management capacity, information flow
procedures, and cost-effectiveness. It calls for a new and clear division of responsibilities
between Ministry and institutional personnel, with the Ministry assuming responsibility for
coordination and quality control and the institutions taking responsibility for management of
personnel, finances, program development and institutional development. The Government
and the institutions have expressed their commitment to early implementation of the new
policy.
5.    Project Rationale. Consistent with the priority it gives to primary education, the
Government of Guinea has over the past five years reduced funding for higher education from
over 25% to 17% of the education sector budget. This means that if higher education is to
contribute to the country's economic development, and to improving the quality of teachers
whom it forms for lower levels of the education system, it will need to operate with much
greater cost-efficiency and develop other sources of financing. The current project has been
designed for this purpose and will help Government move from a direct management role to
one of quality and financial control.
6.    Three alternative financing approaches were considered at the time of project
identification: (i) a Government proposal for an investment project (cafeteria facilities, library
infrastructure and holdings, and science laboratories) to cost an estimated US$10.8 million; (ii)
a proposal that studies be conducted under PPF funding for up to US$1.25 million, leaving
open any decision about subsequent investments; and (iii) the current technical assistance
project, including a communications component (US$6.6 million of IDA financing, US$7.4
million overall). The investment project was rejected as premature and economically unsound,
since it would have added over US$400,000 to annual recurrent expenditures while providing
little in terms of external efficiency gains. The sole reliance on PPF funding was considered
inadequate since it would have left a significant time gap between policy reform decisions and
investments in support of those decisions, jeopardizing the sustainability of reform initiatives.
It was also felt that policy reforms could not be adequately implemented in the absence of
viable communications. The technical assistance approach was considered to present lower
risk and higher potential payoff, since it would lead to early decisions about a new
configuration of institutions, a-nd provide for investment in needed human resources and
management capacity rather than in institutions or programs which might ultimately be closed
down. It would also lay the groundwork for any future investment and provide time and
technical guidance for a participatory process of fundamental change.
7.    Project Objectives.  The long-term  objective of the project is to establish a
reconfigured, strearmlined system of higher education and research, with greater institutional



3
autonomy, improved cost-effectiveness, and increased relevance for economic development.
Specific objectives are to help the Government to: (a) reorganize the Ministry and the
institutions of higher education based on identified need and resource availability; (b) build
financial and budget management capacity at the Ministry and institutional levels; and (c)
establish a viable information and communication system. The Ministry will assume a new
role focusing on the control of quality, cost-effectiveness, and relevance. This will mean
overhauling the flow of information, establishing criteria for evaluating teaching and learning
processes (linking the amount of financing to these criteria), and helping the institutions
become more academically relevant and financially competitive. This approach is seen as a
necessary prelude to any broader attempt to redefine curricular offerings, etc., or any major
investment operation, all of which will be undertaken only under a follow-up operation to be
contingent upon progress realized through this project.
8.    Project Description and Financing. The proposed operation is a technical assistance
project. It has been designed to provide support for development and implementation of a new
policy framework in Guinean higher education, and for institutional capacity-building.
Activities in support of policy reform will take place over the first two years of the project, at
which time agreement will be reached on implementation of a detailed policy agenda; capacity-
building initiatives will be spread over four years. IDA financing will be provided in support of
the following components: (a) institutional reorganization (US$3.6 million equivalent). The
process of reorganization began during project preparation with establishment of broadly
representative working groups at post-secondary and research institutions and at the Ministry
of Higher Education (MESRSC). The project will provide funding for in-depth analysis and
reform of university governance, finance, management, female participation, student services,
and user fees. It will provide consultant support for a collaborative process to reconfigure the
higher education  sector, prepare  new  recruitment criteria  and  procedures, develop
accreditation procedures, and redefine administrative responsibilities. The project will finance
training activities corresponding to these reforms; (b) development of an information and
communication system (US$2.0 million equivalent). Improvements in communication will
consist of:  improved data collection, analysis, and dissemination; upgraded institutional
information systems; and improved communications through installation of a campus telephone
system for the University of Conakry, radio communications equipment to provide an
inexpensive link among the higher education institutions and research centers, and installation
of electronic data communication through the Internet. The information system will be
compatible across institutions and will permit tracking of enrollments, expenditures and
program offerings. It will serve as the basis for allocation of criterion-driven recurrent and
investment funding. Funding will include institution- and central-level training; and (c)
establishment of budgetary programming and monitoring capacities (US$1.1 million
equivalent). This will include training of Ministry and institutional personnel, development of
budget models, selection and purchase of computer software and equipment. It will strengthen
the capacity of MESRSC to respond to priority needs and to reward best practices. Three PPF
advances totaling US$640,000 have been made available for preliminary studies under
components (b) and (c). The total cost of the project, including taxes and duties, is estimated
at US$7.4 million equivalent. IDA will finance US$6.6 million equivalent. Government will



4
finance US$0.7 million equivalent of which US$0.4 million equivalent represents taxes and
duties.
9.    Project Implementation.  The operation will be overseen by two committees:  a
sectoral steering committee created by ministerial decree in February 1994 and reorganized in
September 1995 and an interministerial committee created in September 1995. The steering
committee is composed of representatives from each institution as well as from the central
ministry (MESRSC) and is chaired by the Secretary-General of MESRSC who is designated by
the Minister of Higher Education for this purpose. It is responsible for day-to-day operations
of the project. The interministerial committee includes a representative of the Ministry of
Plan, who serves as its chair, three representatives of the MESRSC, a representative of the
Ministry of Administrative Reform and Civil Service, a representative of the MEPUFP, and a
representative of the Ministry of Finance. It approves budgets and work plans and ensures
interministerial coordination. The two committees receive technical and logistic support from
the project coordination unit, situated in the MESRSC. The Project Coordinator serves as
secretary of the steering committee and is responsible with the chair for preparing the agenda.
10.   Lessons Learned from  Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The capacity-building
focus of this project fits well with efforts to strengthen the Ministry of Finance and Plan
through the Economic Management Support Project (PAGEN). Experience gained during
implementation of the Education Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr.2155-GN, 1990), which has
been fully disbursed and closed June 1994, has shown that significant change is possible where
there is sufficient political will. It has also underscored the heavily politicized nature of the
higher education subsector, and the impossibility of effecting sustainable change at the
institutional level without the ongoing involvement of students, professors, administrators,
donors, business leaders, Ministry personnel and others.  This is consistent with lessons
learned about reform in Senegal and elsewhere in the region, which have shown the need for a
period of reflection and planning during which to bring in stakeholders and build national
consensus.
11.   Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement. The project is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 1, 1994. Recognizing the links
between education and economic growth, the Country Assistance Strategy emphasizes the need
to build a strong human resource base. It calls for higher education reform "in light of severe
shortcomings in the adequacy of higher education training vis-a-vis economic development
needs and high unit costs". IDA has taken the initiative at the pre-university level of ensuring
that donors have worked at high levels of collaboration with one another and with
Government, ensuring that sectoral investments and donor coordination occur within a
supportive policy environment. This project will extend the collaborative approach to higher
education and will strengthen ongoing Bank support for improving policy articulation and
resource allocation.
12.   Agreed Actions.  Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted the following
documents to IDA: (a) a draft policy statement for higher education and research; (b) draft



5
terms of reference for consultant services and studies for the first year of the project; and (c) a
draft implementation manual.
13.   During negotiations, IDA and the Government reached agreement on: (a) the policy
statement for higher education and research, including monitorable performance criteria and a
policy reform agenda; (b) termns of reference for consultant services and studies for the first
year of the project; (c) the draft implementation manual; (d) establishment of a management
information system to enable the MESRSC to track annual monitoring indicators; (e) the
interministerial committee's responsibility for ensuring that a mid-term review to evaluate the
progress made in implementing the project is carried out with IDA by December 1997 and the
steering committee's responsibility for prompt implementation of all measures agreed upon
with IDA as a result of the mid-term review; (f) submission to IDA of: (i) progress reports on
the implementation of the project not later than May 31 and November 30 of each year; (ii)
annual projected work programs and budgets not later than November 30 of each year; and
(iii) background documents for an annual review of progress to be organized and carried out
with IDA during the fourth quarter of each calendar year; and (g) submission to IDA of annual
audit reports, of reasonable scope and detail, within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
14.   As conditions for credit effectiveness, the Government will have: (a) established a
budget unit with internal audit responsibilities, and a computerized accounting system
acceptable to IDA; (b) adopted the implementation manual; (c) established a management
information system to enable the MESRSC to track annual monitoring indicators; (d) submitted
bidding documents acceptable to IDA for all major contracts to be procured through ICB
during the first year of the project; and (e) appointed an independent auditor under a multi-
year contract acceptable to IDA.
15.   Environmental Aspects. The Project does not present the prospect of any detrimental
impact on the environment and has been assigned a C-classification.
16.   Program  Objective Categories.  The operation will provide support for human
resources development through the rationalization of higher education.
17.   Participatory Approach. Most of the stakeholders involved in higher education have
participated in the preparation of the proposed project. Broadly representative working groups
were formed at each institution and have met repeatedly, providing significant input,
particularly in preparation of the first year of activities for the institutional reorganization
component. Members include students, professors, administrators, donor representatives and
Ministry and other Government personnel. The client consultation process will be a permanent
feature during implementation. Working groups will function throughout the project, with an
annual review process bringing together representatives of all stakeholder groups.
18.   Project Benefits. The economic analysis conducted during project preparation focused
on internal efficiency savings generated by the project.  The external benefits of the
interventions planned were not quantified because of the weakness of the existing data base, a



6
weakness to be addressed under the project. Internal savings and new revenues were estimated
in four key project areas: (i) private resource mobilization, (ii) the opening of University
social services management to competitive bidding, (iii) restriction of scholarships, and (iv)
increased productivity of teaching and non-teaching personnel. It was estimated that cost-
savings and resource mobilization will amount to US$6.4 million over the life of the project,
and that additional recurrent costs under the project will amount to US$1.6 million, for net
savings over four years of approximately US$4.8 million. Key performance indicators have
been included in Government's Policy Statement for Higher Education and Research, and are
listed in Schedule B.
19.   The project will help the Guinean government ensure that future investments in the
sector are focused on sustainable activities and programs that can be shown to have an impact
on economic development. By introducing cost recovery measures, it obliges the sector to
initiate demand-driven programs which provide graduates with marketable skills. Through
development of criterion-based funding, along with accreditation mechanisms, the project
provides incentives to individual institutions to achieve long overdue cost efficiencies. Along
with the budgetary targets included in the Government's policy statement for higher education,
to be monitored throughout the project, this will further ensure that the absolute priority given
to primary education is maintained, and that funds are freed for the continued expansion of
primary and secondary education and for improvements in the quality of higher education.
Recasting the role of the MESRSC as one of support and quality control, rather than direct
management will reduce political tensions throughout the entire sector and provide a more
stable environment, conducive to the long-term sustainability of reform efforts.
20.   Project Sustainability. The benefits from the cost-efficiency objectives of this project
are clearly sustainable, since the project will create internal savings and new revenues well into
the future that are far greater than the additional recurrent costs it will generate. Political
sustainability has been addressed through broad-based participation of stakeholders in
developing a policy statement for higher education and research and through cross-sectoral
membership in the committee overseeing the project. On the other hand, the sustainability of
efforts to improve the overall relevance of higher education will require a longer-term
perspective and additional investments in the future to strengthen infrastructure and provide
teaching and laboratory materials. Future investments would be contingent on the successful
implementation of policy initiatives under the current project. These measures include the
transfer of most financial management responsibilities to the institutional level, the
development of closer links with the private sector, and the establishment of objective program
evaluation criteria. They will help establish a framework in which future investments will
have maximum sustainable impact.
21.   Project Risks. The project is low risk. Policy reform measures have been front-
loaded early in the project cycle to ensure that they remain the focus of activities and the
subject of the annual and mid-term reviews. The main short-term risks include the availability
of capable leadership to guide the reform process and potential opposition from interest groups



7
(students, faculty) that may see themselves as losers in the process; long-term risks include the
potential failure of Government to provide adequate ongoing budgetary support and the
converse possibility that increased investments in higher education will draw resources away
from primary education. These risks cannot be entirely eliminated, but they have been
addressed through the participatory, consensual approach taken to project development.
Intensive budgetary discussions were held with representatives from the MEPUFP and the
MESRSC, as well as the Ministry of Finance, to ensure agreement on budgetary funding that
gives a continuing priority to primary education. These agreements are included in the policy
letters for both ministries and will be a focus of annual and mid-term reviews for this project
and for the Equity and School Improvement Project approved by the Board in May 1995.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.          The FY95 ARPP for the Guinea portfolio noted a range of continuing
implementation issues, as well as a decline in disbursements. About 18% of the projects in the
portfolio received an unsatisfactory rating or worse for Development Objectives, as compared to
21% in FY93 and 6% in FY94. Implementation progress showed a similar trend although the
decline appears to reflect more realistic rating by task managers rather than the sudden emergence
of new performance issues. Eight projects are due to close in FY96; it is expected that this will go
a long way toward cleaning up the portfolio.
2.          Ongoing implementation issues that are being addressed include the lack of
counterpart funding and overall audit compliance.  Action plans have been developed and
supervision coefficients have been slightly increased. A CPPR in February 1995, along with a
Public Expenditure Review helped convey the need for Government to improve management of
resources.
3.          These systemic disbursement problems were addressed directly during preparation
of the Higher Education Management Support Project. Project management received extensive
taining and support regarding disbursement and procurement procedures.  The project was
designed so that most key conditions were fulfilled prior to negotiations. Further, all terms of
reference, scopes of work, procurement arrangements and contracts will be prepared and agreed at
the start of each fiscal year. Annual counterpart funding requirements for the project will be
included as a line item in the annual budget for higher education; compliance will be monitored
closely. The project size also reflects Government's counterpart funding capacity.
