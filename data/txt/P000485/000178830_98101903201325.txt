APPRAISAL OF A
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project to assist the development of the
livestock industry through construction of 38 wells and repair and renovation
of 102 wells in the Batha district; maintenance of 821 wells in the main
cattle producing areas; and support of an expanded Livestock Development
Unit (LDU) to plan integrated development of the industry and prepare
further projects.  The Project, which would be the first Bank/IDA agricul-
ltural project in Chad (previously IDA financed a road maintenance project
and two education projects), would meet a priority need for more stock
watering facilities, thus increasing effective grazing area. It would be
a first step in the development of the livestock industry, although Government
does not as yet have a comprehensive livestock program.
ii.       The Project was first appraised in 1968 but, due to political
problems and tribal unrest in livestock raising areas, IDA decided to hold
it in abeyance until the security situation improved. At the time of
appraisal, IDA suggested the establishment of the LDU and it was subsequently
set up in 1970 by UNDP, with FAO as the executing agency. It, however, has
only one expatriate professional staff member, provided by FAO, who serves
as a general planning advisor to the Government. Under the proposed Project,
the unit would be oriented to the purposes originally envisaged and provided
with technical support to enable it to prepare a broad and coordinated plan
for the industry and at least one priority project within two years.
iii.      In consultation with IDA, the construction of new wells and the
repair and renovation of existing wells have been put to international tender
and work can start as soon as financing is secured. Genie Rural, the depart-
ment in the Ministry of Rural Development responsible for rural water supplies,
would supervise construction and repair works, assisted by French technical
personnel or a consulting engineer. Small quantities of vehicles and equip-
ment for the Well Maintenance and Livestock Development Units would be pur-
chased through regular Government tender procedures, since most international
vehicle manufacturers have local agents who would bid for Government orders.
iv.       The Project would enable livestock production to be increased on
some 600,000 ha of natural pastures and would prevent a decline in production,
through lack of water, on over 2 million additional ha. Over a period of
about 10 years, it would lead to an increase in the national cattle herd,
now estimated at 4.5 million, of about 190,000 head, and an increase of
about 160,000 in the number of sheep and goats.  Furthermore, it would
prevent a decline in well capacity, which, if not checked, might cause stock
reduction of the order of 270,000 cattle and 230,000 sheep and goats.  It    J         X
would bring about additional annual offtake of about 50,000 cattle and
100,000 sheep and goats (about 10% of present offtake for both), worth about  A-'



- ii -
US$2.3 million at 1970 prices. It would also provide subsistence for some
15,000 to 20,000 persons and improve foreign exchange earnings.
v.        The estimated total cost of the Project is about CFAF 876 million
(US$3.4 million), of which about CFAF 523 million (US$2.1 million), or 60%,
would be in foreign exchange. Of the foreign exchange, IDA would finance
US$1.6 million for well construction, renovation and maintenance and UNDP
would provide about US$0.5 million for LDU.  On country grounds, IDA would
finance, in addition to the foreign exchange expenditures, about US$0.5
million of local currency cost. Government's contribution would be about
US$0.8 million, approximately half of local currency expenditures or about
22% of total cost. Part of this would be recouped by taxes paid by the
contractor and those paid for import of equipment and construction materials
required for the Project. Net of taxes, Government's share would be about
11% of Project cost. The annual return to the economy, discounted over 30
years, would be about 11%, and benefits would be widely spread through the
livestock raising population.
vi.       The Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.2 million
(rounded to nearest 0.1 million) equivalent, to be disbursed over three years.
The borrower would be the Republic of Chad.



CHAD
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Chad has requested an IDA credit to help finance
development of the livestock industry, primarily by the provision of addi-
tional watering facilities.  The Project was p  aXed by an FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program mission that visited Chad in November 1966 following an FAO/IBRD
identification mission in May 1966. A further A7O/IBRD preparation mission
visited Chad in June 1967 to reassess alternative methods of providing
water.
1.02      The identification mission recognized the potential of the Chad
livestock industry and suggested comprehensive development. The November
1966 preparation mission found, however, that the Government did not have a
wide-ranging livestock development program at its disposal and suggested
that, while IDA might usefully finance the extension of stock watering
facilities, such efforts should be regarded as a first stage during which a
broad and coordinated plan would be prepared. The proposed Project, there-
fore, provides not only for additional and improved stock watering facili-
ties through repair of existing wells and construction of new ones and two
well maintenance units, but also for a development unit to prepare a second
more comprehensive stage of development for the livestock sub-sector.
1.03      An appraisal mission, composed of Messrs. P.G. Nelson, M. Palein,
and C.R. Wilkinson (IDA); W. Barber (FAO consultant hydrogeologist); and
D.E. Tribe (livestock consultant), visited Chad in September/October 1968 and
prepared an appraisal report that formed the basis of negotiations for an
IDA credit in 1969. However, at that time, detailed surveys had not been
made to determine the extent of necessary well repairs or the number and
siting of new wells, so that cost estimates were tentative. Additionally,
because of political problems and tribal unrest in livestock raising areas,
it was felt that the security situation precluded Project implementation
and IDA, therefore, decided to hold the Project in abeyance. In the interim
period, however, IDA assisted the Government in carrying out a detailed
well survey and well siting studies. These studies were done by SAUTI of
Rome. A mission, composed of Messrs. P. G. Nelson and R. Khouri (IDA) and
D.E. Tribe (livestock consultant), visited Chad in October 1969 to determine
the possibilities of proceeding with the project.
1.04      While the security situation in the Project area has improved in the
last two years, Government and IDA agreed, early in 1971 to proceed to
tendering for construction of 38 new wells and repair of 102, based on the
surveys performed by SAUTI to ascertain the interest of contractors in work
in areas subject to strife. Three firms 1/ submitted bids and the Chadian
firm, Dyckmans, offering the lowest price, won the contract. The bidding

procedure was consistent with the Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits. At all stages IDA was afforded an opportunity
to review and comment on the bidding documents, the evaluation of bids and
the proposal for award. Howeve:r, Government was informed that IDA could
not accept previous obligations with regard to procurement prior to Board
approval, and award of contract is, therefore, still pending.
1.05      The appraisal was updated in September 1971 by a mission consisting
of Messrs. S. Silbiger and G.M. de Wit (IDA). The present report is based
on the findings of the 1968 appraisal, the 1969 review, and the 1971 updating
missions.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Geography and Climate
2.01      Chad, with an area of 1.3 million km  (500,000 sq miles), about
the size of Mali or Niger, is bordered on the north by Libya, on the south
by Central African Republic (CAR), on the west by Niger and on the east by
Sudan.  It is a land-locked country, more than 1,000 km from any seaport,
with poor roads and no railway.  Freight costs are consequently high and
imports expensive.  Producer prices of exports to competitive markets, after
deduction of freight costs, are low.  Northern Chad is in the Sahara desert.
Rainfall increases southward from about 300 m  (12 inches) in the Sahelian
(sub-Sahara) belt, the main cattle raising area, to 1,200 mm (48 inches) in
the extreme south, the main cotton growing area. Most rain falls during June
to September when large areas are flooded, especially in the south. Ponds
form in the Sahelian region and vehicle movement becomes virtually impossible
in all except the desert areas. Day temperatures vary from an average
maximum of 42C (107°F) at the end of the dry season (March to May) to
the low 30's C (high 80's F) during the rains.
Economic Features
2.02      The population of about 3.7 million is predominantly agricultural and
is growing at a rate of 2.8% per annum although population growth in the north
is thought to be lower. The population is divided into two main ethnic groups.
The people of one group live in the Sahelian areas and are mostly nomadic or
semi-nomadic. They are Moslem and Arabic speaking and animal husbandry is
their principal source of income and subsistence, milk and meat being their
main food. The people of the other group live in the south, are animist or
Christian, speak many dialects, and are mostly settled, with cotton providing
their main cash income.
2.03      There has been friction between the two groups but the Government
is trying to reach a peaceful compromise. In April 1971 the President changed
his cabinet and selected half his ministers from the north. Particularly



- 3 -
significant is the creation of a separate Ministry for Livestock, Marketing,
Water, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting (Ministry of Livestock), headed by a
minister and a secretary of state, both from livestock raising areas.
2.04      The strife between the north and south has severely handicapped
the development of the livestock sector and it is hoped that recent efforts
to restore peace will create more favorable conditions for such development.
However, the Project area has, even at the height of the disturbances, been
relatively quiet. Well construction projects financed by the European
Development Fund (FED), operating east and west of the Project area, had to
be interrupted for only three months in 1969, because of incidents but
they have since continued without security difficulties. Government and
foreign aid officials unanimously contend that their staff travel freely
without guards in the Project area and that the local population recognizes
their interest in ongoing construction projects (stock wells, village wells,
schools, and roads).
2.05      The Government's financial position is strained, due to several
factors: lack of growth of revenue in the late 1960's, largely as a result
of evasion of livestock taxes; the country's withdrawal from the Union
Douaniere des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale (UDEAC), a regional economic
union, causing a loss of revenues; and slow expansion of the economy in the
1960's resulting in an annual GDP growth rate of 2 to 3%. Tax income from
livestock decreased in 1970 to about 3% of total revenue, while in 1967 it
amounted to about 10%. If all animal taxes, both animal head and export
taxes had been paid in 1970, revenue would have been more than CFAF 1.2
billion (US$4.3 million); however, actual collections came to approximately
one-fourth or about CFAF 300 million (US$1.1 million). Government is aware
of the need to improve the livestock tax collection and, to this end, inter
alia, has proposed to replace the animal head tax, which should give about
180% of all livestock taxes, with some sort of production tax. The matter
has been under consideration within the Government for several years, but
no firm plans have yet been made.
2.06      Nevertheless, the revenue situation shows signs of recovery.  In
1970 total Government revenues increased by about 12% compared with those in
1969 and a further increase of about 7% is expected for 1971. Expenditure,
however, has grown even faster; over 90% of outlays is for current requirements,
mostly salaries and operating supplies. This tight budgetary position could
I have an adverse effect on development projects since Government can contribute
only nominal amounts to their costs.  Furthermore, it has difficulties in
providing for current maintenance and operating expenses, which might also
jeopardize development projects.  Government revenue and expenditure in the
period 1969-71 are given in Annex 1.
Livestock in the National Economy
2.07      The importance of the livestock industry is difficult to assess
because statistics are poor. Agriculture as a whole accounts for about 50%
of Gross Domestic Product and roughly a quarter of the agricultural contribu-
tion is from livestock, mainly cattle, meat and animal products, with subsis-
tence consumption of milk, sheep and goats.



- 4 -
2.08      Recorded exports of livestock and animal products were CFAF 852
million (US$3.1 million) in 1969 (nearly 90% cattle and beef), but these
were probably only 30% of the total, the other 70% being unrecorded exports
on the hoof. Total exports of livestock and animal products may, therefore,
have been about CFAF 2,800 million (US$10 million), or 28% of all Chad
exports in 1969, ranking second only to cotton (about CFAF 6,600 million, or
US$24 million). Further information on livestock marketing is in paragraphs
2.20 and 2.21 and Annex 3.
B. The Livestock Industry
2.09      In the main cattle areas of Sahelian Chad, permanent water is
limited. The rains open up extensive additional grazing, but only for a
short time. The widespread and traditional form of cattle husbandry is,
therefore, based on annual movement of herds in search of water and pasture.
2.10      Generally, the cattle-owning tribes move with their herds, but
the pattern of nomadism differs markedly between them. For some, movement
is seldom out of a 50-km radius; for others, especially those most distant
from commercial centers, 200 to 400 km may be traversed annually north and
south. The pattern, however, is being continually modified, as exemplified
by the tendency of nomads to settle especially in areas with permanent water
supply where they are starting to grow some millet and becoming more willing
to sell livestock. Details of the livestock industry are in Annexes 2
(Livestock Production) and 3 (Marketing).
Livestock Population and Parameters
2.11      Cattle population is estimated at 4.5 million, of which about 70%
are in the Sahelian belt. There are also approximately 1.5 million hair
sheep, 2.8 million goats, 0.4 million camels, 0.5 million horses and donkeys,
and a few thousand pigs (see Annex 2, Table 1). The cattle are mainly Zebus,
noted for hardiness and ability to produce under harsh conditions. They
reach a liveweight of 300 to 400 kg in about five to seven years. Their
estimated over-all annual calving rate is 60 to 70%, but mortality between
birth and one year is 40 to 50%.  This reduces the effective calving rate to
between 30 and 40%.  Heifers calve at 3.5 to 4 years and annual average
I offtake is about 11%. These figures are typical of unimproved rangelands
of low productivity.  By contrast, good South American producers achieve
liveweights of 300 to 400 kg in three years, effective calving rates of 70%,
and offtake averaging 15 to 20%.
2.12      Sheep and goats are kept as a main source of meat and skins and a
supplemental source of milk. They are also sold or exchanged for other
foods (mostly grains), simple household goods and clothes.



-5-
The Importance of Water
2.13      New permanent watering facilities make pasture usable throughout
the dry season where it could otherwise be utilized for only a short time
immediately after the rains. It also enables more distant temporary grazing
to be brought within range. The provision of water thus permits the overall
herd size to grow by making it possible to accommodate the natural increase
as well as animals that would otherwise have had to have been disposed of
(or that might die from malnutrition). This growth continues until grazing
land becomes fully stocked, at which time the herd stabilizes. The provision
of water and additional grazing may temporarily improve fertility, growth
and health of grazing animals during the build-up period, but it cannot, by
itself, effect any permanent improvement in productive efficiency. It does,
however, enable more cattle to be carried.
Animal Health
2.14      Because Government has given priority to disease control, the
veterinary service has made some progress in improving animal health, despite
the fact that many cattle diseases, such as rinderpest, foot and mouth
disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and blackleg, are endemic
throughout Chad and adjoining territories. Particular effort has been put
into the international rinderpest campaign covering Chad and eight
neighboring countries. There is no trypanosomiasis in the Sahelian belt,
but cattle may encounter it during their trek to southern markets or even
during their southern dry season migration.
2.15      The veterinary service is well supported by the Farcha Research
Laboratory in Fort Lamy, which produces a wide range of vaccines. The
Laboratory forms part of the Institut d'Elevage et de tMedecine Veterinaire
des Pays Tropicaux in Paris, an organization of long standing, financed by
France and other participating countries.
2.16      Under present conditions, inadequate nutrition is the most frequent
cause of death, loss of weight and low production, and the situation is
frequently aggravated by water shortage and internal parasites (especially
in calves).
Livestock Services
2.17      Staffing of the recently established (May 1971) Ministry of Livestock,
is shown in Annex 2, and the organization in Chart 1. Almost all staff are
fully occupied with disease control and no section deals specifically with
animal husbandry, range management or livestock marketing. There is virtually
no livestock extension service.
2.18      Staff education and training are severely hampered by the general
lack of basic education in Chad and by budgetary constraints. The curriculum
concentrates on disease control, but a more comprehensive three year course in
animal husbandry will start in 1972/73 (see Annex 2).



- 6 -
2.19      There are several bi-lateral and international technical aid
programs for the livestock sub-sector, and the two largest are sponsored by
FED for the construction of 318 wells in Chari, Baguirmi, Batha and Ouaddai.
Both the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and FED have been
providing watering points in Chad over the last 12 years and have been
highly successful in opening up additional grazing land (para 3.02). The
provision of water has been welcomed by Government and by the pastoralists.
FAC also provides technical assistance to livestock services, mainly in
animal health.
Marketing
2.20      Cattle are traded through commercial channels (rough.y 65X of
offtake), mainly to pay taxes and buy clothing, sugar, tea, salt and millet.
Sales are generally made through local markets, highly organized in a tra-
ditional way but lacking modern facilities (auction floors, weigh scales,
and such). Six of these markets handle, respectively, more than 25,000
cattle annually. The principal flow of cattle is toward the west to Fort
Lamy for local consumption, processing, or export on the hoof to Nigeria.
Another route takes cattle from the northeast to the south for slaughter
at Fort Archambault or live export to CAR.
2.21      Annual offtake is approximately 500,000 head, equivalent to
64,000 m tons carcass weight, about 52% of which is consumed domestically,
representing a low per capita average of Ji6-kg (17 lb) per annum (Annex 3,
Table 1). About 240,000 head, or 48% of offtake are exported, some 150,000
on the hoof, mainly to Nigeria and CAR (Annex 3, Table 2). Stimulated by
the establishment of modern abattoirs at Fort Lamy (1958) and at Fort
Archambault (1960), annual export of dressed meat has increased nearly three-
fold in the past four years and has now reached almost 12,000 m tons, 11,000
m tons of which are beef.  Most meat is,          an consuZire    n 0
(B) and Gabon (Annex 3  Tabl  3   nd"                            Further details
of'cattl'emarketing are in Annex --3 and Appendix 3.
Potential of the Livestock Industry
2.22      Chad has the potential to increase livestock production.  There
are still large areas of reasonably good pasture that could be opened up
by provision of permanent water. Substantial increases would also be
possible in areas that already have water if pastoralists would use better
methods of range and animal management, such as control of grass fires;
increase in grazing time through abolition of night enclosing of cattle;
drenching against parasites; and sale of immature cattle for fattening. A
necessary adjunct would be improved marketing, including better (especially
better watered) stock routes, and stratification of the cattle industry,
developing areas remote from the market centers for breeding (for which
they are suited) and areas closer to market centers for fattening and
finishing.

III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The primary purpose of the Project is to improve stock watering
facilities, with consequent expansion of available grazing, a fundamental
requirement for development of the livestock industry. Additionally, it
would provide for the planning of integrated development of the industry
and preparation of further projects for financing. Works would include:
(a)  construction of 38 open concrete wells in a western
strip of Batha district;
(b)  repair and renovation of 102 existing wells in
Batha; r  -,' s.
(c)  establishment of two units to maintain 821 concrete
wells in the main livestock producing areas; and                   a  f''f5
(d)  expansion of the Livestock Development Unit
(LDU) within the Ministry of Livestock.
3.02      The Project would supplement the FAC and FED programs (para 2.19)
by adding wells in western Batha, leaving the provision of water in the
northeastern area until further necessary water studies had been made.
It would also restore some of the earlier water points to full productivity
and ensure that all wells in the main cattle areas would be properly
maintained by Government.
B. Project Areas
3.03      New wells would be built within an area of about 1.3 million ha
in those parts of Batha known as Guetty and Harr. When completed, they
would service a total grazing area of about 600,000 ha. The wells to be
repaired and improved are in southern Batha.
3.04      The Batha climate is Sahelian (para 2.01) with annual rainfall
ranging between 300 and 400 mm (12 to 15 in) and falling from June to
September. There is virtually no rain at other times of the year and,
during the dry periods, humidity is very low.
3.05      Lands are flat or gently undulating and soil is almost universally
sandy. Elevacion is about 300 m above sea level and there is no permanent
'-rF^ace water.  If stock are to remain in the area during the long dry
season, they must depend on well water.



- 8 -
3.06      Vegetation runs to open grassland, with thorn bushes varying
from a few to a maximum of 40 to 50 per ha. The grasses are mostly
annuals (Annex 2) that seed freely and grow rapidly during the rains,
providing adequate grazing for stock throughout the year when they are not
subject to overstocking. Grazing conditions are not of uniform quality,
however, and new wells were sited only where carrying capacity would be
predominantly one adult cattle unit to 10 ha.
3.07      Cattle in Batha number probably about 900,000, or one-fifth of
the national herd. Accurate statistics are not available because of
constant herd movements and reluctance of owners to report numbers for
fear of taxation (Annex 2, Table 1). Sheep and goats, which generally
accompany cattle herds, number about 800,000.
3.08      A shallow groundwater trough underlies the Project Area, spreading
from northeast to southwest. Depth from surface to water table ranges
southwest to northeast from 20 to 80 m but, according to the findings of
the survey, sites where water is likely to be deeper than 60 m have been
avoided (para 3.09). Permeability of the aquifer varies considerably and
direct surface recharge is small. However, the minimum Project requirement
of 1 liter/sec should be readily obtainable and no significant lowering
of the water table is likely to result (Annex 4). Failure to find water
has so far been rare.
3.09      On the basis of a BRGM 1/ hydrogeological map, experience with
wells adjoining the Project Area and results of the SAUTI survey, it is
expected that water would be found between 30 and 60 m, at an average
depth of 44 m.
3.10      The quality of water in a small part of the Project Area is
expected to be somewhat saline, but Batha cattle are well adapted to this
and the local pastoralists use it with discretion, so that the dangers of
hypersalinity are small.
C. Detailed Features
New Wells
3.11      The design of the proposed new wells is based on accumulated
experience under Chad conditions. Each would comprise a reinforced
concrete-lined shaft of 1.8 m (5.9 ft) diameter, at the bottom of which,
at an average depth of 44 m, would be a precast reinforced concrete sand
filter column in the shaft (Annex 4). Surface installations for each well
would include a low parapet to prevent sand from falling in and silting up
1/   Bureau des Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM) in Paris.

the well and to protect against accidents; rollers to assist in lifting
w.tor; nnd six metal troughs grouted into the surface. Many types of
addiltional and alternative surface installation have been tried, but none
has so far proved to be economically justified because material costs are
high. Water would be extracted by traditional methods, aided by the rollers
and troughs, without which it might not be possible to draw the required
amount, especially from the deeper wells (Annex 4). The drawing rate by
these methods would be about 1 liter/sec per well, which would be adequate
to water about 1,500 cattle units daily. Since carrying capacity is one
adult cattle unit to 10 ha (para 3.06) and the area of grazing reasonably
accessible to a well is about 15,000 ha (Annex 4), it follows that only
about 2,100 cattle and 1,800 sheep of mixed ages could be supported. The
drawing rate thus tends to keep the number of cattle watered in line with
the carrying capacity of available pasture (Annexes 2 and 4).
3.12      Alternative methods of providing water were carefully considered.
However, open reservoirs would silt up rapidly and evaporation would be
high, while maintenance of drilled boreholes with pumps would be costly
and difficult under Chad conditions (Annex 4).
3.13      Construction of 38 new wells would take about two years, depending
on the time lost during the three-month rainy seasons (July to September)
when no work could be done. Sites were determined up to minutes of latitudes
and longitudes by the consultant firm SAUTI, engaged by IDA, and grazing
conditions and expected depth and quality of water were taken into considera-
tion, although some modifications might be made in the light of experience
obtained during construction. Each well is expected to last at least 30
years. The total cost of the 38 wells, including contingencies and super-
vision, would be about US$1,12 ,000 equivalent (Annex 5).
Well Repair and Renovation           -' -      4  '  
3.14      The 102 concrete-lined wells, to be repaired and renovated, were
constructed in southern Batha in 1955.  During late 1966, defects were
discovered which, if neglected, would lead to gradual failure and ultimate
collapse. By 1969, 21 wells had already been abandoned and all others were
in need of repair (Annex 4). Some filter columns had proved too heavy for
casings to which they were rigidly attached, and casings cracked. Left
alone, filters might topple and wells become ineffective but, repaired and
properly maintained, such wells could last at least another 30 years.
Casing repair consists of cavity filling, grouting and lining the cracks.
Surface installation would vary, depending on the amount already provided
and the damage suffered during use. Average repair would cost considerably
less than a new well and be of equal benefit if it prevented a well from
going out of operation.
3.15      A survey was conducted in 1969 by IDA consultants, SAUTI, to
determine the extent of repairs needed, and the findings formed the basis
for the invitation to bid. On the basis of the lowest responsive bid,
total cost would be US$593,000 equivalent, including contingencies and



- 10 -
supervision (Annex 6).  Average cost per well would be US$5,800 but there
would be wide disparities, depe:iding on how much work was needed. Repair
and renovation work would take 18 months, including two rainy seasons,
during which no construction can be done.
Maintenance Units
3.16      Because of lack of funds, Government haOtrena
t3vely for rather lon    riods  it                                         ar
atewntloo. Tnereoore, tne Fro        would provide for the acquisition ot
maintieaene equipment as well as for operating funds to get maintenance
started. Maintenance would include repair of casing, filter and surface
installations and desilting.
3.17      In the main cattle producing areas of Chari, Baguirmi, Kanem,
Batha and Ouaddi, there are now 630 concrete stock wells. Moreover, 153
are under construction and 38 are included in the proposed Project, making
a total of 821. Two maintenance units would therefore be established.
Each would visit about 140 wells during the dry season and visits every
three years would suffice. As maintenance of existing wells has been
neglected, the two new units would be formed immediately and their initial
running cost provided for.
3.18      Maintenance equipment for each unit would comprise two heavy
twin-axle, four-wheel drive trucks, one of which would be equipped with
a winch, a welding unit, a pump and compressor, and steel casting moulds.
In addition, one supervisor for each unit would be provided with a four-
wheel drive vehicle. The cost of equipping two new units would be about
US$371,000 and of running two units for three years, about US$448,000.
Total cost, including contingencies, would be about US$953,000 equivalent
(Annex 7). Part of financing the unit's running cost has been included
as it represents a sudden considerable increase in expenditure that the
Chad Government would have difficulty in meeting.  Since it is important
that maintenance not be hampered by lack of funds, IDA would finance the
whole cost of maintenance in the first year and half in the second.  There-
Xafter, Government would take over support of the units, also providing
replacements. The Government also agreed to maintain all wells properly
at all times.
'Livestock Development Unit
3.19      In 1968, IDA proposed the establishment of a Livesw    . evelopment
Unit (LDU) to draw up a comprehensive development plan and prepare subsequent
projects for the livestock sector. When the proposed Project was postponed
in 1969, the idea of LDU was taken over by UNDP which, in February 1970,
established it as a UNDP/FAO project. However, LDU developed along functional
lines that were different from those envisaged by IDA and its only expatriate
ikAW     professional staff member, provided by FAO, has served now mostly as a



- 11 -
general planning adviser to the Government. Under the proposed IDA Proj-
ect, the Government would reorient LDU to the original concept. Assurances
were obtained from Government that the unit would function under terms
of reference (Annex 8) agreed with IDA (para 4.02).
3.20      The proposed LDU would continue to function within the Ministry
of Livestock for an initial period of three years. During this time, it
would prepare a broad and coordinated plan, indicating priorities for
further development of the livestock industry. It would, inter alia,
evaluate the results of the current well program, and study prospects for
further construction and alternative methods of providing water; the
problem of drawing water from greater depths; range management and animal
husbandry techniques that could be profitably and immediately introduced;
establishment of stock routes; stratification of the industry; marketing
and taxation; extension and training. It would also identify and prepare
priority projects, at least one to be ready within two years of credit
effectiveness.
3.21      LDU would include a livestock specialist, an animal production
officer, a range ecologist, and an agricultural economist, all to be
internationally recruited. A Chadian veterinarian would be attached to
the Unit to obtain experience in planning and project preparation. Other
personnel would consist of two technicians and supporting staff (Annex 8).
3.22      LDU would be authorized to engage additional specialists on
short-term contracts, in consultation with IDA, to advise on particular
problems and would have the means to travel extensively in the cattle
producing areas and to similar areas overseas. Before engaging consultants
for special studies and organizing foreign travel, Government agreed to
obtain IDA approval on terms of reference and conditions of contract.
3.23      LDU would be financed by UNDP for a period of three years.  UNDP
would contribute about US$315,000 equivalent for four expatriate staff (two
livestock specialists and one range ecologist for three years and one
agricultural economist for two years). Furthermore, UNDP would contribute
about US$215,000 equivalent for scholarships, travels and visits and purchase
and running cost of vehicles. The LDU would be responsible for carrying out
special (feasibility) studies for further livestock development and IDA
would contribute about US$190,000 equivalent to finance the foreign cost
(Annex 9). The Government would contribute about US$48,000 equivalent to
the financing of the Chadian counterpart to the head of LDU and to cover
the local cost of special studies.
D. Cost Estimates
3.24      The total estimated cost of the Project is US$3.4 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is US$2.1 million
equivalent, or 60%.

3.25      Cost estimates for new wells and well repair and renovation are
based on bids submitted by the contractor who won the contract (para 1.04).
Capital and operating costs for the maintenance units have been estimated
on the basis of prevailing local prices, information from Genie Rural and
an analysis made by the French Government for nearly identical units
working under similar conditions in the Republic of Niger. Cost estimates
for the LDU have been derived from proposals supplied by the Ministry of
Livestock and the present unit. Price and physical contingencies have been
added to the estimated cost of the new wells and well repair and renovation
to cover additional cost of precise new well siting, which was not included
in the tender, and of various experiments with new types of parapets and
water drawing devices, which would be useful for further well construction
projects in similar areas. Furthermore, 15% has been provided for super-
vision of new well construction cost and of well repair and renovation.
For well maintenance, a price contingency of 10% of capital and running
costs (except salaries) plus spare parts, has been included. Price
contingencies have been estimated on the basis of a rate of escalation of
costs of 10% per annum. Overall average contingency provision is about 15%
of Project cost.
3.26      Cost estimates for well construction and repair include taxes.
These consist of turnover taxes payable by the contractor and import duties
on imported equipment and construction materials (30% to 40%). These taxes
have been estimated at US$412,000 equivalent, or 24% of construction and
repair cost. As the Government does not pay taxes, no tax provisions have
been made for the other Project components, and the tax element in total
Project cost, consequently, amounts to 12% (Annex 5, 6 and 10).
E. Financing
3.27      Government would finance about 22% of total Project cost, an
equivalent of about US$754,000. However, it would recoup about US$412,000
through taxes collected on construction of new wells and repair of existing
ones. Government's net of tax contribution would be the equivalent of
US$342,000, or about 11% of Project cost net of taxes.

F. Procurement
3.28      The contract for well construction and repair equivalent to about
one third of total Project cost was won by Dyckmans (para 1.04) under inter-
national competitive bidding. Vehicles and ancillary equipment, amounting to
about US$371,000, would be purchased through normal commercial channels be-
cause bulking would not be practicable. Well-known international manufac-
turers of vehicles and required equipment have local agents who would bid for
local Government purchases.
G. Disbursement
3.29      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against:
(a)  70% of the cost of well construction, repair and
renovation;
(b)  80% of total cost of equipment and spare parts for the
two maintenance units;
(c)  100% of total amount of expatriate salaries in the two
maintenance units;
(d)  100% of total running cost, including local salaries,
for the first 12 months of operation of the two maintenance
units;
(e)  50% of total running costs, including local salaries, for
the second 12 months; and



- 15 -
(f) 76% of total cost of special studies, representing the
estimated foreign exchange component.
3.30      All disbursement of IDA funds would be made against applications
supported by appropriate documentation and verified by the Ministry of
Finance, which has control over all expenditure. Government has agreed with
this procedure. Disbursements of the IDA credit would be made over a period
of three years. Phasing is shown in Annex 11.
H. Auditing
3.31      Government agreed that:
(a) adequate accounts would be kept for the Project, following
the same procedures used in the other three on-going projects;
(b) the accounts would be satisfactorily audited under existing
Government regulations; and
(c) audited accounts would be submitted within four months of the
close of each fiscal year to IDA.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      Genie Rural (see Chart 2) would be responsible for supervision of
new well construction, repair and renovation works, and maintenance. Govern-
ment has requested technical assistance from France for this purpose, but
should such assistance not be forthcoming by the time the credit is effective,
it has agreed to engage consultants satisfactory to IDA. Full cost of super-
vision of construction and renovation has been included under the project.
4.02      LDU's work would be reviewed every three months by the Ministry of
Livestock (paras 3.19 through 3.23). A meeting at senior level would be
convened by the Ministry to examine the unit's work program with the Ministry
of Finance, the High Commission for Planning and the Ministry of Rural Develop-
ment (Genie Rural), on the basis of the terms of reference (Annex 8). LDU
would also submit progress reports every three months to UNDP and IDA. Agree-
ments on these points were obtained from Government.
V. MARKETS, MARKETING AND PRICES
5.01      Three factors are likely to affect the future utilization of Chad's
livestock production: first, there will be no substantial livestock produc-
tion increases, except those resulting from the Project, in the foreseeable
future; second, a large part of offtake (possible as much as 35 to 40%) is



- 16 -
unsuitable for export because of animal diseases, undernourishment of calves,
and other adverse conditions; and third, the utilization of exportable cattle
and beef will probably be determined by domestic and export price levels.
Incomes in Chad are not likely to rise as quickly as those in its export
markets (particularly Nigeria) so the demand in those markets would grow some-
what faster than would domestic demand.  Assuming a future annual growth of
offtake of about 1.5% per year, output would amount to about 68,000 m tons in
1976, of which 40,000 m tons would be exported and 28,000 m tons consumed
locally.
5.02      It is unlikely that cattle and meat prices would rise substantially
beyond the present level (Annex 3, Tables 4 through 6). Such increases would
jeopardize export of meat, considering air freights are up to one-third to
one-half of the average cif delivered price of beef (para 2.21) and domestic
consumers have limited purchasing power (para 2.21).
5.03      In 1966, domestic beef consumption was estimated at 23,000 m tons
(carcass weight) and exports at 36,600 m tons. In 1970, these estimates are
27,440 and 36,200 m tons, respectively, but in the absence of comprehensive
and consistent statistics, it cannot be ascertained whether these figures
accurately reflect actual developments.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would bring into productive use some additional
600,000 ha of grazing land with a carrying capacity of 80,000 cattle and
about 70,000 sheep and goats. Furthermore, it would prevent continued decline
and ultimate collapse of 102 existing wells serving an area of over 2.0 mil-
lion ha, and supporting about 210,000 cattle and 180,000 sheep and goats.
In addition, some 821 wells, including those to be constructed and repaired,
would be regularly maintained. Studies leading to the identification and
preparation of further projects within two years would ultimately lead to
wider benefits.
6.02      The Project would increase herd size through natural growth, made
possible by additional grazing areas. The size of ti._ herd would grow by
almost 190,000 cattle and by some 160,000 sheep and goats to reach a -otal of
approximately 836,000 and and 716,000 animals, respectively. Importaiit addi-
tional benefits would be derived by preventing well deterioration, which
would, within a decade, reduce well capacity by at least 270,CY- 'attle and
230,000 sheep and goats. Because part of natural growth of iiet- and flock
would be used to stock new grazing areas, offtake with the Project would
initially decrease, but new areas would become fully stocked within about
10 years.  Assuming an offtake of 11.5% after full stocking, annual offtake
in Batha district with the Project would be 50,000 cattle and almost 100,000
sheep and goats higher than without the Project. At 1970 prices, this
represents a value of over US$2.3 million per year.



- 17 -
6.03      The Project has additional benefits that have not been considered
in the rate of return calculations. It would provide an important part
of subsistence food (milk) for roughly 15,000 to 20,000 persons and a great
variety of secondary products (skins, butter and hair). It would also
increase (and prevent a decrease of) foreign exchange earnings by about
US$1.3 million per year at full development and create employment and income
in secondary activities (traders markets, slaughterhouses, and such) as well
as indirectly related fields such as construction and maintenance. Finally,
the Project would bring additional taxes to Government, amounting to about
US$195,000 per year under the present tax system, if all taxes were collected.
6.04      No charge is levied for water supplied from Government stock wells
and none would be from Project wells. It would be virtually impossible to
monitor and, considering the cost of collecting from the many remote well
locations (para 3.17), not economically worthwhile.
6.05      The average return to the economy of the Project discounted over
the 30-year life of the wells, would be 11% (Annex 12), with benefits widely
spread throughout the livestock raising population.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following agreements were reached with the Government that:
(a) all stock wells would be properly maintained at all
times (para 3.18);
(b) the Livestock Development Unit would function under
Terms of Reference (Annex 8) agreed with IDA (para 3.19);
(c) before engaging consultants for special studies and
organizing foreign travel, it would obtain IDA approval
on terms of reference and conditions of consultation
(para 3.22);
(d) all disbursements of IDA funds would be made against
applications, supported by appropriate documentations
and verified by the Ministry of Finance (para 3.30);
(e) separate accounts would be kept for the Project
(para 3.31);
(f) accounts would be satisfactorily audited under existing
Government regulations (para 3.31);
(g) audited accounts would be submitted within four months
of the close of each fiscal year to IDA (para 3.31);



- 18
(h) if French technical assistance is not forthcoming for
supervision of construction and renovation at the time
of credit effectiveness, consultants satisfactory to
IDA would be appointed for this purpose (para 4.01);
(i) the Ministry of Livestock would, every three months, convene
a meeting with the Ministry of Finance, the High Commission
for Planning, and the Ministry for Rural Development (Genie
Rural) to examine the work of the Livestock Development Unit
on the basis of the terms of reference shown in Annex 8
(para 4.02); and
(j) the Livestock Development Unit would submit progress reports
every three months to UNDP and IDA (para 4.02).
7.02      With the foregoing agreements reached, the proposed Project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$2.2 million equivalent
under IDA terms.

CHAD
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Livestock Production in Chad
with Particular Reference to Batha Prefecture
A. Introduction
1.        There is an almost complete lack of reliable statistics for the
Chad livestock industry, and various estimates made (e.g. in previous reports
by FAO, FED, FAC, USAID, etc.) sometimes differ markedly from one another.
The figures in this annex must be treated with reserve, though they are based
on reference to the literature and Government statistics, discussions with
local authorities and cattle owners, and personal experience and observation.
2.        The main livestock areas of Chad are between 120 and 16' N and the
proposed Project Area is in the western part of Batha Prefecture (Guetty and
Harr) between 13° and 150 N. Ati, the capital and principal market of Batha,
is 450 km from Fort Lamy and 600 km from Fort Archambault, the two largest
towns in Chad and the main export centers.
B. Ecological and Climatic Features of Batha
3.        The Batha climate is Sahelian.  Topography is generally flat or
gently undulating, with well-grassed low sand dunes alternating with shallow
depressions (ouadis) and occasional clay pens. Except for storms during the
rainy season, wind velocity is low, varying on average from about 6 to 11 km/h
(4 to 7 mph).
4.        The vegetation consists mainly of annual grasses, with a variable
(5 to 15%) cover of thorny trees (Acacia sp.) and other xerophytic trees (e.g.
Euphorbia sp.) and shrubs. The grazing quality of dry season pasture varies
from good (e.g. Aristida longiflora, Aristida Hyparrhenia dissoluta) to medium
or poor (e.g. Eragrostis tremula, Aristida pallida, Andropogon Gayanus, Cvmbo-
pogon giganteus).
5.        There are no permanent streams or surface water.  After the rains,
seasonal surface water in Batha lasts for two or three months in the south but
only a few weeks in the north. All Batha livestock then become dependent on
wells or, where there are none, they move south where permanent water is avail-
able (e.g. to Lake Fitri). At present there are only a few isolated wells in
the Project Area and cattle are moved out of it for most of the year.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
C.  Nomadism and WFt- r UTse
6.        The widespread and traditional form of cattle husbandry is based
on an annual movement of pastoralists with their herds. The exact pattern
of nomadism differs markedly between tribes.  In Kanem, where there is a
well-developed network of wells and markets, the people seldom travel out-
side a radius of 50 km. In east Batha and Ouaddai, however, movement is
north and south as much as 200 to 400 km. In west Batha, adjacent to the
Project Area, movement is about 50 to 100 km in a normal yearly cycle.
7.        The traditional patterns of nomadism are being continually modified
because of:
(a)  Government's stock water supply program (783 concrete wells
exist or are under construction, in addition to the 38 pro-
posed for the Project);
(b) increasing adoption by pastoralists of millet cultivation,
which now extends north beyond the 14th parallel;
(c) improved disease control and increased water availability
for livestock; and
(d) growth of population of less than 2% per year in the North.
The trend is towards a more sedentary way of life, and a recent study of 100
herds in the Moussoro region of Kanem, where commercial orientation is strong,
showed that as many as 63 were now sedentary or confined to a radius of 20
km, while only eight travelled 100 km or more.
8.        The ways in which wells are used are complex and variable.  They
depend upon such factors as water purity; grazing quality; incidence of biting
flies in the wet season; traditional land usage rights; distance to market;
and the custom of the particular tribe or clan. A group may settle more or
less permanently on a well or visit it several times a year for a few days or
follow any permutation between these extremes. However, whether a single
community uses the well for most, if not all, of the year, or whether a
series of different communities visit it for short periods (as they might a
highly saline well), the general year-long effectiveness, in terms of animal
production, is likely to be about the same.
9.        A new well opens up additional dry season grazing.  It also makes
additional wet season grazing accessible on the perimeter of the newly opened
area. A new well cannot bring about sustained improvement in fertility,
growth or health of grazing animals, but it can bring about an increase in
the total number by making it possible to accommodate natural increase and
animals which would otherwise have to be disposed of (or would die from mal-
nutrition). When a new area is opened up, animals move into it from other
areas within the same nomadic pattern. It takes an estimated eight years
before both old and new areas again become fully stocked.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       The new wells would each serve about 15,000 ha of pasture, approxi-
mating to a circle with a radius of 7 km from the well. In the Project
Area, carrying capacity is estimated at one adult cattle unit and one adult
sheep/goat unit per 10 ha. From current herd and flock compositions it has
been calculated that, in terms of actual animals (of mixed ages and sex), each
well area of 15,000 ha would carry about 2,100 cattle and 1,800 sheep or
goats. This is about the number of animals that can be safely maintained
without danger of overgrazing. Since the minimum daily water requirement is
about 20 liters per adult cattle unit and five liters per adult sheep/goat
unit, and since traditional methods of drawing water can only provide a yield
of about one liter/second, it follows that this is about the maximum that
can be watered from a single well operating approximately 10 hours a day.
D. Livestock Production
11.       Estimated Chad cattle population is 4.5 million, of which in 1970
about 19% were in Kanem, 207 in Batha and 187 in Chari Baguirmi (Table 1). In
addition, there were about 1.5 million hair sheep, 2.8 million goats, 4
million camels, 0.4 million horses and donkeys, and some 5,000 pigs.
12.       In the most important livestock producing areas, cattle are predom-
inantly of the Wadara (or Shuwa Arab) type, short-horned humped zebus, noted
for their hardiness and ability to produce both milk and meat under harsh,
arid conditions. They are large framed, and the immatures show a high poten-
tial for growth and meat production. Under improved ranching conditions in
Nigeria, near Maiduguri (400 km from the Chad border), Wadara-type cattle
reach an average liveweight of 300 kg at 30 months, compared with an average
of 300 to 400 kg at five to seven years in Chad.
13.       Under prevailing nomadic and semi-nomadic conditions, Chad cattle
now have an estimated overall calving rate of 60 to 70%. Mortality between
birth and one year is high, however -- between 40 and 50% -- so effective
calving rate is probably between 30 and 40%, though female calves are likely
to receive somewhat more care and to have a higher survival rate than male
calves. Heifers normally calve at 3.5 to 5 years of age. Annual offtake
rate is approximately 10%.
14.       Many cattle diseases, such as rinderpest, foot and mouth disease,
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and black leg, are endemic throughout the
region. Tuberculosis and brucellosis are commonly reported and there is a
"significant" incidence of cysticercus bovis in carcasses examined at the
Fort Lamy abattoir. Although trypanosomiasis is not found in the sub-arid
savannah, cattle may encounter it during their trek to southern markets or
even during their annual southerly dry season migration. However, although
the disease situation is likely to continue to inhibit sale of animals or
meat to the high-priced markets of North America and Europe for many years to
come, considerable progress in disease control has been made by the veterinary
service. Factors such as nutrition, water availability and management are
now of more widespread importance to the level and efficiency of animal pro-



ANNEX 2
Page 4
duction than is disease. Quarantine regulations in most countries of Central
and West Africa do not exclude meat or livestock from Chad.
15.       During recent years, the main activity of the Livestock Department
of the Ministry of Agriculture 1/ has been its participation in the interna-
tional rinderpest control campaign.  Divided into four phases, the first
starting in 1962 and the last being completed in 1969, this campaign has in-
volved Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Mali, Upper Volta, the Central African
Republic, Senegal and the Sudan, as well as Chad. It has been financed by
UNDP, USAID and FED and practically all cattle in Chad have so far been vac-
cinated. Although not initially popular with cattle owners, the program is
now recognized by them as having successfully reduced cattle mortalities.
16.       The most serious cause of death, inefficient production and loss of
weight, is inadequate nutrition, frequently combined with water shortage and,
in young animals, often seriously complicated by high levels of internal para-
sites (including liver fluke and lung worm). As the dry season progresses,
calves increasingly compete unsuccessfully with the human population for a
decreasing supply of milk. Better calf nutrition is one of the most urgent
requirements if efficiency of animal production is to be improved. Stimula-
tion of market demand for weaners and immatures, together with better facil-
ities for their sale and transfer to the south, would encourage greater in-
terest in improved husbandry.
17.       Hair sheep and goats are used by the nomadic or semi-nomadic pas-
toralists as a main source of meat and skins and as a supplementary source
of milk.  These animals are a hardy, heterogeneous mixture, with long legs
and large frames. Carcasses seen at Fort Lamy were of good quality and
weighed approximately 18 kg. Surplus sheep and goats are sold to purchase
other foods (e.g. millet), "household" goods or clothes.
E. Rangeland Management
)  18.        Marked changes in the rangelands have been reported from Kanem
Prefecture, and the predominance of annual grasses throughout the Sahelian
zone is believed to reflect an ecological deterioration from an original
community of perennial species. Extensive grass fires and increased culti-
vation of millet in marginal areas probably have a more drastic effect on
soils and vegetation than the present rate of stocking.
19.       The significance of these ecological changes is hard to assess but
there is little evidence of serious bush encroachment and depleted ranges
regenerate quickly. Moreover, there is no evidence of significant soil ero-
sion. High rates of water infiltration in the undulating sands and moderate
1/   In May 1971, the Department has been transformed into a separate Minis-
try of Livestock, Marketing, Water, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
to good grass cover combine to prevent erosion, even during high intensity
rain storms.
20.       Since stocking rate tends to be limited by the amount of pasture at
the end of the dry season, there is always an abundance of feed after the
rains, during which the annual pastures are setting seed. Thus continued
seasonal regeneration seems assured and any overgrazing during the latter
part of the dry season is unlikely to have permanent detrimental effects.
F. Livestock Potential
21.       During the last decade, improvements in disease control, water
availability and marketing opportunities have combined to raise offtake rates
from around 6% to a little over 10%. There is also some evidence that car-
cass weights of cattle slaughtered for export at Fort Lamy have increased
slightly (less than 1 kg per annum).
22.       The nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists regard the livestock pri-
marily as a means of subsistence, depending upon them for their main diet of
milk and meat, which nowadays is supplemented by home-grown and purchased
millet. Traditionally, they have maintained a cattle economy and the size
of a herd has reflected a family's wealth. Cattle owners are, however, in-
creasingly willing to sell surplus stock for cash and are sensitive to
market values and fluctuations. The desire for cash arises partly out of
an increased appetite for consumer goods (particularly millet, sorghum and
other grains) and partly from the need to pay taxes.
23.       There are still considerable areas (such as the Project Area) in
which little or no grazing is possible because there is no permanent water.
Further provision of concrete wells throughout the savannah strip, between
approximately 130 and 15e N, could continue to open up medium quality range
capable of carrying one adult cattle unit and one sheep/goat unit per 10 ha
with a productive efficiency equal to the average for the country (paras 12
and 13).
24.       Siting of new wells has been determined by the consultant firm
SAUTI accurate to minutes of longitude and latitude. The exact location of
wells will be organized by Genie Rural. In the Project Area, equipotential
and resistivity tests have indicated occasional concentrations of dissolved
solids ranging between 1,500 and 6,000 parts per million (ppm) (Annex 4).
However, water samples from wells adjacent to the Project Area, having a
total dissolved solids content of about 6,000 ppm, contain less than 150 ppm
of magnesium and 1,500 ppm of sodium, high levels of which are deleterious
to cattle. Experience has shown local cattle are well adapted to such
waters and the danger of hypersalinity is small. Moreover, certain wells
with unusually high salt content are of particular nutritional value and,
altho"g"h stock cannot be safely watered from them for more than a few days,
pastoralists arrange that animals benefit from such waters for three or four
short periods during each year.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
25.       The advantages and disadvantages of boreholes as opposed to wells
are discussed in Annex 4. From the point of view of range management, it
needs to be stressed that because boreholes with pumps usually yield large
amounts of water quickly and easily, they can readily lead to serious over-
grazing, if there is no deliberate control. Some of the functional boreholes
in Chari Beguirmi, yielding up to 12 or 13 liters/second, now support an
estimated 20,000 to 30,000 cattle per borehole. Inevitably, this can only
last for a short time because of the severe overgrazing which follows. Be-
cause no system of water or grazing control will yet be adopted voluntarily
by the pastoralists, nor can be imposed by Government, the proposed adherence
to traditional (bull-power) methods for drawing water from wells provides a
rudimentary but effective brake on overgrazing. Because of the dangers of
overgrazing around high-yielding boreholes, it is not recommended that they
be constructed for normal stock watering purposes.
26.       In addition to shortage of permanent water and high calf mortality
(para 16), there are two other important factors, both related to nutrition,
which restrict animal production. One is the high annual loss (30 to 50%) of
potential grazing due to accidental and intentional fire; the other is re-
striction of grazing time due to enclosure of flocks and herds from before
dusk until after dawn. When the hours spent travelling to and from water,
watering at the wellhead, and in the enclosure, have been accounted for, it
is likely that daily grazing is reduced to some six hours, mainly during the
hottest period of the day.
27.       Other factors which now restrict further expansion and modernization
of the Chad cattle industry (in addition to the limitations imposed by the
shortage of feed and water) are:
(a) inadequacy of educational, extension, regulatory and research
services;
(b) remoteness combined with poor communications, resulting in
high development costs and difficult marketing; and
(c) traditional and ill-defined patterns of land ownership and
rights of use.
28.       The extensive cattle industry in Kanem, Batha and Ouaddai can func-
tion with reasonable efficiency for breeding, but the offtake is essentially
unfinished immatures and poor quality cows and bulls at the end of their
breeding life. Stratification is needed so that stock, particularly imma-
tures, can be fattened and finished in areas of higher rainfall and agricul-
tural potential nearer the abattoirs and ultimate markets.
29.       A French company (Pastorale Prodel) attempted to fatten immature
stock prior to slaughter on a ranch at Ouadi Rimi established in 1953 by the
Chad Government with U.S. Government assistance. However, the ranch is some
550 km from Fort Lamy abattoir. Officials claim that it took 18 months to
put on 40 kg carcass weight and between 15 and 40 kg were commonly lost dur-



ANNEX 2
Page 7
ing the trek to the abattoir. The ranch no longer functions, at least pending
the establishment of a satisfactory stock route from Ati to Fort Lamy.
30.       The problems besetting private ranching schemes include:
(a) finding enough land which is unoccupied or from which local
tribes can be displaced;
(b) high cost of capital improvements (e.g. fencing, water and
housing); and
(c) difficulty of preventing fire, cattle theft and tribal en-
croachment.
31.       An alternative would be to fatten cattle on local farms in the
south (particularly near Fort Lamy and Fort Archambault), supplementing nat-
ural pasture with cash crop and food crop residues and surpluses (e.g. cotton
seed, wheat bran, millet, sorghum and groundnut meal).
32.       Future development might also include group, company or individual
ranches owned and operated by tribal or family shareholders (as in the Kenya
Livestock Development Project 1/), but this is unlikely to be possible in
Chad for some years.
33.       Whatever the ultimate pattern of breeding and fattening, a network
of improved stock routes from Ati, Moussoro and Mao to Fort Lamy is needed.
A substantial reduction, if not elimination, of weight losses (now of the
order of 10 to 25%) could be achieved by establishment of properly controlled
stock routes with permanent water at intervals of about 25 km.
34.       Another urgent need is the maintenance and further development of
essential educational, extension, research and veterinary services, including
pastoralist, farmer and technician training, particularly in range management
and animal husbandry. At the same time, it is essential that the work of
the veterinary services is not interrupted by shortage of staff, equipment,
or funds. Also, providing additional permanent water, and thus extending
effective grazing area, is a comparatively simple way of increasing animal
production.
35.       Further increases in production must depend on improvement in range
and animal management by the pastoralists, associated with improved marketing
and meat processing arrangements. It is essential to find out how best this
may be brought about and to start an action program. This will be one of the
tasks of the Livestock Development Unit (Annexes 8 and 9).

G. Livestock Services
36.       A separate Ministry of Livestock, Marketing, Water, Forestry, Fish-
ing, and Hunting (Ministry of Livestock) was established in May 1971 to in-
crease the effectiveness of the livestock development efforts and to provide
broad and integrated initiatives for a sound and coordinated national live-
stock development plan.
37.       Within Government, responsibility for livestock matters since May
1971 rests with the Ministry of Livestock (Chart 1) and for water supply with
the Ministry of Rural Development (Chart 2).  Although the time is too short
to evaluate the effects of the reorganization, it seems that the Government
intends to coordinate all efforts for livestock development wtthin the new
Ministry of Livestock. The cooperation between it and the Ministry of Rural
Development and other relevant institutions for livestock development seems
to be good. There are three categories of technical staff in the Ministry
of Livestock:
(a) veterinary inspectors (inspecteur veterinaire);
(b) livestock officers (controleur d'elevage); and
(c) veterinary assistants (infirmier veterinaire).
The following table summarizes the staffing positions as of December 31,
1970:
Category             Establishment/1  Future Need/              Salaries/3
(CFAF '000 per month)
Veterinary Inspector            9\         17 immediately    200-500 (French)
40 by 1975/80       60-70  (Chadian)
Livestock Officer              31/                12            40-50
Veterinary Assistant          191                 280           15-20
/1   All veterinary inspectors are French expatriates.  At present, 13
Chadians are receiving veterinary training in Italy, Belgium, Senegal
and the Soviet Union, and of these, three are expected to graduate in
1972 and the others from 1973 to 1976.
/2   Official estimates of the Ministry of Livestock.
/3   Salaries of veterinary inspectors are paid by FAC while those of live-
stock officers and veterinary assistants are financed from the national
budget.
38.       Livestock officers attend a three-year course at the Central African
School for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science at Farcha (Fort Lamy)
following three years of general secondary education. Some 10 to 15 students



ANNEX 2
Page 9
are accepted each year, of whom five or six are from Chad.  A two-year
course in Animal Husbandry, to follow the present three-year course dealing
mainly with the practice of disease control, is planned from 1972/73.
39.       Veterinary assistants follow primary education with a two-year
course at the Chad Veterinary School, also at Farcha. Some five to 10 stu-
dents a year enter this course but, since all are subsequently employed in
the Ministry of Livestock, the annual intake is determined by the Ministries'
budget prospects.
40.       Almost all staff are fully occupied with disease control.  Veteri-
nary assistants operate vaccination campaigns in the field under the super-
vision of district livestock officers. There is virtually no livestock ex-
tension service (except a small scheme to train cotton growers in the south
to manage draft animals) and there is no farmer training center. No section
in the Ministry of Livestock deals as yet specifically with animal husbandry,
range management or livestock marketing.
41.       Chad veterinary services are well supported by the Farcha Veterinary
Research Laboratory, which is a regional institution forming part of the
Region de Recherches Veterinaires et Zootechniques d'Afrique Centrale and is
organized, staffed and partly financed by the long-established Institut
d'Elevage et de Medecine Veterinaire des Pays Tropicaux in Paris. This Lab-
oratory has a professional staff of two (with no vacancy) and, besides its
veterinary research program, it produces a wide range of vaccines (rinder-
pest, black leg, pleuropneumonia, black water, rabies, etc.) and participates
in teaching programs. A rangeland ecologist on the staff has published
useful information and vegetation maps describing the rangelands of Kanem
and certain parts of Batha.
42.       Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Livestock there are
several individuals financed by bilateral and international technical aid.-
There are, for example, programs for poultry produciqon (now being extended
on similar lines for pigs, cattle fattening and dairying), animal feed
production and installation of windmill pumps. USAID is providing an econo-
mist and range management consultant for the Chad Basin Commission, and
Arthur D. Little, Inc., American management consultants, has completed a
report to the Government on meat production potential.
H. Summary and Conclusions
43.       There is considerable potential for increasing livestock production
in Chad by:
(a) increasing livestock numbers t.-:ough provision of more
permanent water points to new areas of pasture available;
and



ANNEX 2
Page 10
(b) increasing the efficiency of livestock production by in-
troducing improved techniques of animal husbandry and range
management and by improving marketing facilities and
procedures.
44.       The first can be readily undertaken and, so long as water points
are properly designed, suitably sited and adequately maintained, their in-
troduction produces well defined, though limited, benefits.
45.       The second is likely to produce much wider and continually expand-
ing benefits. However, to achieve them, more and better trained staff in
Government services would be needed to work closely with better educated
livestock owners and imprave the efficiency with which they ue.and conserve
avilable water and soil and vegetation and breed, fatten and market their
animals.

Cattle Marketing
Production and Utilization
1.        In 1970, the last year for which adequate statistics are available,
some 500,000 cattle, equivalent to 64,000 m tons of carcass meat, were con-
sumed or exported, out of a cattle population estimated at 4.5 million.
This represents an offtalke of about 11.0%. Inadequacy of cattle statistics
makes it impossible to determine whether there has been a change in herd
size but available figures place the number of cattle constantly at 4.5 mil-
lion since 1966. These, however, are based on casual observations in the
field and may not reflect actual changes. -
2.        About 260,000 head of cattle were consumed in the country -- 72%
(in terms of carcass weight) in rural areas, 16% in the two large urban cen-
ters of Fort Lamy and Fort Archambault, and 12% in other urban areas. Al-
though they constituted 52% of total offtake, they represented only 43% of
total offtake carcass weight (Table 1).
3.        About 241,000 animals were exported -- about 150,000 (62%) on the
hoof, mainly to Nigeria (67%) and the Central African Republic (CAR) (20%);
about 22,000 in the form of dried meat, mainly to Nigeria; and 69,000 as
chilled meat to various destinations in Africa (Tables 1, 2 and 3).  Exported
cattle represent about 48% of total offtake in numbers and 56% in weight.
4.        Exports of fresh meat started in 1948.  Stimulated by the estab-
lishment of modern abattoirs at Fort Lamy (1958) and Fort Archambault (1960),
annual exports of chilled meat have now grown to about 12,000 m tons, of
which some 11,000 m tons are beef (Tables 1 and 3). Most of this meat is
purchased for urban consumption in Zaire, Congo (Brazzaville) and Gabon.
One foreign-owned company accounts for about 50% of meat exports, while the
remainder is handled by several smaller exporters (Table 3).
5.        Endemic animal diseases (e.g. rinderpest and foot and mouth) pre-
clude beef or cattle exports to the higher priced markets of Europe, but
there is considerable potential for further expansion of exports to West and
Central Africa. Reductions in the cost of air freight has led to an in-
crease in beef exports to Zaire, from 150 m tons in 1965 to 7,180 m tons
in 1970. Furthermore, normalization of conditions in Nigeria (Chad's major
market for live cattle) and rising standards of living cause a rapid increase
in demand for beef. The general expectation is that demand will continue to
rise in West and Central Africa, resulting in an upward pressure on prices.
Although African demand is not for high grade meat, there is a danger that
the quality of Chad beef may decline below acceptable levels and that markets
in Central and West Africa will be lost as a result.

Markets and Prices
6.        The numerous livestock markets, where intermediate buyers meet
producers or traders, are highly organized in a traditional way but lack
modern facilities, such as auction floors and weighscales. Producers are
generally aware of local market conditions but lack information about the
broader national and international scene. The prices paid to producers for
cattle of different qualities are shown in Tables 4 and 5. They varied in
1970 between CFAF 3,500 (US$13) for cull cows in local markets to CFAF 12,500
(US$45) for medium quality, and CFAF 15,000 (US$55) or more for top quality
export animals at Fort Lamy and Fort Archambault. The breakdown of costs of
marketing cattle, which did not change substantially regarding the percentages
in the past years, is shown in Table 6.
Movement of Cattle
7.        Main cattle production areas are far from Chadian consumption and
processing centers, and farther still from export markets. Roads are poor,
usually impassable for vehicles in the rainy season (July to September),
and there are no railways or well-defined and controlled stock routes.
Cattle must walk long distances to market and export meat is transported by
air. Movement of livestock and meat is, therefore, important in the devel-
opment of the livestock industry.
8.        Within Chad, cattle move along two general directions.  The major
route leads from the north and northeast to Fort Lamy for consumption, pro-
cessing or export on the hoof to Nigeria. The other route goes from the
northeast to the south for slaughter at Fort Archambault, or live export to
CAR. The trek to Fort Lamy or Fort Archambault takes nearly a month. From
there it takes another two months to reach Lagos, the Nigerian capital, and
one month to reach Bangui, CAR's capital. Moving cattle over such long dis-
tanices involves intermediaries and causes losses. The southern route, for
example, involves passage through tsetse-infested areas. However, for the
risk involved, marketing costs are not unduly high. Export duties account
for a high proportion of the difference between producer price and terminal
market price (Table 6), but there is a high incidence (about 50%) of duty
evasion, which, as additional profit, accrues to livestock dealers.
Abattoirs
9.        The Fort Lamy abattoir is Government-owned but enjoys financial
autonomy. It has an annual slaughter capacity of 12,000 m tons (about 80,000
head) and, since it is now working close to full capacity, it will be ex-
panded to a capacity of 18,000 tons. It is technically efficient and includes
refrigeration facilities. The institution is financially self-sufficient and
generates a profit. A cold storage and palletization facility was constructed
at Fort Lamy airport in 1967 and about three-fifths of the annual throughput
of beef is now exported by DC 8 aircraft operated by the French Airlines UTA
and Air Afrique (Table 7).



ANNEX 3
Page 3
10.       The Fort Archambault abattoir has an annual capacity of about
17,000 head (3,000 m tons). It is equipped with refrigeration and, in 1967,
an ambitious meat processing complex was added, including a canning factory.
It is being operated by a company financed largely (80%) by the Government.
Due to insufficient cattle supply, however, the Fort Archambault abattoir
has never worked near capacity and for the moment has stopped production
(Table 7).
Prospects for Production, Consumption and Exports
11.       The realization of Chad's potential as a meat exporter will require
marked changes in production and marketing. Because of the high cost of air
freight, present meat exports depend upon supply of cattle at low prices.
Therefore, continued price rises may affect exports of meat by air. Expan-
sion of production depends, in the short term, upon increased avilability
of water and pasture to increase the cattle population and, in the long term,
upon improved offtake rates and carcass quality through better methods of
animal husbandry and the simultaneous development of an adequate marketing
infrastructure.
12.       Basic to an expansion of the livestock industry is the willingness
of the cattle owners to improve productivity and increase cattle sales.
The pastoralists live at or near a subsistence level and look upon their
stock primarily as a source of food (milk from cattle and meat from sheep
and goats). Only incidentally are livestock regarded as a source of cash
income. The Ministry of Livestock estimates the yearly income of a family
of 10 in Bahr-el-Gazal (the richest livestock area) at about CFAF 48,000,
corresponding to a per capita income of CFAF 4,800, equivalent to US$17.
Little is known about consumption habits. Of the expenditures of such a
family, 29% would go to taxes (if all taxes               wheerepa   motthe
o salt_                   and clxa hin g.  There

pxtssure    nc~renX  cash ii^O4auvjon  l;a   t.  The pastoralists are becoming
increasingly more commercial in their attitudes towards their livestock and
more interested in marketing systems and facilities. They are reluctant to
pay taxes and the incidence of taxation and method of collection need to be
modified. There is some evidence that the present taxation system forces
cattlemen occasionally to sell breeding stock, and it certainly reduces their
confidence in, and willingness to cooperate with, Government. The Government
is willing to resolve the taxation problem. The establishment of a separate
livestock ministry is intended to give new impetus to fiscal reform efforts.
13.       In 1966, domestic beef consumption was estimated at 23,600 m tons
(carcass weight) and exports at 36,600 m tons. In 1970, these estimates
are 27,440 and 36,200 m tons, respectively. This would seem to indicate
that production increases have been utilized to meet domestic demand. Exports
seem to have declined somewhat. In the absence of comprehensive and consis-
tent statistics, it cannot be ascertained whether these figures accurately
reflect actual developments. In the future, three factors are likely to de-
termine the utilization of Chad's offtake. First, total production is likely
to increase only slowly, if at all. Considering the time needed for prepara-



ANNEX 3
Page 4
tion and implementation of an effective livestock development program (where
none exists at present) and for such a program to produce results under
Chadian conditions, no substantial production increases should be expected
in the foreseeable future. Secondly, a large part of offtalce (possibly as
much as 35 to 40%) is unsuitable for export.  There is no visible trend
towards amelioration in animal diseases, undernourishment of calves, and
other debilitating factors which render animals unfit for export. Thirdly,
the utilization of exportable cattle and beef will probably be determined by
domestic and export price levels. Chadian incomes are likely to rise slower
than those in its export markets (particularly Nigeria) for cattle and beef.
This may enable foreign consumers to price Chadian consumers out of the
market, which could slow down the domestic consumption of expor-table cattle
and beef. Under the circumstances, it may be expected that exports will
grow somewhat faster than domestic consumption. Assuming a future annual
growth of offtake of 1.4% per year (as implied in the export and consumption
figures above), offtake in 1976 may amount to 68,O00 m tons, of which 40,000
in tons would be exported and 28,00n m tons consumed locally (Appendix 3).

DEMAND FOR BEEF IN SELECTED WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES
Regional Structures of Beef Production and Consumption in Western Africa
1.        Cattle in West and Central Africa, South of the Sahara, for
decades have been concentrated on the Savannah, between the parallels of
10°N and 15°N latitude. The northern boundary for raising livestock is
limited by ecological factors, mainly the lack of year-round grazing and
water. The southern limit for sustained cattle raising near the coastal
rain forest zone usually is restricted by the seasonal presence of the tsetse
fly and various debilitating livestock diseases. Cattle production in the
Savannah was sufficient during the 1950's and 1960's to meet nearly all
West Africa's effective demand for beef. Relatively small quantities of
higher quality, chilled or frozen beef were imported each year from Europe
and South America, mainly for European consumers in coastal cities.
2.        Marked differences in per capita beef consumption throughout the
West African region existed in 1966, and these characteristics probably are
still typical today. Briefly, consumption of butcher's meat and edible
offals in Mali, Niger, Northern Nigeria, and Upper Volta (which produce
more meat than they consume locally) averaged nearly 20 kg. per person each
year for "town dwellers" and almost 9 kg per capita for "country people" in
the mid-1960's. 2/ Beef constituted about 55 percent of this meat. Average
per capita consumption of beef (including edible offals) in coastal regions
(Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Togo, Ghana, and Southern Nigeria) in 1966 ranged
from 2.4-6.3 kg. a year. However, average consumption among urban popula-
tions in these deficit regions probably equalled that among town dwellers
in the surplus countries. Increasing incomes and urbanization in coastal
countries during the 1960's increased the effective demand for meats there,
but exportable supplies in several exporting regions supplying Southern
Nigeria did not increase correspondingly during the late 1960's, partly at
least because local consumption increased in these surplus areas. Generally
speaking, population increased much faster than cattle numbers in West
Africa during the 1960's.
1/   This review refers mainly to Nigeria and the principal beef-surplus
countries (Niger and Chad) exporting to this market. The situation
in Mali, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Togo, Ghana and Zaire
is covered briefly.

Organization and Structure of Intra-Regional Trade in Live Cattle and Beef
3.        Traditional cattle marketing patterns were established many years
ago. The seasonal, north-south movement of cattle within the Savannah in
search of grass and water facilitates butchering of cattle for local consump-
tion. Surplus cattle each year are driven on the hoof south to the coast
instead of being moved to northern grazing areas at the beginning of the
rainy season. Animals which apparently cannot complete the long drive to
the coast are sold to butchers enroute. Traditional cattle trails developed
by drovers in Mali, Upper Volta, Niger, and Chad generally lead west and
south. Most surplus Chadian cattle usually walk to Northern Nigeria, often
through Niger, while the rest are driven south to the Central African Republic
and Cameroon. The limited statistics available indicate that this trade
changed little in either volume or direction during the 1960's (Table 1).
Wholesale beef price differentials reflect this cattle movement rather
closely, and prices typically increase as one goes west or south from Fort
Lamy.
4.        The establishment of refrigeration facilities at the Fort Lamy
abattoir and the development of capability fo ship chilled beef by air from
Fort Lamy were important developments in the intra-regional trade in beef,
which previously had been limited mainly to shipments of dried meat. Statis-
tics on Chadian meat exports indicate shipments have doubled and new markets
have been developed since 1966 (Annex 3, Table 3). These trends were in
marked contrast with estimates of live cattle exports, which certainly were
static and probably indicated a declining trend developed during the late
1960's (Table 1).
Recent Expansion in Effective Demand for Beef in West Africa
5.        Beef consumption in West Africa traditionally has been determined
largely by the number of live cattle sold by herd owners. Statistics on
cattle numbers and slaughter are completely inadequate for appraising the
nature of cattle owners' response to demand or price or his intentions for
expanding his herds specifically to meet increased future demands. Never-
theless, several indicators suggest that effective demand for beef in
coastal cities expanded faster than local beef supplies during the late
1960's. Prices for live cattle increased significantly during 1969 and
1970, particularly in the case of animals suitable for export (Annex 3,
Table 4), and similar increases in wholesale prices for premium quality
beef for export occurred in Fort Lamy during 1970 (Annex 3, Table 5). Further-
more, imports of chilled and frozen beef by Ivory Coast, one of the two
leading importers in the region, increased during the late 1960's (Table 2).
Purchases abroad since 1968 have meant transactions at consistently increasing
prices. 1/ These higher prices probably discouraged import demand in
Zaire anJ other coastal countries in West Africa (Table 2).
1/   Representative international beef prices increased about 7 percent during
1969, and another 27 percent in 1970.

Outlook for Chadian Exports of Beef
6.        This report elsewhere (Annex 3, paragraph 13) stipulates offtake
from Chadian herds should increase to 68,000 tons of beef by 1976, compared
with 63,640 tons in 1970, of which 40,000 tons would be available for export.
This projected increase, which represents an annual rate of growth in
exports of 1.7 percent a year from 1970-76, is considerably less than recent
projections of meat consumption in Nigeria, which is expected to grow 30
percent by 1975, and another 30 percent by 1980. 1/ Recent FAO estimates 2/
imply meat imports by both Nigeria and Zaire may nearly double
between 1975 and 1985. Most of this will be beef, if adequate supplies
become available. Nigerian imports alone were projected in two studies to
approach 41,000 tons of beef in 1975 and 60,000 tons in 1979/80. 3/ Con-
currently, exportable supplies from Niger were projected to remain alternatively
constant during the 1970's. One may conclude from these estimates that
regional demand for Chadian beef will exceed projected increases in supplies
during the 1970's, and that local cattle prices should continue to increase
significantly during the decade.

CHAD
LTVFSTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Hydrogeology -- Well Construction, Repair and Renovation
A. Regional Hydrogeology
1.        The major hydrogeological features of Western Central Chad in
which the Project is situated, have been well described in various publica-
tions 1/, which include maps of the surface geology, electrical resistivity
of the groundwater (as an indication of salinity), chemical characteristics,
and depth to water surface. The maps coverlng the Project Area are based
on somewhat limited data. However, as BRGM published a detailed hydrogeo-
logical map of Chad in 1969, available data become more reliable.
2.        The sedimentary sequence in which the aquifers occur is an alter-
nation of clays, clayey sands, sandy clays and sands of Tertiary-Quaternary
Age and lacustrine or fluviatile origin. The aquifers consist of weakly
cemented or free sands which are poorly graded and probably occur as lenticu-
lar bodies of varying thickness and lateral extent. The degree of intercon-
nection between adiacent lenticular bodies is variable, both laterally and
vertically.
R. The Guetty and Harr Areas of West Batha
X.        The ground surface elevation in the Project Areas of Guetty and
Harr is about 30n meters above sea level. The topography is subdued and
there are no perennial streams or areas of permanent surface water.
4.        Mean annual rainfall ranges south to north from about 400 mm to
0nn mm, and annual variation is considerable. Rains normally occur from
June to September and high intensity storms are a characteristlc feature.
5.        Mean annual temperature is about 290 C and the mean monthly tem-
perature range is from about 24' C during the relatively cool winter months
to about 39 C in the weeks preceding the rains. Mean annual relative humid-
ity is of the order of 40% -- about 20% during the long dry season and about
Rnf during the rains.  Potential evaporation exceeds 350 cm per annum.  Winds
are relativelv weak, except during storms, blowing mainly from the northeast
during the drv season and from the southwest during the wet.

ANNEX 4
Page 2
6.        The most extensive soil type is sand but, due to weak winds and
extensive grass cover, mobile dunes are uncommon. Clay flats occur in
interdunal areas.  Vegetation is mainlv annual grasses with scattered acacia.
7.        No estimates have been made of direct recharge but, due to the low
rainfall, high temperature and extensive cover of growing plants during the
rainy season, it is probably small. The shape of the equipotential water
surface indicates that indirect recharge from losses in the drainage channels
is not a malor factor in the recharge pattern. However, the wide spacing
and low mean discharge of the proposed wells make recharge of the aquifer
of relativelv minor importance. Appreciable lowering of the water table by
withdrawals is not expected, although there is evidence of a regional decline
of 1 or 2 cm per year.
8.        The Guetty area lies within a shallow9 northeast by southwest
groundwater trough. Harr is on the eastern end of a low amplitude ground-
water mound. Groundwater gradients are low, being of the order of 1:2,000.
The depth to water in Guetty ranges between 30 and 60 meters; in Harr between
5 and 60 meters. Permeability of the aquifer probably varies considerably.
Specific capacities ranging from 0.1 liter/second/meter to 5 liters/second/meter
have been recorded, and about 1 liter/second/meter appears to be fairly com-
mon. No estimates are available for specific yield (effective storage) but in
acuifer material of this type the long-term storage factor under water table
conditions might he expected to range between 5 and 157.
The water quality is variable.  In the Guetty area, concentrations
of dissolved solids range from 25n to over 6,000 parts per million (ppm) and
much of the groundwater there is of the 1,500- to 6,000-ppm range.  Many of
the waters in the latter range are sulphate in character and, in some areas,
are also hypersodic. The groundwater of Harr is mainly of higher quality,
the range of total dissolved solids being between 250 and 1,500 ppm. In
most of this area the waters contain 500 to 1,500 ppm but they are of calcium
bicarbonate type. Some of the waters of both Guetty and Harr contain con-
siderable magnesium and the more saline (above 1,000 ppm), in particular the
hypersodic types, will be aggressive to normal metals used in borehole con-
struction. High salt concentrations (greater than 1,500 ppm) with a high
nroportion of magnesium sulphate are normally detrimental to cattle if used
for long periods and care will be needed in siting wells, especially in a
small area to the north of Guetty where saline water is strongly indicated.
C. Selection of Well Sites
1n.       The basic assumptions in selecting well sites have-been that:
(a)  each cattle unit needs a minimum of 20 liters/day and each
goat/sheep unit 5 liters/day;



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(b) traditional bucket and rope methods of water extraction
would be used, i.e., leather buckets of up to 40 liter
capacity, each drawn by a bull;
(c) six buckets would be worked from each well at a rate
drawing a minimum total of 1 1/sec per well for about
1n hours:
(d) each well would command a 7-km radius, or approximately
15,0nn ha: and
(e) carrving capacity would be one unit (cattle plus goat/
sheep) per 10 ha.
11,       On this basis, wells would have to be spaced at about 14-km inter-
vals. A rigid pattern of well distribution could not be maintained, however,
because patches of the Project Area have poor grazing and there may be low
qualitv water in parts of Guetty. The exact location of the wells (staking
of the sites) would be determined by Genie Rural. The Bureau de Recherches
rZeologiques et Minieres (BRMO) in Paris published in 1969 a detailed hydro-
geological map of Chad which contributed substantially to hydrogeological
information in the Project Area. However, as wells are dug, small changes
in the location of well sites could become desirable. To this end, Genie
Rural.would, during well construction, record and interpret hydrogeological
information. No test borings are considered necessary, however, and no undue
difficultv is expected in finding water in the Project Area.
D. The Argument for Dug Wells
1.        Considerable thought has been given to alternative methods of pro-
viding water and techniques for tapping and lifting water from underground
sources. Small dams were considered, but there is no local knowledge of
stream hvdrology and evaporation would be high. Dams in nearby Nigeria
Proved difficult to site and needed extensive annual maintenance and no ef-
ficient method to reduce evaporation could be devised. Windmill pumps were
rejected for a number of reasons, not the least being the uncertainty of
w,ind nower in the Project Area. Drilled boreholes with pumps may prove
necessarv at depths greater than about 50 meters but the arguments for and
against them at lesser depths are:
For:
(a) capital cost of a borehole is 50% to 75% that for a dug
well, denending on degree of corrosion protection required;
(b)  animals could be watered much more quickly from a borehole,
at less cost in terms of man and animal power, and there
would be more time for grazing; and



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(c) the slow water extraction rate, using the alternative
traditional open well methods, might encourage watering
every second day, which would reduce animal productive
efficiency and possibly increase stocking rate per well
beyond the optimum.
Against:
(a)  yearly running cost of pumps (including labor, fuel and
fuel delivery) would be about TUS$ ,200 per unit; an open
well costs nothing to run except man and bull power,
which has negligible opportunity cost in the Project
Area:
(b)  mechanized pumps need an efficient maintenance unit ca-
pable of providing quick repair. While a maintenance
unit might cost about the same for bores as for wells, a
well is less vulnerable and its complete failure would be
unusual:
(c) Guetty and Harr waters are highly corrosive to metal and,
though some borehole parts could be made of resistant
materials (e.g. fiberglass casing, stainless steel! screens
and pumps), they would increase the capital cost. In any
case, a life of 15 vears would be exceptional for a bore-
hole, whereas wells are likely to last at least 30;
(d) the water users are quite unfamiliar with mechanical de-
vices and accidental damage would be highly probable; bore-
holes and pumps are also more susceptible to malicious
damage: and i
(e) the faster borehole supply of water might lead to over-
stocking in the absence of deliberate control (which seems
likely to be very difficult to enforce in Chad).
On balance, in present conditions in Chad, the powered borehole must be
rejected in favor of the traditionally operated open well.
E. Well Construction
13.       There is now ap accumulation of experience in the designing of
wells to meet Chad conditions. Main criteria are ability to deliver at least
1 1/sec and convenience for six bulls to operate simultaneously. The
basic design now used is:



ANNEX 4
Page 5
(a)  reinforced concrete casing, cast in situ by descending sec-
tions, keyed at 10 meter intervals into surrounding strata,
and of 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) interior diameter to the
water table;
(b)  prefabricated porous concrete elements, 10 cm high, super-
imposed, one on top of the other, without joints and held
in position by six vertical concrete posts poured through
holes in the ringshaped elements to hold them together.
These elements are assembled in the shaft, and the column
thus formed is let down to an adequate depth by undercut-
ting: and
(c)  parapet approximately 0.70 meter, of which 0.50 is above
ground level.
14.       Many types of additional surface installation have been tried, but
the economic justification for some of them is uncertain. The new FED wells,
for example, are equipped additionally as follows:
(a)  reinforced concrete surface platform (keyed to shaft) of
7.2 meter diameter, with gravel foundation and skirting;
(b)  four 1-meter sealed bearing rollers and two 0.20-meter sealed
bearing rollers, each mounted in strong I-girder sup-
ports; and
(c)  six cement basins attached to metal conduits leading to
six metal troughs, each of 250 liter capacity and grouted
into concrete, 6 meters from the well.
15.       While this design is technically efficient, it would add about
US$3,000 to the cost of a well. Pastoralists use both traditional
and concrete wells without these additional surface installations. They
build thorn fences to keep drinking cattle from the well head and make
,troughs in the sand (sometimes clay lined), or from old fuel drums, into
which water is poured from the well. While this traditional system is labor-
ious and somewhat wasteful of water, material costs are so high in Chad that
additional installation should not be provided until cost is carefully weighed
against probable benefit following a series of controlled experiments. In
view of the probable depth of water in the new Project wells (averaging 44
meters), however, it is proposed to equip them at least with rollers (which
have been tested and are proven) and troughs (without basins and conduits)
to ensure that the required amount of water can reasonably be drawn by
traditional methods. This additional installation per well (including con-
tingerncies) would be about TTSS1,i100, which has been included in the estimated
cost.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
16.       Wells are dug by hand and two teams are engaged in the work.  The
first sinks (settles) the shaft, positions the lining, assembles the column
and does the undercutting. The second works on the surface, finishes the
parapet and installs troughs, spouts and other facilities. When construction
starts, the shaft is sunk as far as the soil is firm. After reaching about a
10-meter depth, the shaft is lined with reinforced concrete, working from the
bottom upward. Thereafter, the lining of the shaft is resumed in the same
way by sections of about 1 meter. When the water table is reached, the team
stops with the lining and commences the assembly of the "Baziadoly" filter
column rings in the shaft, which have been precast in advance close by the
well (see para 17 and Diagram 1). A metal frame is put on the spot, rings
are stuck one on the other and the rings and the frame are linked by round
vertical iron bars in precast holes. After completion, the column is brought
into proper position by undercutting, which is done by frogmen who receive
air from the surface.
17.       Although originally Hagusta filter was proposed, evidence has ac-
cumulated to indicate that the Baziadoly filter was an improved type for
Chadian conditions and firmly recommended by BRGM in Paris. Genie Rural
feels that the change of the filter type is justified and the Government ac-
cepts this alteration. According to BRGM and Genie Rural hydrologists and
engineers, the Baziadoly filter, where used, showed a lower degree of clog-
ging and less breakage, would be cheaper to install and, consequently, would
have lower maintenance cost. The Baziadoly filter is made of reinforced con-
crete rings 15 cm thick and 10 cm high, with four to six vertical holes.
These rings are cast in the vicinity of the shaft. They are superimposed on
each other in the shaft and linked together by reinforced concrete posts
through the holes after installation in the shaft. The reinforcement of the
posts is attached to that of the rings by means of pins. The column is then
positioned by undercutting. The water penetrates into the well through the
space left between the rings, resulting from roughness of the ring surfaces.
The average width of space is about 1 cm. With a column of this type the
water can easily penetrate into the shaft. The Baziadoly column proved to
be better under Chadian conditions as it does not stop solid particles con-
tained in the water, unlike the Hagusta strainers, originally proposed for
construction by the 1968 appraisal mission, although the amount of such
solids entering is no more than that from the ropes and buckets used for
drawing water from the well. The advantages of this type of filter, further-
more, are its sturdiness, the simplicity of its use and its lasting permea-
bility compared to the Hagusta strainers, which are very quickly blocked in
the soils of the Project region. When necessary, the permeability of the
filter can be increased by replacing one out of every two reinforced concrete
rings by a similar ring of porous reinforced concrete.
18.       The basic price bid by the successful contractor in April 1971 is
equivalent to US$18,300 per well. However, physical contingency of 10%,
price contingency of 27% and provision of 15% on top of this price have been
allowed in estimating total Project cost. The 27% price contingency is based
on a 10% cost escalation per year from April 1971 till the expected date of
completion in March 1974. Further details are given in Annex 5.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
19.       The proposed 38 new wells could be constructed over two years,
the actual time depending on intervention of the rainy season. It is assumed
construction would start during 1972 and be finally completed about March
1974.
F. Well Repair and Renovation
20.       There are 126 concrete-lined wells in Batha that were constructed
in 1955. It was reported, after a sample survey in November 1966, that about
half were in danger of collapse and that about 80 needed repair to surface
works to restore them to full productive efficiency. A survey, carried out
by an IDA consultant (SAUTI) to determine the nature of repairs needed to
the casing and existing surface installations of each well and to estimate
the cost of the necessary repairs and surface installations, showed that
102 wells needed repairs that could not be done by Genie Rural. These are
included in the proposed Project. The remaining 24 could be restored by
well maintenance units to be established under the Project.
21.       The heavy filter column in the earlier wells was firmly attached
to the casing. As water was drawn from the aquifer and the well settled
(which it nearly always does), the weight of the filter proved too great
for the casing of some of the wells and it cracked. If it cracked near the
bottom, water and sand seeped in and a cavity formed behind the casing. In
time this can cause lateral displacement or toppling of the filter column.
Wherever the casing has cracked, the well may become less effective, but it
should be possible, in most cases, to repair the cracked casing by filling
and grouting, or perhaps lining the crack, the amount of work depending on
the extent of damage.
22.       Average repair and renovation cost per well is US$5,800 including
contingencies and supervision but there are wide variations in repair costs.
The repair survey showed that 30 wells need major filter repairs, nearly all
need renovations of surface installations and casing repairs, and about 50
need cleaning and parapet repairs. Although all wells would have parapets
to prevent rapid silting from sand blown and kicked down the well and from
minor surface collapse, silting would nevertheless occur through sand being
picked up and carried down on wet ropes and buckets dropped on the ground
during operation.
G. Well Maintenance
23.       Although concrete-lined open wells can function for long periods
without attention, it is important that they be inspected and maintained
regularly, as the survey of the existing Batha wells showed. The Government



ANNEX 4
Page 8
established a unit for well maintenance but it has not worked for lack of
equipment and operating funds. Therefore, the Project proposes to establish
two fully staffed and equipped units and to make them operational.
24.       The composition of the personnel of the proposed maintenance units
is identical with that of the units which have been working satisfactorily
for five years under similar conditions in the adjacent Republic of Niger 1/.
Each unit would consist of 37 men, an expatriate head of the unit, a rural
work engineer and his local counterpart, and an expatriate assistant-techni-
cian and his local counterpart. Furthermore, there would be five small spe-
cialized teams, each consisting of five men for different types of maintenance
work. Finally, there would be one specialist for filters, three drivers, two
assistant driver-mechanics, one clerk (bookkeeping, storeman) and one guard
in each unit.
25.       The equipment of each unit would consist of two heavy twin-axle
trucks, one four-wheel car of the landrover type and specialized equipment
such as derrick and gins, compressors, power generating and welding sets, and
pumps. The capacity of each unit would be about 140 wells per year, and each
well would be checked once every three years.
26.       Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 7 and include provisions
for operating cost. Because of the Government's tight financial position,
IDA would (to get the work of the units started) finance 100% of operating
cost (including foreign technical staff) in the first year and 50% in the
second year. The Government would finance 50% of operating cost in the second
year and all in subsequent years, including replacements. Capital cost would
be about US$371,000, salaries for two units over three years would be about
US$362,000, and other operating costs would total US$220,000.

CHAD
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Livestock Development Unit
Terms of Reference
A. Establishment and Objective
1.        A Livestock Development Unit would be established within the
Ministry of Livestock to develop livestock production through improved
animal husbandrv, range management and livestock marketing. It would work
closelv with other services of the Ministry of Livestock (particularly the
veterinary service), the Genie Rural, the livestock training and research
institutes, and local representatives of bilateral and international aid
organizations, particularly FAC, FED and UNDP. Its work would be reviewed
everv three months by the Ministry of Livestock which would, for this pur-
pose, convene a meeting at senior level with the Ministry of Pinance, the
High Commission for Planning, and the Ministry of Rural Development (Genie
Rural). LDI would also submit progress reports to UNDP and IDA every three
months.
B. Composition
2.        The unit would consist of:
(a)  Read of the Unit  -  a livestock specialist with a wide
and practical experience in cattle, sheep and goat produc-
tion in semi-erid areas;
(b) Animal Production Officer - a livestock specialist with
extensive experience in stock raising in Sahelian areas.
He would function as assistant to the Head of the Unit;
(c) Rangeland Ecologist - with experience in the rational use
and conservation of soil and vegetation in semi-arid
savannah;
(d) Agricultural Economist - with experience in the
economics of livestock production and the marketing
of animals and animal products;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(e)  Chadian Counterpart to the Head of Mission  -  in the
absence of experienced candidates for this post, this
would be a European-trained veterinarian who has just
completed his studies. He would be attached to the unit
to obtain experience through practical work in development
planning and project preparation for the livestock sector.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the above
specialists will be subject to the approval of IDA.
C. Consultants
3.        The unit would be authorized to appoint (and would have budget
provision for) consultants on short-term contracts to advise it on
particular problems such as hydrogeology in areas needing water; livestock
processing and marketing; livestock extension services; training of staff
in animal husbandry; and control and management of stock routes. Appoint-
ments and terms of reference would be subject to IDA's approval.
D. Supporting _Staff
4.        The Government would provide supporting staff, including livestock
officers and assistants but, because of a lack of qualified staff and
budgetary constraints, it could not obtain such personnel during the first
year. During the second and subsequent years, however, two livestock
officers and two assistants would be engaged as would two secretaries and
three drivers.
E. Operation
5.        The unit would operate for an initial period of three years,
during which time it would:
(a) prepare a broad and coordinated plan indicating
priorities for the further development of the
Chad livestock industry; and
(b) identify and prepare in detail at least one further
investment project appropriate for international
financing and in accord with the priorities indicated
by the plan.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
6.        The unit would also investigate in detail the technical feasibility
and economic return of proposed projects, including the following topics
in its program for study and, if appropriate, project preparation:
(a) provision of further water points in the livestock
producing areas of Chad-
(b) establishment or improvement of one or more stock
routes (e.g. Ati to Fort Lamy) and such associated
staging or holding grounds as can be economically
justified;
(c) creation of cattle ranches in the semi-arid savannah
belt, which may be controlled by overseas interests
or by local people organized on a group, company,
cooperative or individual basis;
(d) stratification of the cattle industry involving
movement of immature cattle from the north to be
fattened on mixed farms of high potential in the
south, particularly in localities near Fort Lamy and
Fort Archambault where cash crop and food crop sur-
pluses or by-products may be available as stock feed;
(e) extension and/or improvement of marketing facilities
and practices and of slaughter and processing arrange-
ments;
(f) improvement of extension services and training of
pastoralists in livestock management and staffing for
these services; and
(g) any other topic that may be agreed upon by the Livestock
Council in consultation with IDA.
7.        The unit would also undertake field investigations in order to
provide the necessary basis for project preparation. These investigations
would include:
(a) a study of the ways in which wells, particularly the
45 new wells financed by IDA, are used for livestock
production, paying particular attention to the
measurement of possible ecological changes in the
vegetation, the effects on animal production and the
economic consequences of the development;



ANNEX 8
Page 4
(b) identification of range management and animal
husbandry techniques that could be profitably
introduced immediately into nomadic or semi-
nomadic livestock management;
(c) establishment of demonstration herds and flocks
under the control of trained Arabic-speaking
Chadians that would share water points with the
local people and incorporate improvements into their
system of husbandry;
(d) incidence of livestock taxation and method of collec-
tion: and
(e) initiating an improved system of collecting and
collating livestock statistics.
The Unit will not engage in the implementation of projects.
3.        If the Head of the Unit approves, any of its staff may be sent
on visits to other countries for any purpose directly related to its
objectives, and any of its Chadian staff may be sent abroad for short
neriods of academic studs or practical training in livestock subjects.
9.        It is anticipated that the Unit would prepare a livestock Industry
development plan and propose a suitable project or projects for financing
within about 18 months. In that time, it would also recommend an
organizational structure and staffing for the further development of the
livestock industry, which might or might not include a continuation or
expansion of the unit in existing or modified form. When preparing proj-
ects for financing, the unit would consult frequently with IDA.

Explanatory Notes to the Rate Of Return Calculation
Stock at Beginning of Year
Wells at full capacity would each accomnmodate, on average, 2,100
cattle and 1,800 sheep and goats of mixed ages. In Batha Prefecture, there
are 360 wells from which cattle might be drawn to the Project Area. Of
these, 102 wells (those included in the Project) are defective; it is
assumed that at present they work at 75% of capacity. The other 258 wells
are in better condition, but still show defects; it is assumed that at
present they work at 90X of capacity. The initial size of the herd is
consequently 2,10o (0.75 x 102 + 0.90 x 258) = 648,300 and that of the flock
of sheep and goats 1,800 (0.75 x 102 + 0.90 x 258) - 555,700. Without the
Project, well capacity is assumed to decrease by 5% per year until it
reaches 60%, at which level it stabilizes. The size of the herd and flock
is assumed to be the maximum that can be accommodated.  With the Project,
growth of herd and flock is taken at 37% per year until they reach the
maximum size that can be supported (398 x 2,100 + 835,800 cattle and
398 x 1,800 - 716,400 sheep and goats).
Offtake
The Government estimates that with 11.5% offtake per year for
cattle and about 25% for sheep and goats, the number of animals remains
constant. Without the Proiect, additional stress sales would take place.
These have been computed as the difference in the number of animals in
subsequent two years. With the Project, cattle offtake has been taken at 8.5%
and increase of the herd at 3.0% per year until wells are stocked to capacity.
Subsequently, offtake is calculated at 11.5% per year without herd in-
crease. For sheep and goats, the percentages used are 20, 5, and 25,
respectively.

Source: Derived from Annex 2, Table 1, and Annual Report,
Ministry of Livestock.
Stress sales have been calculated at CFAF 8,000 per head.
The average value of CFAF 10,000 is roughly composed of a producer
price of CFAF 7,000 (in Batha) and CPAF 3,000 of domestic costs (trekking,
trade profits and taxes).
Since 1970, the year to which these prices apply, there have been
further small increases.
Sheep and Goats
The offtake value has been set at CPAF 700 per head for normal
sales and CFAF 500 per head for stress sales.
Residual Value
The incremental herd in year 30 (835,800 - 378,000 - 457,800)
has been valued at CFAF 7,000 per head. The incremental flock in year 30
(716,400 - 324,00n - 392,400) has been valued at CFAF 500 per head. The
lower values (as compared with the offtake values) reflect differences in
co'mnosition of offtake and residual herd or flock: the latter include more
immature animals.

Maintenance of 398 Wells
The Well Maintenance Units would maintain all existing and pro-
jected wells in Chad (828 after completion of the proposed IDA Project).
Since 398 of these would be in the area considered in the rate of return
calculation, 48X (398/828 x 100X) of the investment and operating cost of
the units has been included in the return calculations for the Project.
