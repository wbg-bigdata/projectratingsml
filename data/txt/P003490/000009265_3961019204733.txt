IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
XINJIANG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1764-CHA)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Xinjiang
Agricultural Development Project in China, for which an IDA Credit (Credit 1764-CHA)
in the amount of SDR 57.3 million was approved on March 3, 1987 and made effective
on January 7, 1988.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1994, two years behind
schedule, following extensions granted in May 1992 and December 1993. Final
disbursement took place on April 26, 1995, at which time the balance of SDR 303,869
was canceled. Total disbursements amounted to SDR 57 million. Cofinancing of
A$750,000 was provided by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau;
in addition, the Danish Trust Fund financed some technical experts as part of project
supervision.
The ICR was prepared by a team comprising W.P. Ting
(Agriculturalist) and Li Qun (Consultant). The ICR was reviewed by J. Goldberg, Chief,
EA2RS and Z. Khan, Acting Project Advisor, EA2DR. The borrower provided
comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision
mission in August 1994. It is based on the material in the project file and meetings with
project staff in the field. The borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
contributing views and data requested, its own evaluation of the project's execution, and
comments on the draft ICR.

XINJIANG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1764-CHA)
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.          The main objective of the project was to increase agricultural productivity
and farm incomes in Xinjiang, one of the poorer and less developed areas in China,
through investment in irrigation, rural infrastructure, and agricultural support services
on state farms. It was intended to serve as a model for more productive use of
Xinjiang's arid lands for crop and livestock production. The project was particularly
designed to assist ethnic minority herdsmen in raising livestock and provide productive
employment for women. The main activities to be supported were: (a) construction of
irrigation and drainage on 27,842 ha for food, fiber and fodder crops; (b) improvement
of 25,450 ha of rainfed pasture through fertilizing, fencing and seeding; (c) introduction
of new and improved animal breeds; (d) construction of agro-processing facilities for
vegetable oil, wool processing, slaughterhouses, raisin production, tannery and durum
wheat processing; (e) procurement of equipment for agroprocessing, combines, balers,
scrapers, bulldozers, etc.; and (f) construction of a training center and implementation
of training programs for project personnel, plant managers, equipment operators, and
farm workers.
2.          The objectives were generally well designed, spelled out in the project
documentation, and supported by all the stakeholders. Similarly, they appropriately
reflected the Government's implementation capacity and were consistent with both the
Government's development strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy at the
time of preparation.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.          The project substantially achieved the objective of agricultural growth and
diversification in Xinjiang, and partially achieved secondary goals related to training.
4.          In terms of physical targets, the project has achieved and, in many cases,
exceeded the targets set out in the project documents. For example, total land clearing
and levelling amounted to 21,824 ha, in excess of the original target of 18,200 ha; eight
agro-processing plants were constructed, against an initial plan of seven factories; and
a total of 583 km of roads and 744 km of transmission lines were constructed, well in
excess of the targets of 193 km and 303 km, respectively. A small shortfall occurred
with the grassland component, where 1,716 ha of irrigated land were developed against



- iii -
a target of 2,700 ha, and 5,067 ha of land were seeded against a target of 10,000 ha.
Most of the completed works were of good quality and in compliance with national
standards for safety, health and environment.
5.          In terms of agricultural output, yields and production levels for most crops
were well above the planning assumptions used at appraisal. For example, the total
annual yield of wheat increased during the project period by about 22,106 tons in Bole
(with a unit yield of 3.8 t/ha, which was 7 percent higher than appraisal estimates),
5,661 tons in Hami/Turpan (with a unit yield of 4.5 t/ha, which was 28 percent higher
than appraisal estimates), and 4,773 tons in Emin (with a unit yield of 3.8 t/ha, which
was 7 percent higher than appraisal estimates. The other project crops, including cotton,
grapes, rapeseed, and beets, registered similarly impressive gains. The revised economic
rates of return (ERRs) for the consolidated agricultural activities in the four project areas
are higher than the appraisal estimates, ranging from 21 percent for Zhaosu/Yining
(against an appraisal estimate of 13 percent) to 31 percent for Bole (against an appraisal
estimate of 23 percent).
6.          However, the livestock development program  encountered  some
implementation problems as a result of the impact of the disastrous weather in the winters
of 1992-1994, and the topsoil disturbance on newly developed land. The incremental
annual fodder production increased during the project period by about 6,006 tons in Bole
and 16,900 tons in Emin, with unit yields of 3.5 t/ha and 3.8 t/ha, respectively, well
below the appraisal estimate of 6.0 t/ha. The ERR for the livestock and grassland
development component in Zhaosu amounted to 21 percent, while the ERRs for the
pasture development components in Bole and Emin were negative because of the low
pasture yields.
7.           Overall, the agro-processing factories have performed well and have met
their expected production targets and rates of return. However, some of the factories
experienced initial problems with raw material availability, changing market conditions,
and adequate working capital. The high rate of domestic inflation prevailing during the
second-half of the project, particularly for local building materials and equipment,
increased local counterpart funding requirements and affected the timely completion of
some of the project investments. Most of the plants were characterized by limited
technology transfer and relatively poor physical design. A few of the plants have yet to
reach their designed output levels, while the Yili wool spinning plant has a problem of
product overstocking due to market fluctuations. The revised ERRs for the plants range
from 16 percent for the Yili tannery to 25 percent for the Emin seminola plant.
8.          The training program supported under the project has only been partially
successful, for two reasons. First, as in many projects in China, the implementing
agency was reluctant to use "hard" loan funds to finance "soft" capacity building
activities; as a result, only about 20 percent of the training funds were utilized. Second,
the construction of the training center was delayed for several years, which slowed the



- iv -
delivery of training courses in technical, managerial, and financial aspects of project
implementation.
9.           The project closing date was extended twice, as a result of the delays in
the implementation of the training program, delays in securing the necessary counterpart
funding to complete construction of some agro-processing plants, and the redesign of
some of the agro-processing factories in response to changing market and economic
conditions.
10.         IDA's performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project is viewed as satisfactory to highly satisfactory. IDA's performance in supervision
was also satisfactory, although the project would have benefitted from more frequent
supervision visits. In 1995, after completion of the project, the Bank undertook a review
of its operations in Xinjiang in response to allegations that the Tarim Basin Project
involved the use of forced labor.  The Bank concluded that while the Xinjiang
Agriculture, Industry and Trade Corporation (XAITC) is responsible for administering
some prisons and adjacent farms on behalf of the central Ministry of Justice, XAITC is
implementing Bank projects without the use of forced labor.
11.          The borrower's performance in project preparation and implementation
was also generally satisfactory, though some aspects were deficient: there were frequent
changes of key management staff at project management offices, which undermined
effective supervision of project activities; periodic coordination problems among the
Planning Bureau, Financial Bureau, and the XAITC; and shortages of counterpart funds
and working capital, which affected timely completion of civil works and commissioning
of agro-processing plants.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
12.          Overall Finding. The project, which was conceived at the time when
agricultural reforms were beginning to be introduced in the state farm system throughout
China, has played an important role in promoting key reforms in Xinjiang, such as the
introduction of the production responsibility system and dissemination of new agricultural
technologies. As reviewed above, the actual land development areas and crop yields
generally exceeded appraisal estimates. In particular, excellent results were obtained in
the reclamation of alkaline/saline wastelands through the use of sprinkler irrigation
combined with cultivation measures, which resulted in substantial cost savings and
economic benefits. While grassland irrigation areas and pasture yields were below
appraisal estimates, the quantity and quality of sheep and cattle production was good and
generated high returns for households. The agro-processing component also performed
well, despite some initial problems with financing and market changes.
13.          The project's outcome is viewed as satisfactory, since the first and most
important objective of agricultural growth and diversification in Xinjiang was achieved
with a relatively high degree of sustainability.  As a result of the overall strong



v 
performance of the agriculture and agro-processing activities, the project has contributed
to a significant increase in sectoral productivity and household incomes. The overall
project ERR is estimated at 27 percent, significantly above the SAR estimate of 18
percent. Overall, the project had a fairly strong developmental impact through the
provision of scarce investment funds for the expansion of agricultural production and
value-added processing in a poor, underdeveloped part of China. The project is not
viewed as highly satisfactory because of the limited achievements of the pasture
development program and training activities and the delays in project implementation.
14.          Project Impact. The crop and livestock activities supported under the
project have particularly benefited ethnic minorities and women. Living standards of
minority people on project farms are now higher than those outside the project areas.
In Zhaosu, minority livestock farmers are able to follow a more settled life instead of
moving animals between winter and summer grazing areas. This new pattern not only
has contributed to more efficient fattening of livestock but also has saved scarce labor
time that minority households have redeployed to other income generating activities.
Women have also played an important role in project implementation. They accounted
for 40 and 30 percent of all crop, pasture, and livestock production in Bole and Zhaosu,
respectively; and 51 percent of all crop production in Emin and 46 percent of all grape
production in Hami/Turpan. However, the participation of women in training programs
was not as strong. For example, they only accounted for about 15 percent of the
participants in crop training programs in Bole, Zhaosu, and Hami/Turpan.
15.          Sustainability. The benefits generated by the agriculture, livestock, and
agro-processing activities are likely to be sustained throughout the life of the project, as
the project beneficiaries have strong financial incentives to operate their investments
profitably, the macroeconomic framework is expected to remain relatively stable, and
commodity price forecasts indicate no substantial changes in world supply and demand
conditions for project production. Therefore, XAITC will not be required to provide any
significant technical or financial assistance in the future except for routine supervision
of project activities. However, the sustainability of a few of the agro-processing plants,
such as Yili wool spinning, is less certain and will require closer monitoring by project
staff. In addition, the sustainability of the institutional development activities is
uncertain, in view of the limited achievements during the project implementation period.
16.          Future Operation. The future operation of the project will not require any
significant additional technical or financial assistance from XAITC, as most of the project
activities have been developed and are operating profitably.   XAITC's main
responsibilities will be: (a) continued supervision of agriculture, livestock, and agro-
processing activities; (b) provision of recurrent budgetary support as necessary to
complete the livestock development program in Zhaosu, which suffered a set-back due
to three successive years of extreme winter conditions; (c) ensure adequate provision of
incremental working capital as agro-processing plants reach full production; (d) close
monitoring of the financial profitability of agro-processing plants and development of



- vi -
restructuring plans as required; and (e) preparation of an operational plan and cost
recovery fee structure for the training center to ensure its efficient use in the future.
17.          Lessons Learned. The main lessons learned from the project include the
following.
(a)   In addition to written assurances obtained at negotiations from provincial
and local governments that working capital and counterpart funding would
be made available to the project units in timely fashion, the estimated
annual amount of counterpart funding necessary for the project (together
with the assumptions from which these figures are derived) should be
identified and discussed with the Borrower at appraisal in order to ensure
that proper attention will be paid to project financing arrangements.
(b)   The Borrower should solicit advice from technical experts during project
preparation about the design of agro-processing sub-projects and selection
of agro-processing equipment.  This will ensure greater technology
transfer and more efficient physical design.
(c)    Both the Borrower and the World Bank should pay greater attention
during project supervision to the construction and commissioning of waste
water treatment facilities for agro-processing sub-projects, in order to
ensure that the pollution control investments are implemented in line with
the approved designs.
(d)   The Borrower and the World Bank should agree to a detailed training plan
during project preparation, specifying the timing, quantity, focus, and
performance indicators for training activities. This will ensure that there
is agreement at the start of the project about the priorities and phasing of
training activities.
(e)    Greater effort is required in the marketing of project production,
particularly in the areas of information gathering, analysis of supply and
demand, and aggressive promotion of products.

XINJIANG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1764-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.        The main objective of the project was to support the Government's policy to speed
up the development of China's poorer provinces in the north and west. The project was intended
to expand the irrigated area for crop production, improve pastures, and promote livestock
development on twenty-three state farms in northern Xinjiang Autonomous Region, one of the
poorer and less developed areas in China. The project was particularly designed to assist ethnic
minority herdsmen in raising livestock and provide productive employment for women.
2.        The main features of the project were as follows:
(a)  Construction of irrigation works on 27,842 ha, of which 21,842 ha were
initially uncultivated;
(b)  Improvement of rainfed pasture on 25,450 ha through fertilizing, fencing and
seeding;
(c)  Provision of improved animal breeds and veterinary and livestock equipment,
and construction of animal sheds;
(d)  Construction of seven agro-processing plants and provision of equipment;
(e)  Provision of farm machinery and construction equipment;
(f)  Construction of housing, community facilities, and warehouses in newly
developed areas; and
(g)  Local and overseas training and study tours.
3.        The objectives were generally well designed, spelled out in the project
documentation, and supported by all the stakeholders. Similarly, they appropriately reflected
the government's implementation capacity and were consistent with both the Govemment's
development strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy at the time of preparation.

B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.        As reviewed below, the project substantially achieved the objective of agricultural
growth and diversification in Xinjiang, and partially achieved secondary goals related to training.
As a result of the strong performance of the agriculture, livestock, and agro-processing
components, the overall economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 27 percent, well
above the appraisal estimate of 18 percent.
5.        Physical Results. In terms of physical targets, the project has achieved and, in
many cases, exceeded the targets set out in the project documents. Total land clearing and
levelling amounted to 21,824 ha, in excess of the original target of 18,200 ha. Drainage canals
were developed on a total of 21,424 ha, close to the target of 21,800 ha. Eight agro-processing
plants were constructed, against an initial plan of seven factories. A total of 583 km of roads
and 744 km of transmission lines were constructed, well in excess of the targets of 193 km and
303 km, respectively. A small shortfall occurred with the grassland component, where 1,716
ha of irrigated land were developed against a target of 2,700 ha, and 5,067 ha of land were
seeded against a target of 10,000 ha. In addition, livestock development was slightly below
original estimates, with 115,592 m2 of sheds and pens constructed against a target of
181,800 m2. The quality of most of the completed works was good and complied with all
national standards for safety, health and environment.
6.        Agricultural Benefits. The irrigation component was successful in rehabilitating
and expanding irrigation schemes in Bole, Emin, Hami/Turpan and Zhaosu areas. The total cost
of the irrigation components was US$42.4 million or 32 percent of total project cost, compared
to the SAR estimate of US$37.4 million, representing an overrun of 13 percent. The project
included the construction of irrigation works on 17,362 ha of land for wheat, cotton and sugar
beet production in Bole; 3,517 ha for wheat and cotton; and 1,508 ha for grapes in
Hami/Turpan, all of which were initially uncultivated wasteland. The project also included
improved irrigation on 5,533 ha of wheat, cotton and rapeseed in Emin.
7.        In terms of agricultural output, yields and production levels for most crops were
well above the planning assumptions used at appraisal. However, as reviewed below, pasture
areas and yields were below appraisal targets due to the impact of the disastrous weather in the
winters of 1992-1994, and the topsoil disturbance on newly developed land. The total annual
output of wheat increased during the project period by about 22,106 tons in Bole (with a unit
yield of 3.8 t/ha, which was 7 percent higher than appraisal estimates), 5,661 tons in
Hami/Turpan (with a unit yield of 4.5 t/ha, which was 28 percent higher than appraisal
estimates), and 4,773 tons in Emin (with a unit yield of 3.8 t/ha, which was 7 percent higher
than appraisal estimates. Similarly, annual cotton production increased by about 10,875 tons in
Bole (with a unit yield of 1.1 t/ha, which was 13 percent higher than appraisal estimates), and
1,680 tons in Hami/Turpan (with a unit yield of 1.2 t/ha, which was 20 percent higher than
appraisal estimates). Annual grape production increased by 15,408 tons in project areas (with
a unit yield of 15.1 t/ha, which was 25 percent higher than appraisal estimates).
8.        Revised financial and economic rates of return (FRRs and ERRs) were calculated
for the consolidated agricultural activities in the four project areas, based on actual yield,



- 3 -
operating cost, and price data. All of the revised ERRs are higher than the appraisal estimates,
ranging from 21 percent for Zhaosu/Yining (against an appraisal estimate of 13 percent) to 31
percent for Bole (against an appraisal estimate of 23 percent).
9.        Animal Husbandry Benefits. The project constructed or improved pasture on
8,667 ha in Emin and 1,716 ha in Bole. In Zhaosu, the project concentrated on establishing or
improving 15,067 ha of pastures and developing livestock (about 104,000 head of breeding sheep
and cattle). The cost of the pasture improvement and livestock development components
amounted to US$2.1 million and US$4.6 million, respectively, or 1.6 and 3.5 percent of total
project costs, compared to the SAR estimates of US$2.2 and US$6.5 million, or 1.9 and 5.7
percent of total project costs.
10.       The yields and production levels for pasture were lower than appraisal estimates,
because pasture was planted on newly developed land where the topsoil was disturbed during
land preparation. This was compounded by the impact of the severe weather experienced in the
winters of 1992-1994. The incremental annual fodder production increased during the project
period by about 6,006 tons in Bole and 16,900 tons in Emin, with unit yields of 3.5 t/ha and 3.8
tJha, respectively, well below the appraisal estimate of 6.0 t/ha. Yields are expected to increase
further with stabilization of the soil. The introduction of new, improved breeds of animals under
the project has led to some productivity gains in the sector. ERRs were recalculated for each
category of livestock production activity, using production input costs and output prices provided
by the Project Management Office. The ERR for the livestock and grassland development
component in Zhaosu amounted to 21 percent, while the ERRs for the pasture development
components in Bole and Emin were negative because of the low pasture yields.
11.       Agro-processing Benefits. The project financed the development of eight agro-
processing plants (two wool processing plants in Emin and Yili, two tannery plants in Yili and
Emin, an oil processing plant and slaughterhouse in Bole, a seminola plant in Emin, and a raisin
processing plant in Hami), for a total cost of US$49.7 million, or 38 percent of total project
costs. This compares to an appraisal estimate of seven plants for a total cost of US$26.8
million, or 23 percent of total project costs. All agro-processing facilities were constructed in
line with the original approved designs, except for the slaughterhouse proposed for Zhaosu.
This sub-project was cancelled due to a limited supply of livestock resulting from the three
successive years of extreme winter conditions. Several plants have not yet complied with
environmental control regulations related to waste water management.
12.       Overall, the plants have performed well and have met their expected production
targets and rates of return. However, some of the factories experienced initial problems with
raw material availability, changing market conditions, and inadequate working capital. The high
rate of domestic inflation prevailing during the second-half of the project, particularly for local
building materials and equipment, increased local counterpart funding requirements and affected
the timely completion of some of the project investments. Most of the plants were characterized
by limited technology transfer and relatively poor physical design. A few of the plants have yet
to reach their designed output levels, while the Yili wool spinning plant has a problem of
product overstocking due to market fluctuations. The agro-processing component has resulted
in the incremental production of 7,500 tons of edible oil, 6,000 tons of processed meat, 500 tons



- 4 -
of raisins, 10,250 tons of seminola, 340,100 pieces of silk and wool sweaters, 75,090 pieces of
hide, and 100,000 pairs of leather shoes. The revised ERRs for the plants range from 16
percent for the Yili tannery to 25 percent for the Emin seminola plant.
13.       Project Impact. The crop and livestock activities supported under the project have
particularly benefited ethnic minorities and women. Living standards of minority people on
project farms are now higher than those outside the project areas. In Zhaosu, minority livestock
farmers are able to follow a more settled life instead of moving animals between winter and
summer grazing areas. The traditional system has now been replaced by grazing the animals
in summer and stall feeding in winter. This new pattern not only has contributed to more
efficient fattening of livestock but also has saved scarce labor time that minority households have
redeployed to other income generating activities. Women have also played an important role
in project implementation. As reviewed in Table 14, women accounted for 40 and 30 percent
of all crop, pasture, and livestock production in Bole and Zhaosu, respectively. Similarly,
women accounted for 51 percent of all crop production in Emin and 46 percent of all grape
production in Hami/Turpan. However, the participation of women in training programs was not
as strong. For example, they only accounted for about 15 percent of the participants in crop
training programs in Bole, Zhaosu, and Hami/Turpan.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
14.       Implementation Schedule. The project was scheduled for completion in December
1992, five years after signing. The major irrigation component, the largest single expenditure
category accounting for 32.4 percent of total base costs, was implemented more or less on
schedule. There were, however, delays in the construction of agro-processing facilities due to
design changes in response to changing market and economic conditions, problems with
availability of counterpart financing, and late delivery of equipment.  In addition, the
construction of the training center was delayed, as detailed design plans were only finalized in
mid-1994, and construction was completed in 1995. As a result of these delays, the closing date
of the credit was extended twice, for a total of two years.
15.       Training and T.A. The training program covered a wide range of topics. A total
of 9,508 project staff at the Xinjiang Agriculture, Industry and Trade Corporation (XAITC),
branch company, and state farm levels received training in technical, management, and financial
aspects of project implementation. Forty-eight persons proceeded overseas to receive specialized
technical training and about 400 project staff also participated in group meetings on project
related topics. Arrangements were made for local and overseas study tours for staff to learn
advanced technology and management systems for agroprocessing. However, the project
completed only part of the training originally planned, and only about 20 percent of the funds
allocated for training was utilized. This was largely due to the reluctance of the implementing
agency to use "hard" loan funds to finance "soft" capacity building activities.
16.       The Australian Government through the Australian International Development
Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) provided A$750,000 to the project to build capacity in the following
areas: sheep management, wool processing, meat processing, shearing, wool classification, and
wool handling. AIDAB-funded experts also assisted in finalizing the specifications and bid



documents for three processing facilities (which led to substantial redesign of the original
proposals) and in designing several key livestock activities, including pastures, fencing, and
sheep breeding and ram requirements. The training and assistance provided by AIDAB was well
received by the project staff and enhanced the livestock program.
17.       The project also benefited from technical specialists provided by the Danish Trust
Fund. Review of the facilities and equipment for embryo transfer was undertaken by an embryo
transfer specialist. An abattoir specialist reviewed the design of the Bole abattoir and a livestock
specialist evaluated livestock and feed production, disease control and management in the project
area. In addition, technical assistance and training were also provided in grain breeding and
seed production, as well as planning for a breeding station for grain and legumes. These
training activities were successful.
18.       Procurement. Preparation of bid documents, bid invitation, evaluation and award
were carried out by the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CNMIEC)
in cooperation with XAITC. The bulk of the equipment was purchased through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), which presented a few administrative problems. By the end of
1994, some 60 contracts procured through ICB were signed. The number of international
contracts signed on basis of other procurement methods (including for breeding stock, where
specific genetics were critical) amounted to US$5.9 million. The balance of the equipment
purchased was procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) and shopping because the size
of the contracts was too small to justify ICB. Overall ICB procedures resulted in satisfactory
supply of equipment.
19.       Disbursement. The pattern of disbursements was fairly close to appraisal estimates,
although the credit closing date was extended for two years to permit continued disbursement
for a few remaining activities. Total disbursements amounted to US$76.8 million, which was
higher than the original credit amount of US$70.0 equivalent, due to depreciation of the US
dollar against the SDR.
20.       Credit Allocation. The actual allocation of funds by expenditure category were by
and large, as anticipated, with a small reallocation of consultants' services and training funds
to accommodate an increase in civil works, and equipment and materials costs.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.       The benefits generated by the agriculture and livestock activities are likely to be
sustained throughout the life of the project, as the project beneficiaries have strong financial
incentives to operate their investments profitably, the macroeconomic framework is expected to
remain relatively stable, and commodity price forecasts indicate no substantial changes in world
supply and demand conditions for project production. Therefore, the project implementing
agencies will not be required to provide any significant technical or financial assistance in the
future except for routine supervision of project activities. However, the government will need
to continue to provide investment funds and recurrent budgetary support for livestock
development in Zhaosu, which suffered a set-back due to three successive years of extreme
winter conditions.



- 6 -
22.       The agro-processing component is also likely to be sustainable, though the status of
a few of the plants, such as Yili wool spinning, is uncertain. The plants will need to continually
improve product quality, closely monitor changing supply and demand conditions in the
marketplace, and be given sufficient autonomy in marketing, pricing, and personnel
management. In addition, they should ensure that all required waste water treatment systems
are fully operational by the end of the production testing period. All sub-projects will require
close supervision by project staff and restructuring plans would have to be developed for any
of the plants that fail to become profitable after two or three years following commissioning.
The firms should also be encouraged to implement enterprise reform measures in line with the
transition to a market economy, including the transformation of state-owned enterprises into
share holding companies or joint ventures with foreign companies.
23.       The sustainability of the training program is uncertain, in view of the limited
achievements during the project implementation period. An action plan should be prepared for
the operation of the training center to ensure its efficient use. In addition, an appropriate fee
structure should be developed for the center to ensure adequate cost recovery.
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
24.       IDA's performance in identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is
viewed as satisfactory to highly satisfactory. This work was directly based on the Government's
development strategy, the Bank's country assistance program, the implementation experience of
earlier projects (the FY85 Second Agricultural Research Project and the FY85 Seeds Project),
and detailed field work in Xinjiang. As a result, there was a fairly strong consensus between
IDA and the Government about the overall objectives and design of the operation as well as the
conditions necessary to ensure successful project implementation. During preparation and
appraisal, IDA made a number of useful suggestions regarding equipment specification, training
needs, technical assistance, and marketing that strengthened the technology transfer elements of
the project.
25.       IDA's performance in supervision was also satisfactory.  The nine missions
accurately reported implementation progress; identified the key operational problems and
provided useful interventions and recommendations; paid close attention to the overall
development impact of the project; and showed a high degree of flexibility in modifying project
arrangements in response to changing implementation conditions. Supervision missions made
particularly important contributions in the following areas: improving the technical design and
operating efficiency of many agro-processing sub-projects, educating project staff on the need
for more rigorous analysis of market conditions, emphasizing the importance of training and
technical assistance in dissemination of new technologies, requiring installation of suitable waste
water treatment systems in plants, and ensuring the adequate provision of counterpart funding
and working capital for project activities. Supervision staff were also instrumental in obtaining
and guiding use of bilateral technical assistance from the Governments of Australia and
Denmark, which markedly raised the level of technical expertise applied to project
implementation. The project would have benefitted from more frequent supervision visits, which
was not possible as a result of limited IDA resources available for supervision.



-7-
26.       In 1995, after completion of the project, the Bank undertook a review of its
operations in Xinjiang in response to allegations that the Tarim Basin Project involved the use
of forced labor. The Bank concluded that while the XAITC is responsible for administering
some prisons and adjacent farms on behalf of the central Ministry of Justice, XAITC is
implementing Bank projects without the use of forced labor.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.       The implementing agencies' performance in project preparation was satisfactory, as
they prepared a comprehensive feasibility study for the project that adequately covered technical,
financial, economic, and institutional factors. Their overall performance in implementation was
generally satisfactory. Project staff at all levels were committed to the project objectives;
implemented the components generally in line with the agreed implementation arrangements;
responded effectively to changes in the macroeconomic and sectoral policy environment; and
generally took appropriate action to redress problems as they occurred. Nonetheless, some
aspects of their performance were deficient and required intervention from IDA supervision
missions, as follows.
28.       The coordination of project activities by XAITC could have been better. This was
in part due to the frequent changes of key management staff at the XAITC and Branch Company
level. At times, the project was affected by coordination and cooperation problems among the
Planning Bureau, Financial Bureau, and XAITC. Lack of adequate supervision by XAITC led
to the use of some counterpart funds for activities outside the scope of the project, as noted in
an annual audit report by the Xinjiang Audit Bureau. The funds were subsequently fully
restituted by the concerned project unit. The project would have benefitted from more regular
visits by XAITC and Branch Company project staff. Some project units encountered problems
with the availability of counterpart funds and working capital, which affected timely completion
of civil works and commissioning of agro-processing plants. Audit reports were received on
time, and as noted above, were candid and useful.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
29.       The project's outcome is viewed as satisfactory, since the first and most important
objective of agricultural growth and diversification in Xinjiang was achieved with a relatively
high degree of sustainability. The overall ERR of 27 percent significantly exceeds the SAR
estimate of 18 percent and is particularly impressive in view of the difficult weather conditions
and the changes in the macroeconomic policy environment during implementation. Overall, the
project had a fairly strong developmental impact through the provision of scarce investment
funds for the expansion of agricultural production and value-added processing in a poor,
underdeveloped part of China. The project is not viewed as highly satisfactory because of the
limited achievements of the pasture development program and training activities and the delays
in project implementation.

H. FUTURE OPERATION
30.       The future operation of the project will not require any significant additional
technical or financial assistance from XAITC, as most of the project activities have been
developed and are operating profitably. As reviewed above, XAITC's main responsibilities will
be: (a) continued supervision of agriculture, livestock, and agro-processing activities; (b)
provision of recurrent budgetary support as necessary to complete the livestock development
program in Zhaosu, which suffered a set-back due to three successive years of extreme winter
conditions; (c) ensure adequate provision of incremental working capital as agro-processing
plants reach full production; (d) close monitoring of the financial profitability of agro-processing
plants and development of restructuring plans as required; and (e) preparation of an operational
plan and cost recovery fee structure for the training center to ensure its efficient use in the
future. In addition, the managers of the agro-processing plants will need to continually improve
product quality, closely monitor changing supply and demand conditions in the marketplace, and
be given sufficient autonomy in marketing, pricing, and personnel management. In addition,
they should be encouraged to implement enterprise reform measures in line with the transition
to a market economy.
31.       IDA will continue to monitor the operation of project activities in conjunction with
the supervision of the Tarim Basin Project.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
32.       The key lessons learned from the project are summarized below.
(a)  In addition to written assurances obtained at negotiations from provincial and local
governments that working capital and counterpart funding would be made available
to the project units in timely fashion, the estimated annual amount of counterpart
funding necessary for the project (together with the assumptions from which these
figures are derived) should be identified and discussed with the Borrower at
appraisal in order to ensure that proper attention will be paid to project financing
arrangements.
(b)  The Borrower should solicit advice from technical experts during project preparation
about the design of agro-processing sub-projects and selection of agro-processing
equipment. This will ensure greater technology transfer and more efficient physical
plant design.
(c)  Both the Borrower and the World Bank should pay greater attention during project
supervision to the construction and commissioning of waste water treatment facilities
for agro-processing sub-projects, in order to ensure that the pollution control
investments are implemented in line with the approved designs.
(d)  The Borrower and the World Bank should agree to a detailed training plan during
project preparation, specifying the timing, quantity, focus, and performance



- 9 -
indicators for training activities. This will ensure that there is agreement at the start
of the project about the priorities and phasing of training activities.
(e)   Greater effort is required in the marketing of project production, particularly in the
areas of information gathering, analysis of supply and demand, and aggressive
promotion of products.
(f)   Budgetary resources for supervision should be increased to ensure effective periodic
monitoring of project activities.
(g)   A strong and effective director of the project management office and continuity of
project staff at all levels are essential for successful management of the project.

SHANDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SADP)
AND
XINJLANG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (XADP)
AIDE MEMOIRE
April 13, 1995
1.          A Bank Mission comprising of Messrs. El-Hanbali, Ting, and Ms. Li visited
Shandong Province from April 11 to 13, 1995, to review the preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the above captioned projects. The mission was
unable to undertake a full ICR mission for the two projects and instead took the opportunity
during the supervision of the Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project to meet with staff
from Shandong and Xinjiang in Jinan, Shandong, for three days to review the preparation
completed by the two provinces. Initially, the mission briefed the project staff from SADP
and XADP on the new requirements for the ICR. The mission was briefed by project staff
from the Shandong Project Management Office (PPMO), and Xinjiang Foreign Investment
Office (XFIMO), on the preparations they have already made for the ICR. The mission was
impressed with the efforts made in preparing the ICRs and the completion of the tables
forwarded to the two provinces prior to the arrival of the mission. The mission would like
to thank the Shandong PPMO, for the excellent arrangements, courtesy, and hospitality
extended to the mission during their stay in Jinan.
2.          Representatives from the three provinces of the Irrigated Agricultural
Intensification Project (IAIP) also participated in the above meetings to familiarize
themselves with the requirements for the preparation of their respective ICRs. A subsequent
separate follow-up session was organized to deal specifically with the requirements for the
preparation of the ICR for the IAIP.
3.          The main points and actions which were discussed and agreements reached
during the three days deliberations are summarized below:
a.   the mission stressed the importance of preparing a good completion
report to highlight the excellent achievements and experiences gained
under the project; the Bank ICR guideline should be used only as a
reference in the preparation of the ICRs, the ICR should be succinct
and where appropriate supported by annexes/tables and an evaluation
summary. The mission stressed the importance of highlighting the
positive as well as negative aspects of the project;
b.   the report should comment on the technical assistance provided to

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO ICR
PREFACE
On December 2, 1983, Xinjiang Agriculture Industry and Trade Corporation (It is
abbreviated to XAITC following) proposed the State Government to employ World Bank loans
to implement "Agricultural Comprehensive Development Project." In October, 1984 and June,
1985 the State Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Agriculture sent two
groups to make on-the spot investigation, to the project. In September 1985, the experts of
World Bank appraised the project. In April 1986, the World Bank designated to make
preliminary estimates of the project in Beijing. In June the World Bank Evaluation Group went
the project site to make a detailed evaluation. In July 1986 the XAITC submitted the Ministry of
Agriculture the first draft of "The Feasible Proposal of Xinjiang Comprehensive Development
Project" which was examined and approved by the State ministries and Commissions concerned,
and some suggestions were put forward. According to the suggestions, the XAITC revised and
completed the proposal and submitted it to the Ministry in October.  The State Planning
Commission officially ratified it on the document named Planning Arg. 1987 No. 613. The
Chinese Government Delegation and World Bank officials held negotiations about the "Project
Evaluation Report" and "The Loan Agreement" and reached up to identical views, the project
was named "Xinjiang Agricultural Development Project", the amount of World Bank loan was
57,300,000 SDR. The Project Evaluation Report and the Loan Agreement were submitted to the
Board of Directors of World Bank. In September 1987 two parties formally signed on the
Agreement and from January, 1988, the project began to put into effect.
The account vith World Bank of the project is closed at December 31, 1994. The
deadline of payment is April 30, 1995.
This project is the first large scale farms and animal husbandry comprehensive developing
project employed World Bank Loan. This project has introduced 1980s advanced technology and
equipment and been training a large number of staffs of management and technology so as to
efficiently speed up the farm and animal husbandry development and promote the modernization
of XAITC.
1.    Project Evaluation
1.1   Project Objective
Xinjiang Agriculture Development Project has developed the agricultural production over
20 State Farms in XAITC for expanding the crop irrigation area, adding farming machinery,



- 32 -                       Appendix B
improving the grass land and introducing the fine stud stocks and the processing equipment. The
objectives of the project would be to cause a great advance in the agriculture and the livestock,
and increase the added value so to promote the economics development of XAITC.
1.2   Project Description
The project includes the five sectors: 1) crops; 2) livestock; 3) by product processing; 4)
transportation; 5) education. The contents describe as following:
1.2.1 To build 27842 ha. of crop irrigation system network for production of grain, cotton and
forage grass.
1.2.2 Improving 25450 ha. of natural grassland by fertilizer applying, fencing and planting the
fine variety herbage.
1.2.3  Introducing fine stud stocks.
1.2.4  To install processing plants, produce oil fat, fleece, meat, raisins and Durum wheat flour.
1.2.5  Improving two leather factories technically.
1.2.6  Purchasing the farm machinery and construction equipment.
1.2.7  Setting up the living houses, public facilities and storage house in this project area.
1.2.8  To organize a fleet or transporting the products from the project area.
1.2.9  Setting up the Shihezi Training Center.
1.2.10 Training at home and abroad and technical assistance.
1.3   Project achievement
The project has almost reached its objective. Besides the items of the Emin Durum wheat
flour processing, Shihezi training center and fleet, most of the items of the project have been
finished. At the end of 1994, the XAITC has checked and agreed to the 12 project units, in which
95 percent of the project regarded as good quantity. The two leather factories, which are under
installation and test, will be finished at June 1995. Emin factory is preparing the work for the
acceptance and will finish at the end of 1995. From 1991 to 1993, Zhaosu livestock project was
hit by the continuous three years of natural disaster, however, the project unit has made the
schedule to finish it when possible. (See the table about project achievement)
1.4   The deadline of project construction
The project was carrying out a five-year period and begins at January 1988. Due to the
change of the domestic market, the project has been adjusted by adding the new items of Emin
Durum wheat flour, Yili leather factory and Hami Cotton production. So we applied to the



- 33 -                     Appendix B
World Bank to expand more one year time to the project achievement. We also decided to set up
Shihezi Training Center by fully using the remaining loan for purchasing the equipment and
materials. For to does the contracts better, the suggestion has been made to World Bank again
for another one more year, so the project actually took seven years of the achievement.
I.5   Disbursements
Up to April 30, 1995 the World Bank loan was disbursed 56,996,100 SDR, accounting for
99.47 percent of project budget.
1.6   Organization structure
The project was set up by the XAITC that has three subsidiary organizational levels:
XAITC, Branch and State Farm. Under the XAITC we have the project management office,
which is in charge of planning and administration, organizational coordination, inspection,
monitoring and equipment procurement for the project. The project finance and accounting
administration are responsible by the financial bureau under the XAITC. The transportation of
machinery, equipment and material of the project are borne by the Material Bureau under the
XAITC. Some equipment were procured under the procedures of international competitive bid
by CMIOC. Some are on the basis of three price quotation or local procedure satisfactory to the
World Bank. The XAITC had handed over the audit report and financial statement to the World
Bank according to the Bank's regulation annually.
1.7   Training and technical assistance
According to the requirement, the project has trained 9508 persons in special technology
and economic management, organized 12 special meetings, sent 15 study tour groups to abroad,
and 41 persons trained in foreign countries, meanwhile 12 train group 48 persons had sent to
abroad, 197 experts were invited from abroad and inner country taken the consultation lecture
and demonstration for the project.
The XAITC have got 700,000 AD of grant from Australia Government through the
assistance of the World Bank for livestock management, study tour to abroad, technical training
and consulting. The assistance project was carried out by the Hassall & Associates company of
Australia. They sent five experts to Xinjiang for technical consulting and training in the area of
Bole, Emin and Yili. Organized three groups to inspect and study in Australia in the field of
livestock management, family farm, fleece grading and sheep raising. It has emerged a good
result and given the great help to Xinjiang livestock's development.
1.8   Procurement and Technical Service
The project has done eight times of ICB, and also domestic limited bidding and direct
purchasing, 115 contracts have been signed with total amount of 50 million USD, in which 66
domestic contracts covers 16 million USD, making up 30 percent of the total, and 49 contracts
with foreign country covers 36 million USD, accounting for 70 percent of the total. The 78



- 34 -                      Appendix B
contracts were made through the ICD with 48 million USD, making up 89 percent of the total
amount.
The project has purchased 254 sets of tractors, 1 703 sets of farm equipment, 103 sets of
construction equipment, 260 vehicles, 799 heads of stud stocks, 29040 tons of steel products, and
also 21 million USD was spent for processing equipment, test instruments and office facilities
within seven years.
As compared with the purchasing plan of the proposal, the project has exceeded the
amount of equipment. The processing equipment (21.13 million USD) has been fulfilled by 130.8
percent, the machineries and vehicles (18.73 million USD) by 122.3 percent, construction
materials (12.14 million USD) by 114.5 percent.
Basically all the goods have been transported and distributed on time and less damaged.
According to the contracts, 197 experts and technicians have been invited to Xinjiang for the
equipment installing, testing and consulting so as to guarantee the machineries with normal
operation.
2.    Project effect evaluation
2.1   Project effect evaluation
The project, developed unused land and enlarged crop irrigation area, has appeared a
better circulation on agricultural production, especially for the crop rotation and nature utilization.
Having improved the grass land and imported the fine standard livestocks has promoted the great
development in livestock. It has thoroughly changes the way of nomadic life into the settle down,
raising the lamb in winter instead of in spring, has much reduced lamb mortality. With the
grassland improvement and the forage harvest mechanization, the output of the forage grass has
increased greatly, so that it helps increase the breeding rate and high yield of fleece. The item of
grape production has become the key industry to the XAITC. Adopting the advanced irrigation
technology, it has benefited the agriculture a great deal by lowering the alkaline level and saving
the water.
2.2   The evaluation to the social and economical benefit:
The project has provided 16896 persons with jobs, including 5121 minority nationalities, it
is the 30.3 percent of the total and 6794 women, it is the 40.2 percent of the total.
After the project implementation, the great changes have been taken into place in the
project area.
In Zhaosu, the housing condition and living standard of the herdsmen have been improved.
Most of the families have been provided with lighting and drinking water. Their income has
increased by 880 RMB per year in 1988 to 1860 RMB per year in 1993. In Bole, the cultivated
area has been expanded by 1.5-3 times than before, it makes possible for crop rotations and crop
structure adjustment. The cotton planting area was enlarged from 8700 ha of 1987 to 17000 ha



- 35 -                      Appendix B
of 1994, which obtained 14 billion RMB of economical benefit. The income of the workers was
raised from 2010 RMB in 1987 to 3300 RMB in 1994. The project in Hami was a great success.
It gives work opportunities to minority nationality women and makes their social status higher
than before as well as the output of grape has surpassed the original target. It gained 6 million
RMB in 1994.
The irrigation item in Emin achieved remarkable results. It can save water by 50 percent,
the unit yield of crop was increased 50-80 percent. In short, the project has made an obvious
achievement in expanding production and increasing farmer's income. At the final year, the
project has made 36,929 ton of grains, 14,479 ton of cotton, 3,490 ton of rapeseed, 42,361 ton of
forage grass, 182,298 tons of grape, 7,500 ton of refined oil, 340,000 piece of sweaters, 10,250
ton of Durum wheat flour, 6,650 ton of meat product, 100,000 pair of leather shoes. The IRR in
the original project proposal is 18 percent, but now is restimated at 23.92 percent.
3.    Project sustainability
The XAITC has made the plan to continue the development of the project, although the
project has been most successful. First of all, the XAITC will be go on to help Zhaosu to
accomplish the livestock item according to the proposal. For the by product processing items, it
is mainly to improve the sewage disposal system And look for the trade partners from foreign
countries to cooperate for production And selling. Now that the XAITC is under the reforming
of the enterprise, will reform some good project enterprises into the stock system, so the project
will have uninterrupted growth in the future.
4.    Achievement from the World Bank
The World Bank has done a great deal of work during the project identification,
preparation, appraisal and supervision and it made valuable suggestions to the project on
equipment procurement, personnel training, technical assistance and marketing. The fact has
proved the evaluation to the project made by the World bank is scientific and realistic. During the
project implementation, the World Bank has sent the mission to Xinjiang every year for the
project inspection and monitoring. The officers of the World Bank mission worked hard and, they
concentrated their attention to the report made by the project units and made useful suggestion to
the project by going down to the farm fields, pastoral area and construction site each time. It has
played a positive role to the project. Since the World Bank stressed time again that the project
should devote the much attention to the training for women and minority nationalities, so the
leaders at the levels put a great efforts in this aspect and made it successful.
5.    Experience
With the eight years of project management, it is important to strengthen leaders at all
levels organizationally, to improve the managing regulation that are the guarantee of successful
project.



- 36 -                     Appendix B
In order to implement the project smoothly, it is absolutely necessary to promote the
managing level by paying attention to the personnel training. As the World Bank suggested
several times, the project has only finished the part of the training programme. So it should be to
set up the Shihezi Training Center at the very beginning of the project.
Being lack of the recognition of the restriction by the project condition each other, some
items of the project have not realized its estimated beneficial result, for instance, the livestock
item that needed longer time to develop and caused meat process factory to be short of raw
materials seriously.
6.    Problem and suggestion
Even though the project has brought up a number of administrative personnel who have
done their bit for the project, it is still need to pay much attention to the training programme, so
as to serve the project more in future.
Some items of the project have not completed and some have not reached the goal of the
evaluation, so the project administrative setup should not be canceled, and should be further
strengthened to manage the project continually.
The price inflation affected the progress and normal operation of the project due to the
shortage of the domestic counterpart funds and working capital. So, the XAITC has been asked
to put some funds to the project otherwise, it will suffer from the loss.
The total loan of the project is 56,966,100 SDR (US$ 76,000,000 equivalent), (RMB
645,120,000 equivalent). Compare the plan of the project 57,300,000 SDR (US$ 70,000,000
equivalent), (RMB 249,000,000 equivalent), for the change of the exchange rate between SDR
and USD. USD and RMB caused 396,120,000 RMB of loss for the project and it has become
heavier to the loan return and reduced the beneficial result of the project, so we hope that the
World Bank can make the suggestion to the Ministry of Finance to compensate the project for the
exchange rate loss.
