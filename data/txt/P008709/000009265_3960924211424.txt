PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - MOSTISTEA-CALMATUI (LOAN 1670-RO): COVTRLUI (LOAN
1795-RO): BBSP (LOAN 1938 RO): CARACAL-TITU (LOAN 1971-RO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of four irrigation
projects, for which loans were made to Romania from July, 1979 to June 1981,
for a total amount of US$ 315.0 million. The loans were closed as scheduled
respectively; Loan 1670-RO, on June 30, 1986; Loan 1795-RO, on December 31,
1987; Loan 1938-RO, on June 30, 1988; and Loan 1971-RO, on June 30, 1986. The
loans were almost fully disbursed; the only exception was the BBSP Irrigation
loan for which a residual of US$ 1.0 m. was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office. Romania stopped borrowing from the Bank in 1982. Between
May 1988 and November 1989, it paid back in advance all outstanding loan
amounits, including those relating to the present projects. The last
supervision of the projects included in this PCR was in November 1986.
Official contacts with agricultural staff and technicians were suspended in
February 1987 and they have not yet been resumed. This is a desk work
exercise based in part on a review of the staff appraisal reports; the loan
agreements; the economic memorandum (No. 5832-RO) dated May 6, 1986, internal
Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files, minutes
of the Board discussions, Bank supervision reports, quarterly progress reports
prepared by the borrower as well as interviews with staff in the Bank who have
been associated with these projects. The PCR is also based on a review of the
PCR Report No. 6558, dated January 22, 1987, for the Viisoara Irrigation
Project, (Loan 1509-RO). With regard to project implementation the PCR is
mainly based on information contained in supervision reports up to November
1986, the time of the last Bank supervision report.
The four projects were the following: (i) Mostistea-Calmatui,
Irrigation and Drainage Project for which loan 1670-RO, in the amount
of US$ 70.0 million was approved on March 13, 1979; (ii) the Covurlui
Irrigation Project for which loan 1795-RO was approved on January 22, 1980, in
the amount of US$ 90.0 million; (iii) the BBSP Irrigation Project for which
loan 1930-RO, was approved on December 23, 1980, in the amount of US$ 75.0
million; and (iv)  the Caracal-Titu Irrigation Project for which loan 1971-RO
was approved on April 21, 1981, in the amount of US$ 80.0 million.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - MOSTISTEA-CALMATUI (LOAN 1670-RO): COVURLUI (LOAN
1795-RO): BBSP (LOAN 1938 RO): CARACAL-TITU (LOAN 1971-RO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The four projects which are the subject of this completion report
were the tenth, twelfth, fifteen and sixteenth in the agriculture sector in
Romania, and the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth in a series of eight loans
made between 1974 and 1981, to develop irrigation and drainage infrastructure.
The eight loans totalling US$ 545 million were made during this period to help
develop irrigation over approximately 1.1 million hectares.
Objectives
The main objectives of the projects were to increase and stabilize
agricultural production over a project area of about 650,000 hectares. This
was expected in turn to have helped increase national income, food supply for
internal consumption and export of primary or agroprocessed production. It
was also expected to increase foreign exchange earnings through export or
through the production of import substitutes such as sugar and pr-tein
feeds/oil crops. These objectives were considered in line with both country
and Bank development strategies.
Implementation Experience
In all four projects, construction started soon after
effectiveness but slowed down almost immediately due partly to technical and
administrative, but mostly to budgetary difficulties. Budget allocations under
the projects were not sufficient to meet financial needs, as the Government
was giving priority to a variety of construction activities outside
agriculture. By the time of the last supervision (12/86), despite the fact
that the loan funds had been completely drawn down, only 28% of the irrigation
works had been completed, and only 24% of the drainage works. However, on the
basis of the experience of the former irrigation projects in Romania it was
expected that the four projects would be satisfactorily completed, though with
considerable delay. Consequently, full development benefits were not expected
until the late eighties and the early nineties.
The aggregate final cost of the projects (Annex 1) has been
estimated to be US$ 1,484 million or about 98% of the SAR's estimates of USS
1,512 million. Except for US$ 1 million under the BBSP Irrigation Project all
Bank loan amounts were disbursed.

Results
Substantial delays were experienced in project implementation. By
December 1986, the time of the last supervision mission, only about 25% of the
irrigation and drainage works had been completed. We do not have final and
factual information as to the advancement of works and to the technical,
financial and economic impact of these projects. However, based on experience
with previous irrigation projects in Romania, and discussions with staff
responsible for appraisal and supervision of the projects, it is expected that
the projects' main irrigation, drainage and flood control components would be
satisfactorily completed and that the projects' objectives would be
accomplished. Further, considering the high yield increases experienced under
former similar irrigation projects, in the same general project areas it is
possible that the projects would achieve satisfactory FRRs and ERRs. However,
this is obviously only an assumption. Considering the delay experienced in
project implementation, that lower priority was assigned to drainage and on-
farm development, and that the provision for inputs was not consistent, actual
calculations may differ substantially. Only after a visit to Romania and the
collection of actual data, will it be possible to assess real economic and
financial benefits, if any, achieved by the projects.
Sustainabilitv
Under the preceding projects inl the subsector assisted by the
World Bank, Romania has been able to demonstrate suitable capability for
operating and maintaining similar project infrastructure. The organizational
changes introduced in the recent past have enabled the Ministry for
Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI) to operate and maintain these projects
more efficiently and with better response to local conditions than it had been
capable in the past. However regarding sustainability of the agricultural
benefits at or above the anticipated levels,file information indicates that
for several crops, comparison with yields achieved in other European countries
with similar agricultural characteristics is disappointing. Substantial
improvement is still possible in this regard.
Findings and lessons learned
The projects benefitted from lessons learned in the design and
preparation of previous irrigation projects. They were based on least cost
alternatives and improved designs made possible by experience learned from
former projects.
Large imbalances between loan disbursements and physical
implementation persisted during the implementation of these projects. On the
average, the loans were fully disbursed when only about 25% of project work
was completed, indicating little relationship between disbursements and
physical progress of project activities. In the future, a stronger link
should be sought between planned loan disbursements and execution of works.
The Bank should insist that precise timetables be submitted by the Government
at appraisal, indicating a strict relationship between procurement operations
and progress in the physical implementation of the project.



- viii -
Despite substantial improvement in the bidding documents used for
ICB to increase competition and foreign participation, only about 10% of
contracts awarded after ICB were assigned to foreign firms. In the future,
more opportunities for equipment of more advanced technology, increased cost
effectiveness and energy efficiency should be encouraged. To avoid almost
exclusive award of contracts under ICB to the domestic industry, as in the
present projects and to avoid suspicion of under-bidding by domestic bidders
or other irregularities, as expressed by foreign bidders on some occasions,
the Bank should: (i) require the preparation of technical specifications
implying the use of technologically advanced equipment, requiring direct
foreign exchange financing; and (ii) prefer financing of projects where a high
level of direct foreign exchange financing would be required.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture represents an important
share of the economy of Romania, contributing in 1987 about 27% of GDP and
with three million people employed in the sector, to about 28% of total
employment. Agriculture's share in total export earning was about 12%. More
than 50% of agricultural exports were in convertible currency. Since 1977,
Romania maintained an agricultural trade surplus till 1987, upto which year
information is available. About 63% of 15 million hectares of Romania's land
is under agriculture, of which 10 million are arable. Sectoral growth depends
heavily on intensified irrigation and drainage in the fertile Danube basin,
and increased agricultural activity.
1.02        The agricultural sector is organized in primarily two field
categories: (a) cooperatives for agricultural production (CAP) and (b) state
owned agricultural farms (IAS). The former produced about one third of
agricultural production and the latter one fourth. A small part - 13% of the
arable land is cultivated in small individual plots, primarily for vegetable,
fruits and livestock production. The rest is cultivated by farmers for
subsistence.
1.03        The projects were part of a program for agricultural development,
especially irrigation works, over an aggregate area of 602,000 ha and drainage
over an aggregate area of about 441,000 ha. It also included soil erosion
control on irrigated and non-irrigated lands. The areas affected by the
projects were mainly in the Mostistea area and valley, where in addition to
irrigation and drainage works four dual purpose, hydropower and irrigation
reservoirs were built. Areas affected were also in the Covurlui plateau, and
in the plains and in the foothill zones of Romania, where most of the arable
land is located, but average rainfall is limited to about 450 mm. per annum.
The potential irrigable land in Romania is about 5.5 million ha. out of which
works totalling 3.1 million ha were completed by the end of 1986. The present
projects were estimated to bring the total to 3.5 million ha. by completion.
The projects were expected to provide a stable base for production and
indirectly to have an impact on social and commercial activity.
1.04        Bank involvement in irrigation.  Bank assisted irrigation projects
accounit for about 35% of Romania's total investment allocations for
agricultural development.   The projects were partially financed by the fifth,
sixth,, seventh and eighth loans for irrigation made by the Bank in the
agricultural sector. The four loans together amounted to US$ 315.0 million.
They brought agricultural lending to about US$ 686.0 million, or half the
Bank's total commitments to Romania. Between 1974 and 1981 the Bank made a
series of eight loans for the development of irrigated agriculture totalling
US$545.0 million. The Bank's involvement contributed significantly to the
advancement of Romania's irrigated areas and irrigation technology. The



-2-
projects introduced important technical concepts or implemented innovative
concepts, introduced under previous projects, relating to the need for
alternative designs, criteria for selection of least cost alternatives,
improved designs of canals, drainage, maintenance, land reclamation and
desalinization.
II. PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01        Proiect Identification and Preparation.   The four projects were
identified and prepared by MAFI between 1978 and 1980, within the framework of
studies undertaken for the development of the national irrigation subsector.
The MAFI's Institute for Studies and Designs of Land Reclamation did most of
the preparatory engineering work. Because of the high professional level and
experience of Romanian specialists the need for Bank assistance during
preparation was minimal.
2.02        Appraisal. Negotiations and Effectiveness.   Appraisals of the
four projects, based on the preparation reports, were carried out in the
following order: the Mostistea-Calmatui project in June 1978, the Covurlui
Irrigation Project in June 1979, the BBSP project in April 1980 and the
Caracal-Titu project in October 1980. Negotiations of the four projects were
carried out between 1978 and 1980 without any major issues being raised. The
most controversial point related to the limited amount (10-15%) of foreign
equipment that would be procured through ICB. However, recognizing the
considerable amount of indirect foreign exchange used in manufacturing
Romanian equipment, the Bank accepted the possibility that the largest part of
contracts, as in previous projects, would be awarded to Romanian
manufacturers. The projects were brought to the Board in the following
sequence: (i) Mostistea-Calmatui (US$ 70.0 m) in March 1979; (ii) Covurlui
(US$ 90.0 m) in January 1980; (iii) BBSP (US$ 75.0 m) on December 1980; and
(iv) Caracal-Titu (US$ 80.0 m) on April 1981. They became effective soon
after Board presentation.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The Directorate General for Land Reclamation of the Ministry of
Agriculture (DGEIFCA) was responsible for the implementation of the four
projects. It did it mainly through its operation and maintenance enterprises
(IEELIF). Following are the highlights of project implementation for each of
the four projects:
3.01        The Mostistea-Calmatui Irrigation and Drainage Project.   The
project consists of two irrigation and drainage schemes; Mostistea (158,540
ha. irrigation, 82,680 ha. drainage) and Calmatui (24,840 ha. irrigation and
66,930 ha. drainage). Construction under the Mostistea-Calmatui project
started soon after effectiveness, in 1979, but slowed down substantially in
1981. Delays occurred because of a combination of factors: technical
difficulties, budgetary constraints, and shortages of fuel and other
materials. During implementation, construction equipment procured under the
project was removed to be used under the rice crash program. Further, it is
not clear whether the full capacity of available equipment was indeed utilized
to implement the project. Budgetary allocations were also prioritized towards



- 3 -
other projects and programs in different sectors. By December 1986, when the
last supervision mission visited Romania, only about 60,000 ha. or 40% of the
irrigation program of the Mostistea component was completed, but no drainage
work had been undertaken. Under the Calmatui component the progress was some
what better as 20,000 ha. or about 80% of the irrigation program had been
completed, and about 34,000 ha. or about 50% of drainage. Originally the
project was expected to be completed by 12/84 (Mostistea) and by 12/85,
respectively. (Calmatui). However, as a result of the above mentioned
difficulties experienced, by December 1986 it was estimated that full
implementation would require eight to nine years, instead of the five to six
estimated at appraisal, with a 46% delay on the estimated completion date.
Consequently, full development benefits were expected to start in 1989 instead
of 1986 as estimated at appraisal.
3.02        The estimated final cost of the project, based on the 11/86
information, is US$ 439.2 million, which represents an overrun in US$ terms of
about 7.3% over the appraisal estimate. In Lei terms the actual cost is about
14% less than the appraisal estimate, due partially to the official
revaluation of the Lei vis a vis the US$ during the implementation period.
3.03        The Covurlui Irrigation Proiect  The project includes a system of
irrigation of 144,660 ha. by pumping water from the Danube, surface drainage
of 8,660 ha., subsurface drainage of 919 ha., valley draining along 267 km.
and soil erosion control on 55,981 ha. Construction under the Covurlui
irrigation project started also soon after effectiveness (04/80), but its
progress was soon hampered by the same problems, as those mentioned in the
case of the former project. By December 1986 only about 25,000 ha. or 28% of
the project irrigation program had been completed and about 700 ha. or 7% of
the drainage works. The most significant negative impact of these problems
was the serious delay in the construction of the Suhurlui dam and reservoir
which directly affects the irrigation of about 60,000 ha. The delay was in
part caused by technical problems related to the original design of the earth
dam. A series of technical defects were detected and in addition there was an
institutional dispute on land acquisition needed for borrow pits for the
construction of the body of the dam. Several construction experts expressed
reservations regarding stability of the earth fill during construction. It is
not clear today whether the construction was eventually completed. DGEIFCA
was considering substantial changes in the work program to expedite
construction and had promised to send to the Bank in early 1987 a detailed new
action plan including a time schedule. The project was estimated at appraisal
to be completed by December 1987. At the time of the last supervision (12/86)
the estimated deadline had been shifted to 12/1991, four years later than the
SAR estimate.
3.04        The estimated final cost of the project is US$ 406.9 million with cost
overruns of about 14.5% over the foreign exchange SAR estimate. In lei terms
the actual cost is estimated to be about 2.5% less than SAR's estimates.
3.05        The Bucsani. Buzau. Siret. Prut (BBSP) Irrigation Proiect  The
project consists of four irrigation and drainage schemes; Bucsani (irrigation
36,800 ha., drainage 43,060 ha.); Buzau (irrigation 59,780 ha., drainage



40,630ha.); Siret (irrigation 15,687 ha., drainage 17,175 ha.); Prut
(irrigation 31,082 ha., drainage 23,386 ha.). Various subsurface drainage,
soil erosion control and other ancillary works are also included. Under this
project construction works experienced the isame delays caused by the technical
and budgetary problems mentioned above. By the time of the last supervision
report (12/86) only the Bucsani component was substantially completed. The
Buzau component estimated at appraisal to be completed by 12/87 had achieved
4% of the irrigation program and the drainage works had not yet started. At
that time the project was expected to be completed by 1989/90. Under the
Siret component priority had been given to drainage works, 70% of which had
been executed by December 1986.  However only 5,800 ha. or 37% of the
irrigation works had been completed.  Under the Prut component only about
10,900 ha. or 32% of the irrigation works and about 50% of the drainage works
had been completed.  This component, estimated at appraisal to be completed by
December 1987, was now expected to be completed by December 1988, with a 16%
delay on the original time estimate. Finally, the surface drainage and soil
erosion components were only 53% completed.
3.06         The estimated final cost of the project is US$ 319.4 million
equivalent, or 15% less than SAR estimates both in US$ and in leis.
3.07         The Caracal-Titu Irrigation Proiect.  The project consists of two
irrigation and drainage subproject; Caracal (irrigation 88,000 ha., drainage
38,500 ha.) and Titu (irrigation 42,912 ha., drainage 36,640 ha.).
Construction under the Caracal-Titu Irrigation Project also experienced
extreme delays in project implementation. By December 1986, the project was
three years behind schedule or experiencing about 80% delays in project
implementation. By that date, under the Caracal subproject, only 6,500 ha. or
7% of the irrigation program had been completed and none of the drainage
program; while under the Titu component about 4,800 ha of the irrigation
program and 4,300 ha. of the drainage program or about 11% of total had been
executed.
3.08         The estimated final cost of the project was US$ 318.2 million
equivalent or about 16% less than SAR estimates.
3.09         Disbursements.   For all the four projects, by the time of the
last supervision (11/86) a total of about 28% of the irrigation works had been
executed and about 24% of the drainage works. Loan funds had been completely
drawn down far ahead of schedule as follows: Mostistea-Calmatui, last
disbursement was in February 1984, two years and four months before the
closing date and about four years before the last estimated completion date.
In the case of the Covurlui irrigation project the last disbursement was in
December 1984, three years before the closing date and about seven years
before the completion date estimated during the last supervision (12/91).
BBSP was fully disbursed one year before the closing date and one and a half
year before the completion date. Finally, the Caracal-Titu Project was fully
disbursed by March 1986, one month before the closing date, and about 2 years
before the estimated completion date (12/88). In the future, disbursements
should be made proportional to civil works constructions, hence the Bank may;



-5
(i) consider the practicability of ICB contracts for civil works, (ii) tranche
disbursements depending on progress in civil works implementation.
3.10        Procurement.  No major issues about procurement was raised,
although as in the past, only a relatively small part of ICB contracts was
awarded to foreign firms. Foreign suppliers were awarded contracts for about
US$ 30.0 million out of a total of US$ 315 million. The Romanian project
specialists justified this situation by arguing that a substantial amount of
indirect foreign exchange was involved in the procurement of domestic
equipment. There is evidence in the files that the Bank was never happy about
the status of the procurement operations, though no specific action was ever
considered in this regard.
3.11        BAFI's accounts were audited regularly by its internal auditing
department and by inspectors of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with
Romanian law which was found to satisfy Bank's auditing requirements. BAFI
has also regularly furnished quarterly progress reports up to December 1986 in
accordance with the formats agreed at negotiations and periodically improved
in agreement between the Bank and the Borrower.
IV. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
4.01        The areas of the projects are in the region of the Danube basin in
the south of the country were other Bank financed irrigation projects have
been undertaken. The two most representative of these projects are The
Giurgiu-Razimiresti (Loan 1082-RO) and the Viisoara (Loan 1509-RO) Irrigation
Projects. It was expected that the four irrigation projects, object of the
present PCR, would achieve the same results of the two above mentioned
projects described in their PCRs of December 1986, provided that the supply of
fertilizers and other inputs and improved cultivation practices were kept at
acceptable levels. The main agricultural results of these projects point to a
decrease after irrigation of cereal production and an increase in the
production of soybeans, sugarbeet and alfalfa and more profitable crops as
cash crops and animal feeds. In general, increases in crop intensities were
largely restricted to early harvested winter cereals. As expected, on the
average, all irrigated crops including wheat and barley had shown improved
yields as compared to the before project situation, but disappointing when
compared with those of other European countries of similar agricultural
characteristics. Consequently,under the present projects, it would be
reasonable to assume that a continuous build up in yields would have taken
place because of irrigation, improved soil conditions and due to improved
cultural practices and fertilization. Production of cereals and major crops
has increased availability for domestic consumption. As a consequence of the
irrigation projects, Romania has also increased exports, mainly of edible
oils, fruits and vegetables and meat. Incremental production of sugarbeet has
helped reduce import of sugar. From the institutional view point the projects
had a significant direct and indirect impact on the reorganization of the
institutions supervising irrigation activities. Before the projects, design,
construction, O&M were carried out by different institutions, which made
coordination and supervision of activities difficult. Under the projects



-6-
coordination of all irrigation activities were concentrated under DGEIFCA,
increasing operational efficiency. Also another positive impact was the
demonstration effect that drainage activities had on independent government
projects. These did not usually include drainage before the Bank financed
projects. Because of the demonstration effect that drainage works were having
under Bank financed projects, drainage was gradually introduced under all
irrigation projects in Romania. Further research activity under Bank financed
projects was substantially strengthened, especially at the research stations
of Braila and Funduleae, which became the focal points of all research being
done to find practical solutions to agricultural problems countrywide.
4.02.       The four projects were expected to generate economic benefits in
the form of increased employment of technicians and higher skill laborers
operating the irrigation systems and of workers in the agricultural and
agroprocessing facilities and increased production of cash crops and other
tradable outputs. Though lack of recent technical data does not allow the
recalculation of FRRs and ERRs for the projects under review, rates of return
calculated at completion for similar projects in the project areas were found
to be compatible with SARs estimates. It would be reasonable to assume that
similar results will be forthcoming from the present projects. However, more
detailed field analysis and performance data are required for a valid
assessment of the benefits, if any, achieved by the projects, if indeed they
have been completed.
4.03        Performance of the Bank.  The Mostistea-Calmatui Project  with
121.4 staff weeks required for appraisal and implementation needed
substantially more (32%) manpower than the average of the four projects
(92.3%) This was basically due to the fact that the project area had more
reservoirs and irrigation areas to supervise. The frequency of supervision
(1.5) per year was less than the normal 2 per year average (see basic data
sheet). The composition of the missions was reasonable, although
agriculturalists participated only in six of the fifty six supervision
missions.  Advice given and comments made by the Bank were usually welcome and
useful. Supervision reports fairly reflect: the progress of execution and the
issues encountered.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
By December 1989, the Government of Romania had completely paid
back to the Bank the full amount of the four loans. Since contacts with BAFI
and MAFI have been completely suspended in early 1987, no supervision evidence
and no relevant information exist since the last supervision report in
December 1986 with regard to project implementation. On the basis of the
available evidence in the EMENA documentation center, discussions with staff
responsible for project implementation and performance under previous
irrigation projects in the project areas, it is assumed that projects' works
have progressed satisfactorily, since December 1986. The agricultural and
economic impact of the projects are also expected to be in line with SARs'
expectations. Available evidence and assumptions will eventually have to be
reviewed with the Romanian authorities and technicians during a field mission,



-7-
as no substantive ex-post assessment of these projects is possible only
through a desk review. While considering to resume lending for agriculture to
Romania, which after the recent political events may be a possibility, a Bank
mission should visit the country to review the findings of the PCR and to
assess more directly the progress in implementation of the irrigation projects
and their economic, financial, institutional and agricultural impact.
