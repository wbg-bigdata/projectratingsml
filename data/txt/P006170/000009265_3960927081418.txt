MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT STRENGTHENING OPERATION
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 7.14 million (US$9.7 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance an economic management
strengthening operation. The project would be cofinanced by IDB for US$0.775
million, the Government of Switzerland for SWF 4 million (US$2.5 million
equivalent), and possibly by the Government of Italy for US$2.4 million
equivalent.
2.       Background.  After the growth years of the 1970's, the Bolivian economy
suffered a steep and rapid decline in the early 1980's. In the 12-month period
leading to the 1985 change of government, Bolivia ran an inflation rate of
almost 24,000S, and other economic indicators were equally alarming. The poor
economic performance of the early 1980's was caused by deep-seated structural
problems, including an expansion of the public sector and its declining
effectiveness. Frequent change of governments exacerbated uncertainties about
the overall economic policy framework. Public sector management was weak,
leading to massive exodus of civil servants and uncontrolled recurrent
expenditures, poor selection of investment projects, and dismal implementation
performance.
3.       To deal with the desperate economic situation, the Paz Estensorro
government took swift and decisive action upon assuming office in August, 1985.
Its New Economic Policy, embodied in Supreme Decree No. 21060, achieved
remarkable success in ending hyperinflation, drastically reducing the budget
deficit, restoring a competitive exchange rate, and establishing the
macroeconomic stability essential for long-term growth. Notwithstanding these
impressive achievements, the government must overcome a legacy of mismanagement
as it tries to further ameliorate social conditions, lower the size and increase
the efficiency of the public sector, and reorient production. The continued
weakness of economic management and severe shortage of qualified managers and
analysts are major constraints.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The basic aim of the IDA count:ry
program strategy for Bolivia is to assist the Government in implementing its
short and medium-term program for increasing productivity and employment. Two
related objectives are to (a) raise public investment levels; and (b) rebuild
the public institutions for economic management so that the direction and
momentum of policy change achieved thus far are sustained. The proposed project
would directly support these aims and objectives. While other donors are also
involved in limited aspects of public sector management reform, IDA has taken a
lead role in this area, througY che ongoing Public Financial Management
Operation (PFMO,Cr.1809-BO) which seeks to improve basic financial management
systems--accounting, cash management, budget programming--and to broaden the tax
base. The proposed Economic Management Strengthening Operation focuses on
complementary economic management and public service reform issues. Both the



-2-
Government of Bolivia and the donor community are looking to IDA to continue
coordination of reforms in these areas.
5.       Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project's long-term goal is to
support the rebuilding of the Government's capacity to manage the economy
efficiently. Its more immediate objectives are to (a) improve public investment
programming and implementation; (b) strengthen core policy-making and management
processes; (c) increase tax revenues; (d) raise public sector productivity by
supporting Government's efforts to rationalize salaries and attract and retain
skilled manpower; (e) provide the analytical framework for regional management
and planning; and (f) improve the Government's data base for economic planning
and management.
6.       Project Description.   Major project activities include:
(a) improvements in the formulation and execution of the Public Investment
Program, through establishment of budgeting, information and monitoring systems,
provision of specialized technical assistance, training, and support for
priority pre-investment studies; (b) expansion of the Financing and Disbursement
Unit within the Ministry of Planning and Coordination (MPC) to better monitor
disbursements of donor-financed programs; (c) expansion of the public investment
information system (SISIN) to include line ministries and regional development
corporations; (d) formulation of a sector strategy for the Ministry of
Agriculture and strengthening of its public investment programming and
implementation capabilities; (e) support for studies on the financial, fiscal
and institutional implications of the Government's decentralization program and
development of a decentralization strategy, and for related training, equipment
and technical assistance to strengthen national, regional, and local
governments; (f) continued strengthening of tax administration (begun under
PFMO) to include the Customs Directorate and Regions; (g) creation of a Public
Sector Management (PSM) Strengthening Program to attract and retain qualified
senior civil servants, including technical assistance to analyze salary policy,
and subsequent studies of conditions and terms of service for civil servants as
a first step in civil service reform; and (h) support to the National Statistics
Institute (INE) for the implementation of a living standards measurement survey
and extension of the national accounting system to include disaggregated data on
a regional basis. The proposed Credit will also provide funds to refinance a PPF
advance. MPC has overall responsibility for project direction, management and
administration. The Undersecretary for Public Investment has been named acting
project director, a project coordinating unit (PCU) has been formed and a
technical coordinator appointed.
7.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on (a)
cofinancing arrangements with IDB and the Swiss Government; (b) the first year
work program; (c) the declining scale for IDA participation in the financing of
incremental salaries; (d) guidelines and criteria for the use of pre-investment
studies funds; and (e) arrangements with IDB and Government on implementation of
the SISIN. The Government and IDA agreed on the following conditions of
effectiveness: (a) appointment of a permanent project director and formal
establishment of the PCU; and (b) signing of an administrative services
agreement with a local procurement agent acceptable to IDA. In addition,
assurances have been received that the Government will: (a) establish by January
15, 1989 a working group composed of MPC, sector ministry staff and regional
development corporations (chaired by MPC) to ensure close collaboration on the
strategy formulation and implementation of the sector studies of the regional



-3-
planning component: (b) appoint by Harch 15, 1989 a director for the PSM
Strenghtening Program and a project trainir,g coordinator; and (c) complete a
project training plan by June 15, 1989. The Government and IDA have also agreed
that no disbursements would be made for expenditures for (a) implementation
activities under the Regional Planning component until the Government has issued
a Supreme Decree stating its overall decentralization program strategy; (b) the
PSM Program Secretariat until it has been formally established by the
Government; and (c) contracts entered into after December 31 of each year until
there has been review and approval by IDA of the project's work program ter the
following year.
8.       Benefits. The project benefits would come from better public investment
programming and implementation, especially important given the magnitude of the
undisbursed pipeline for investments and from increased budgetary revenues due
to better tax administration. Overall efficiency of the ministries and agencies
dealing with economic and public sector management would increase because of
improved working conditions, higher salaries and training opportunities,
permitting the Government to attract and keep qualified, motivated civil
servants.
9.       Risks. There are two main risks associated with the project: (a) the
broad country risk that the Government, during and following the 1989
presidential elections, cannot or will not sustain its macro-economic program;
and (b) the Government's limited capability to manage complex projects will not
be adequate. The first risk is mitigated by the fact that project activities
address fundamental weaknesses in economic management and entail such basic
improvements that the project already enjoys broad-based multi-partisan support.
Regarding the second risk, the management services contract between the
Government and the UNDP's Project Services office--whereby the UNDP is
responsible for the project's administration--will lessen the day-to-day
responsibilities of the PCV, thus allowing it to concentrate on substantive
issues. In addition, the project will be implemented by annual work programs
which permit flexibility and encourage discussion between Government and IDA in
order to reach a consensus on priority needs for the coming year. Finally, the
PSM Strengthening Program is an innovative and potentially controversial scheme,
and entails difficult issues, notably, the depoliticization of the public
service. The potential problems have been discussed with government officials
from the present government and from other political parties, with unanimous
support for the Program. Covenants relating to the PSM Strengthening Program
include the establishment of a Program Secretariat to manage the Program and to
ensure consistent application, transparency, and monitoring of the rationalized
salary scheme, employment conditions, and criteria for selection into the civil
service.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
