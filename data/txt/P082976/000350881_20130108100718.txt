1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The country context during the preparation of the third phase of the Public Works
Program was comparable to when the first and second phase were prepared in 1995 and 1998.
The country was facing a number of challenges deriving mainly from the unification of North
and South in 1990, the return of over a million overseas workers in 1991 and the civil war in
1994. During the preparation of the third phase another civil war broke out in the Northern part
of the country in 2002.

2.      The economy was almost driven to a point of collapse with an estimated 40 percent
unemployment and a budget deficit of 50 percent. This weak economic and political situation
affected the country’s capacity to deliver the most needed basic services especially in the rural
areas, home to 70 percent of the country’s 18 million people out of which 90 percent lived below
the poverty line. In response, the Government had been implementing an economy-wide reform
program designed to stabilize the economy and stimulate sustainable growth. The Government
had been less than satisfied with the expected pay-offs from the reform program in terms of
employment generation, income growth, and better public services, as access rates remained low.
The education indicators were well below regional average; only 48 percent of Yemeni adults
were literate. Infant mortality rate remained high at 76 per1000, and life expectancy was only 56
years. Yemen’s very meager water supply (less than 130 cubic meters per capita per year) left 90
percent of the population with less than minimum standards of water supply. In addition, poor
access to safe drinking water and poor sanitation were daily reminders of poverty, especially
onerous for girls and women in rural areas. The largely mountainous terrain left much of the
rural population without access to the market economy and public services. Less than 15 percent
of the road network was paved.

3.      From the beginning of the stabilization program, the Government had sought to mitigate
the short-term effects on the country’s most vulnerable population by undertaking to provide a
limited social safety net and create jobs. IDA had supported the Government’s strategy through a
series of interventions with the first and second Public Works Program (PWP) and the Social
Fund for Development (SFD). The two first PWPs had attracted substantial co-financing from
other donors due to the shared development priorities and the good results obtained. The Third
Public Works Project (the Project) was an extension of two earlier phases. The aim was to scale
up the impact of these two earlier phases by increasing the number of sub-projects to be
delivered as the needs for basic infrastructure services and income opportunities for unskilled
labor remained high.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.     The overall development objective of the third phase was to continue supporting the
Borrower in the: (a) provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and environmental
conditions (particularly those affecting women and children) and; (b) creation of short term
employment. Sustainability of services delivered was to be ensured through community
contribution to the costs of sub-projects; involvement in sub-projects selection; participation in

                                               -1-
sub-projects preparation; and community involvement in monitoring progress of implementation
during construction. 1

5.      The above objective was also consistent with the relevant Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) and the Government’s Second Five Year Plan (2001-2005) which focused on, among
other issues, social development by supporting social protection measures to mitigate the adverse
impact of the reform program on those most likely to be affected. Thus, while the Project was
responsive to the circumstances and development priorities, it was also relevant to the CAS and
the PRSP, which focused on developing human resources, improving infrastructure, achieving
economic growth and granting social protection.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification.

6.     The PDO was not revised; however, the targets for key indicators underwent revision and
a road/stone paving indicator was added for the ICR as it was omitted in the original results
framework in both the PAD and the Additional Financing Project Paper. As a result of the
increase in fuel prices beginning April 2005, prices of building materials such as cement, steel,
stones, labor, etc., increased drastically up to and above 50 percent. As a consequence,
subproject output figures and estimates of employment generation had to be revised downward at
MTR in May 2007, except for water harvesting schemes due to the high demand of such
subprojects. In spite of the reduction in outputs, it was estimated that more people would benefit
from services, due to the number of beneficiaries being a key element of sub-project selection.
The number of beneficiaries would only decrease for water supply schemes, since this type of
sub-project was scaled down due to sustainability concerns. The targets were revised again
during appraisal of the additional financing in 2008. The details are in the Datasheet and in Table
1 in section 3.2). Finally, the number of district councils to be trained under the Project was
reduced from 50 to 20 districts at the request of the Ministry of Local Administration (MOLA),
following the adoption of the National Strategy for Decentralization after effectiveness.

7.     To compensate for the reduction in the total number of subprojects to be delivered
following the price increases, an Additional Financing (AF) Credit for an amount of SDR18.8
million (US$29.84 million) was approved on April 22, 2008. The PDO did not change.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The beneficiaries were the residents of communities receiving sub-projects, which would
see the quality of life improve through improved access to services, selected in a participatory
manner to correspond to the most acutely felt needs. Improved access to employment in the
construction industry was another direct benefit. At completion, the 716 subprojects delivered
benefited about 2million people distributed across the country’s 21 governorates. Distribution of
projects by governorates and districts is given in Annex 2. The project capacity building
component would provide benefits to 50 districts, reduced to 20 during implementation; districts
are listed under the same annex.

 The sustainability aspect of the PDO figures in the PAD but was not mentioned in the Development Credit
Agreement. It is however considered relevant and included for the evaluation in the ICR.

1.5 Original Components

9.      Component 1: Community Infrastructure: Appraisal estimate: US$46.5 million
/Revised cost including Additional Financing: US$79.19 million /Actual cost at Project closing:
US$81.75 million. This was the primary component of the Project, representing 90 percent of the
total Project cost. It provided small scale basic infrastructure services in sectors such as health,
education, vocational training, water, sanitation schemes, water harvesting/irrigation and village
access roads/stone paving. Subprojects were demand-driven based on requests submitted by
communities, local governments, members of parliament, and selected based on eight established
criteria including community contribution, labor content, investment cost per person-month of
employment generated, poverty alleviation indicators, investment cost per beneficiary,
improvements in environment, sustainability and involuntary resettlement/land acquisition.

10.     Component 2: Technical Assistance/Consultant Services: Appraisal estimate:
US$3.50 million /Revised cost including Additional Financing: US$5.57 million /Actual cost at
Project closing: US$4.15 million. This component provided financing for consultancy services
for Component 1 subproject selection, preparation, design, tendering, and construction
supervision. It would also finance capacity building to 50 district councils in carrying out
assessments of their infrastructure needs, capacity assessments for implementation, preparation
of investment plans, assessment of sources of revenues and establishment of management
information systems. Finally the component would finance:(i) a baseline survey;(ii) carrying out
one Socioeconomic Impact Assessment (SIA); (iii) annual audits; (iv) training, including
workshops for consulting firms, contractors, and NGOs;(v) training of local
communities/beneficiaries in the operation and maintenance of infrastructure created; and (vi) in
carrying out of study on the future options for the Public Works Projects including the role of the
Project Management Unit. The capacity building of 50 district councils was to be undertaken in a
manner consistent with the MOLA National Strategy for Decentralization, under elaboration, and
in coordination with other agencies engaged in similar activities.

11.    Component 3: Project Management Support: Original cost at appraisal: US$2.00
million / Revised cost including additional financing: US$3.48 million /Actual cost at Project
closing: US$4.37 million). The component financed operation of the PMU including incremental
operational and training costs of PMU staff.

1.6 Other significant changes

12.     The Project was implemented as designed with no major changes to the design, scope,
implementation arrangements or funding allocations except for:(i) the reduction in the number of
district councils from 50 to 20 districts based on a request from the Ministry of Local
Administration; and (ii) approval of an additional financing in 2008 to meet the financing gap
that resulted from price increases.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.    The project was prepared in only eight months, given that the predecessor projects
provided valuable lessons feeding directly into project preparation, and the PMU was well versed
in Bank procedures. The Project was originally intended (in the CAS) as a District and
Community Development Project (DCDP) to support decentralization and to include
continuation of the public works program. However, in view of the pressing need for additional
subprojects, with close to 8,000 unmet requests from communities for basic infrastructure
services, the Government requested and the Bank agreed to pursue the DCDP objectives through
two separate interventions, the PWP-3 and a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) for supporting
the decentralization efforts of the Government. While combining the two aspects would have
allowed more learning by doing in the decentralized entities, splitting the two was probably a
wise choice, due to the embryonic nature of the decentralization process and the risk that
capacity constraints would compromise the objective of providing improved services, and the
uncertain direction of decentralization, which still has to take off at the time of project closing.

14.     Institutional and implementation arrangements remained the same as in the previous two
phases. A Steering Committee (SC), composing of representatives from the relevant sector
ministries and three from non-governmental organizations, was in place to assure that there
would be no duplication of efforts with other projects, further guaranteed by the PMU (in the
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), which chaired the SC) being
responsible for implementing similar operations and investments funded by other donors under
the PWP-3.

15.     Lessons learned from the first and second phase were taken into consideration in project
design, including among others:

   •   Reusing the subprojects design to fit well with the local labor market environment,
       country geographical conditions and dispersed site locations. Distribution of allocations
       between the governorates followed the same principles used in the previous two phases
       (i) 50 percent based on poverty index; (ii) population density 30 percent; and (iii) 20
       percent remoteness and underserved areas.
   •   The importance of gathering of baseline data on key performance indicators upfront for
       each area to be targeted by the Project. This helped first establish good practices for
       regular and reliable data collection; provided baseline data against which performance
       was measured.
   •   The importance of ensuring sustainability before a subproject is selected for
       implementation. This is more relevant for example to water supply schemes. Proper
       assessment of water resources is a must to ensure that enough water is available.
       Sanitation schemes are another example but related more to environment. So, to avoid
       negative environmental impact on the targeted areas, there is a need to ensure existence
       of functioning and reliable wastewater treatment facilities or other appropriate disposal
       facilities.
   •   Operation and maintenance should be secured through solid confirmation either from the
                                                -4-
       relevant line ministries for schools, health facilities, training centers or from communities
       for other sectors such as water supply, sanitation schemes, water harvesting, and village
       access roads. Active community involvement would promote a strong commitment of
       ownership which facilitated not only successful delivery but also continued community
       involvement in the future operation and maintenance of subprojects. This is even more
       relevant in isolated communities where government’s ability to provide a sustained
       financial commitment to future operation and maintenance is not foreseen. The PWP-3
       introduced a 5 percent minimum community contribution in cash or in kind as a
       mandatory criterion for selecting sub-projects.
   •   Ensure that appropriate environmental and social safeguards measures were applied
       through strict screening procedures before a subproject is selected for implementation.
       The screening was required to determine the investment needs and to provide appropriate
       mitigation measures.
16.     Based on previous PWP phases, the risks were evaluated as moderate, and it was
adequately foreseen to include sub-project selection criteria to maximize labor content,
strengthen PMU capacity to scale up activities, and include as study on the future of the PMU to
assure institutional continuity. The sub-project cycle was well developed (see the full cycle in the
Government ICR, on page 50). The Project was ready for implementation as soon as it became
effective. There was approximately a one year gap between the closing of the second phase and
the effectiveness of the third phase. However, the PMU continued to operate in full capacity,
managing other donor projects. So, when the Project became effective in July 2004, the PMU
was fully operational and all institutional arrangements, including availability of adequate staff,
was in place. The first year investment plan had already been approved by the Steering
Committee (SC) and was ready for tendering and most of these contracts were ready for signing
by effectiveness.

17.     Based on the above design considerations, with adequate evaluation of risk and
incorporation of lessons learned, including selection criteria that would contribute to maximizing
impact, combined with the full readiness at effectiveness, the quality at entry is rated
satisfactory, in line with the Quality at Entry assessment by the Quality Assurance Group. The
only shortcoming noted is not foreseeing indicators to capture the impacts on women and
children, which was part of the PDO.

2.2 Implementation

18.     The Project was approved on February 26, 2004 and declared effective on July 15,
2004.The Project was generally implemented smoothly, due to the professionalism of the PMU
and engagement of the government and beneficiaries to provide co-financing on time. The main
changes, detailed below, were: (i) the reduction of the number of districts from 50 to 20 under
the technical assistance component and adjustments to indicator targets during the MTR, (ii)the
approval of additional financing and the resulting adjustment of activities and indicator targets to
incorporate results expected from the AF, and (iii) the conflict which resulted in a second
extension to the project.

19.    The MTR was carried out in May 2007. The review acknowledged the lessons
incorporated from previous two phases, in particular O&M and M&E aspects. The main action

                                                -5-
taken during the MTR was the revision of key results indicators downwards to accommodate the
increase in the price of construction materials and labor as a result of steep increase in the price
of fuel and construction materials beginning in April 2005.

20.      Capacity enhancement of 50 district councils was part of Component 2. This sub-
Component was designed to be aligned with the Ministry of Local Authorities’ (MOLA)
National Strategy for Decentralization, but implementation was delayed until a comprehensive
strategy had been developed along with draft training manuals. By April, 2007, a draft
implementation manual was finalized by MOLA and agreement reached concerning detailed
scope of activities for capacity enhancement of the district councils. The revised scope of
activities now consisted of more in-depth training and support to district councils (including
provision of equipment). The total budget of US$1.0 million allocated to activities benefiting
districts was considered too limited and in consequence, the PMU and IDA agreed during the
MTR to reduce the number of districts and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was
amended accordingly on July 19, 2007. The PDOs remained unchanged.

21.     In April 2008 IDA approved an Additional Financing Credit in the amount of SDR 18.8
million (US$29.8 million). The PDO remained unchanged, but key outputs, outcome indicators
and the monitoring targets were merged with the existing targets. The change was made based on
Government’s request to meet the financing gap caused by continuous price increases in cement,
steel and fuel which began in 2005.

22.     Two extensions were accorded to the project: (i) the first, to enable the completion of
Project activities in particular those related to the additional financing, consisted in extending the
Project closing for two years from June 30, 2009 to June 2011, and (ii) as a result of the 2011
unrest the Project’s closing date was extended unilaterally by the Bank from June 30, 2011 to
June 30, 2012.All sub-projects were completed despite the difficulties. The planned final
beneficiary impact assessment, which would have provided a more detailed and nuanced picture
of impacts at project closing, could not be carried out. Although this is a minor shortcoming, due
to the good M&E system with detailed information on all sub-projects.

23.     No other major risks were encountered during implementation hindering the project from
achieving its development objectives apart from those directly related to normal operating
environment risks such as limited access to certain districts in north and south of the country due
to geographic and logistical difficulties. Despite these access problems, these areas received their
shares of subprojects under the Project. It should also be mentioned that access limitation to
conflict affected areas did not deprive these areas from receiving their share of subprojects, but
only in delaying implementation progress.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.     Indicators and targets were developed based on experience from the PWP-2. A good
baseline study was carried out to lay down the exact results obtained from the PWP-2 and assure
that results could be attributed to PWP-3. Further, before the approval of each sub-project the
PMU would visit the beneficiary area to update the baseline for the specific sector, and after
completion the PMU would return to measure impact, providing for good quality of data and
assuring that results can be correctly attributed per sub-project, especially given the large number

                                                 -6-
of donors. The revisions to indicator targets at the MTR and during appraisal of the AF were
each time based on best estimates of number of beneficiaries per output. A result of this was that
even though outputs for most sectors had to be revised downwards at the MTR due to cost
increases, the subprojects with the biggest impact were retained, and it was estimated that the
number of beneficiaries would actually increase in some sectors.

25.      During implementation of the third phase and due to increased workload as a result of
other donor financing and at the PMU’s request in 2009, an M&E officer was recruited to
support M&E functions at various levels of planning, data collection, and quality and cost
control related to results indicators as stipulated in the project documents, and physical progress.
To that effect, a new section was added to the quarterly progress report to cover these new
activities. The very good indicator data was used to maximize the number of beneficiaries and
employment generation of sub-projects and to assure that sub-projects with elevated risk to
sustainability were not funded. Quarterly reports were provided by the Project to the
Government, IDA, and other stakeholders reporting on implementation progress. The reports
provided information on: (a) performance indicators; (b) results of Socio-economic Impact
Assessments; (c) compliance with remedial actions for environmental and social safeguards; (d)
variation of unit costs under civil works contracts; (e) physical progress of civil works; and (f)
status of funds disbursed. Findings of these reviews were regularly shared with the SC, IDA and
other interested stakeholders.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.     Environmental Safeguards: The Project design took into account the Bank’s safeguards
policies and included procedures that would ensure full safeguard compliance in accordance with
OP 4.01. Guidance on procedures for environmental screening, environmental assessment,
consultations disclosures, and environmental management plan were clearly stated in the Manual
of Procedures (MOP). No major environmental safeguards issues were encountered during the
implementation of the PWP-3 except on the issue of disposal of medical waste, which was
resolved through the inclusion in the design of health units of a small incinerator to get rid of the
medical wastes.

27.     Social Safeguard: OP 4.12 was not triggered since land acquisition or involuntary
resettlement was not anticipated. The MOP included a check-list to assess feasibility of
subprojects; any subproject that had the possibility of triggering OP 4.12 was eliminated at the
preparation stage.

28.     Financial Management: Financial Management was carried out in accordance with the
Project design and the DCA. The Project maintained satisfactory financial management
arrangements in terms of human resources, computerized network and well defined segregation
of duties between departments. Accounting software was specifically designed under previous
Public Works Projects, and was used to follow-up on Project accounts and generate timely
financial management reports, including Bank required Financial Monitoring Reports. The PMU
maintained a ‘Financial Management Manual’ that included FM policies, procedures and
guidelines for Project implementation. Audits were carried out on an annual basis, were
unqualified, and repeatedly confirmed adequacy of the Project’s accounting system, including


                                                 -7-
internal controls mechanism, and disbursements that were made on the basis on statements of
expenditures.

29.    Procurement: Procurement tasks were managed by the procurement department which
consisted of a Head of Department, preparation and procurement Engineer, and
appraisal/supervision consultants and engineers. Procurement staff received all the necessary
procurement training to manage civil works contracts and complied with IDA procurement
guidelines. Post procurement reviews were regular and did not reveal any fiduciary issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

30.     Sustainability of subproject is ensured through community involvement in subproject
identification, selection, and implementation and in securing community contribution in cash or
kind which provides additional assurance on sustainability for future operations and
maintenance. Sustainability is also ensured through representative of the line ministries in the
Steering Committee whose main responsibility is approving the yearly and quarterly investment
plans prepared and presented by the Project. At project closing, operating budgets are made
available by the relevant sector ministries except for water harvesting and water supply schemes,
which are fully maintained by the communities. Road sub-projects are almost maintenance free
due to the construction technique (paving) used. Quality is assessed as satisfactory based on
regular quality control carried out by the M&E Department of the PMU.

31.     Capitalizing on the experience built and lessons learned from PWP-3, IDA had
maintained its engagement and has prepared a follow-on Project in the amount of US$61 million
which was approved by Board of Directors on June 22, 2012. This follow up Project (Labor
Intensive Public Works Project) figures in the Yemen CAS of 2010-2013.

3. Assessment of the Outcome

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.     The objective is very much relevant to the Government’s development priorities one of
which is improving living conditions of its population especially those living in rural and remote
areas through provision of basic infrastructure services such as clean water, health care, village
access roads, sanitation, etc. Thus the outcomes achieved support both the CAS and the PRSP –
by improving infrastructure, achieving economic growth and granting social protection. The
relevance is further testified by the large amount of parallel co-financing the project received
from other donors, and the fact that the basic design concept continues to be relevant and is
reused for the Labor Intensive Public Works Project (LIPWP). One of the strongest features of
the design was its demand driven approach which resulted in communities’ direct involvement in
subproject selection, preparation, and implementation. Also, because of its small in size with an
average cost of US$110,000, the Project helped in the development of local small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) and consulting firms and individual engineers ensuring continued
quality improvement of these two local industries. The Additional Financing and minor changes
made during implementation (reducing the number of districts and adjusting indicator targets)
assured continued relevance and adequacy between resources and objectives given the changes


                                               -8-
to operating environment with the adoption of the National Strategy for Decentralization and
price increases.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

33.     The PDO was achieved as measured by the indicators and is rated satisfactory.
Achievement of the two sub-PDOs is evaluated separately below; each was achieved with only
minor shortcomings. Actual achievements by the Project exceeded the output/outcome estimates
in most of the key areas such as job creation, provision of basic infrastructures, development of
local contractors and consulting firms. The ICR further considers sustainability of investments,
in line with the PDO in the PAD.

Sub-PDO (i): Provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and environmental
conditions (particularly those affecting women and children)

34.     Regarding the first sub-PDO the 716 sub-projects delivered have benefited about 2.2
million people, or 112 percent of the target. While the indicator breakdown in the Datasheet
indicates that there were more male than female beneficiaries in total, in reality women benefit
most directly from some of the sub-project types (water supply, water harvesting, health, and
vocational training), while education sub-projects contribute to improving gender equality in the
longer term. Males benefited more from sanitation, since improved public toilets are used more
by men, and from roads, since men tend to be more economically active outside the home. The
results by sub-project type are given below, with additional information on the qualitative
aspects of Project achievements (results against indicator targets at MTR and for the Additional
Financing are presented in the Datasheet and in the overview Table below):

   (a) The school enrollment rate for children increased by 256,359 at Project closing; 28
       percent more than 200,500 targeted. Investments in the education sector account for 52
       percent of the total investment cost, indicating the high priority. The gender breakdown
       of the indicator shows that slightly more males (134,333) than females(122,026)
       benefited from the 378 schools constructed (1,888 classrooms), but in reality the project
       contributes to improving gender parity, since enrollment increased by 58 percent for
       females against 19 percent for males, leading to a gradually improved gender parity
       (currently at 0.66 in primary education).In the beneficiary areas, before the Project there
       would be no school or classes would be held in improvised settings. With proximity of
       proper school buildings people are more inclined to send girls to school.
   (b) The number of beneficiaries of the 20 health centers improved by the project is 537,347
       at Project closing; 29 percent less than 760,000 targeted. No new centers were built since
       under PWP-2 it had taken the Government up to two years to assure adequate staffing.
       The main activity according to the SIA is family planning (22 percent of activity), which
       particularly improves female health and neo-natal survival rates.
   (c) A total of 5,434 students graduated from the 10 vocational training centers built by the
       Project; 112 percent higher than 2,560 targeted. Women make up the majority of
       beneficiaries (8 of 10 centers are for women) and training provides a job opportunity and
       steady income for women. Graduates typically see their earnings increase by 25 to 100
       percent after the training program.

                                               -9-
       (d) The number of beneficiaries benefiting from 47 water supply schemes was 209,762 at
           Project closing; 29 percent less than 295,000 targeted. Fewer sub-projects were approved
           than foreseen, as test-drilling showed that water sources were inadequate in several cases
           and projects would not be sustainable. Especially women benefit from water supply
           schemes, as previously female members of the household would spend between 2 to 4
           hours to fetch water.

       (e) The number of beneficiaries benefiting from 18 sanitation schemes is 197,127; 44 percent
           less than 350,000 targeted. The sanitation schemes has reduced danger of contamination

    Column totals do not add up, this is due to road sub-projects not being an indicator.

                                                                  -10-
       of drinking water sources and water pollution and consequently minimized risks of
       infection with diseases resulting from water pollution. Women and children benefited
       considerably from waste-water elimination.
   (f) A total of 455,770 people benefited from 187 water harvesting schemes; 42 percent
       higher than 320,000 targeted. As for water supply, women benefit from time savings to
       fetch water. The water harvesting has further resulted in improved agricultural potential
       in beneficiary areas and contributes to reducing depleting water sources.
   (g) The number of beneficiaries from road construction was 503,249; whereas there was no
       target set. According to the SIA the roads have facilitated transport of goods and access
       to economic activities, with traffic increasing by about 75 percent on upgraded roads.
   (h) Direct project beneficiaries: 2,165,048 people benefited from the project sub-projects
       against a target of 1,928,060, an achievement of 112 percent.

35.     Although some shortcomings were noted on achievement of targets for some sub-project
types, the total number of beneficiaries is the best indicator of impact due to the demand-driven
nature of the project; this indicator was surpassed. Further, measured by investments, the health,
water supply and sanitation sectors, which did not fully meet the targets, only make up 11
percent of investments. The part of the sub-PDO objective which pertains to benefiting women
and children, this has been achieved. Water supply, water harvesting and vocational training sub-
projects (29 percent of investments) directly or predominantly benefit women, and education
sub-projects (52 percent of investments) directly benefit children and contribute to gender parity
in education. For some sub-project types males benefited more in quantitative terms, but overall,
given the high number of beneficiaries and the qualitative aspects of impact on women and
children, sub-PDO (i) is considered achieved with only minor shortcomings.

Sub-PDO (ii): Creation of short term employment

36.    Intermediate outcome indicator 7 also reveals the level of achievement of PDO; the target
was surpassed by 17% with 118,000 work-months of employment generated against a target of
101,000.

37.     The targeted creation of man-months of work was surpassed, showing that the project did
in fact have the expected impact in terms of employment creation, with the creation of 118,000
work months of short-term employment. This resulted in the distribution of approximately
US$27.7 million in wages. The average employment period was 7.4 months, so potentially the
project benefited about 15,945 workers (some workers might have worked on more than one
contract, so the total could be less), and with a dependency ratio of 7 per person, the total number
of people benefiting from the income generated could be as high as 111,000 people. The average
monthly income generated per worker was approximately 235US$, and this income is especially
important in rural areas (where 85 percent of sub-projects were implemented) which have seen
significant increase in numbers of food in-secured people due to the increase in global food
prices exacerbated by the financial crisis. The project was able to surpass the target by selecting
Sub-projects such as stone paving and water harvesting, which have high labor content (40 to 60
percent), and in consequence average employment content in the investments was even higher


                                                -11-
(34.5 percent) than estimated at appraisal (30 percent). Overall, sub-PDO (ii) is considered fully
achieved.

38.     Private sector development was not part of the PDO, but was clearly supported under the
Project, by the development of new contractors and consultancy firms. For IDA financed sub-
projects 469 contractors have been contracted (at an average of 1.5 sub-projects per contractor),
providing opportunities to get on-job training under the guidance of competent supervision
consultants to develop their skills and enabling them to participate in tenders from different
implementing agencies and the private sector. Contractors also get acquainted with transparent
award and payment procedures that they may in the future insist on the same from others. The
Project also used the services of a many of consultants with services ranging from design and
supervision to tender preparation. For the IDA financed sub-projects 522 consultants have been
contracted out of which 206 are new.
39.     The conditions of 93 percent of the interviewed contractors improved moderately to
significantly according to the 2007 SIA, while the conditions of 6.7 percent did not improve as a
result of increased competition among contractors, leading to reduction of the bidding prices.
The continued development and training of small local contracting and consulting firms as well
as individual consultants, proved to be beneficial and appropriate, and resulted in quality
improvements of facilities delivered.

Evaluation of sustainability

40.     The corollary to the PDO in the PAD relating to sustainability was also achieved, through
ensuring that criteria for the design of the sub-projects financed by the PWPs included that O&M
costs be low and affordable for the targeted beneficiaries. The ability and willingness of the
beneficiaries to operate and maintain these sub-projects was assessed during the evaluation of
sub-project proposals to ensure compliance with established criterion, including sustainability.
The sub-projects built use technologies that facilitate their financial sustainability through the use
of construction designs that have low O&M requirements, mainly local labor input. This is
particularly the case in subproject of water supply and harvesting schemes (and in improved
access through stone paving). All sub-projects are operational at the time of project closing.

Overall results from the PWP-1, 2, and 3

41.     In addition to these results, successful implementation of the PWP-3 (and the previous
phases) had successfully managed to gain the trust and support of the donor community,
government entities, non-governmental organizations, and social and public figures. This trust
acted as a catalyst for mobilizing funds from other donors, which exceeded US$300 million
(details in Annex 1) increasing in turn the impact of the Project on the targeted communities
three- to four-fold. So, with other donor financing, the total number of subprojects delivered
under the third phase is not 716 subprojects but 2019 subprojects. The Table below is a snapshot
of the results from the Bank’s interventions through the PWP phases.

 3.3     Efficiency

 42.     Efficiency is rated substantial. At appraisal, no economic analysis was carried out due to
 the demand-driven nature of the sub-projects. However, the results of PWP-2 showed
 satisfactory economic rate of return and the same ratios of cost to benefits were expected for the
 PWP-3. For the PWP-3 ICR, the overall Economic Rates of Return (ERRs) and Net Present
 Values (NPVs) have been computed for all sub-projects in education and water harvesting,
 covering 75 percent of the total investments of PWP-3.The cost-benefit analysis excludes
 investments in Components 2 and 3 (for which benefits are not quantifiable). Efficiency of
 project management is evaluated by considering operating ratios.

 43.     The result of the economic analysis shows that overall ERRs for classrooms and water
 harvesting schemes are 17.2and 108 percent respectively; confirming the economic viability of
 these investments. These results are consistent with the overall NPVs for schools and harvested
 water of US$128 million and US$38.7million, respectively. The full economic analysis can be
 found in Annex 3, including sensitivity analysis. The operating cost of the PMU was 4 percent,
 which is considered efficient compared to the generally accepted norm of 5 percent for project
 implementing agencies.

 3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
 Rating: Satisfactory

 44.     The overall Project outcome is rated as ‘Satisfactory’ based on its high relevance, the
 extent of achievements and the efficiency of the investments made. The relevance is proven by
 the robust design, adapted from the previous PWPs and which continues on for the LIPWP, the
 large amount of co-financing, and the adjustments made during implementation (including AF)
 to keep the Project fully aligned with external circumstances. There were shortcomings on
 achievement of PDO-indicator targets for some sectors while others were over-achieved. Due to
 the demand-driven nature of the project the total number of beneficiaries is the best indicator of
 impact; this indicator was surpassed. The gender and children aspect of the PDO was not
 adequately monitored during implementation through disaggregated indicators, but the ICR
 presents evidence that this aspect was fully achieved. The project results were made possible by:
 (i) responsiveness of the Project design to the needs of the people, labor market, geographical
 conditions; (ii) existence of a well-established Project Management Unit (PMU) experienced in
 implementing similar projects; (iii) continuous monitoring and evaluation of realistic and


                                                    -13-
achievable project performance indicators; and (iv) early involvement of the communities in
Project design, preparation and implementation ensured ownership and sustainability.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

45.     Poverty impact is significant as Yemen is one of the poorest countries in MENA. Over 85
percent of IDA financed sub-projects were implemented in rural areas, which account for at least
80 percent of total number of poor in Yemen. The highest proportion of its population is
dispersed in wadis and mountain terrain where getting access to basic services is of utmost
importance. And yet like many poor countries, public financing is hardly available where it is
most needed. The Project was specifically designed to help address basic needs of these people,
by having basic services reach these people through provision of small scale infrastructure
services working at the same as catalyst to attract other donor financing to help increase these
impact.

46.     Gender was specifically a part of the PDO and women and girls, particularly those living
in rural areas, derive direct benefits from improved access to basic economic and social
infrastructure services as a result of the creation of high value public assets in different sectors:
health, education, water supply, sewage disposal, water harvesting schemes, stone paving of
roads and streets and vocational training. In the water sector, for example, time usually devoted
by women and young girls (8-12 years) to fetch water was reduced from 2-4 hours in certain
areas to half an hour or less.

47.     In addition to the improved and sustainable access to basic services, the main social
development outcomes achieved were in terms of short-term employment for locally available
skilled and unskilled labor during implementation and empowerment of communities through
direct involvement in subproject selection, preparation, and operation and maintenance.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

48.     The institutional development impact was substantial on the PMU, which increased
ability to implement up to 500 sub-projects in parallel, enabling it to absorb the increase in the
workload as a result in the increase in the financing from US$45 million, original Project cost, to
around US$387 million total. Institutional development and strengthening of district councils in
20 districts (amended from 50 districts to 20 districts) was carried out to help them undertake an
assessment of their basic infrastructure needs, preparation of medium term investment plans,
assessment of sources of revenues and establishment of management information system. The
impact is however limited, as the decentralization process has not taken off to any significant
extent and the districts are not yet exercising their intended mandate.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

49.     The PWP pioneered a solution to the problem of de-forestation by adding a re-forestation
activity to the community infrastructure component. This was done to ensure that trees removed
during construction are replaced, but also to plant 50-200 additional trees in the vicinity of each


                                                -14-
sub-project. For IDA financed sub-projects, around 58,000 trees have been planted thus far, and
other development projects have initiated similar activities.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

50.     A Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SIA) was to be conducted at the end of the
project, but could not be carried out due to the conflict. The text below summarizes the 2007
SIA, conducted on a representative sample population of 15 percent of 323 subprojects
completed and under implementation. Selected findings, which remain relevant to present the
qualitative aspects of the project, are highlighted below (with details in Annex 5):

      (a) In the education sector, overall enrollment rate in basic and secondary education
          increased by 34 percent, 58 percent for females and 19 percent for males in the targeted
          areas. Decrease in teacher to student ratio from one to 60 students to one to 44 students.
      (b) The water storage of 5,790 cubic meters resulted in increasing the average share of water
          per capita by approximately 9 percent. Water harvesting contributes to recharging
          precious ground water resources.
      (c) The vocational training centers resulted in increase in income for trainees of between 25
          and 100 percent, mainly used to finance schooling for household children, clothing and
          medicine.
      (d) The health, sanitation, and road investments also had positive impacts. In health, family-
          planning was one of the major services delivered, which will contribute to improving
          post-natal life expectancy. For sanitation, the average distance between sanitation service
          and the closest water source tripled, reducing drinking water source contamination. Road
          paving increased traffic by 75 percent and according to residents contributed to
          improving environmental conditions, in addition to easy transportation of goods.
      (e) Training programs consultant engineers, contractors and local communities had positive
          effect at different levels such as on improving project design, supervision and
          implementation of sub-projects, and community/beneficiary participation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

51.     Risk to development outcome is mainly related to operation and maintenance of
completed facilities which is mitigated through community and sector ministries involvement in
subproject selection and approval process. Yemen is a conflict country, but so far under the
previous PWPs no sub-project has been affected, due to the strong ownership and resilience built
into project design. The same holds true for sub-projects under PWP-3; since this is a
community-driven development project which was implemented at the local level with strong
local ownership and engagement, the project's design contributed to its resilience in terms of the
conflict situation in Yemen. Where problems have occurred, they have been overcome.
Communities in some Governorates have temporarily taken over payment of operating expenses
for schools and teacher’s salaries until the Ministry of Education could resume payments.
Therefore, while the conflict affected implementation, sustainability is not at risk due to the
conflict.

                                                 -15-
52.     The overall risk is evaluated as low to negligible in all sectors with the exception of the
water supply and health sectors. The issue with the water sector is related to water quality
(salinity, etc.) and quantity that might result from over extraction. With regards to the health
sector, the main risk is absence of financial and human resources to operate completed facilities
(as was the case during the first phase of PWP when out of about 70 health units delivered, only
50 percent were operational and the rest had to wait over 24 months until they could be
operational). As a result of this experience, no new health units were built under the Project, only
extensions or rehabilitation of existing facilities, while sanitation sub-projects were mainly
implemented in urban cities where treatment systems already exist or implementation of disposal
and treatment sites are a pre-condition to selection. Water supply projects were subjected to test
drilling, which resulted in rejection of a number of requests. Furthermore, improved awareness
and the pro-active role of local communities, early coordination with local authorities and
concerned agencies has improved to a large extent sustainability of investments. Stone
paving/village access roads and water harvesting constitute about 36 percent of the investment
cost and they are generally operation and maintenance free except for periodical cleaning. Sub-
projects in other sectors are maintained by the relevant line ministries.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

53.      The PWP-3 was a continuation of two successful phases and lessons learnt were
adequately incorporated during preparation. Key lessons that were integrated into the Project’s
design were ensuring sustainability through community participation in subproject selection and
implementation, and maximizing labor content. The Bank adequately appraised the need to
increase PMU capacities and assured that a study would be carried out on the future of the PMU.
Excellent relationship developed between IDA and the Borrower facilitated easy resolution of
any issues that arose during Project processing. By Project effectiveness, bidding documents for
the first years' investment program were finalized and the Project was ready for implementation.
Accordingly and based on the above the ICR rates the Bank Performance in ensuring quality at
entry “Satisfactory?, in accordance with the rating given by the Quality Assurance Group.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

54.     Implementation of the Project went smoothly without any major problem. This was made
possible through continued cooperation and team work between the task team and the PMU
which in turn helped resolve any difficulties encountered which were, in general, minor. Regular
visits to subproject sites with the PMU staff were conducted and issues on implementation,
quality of workmanship, community participation/contribution etc., were resolved through
discussion with the Project. Comprehensive site visits were carried by the task team during the
MTR.

55.   Safeguards and fiduciary policies were monitored closely and were addressed in a timely
manner. Financial management and procurement activities were constantly monitored ensuring
                                                -16-
that they continued to be maintained in a satisfactory manner at all times. Aide memoires were
descriptive and well-written. The ISRs appropriately reflected the situation on the ground. The
Bank also agreed to provide Additional Financing to overcome the financing shortfall and
assured that adjustments were made to indicator targets as relevant. In view of the above, the
ICR rates the Bank’s performance during supervision as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

56.     The Bank’s satisfactory performance during both lending and supervision phases justify a
satisfactory rating. Looking at the series of PWPs in their entirety, the option for the Bank was to
support the Government to mitigate short-term effects of the adjustment program on the
country’s most vulnerable population. Supporting a third phase proved not only to be very
effective in generating short term employment, but also in providing much needed basic
infrastructure services in poor, remote areas of Yemen.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57.     Government performance is rated satisfactory. The fact that the Project attracted so much
international interest and donor funding is sufficient testimony to its success. The engagement of
various ministries through the SC meant that sub-projects in all sectors are fully operational at
project closing and that risks to sustainability have been minimized. Co-financing has been
provided on time. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of decision as to the future status of
the PMU at project closing, following the recommendations of the PWP-PMU study.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

58.      The project was implemented by a well-established, capable and dedicated Project
Management Unit (PMU) which reports to a Steering Committee (SC) chaired by the Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation and with the Director of the PMU serves as its Secretary.
The PMU has been in place for over 16 years and has proven to be one of the best performing
PMUs in the country. It is fully familiar with the Bank’s fiduciary policies and safeguards and
has a well-tested and functioning MIS; a well-established M&E system to measure results and;
an efficient management structure that has the capacity to work effectively and deliver quality
works and results. The PMU adequately carried out the required fiduciary, legal and safeguard
activities (technical, audits, participation to post-procurement reviews) and responded effectively
and in a timely manner when required to take on additional responsibilities when the need arose.
Action plans/work programs were mostly fully implemented and followed through within the
agreed time frame after each supervision mission. The PMU introduced E-management in 2009
to allow the beneficiaries and contractors to follow up sub-project request status and payments,
reducing staff time on communication while at the same time increasing transparency. Much of
the project success is attributed to the sound leadership and drive of the key members of the
implementing agency; the low operating cost also testifies to the efficiency of the staff and


                                                -17-
management. Finally, the PMU provided a high-quality project completion report, which is
included in full in Annex 7.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

59.      Overall Borrower performance takes into consideration both the Government and the
Implementing Agency’s performance during preparation and implementation. On the basis of the
justification provided above, the Borrower’s overall performance is rated Satisfactory. The
Borrower complied with all covenants and agreements towards achieving the development
objectives of the Project.

6. Lessons Learned

60.     The lessons derived from the Project can be summarized as follows:

61.      Involving communities in sub-project selection and design assured community
ownership and participation, which led to strong resilience in the face of a volatile country
situation. Having developed a strong bond with communities they have become more
responsive, proactive in participating in the project cycle and have proved to be very capable of
managing O&M of most types of sub-projects, including during periods when the government
has not been present, as evidenced by the transitory financing of schools by communities.
Coordination with local councils at early stages of the project cycle yields positive results in
avoiding duplication of services provided by various implementing agencies, enhances their
institutional development, consolidates decentralization and improves sustainability of projects.

62.      The PMU proved to be highly useful, versatile and scalable project delivery
instrument, assuring continued adherence to improved criteria and objectivity in selection.
In a country such as Yemen, where political influence is difficult to avoid, the PMU was able to
successfully adopt a decentralized implementation mechanism (selection of subprojects on well-
established and clear criteria) which shielded the communities and the implementation unit from
political interference. Keeping the number of staff as limited as possible and using local
consulting firms and individuals during high peak workloads allowed the PMU to adjust to
fluctuations in workload. The structure could be scaled up with more branch offices. The
autonomous status of the PMU enabled it to take appropriate measures at times of crisis that
facilitated continuation of its operation that would otherwise have created stagnation, havoc and
endless litigation. This in particular, refers to flexibility in transferring funds from community
contribution account. The effect is further maximized by having government agencies play a
supporting role of facilitator to PMU.

63.    M&E has been developed to a high level of effectiveness through continued
incremental improvements over the three PWPs and a specific focus on baselines and
regular follow-up in the field. The successive PWPs have demonstrated the importance and
usefulness of reporting on results, and consequently attracting additional funds to a performing
concept. The development of a specific M&E department allowed the PMU to integrate M&E
aspects as part of project management and sub-project supervision. The improved data allowed
PWP-3 to select sub-project types based on sustainability, labor content, and cost per beneficiary,

                                               -18-
and to improve technical designs, all essential to maximizing development impact. The next step
is to report regularly on indicators broken down by gender; this is being taken into account for
the next phase of PWP – the LIPWP.

64.    The sub-project selection, design, and tendering process can be used to maximize
employment and maintain low investment and maintenance costs. The Project continually
used improved data to select sub-project types with high labor content, such as stone road paving
and rain water harvesting. With 40-60 percent labor content, these sub-project types can play an
important role in absorbing sudden unemployment in times of crisis, while at the same time
reaching a large number of beneficiaries per dollar. Moreover, the PMU has modified many
technical design aspects, lowering O&M costs, e.g. provision of roof rainwater harvesting for
schools and low cement techniques for stone paving. Transparent procedures and timely payment
have had a significant impact on reducing unit rates. While the unit cost of construction inputs
increased significantly, PWP still maintains its competitive edge through transparency in the
bidding process and simple and timely payment procedures combined with contractors
confidence in the PWP management built up over 16 years.

65.     Long-term engagement and incremental improvement to a strong design can lead to
improved sector performance. The demonstrated success of the PWPs is what led to strong
donor commitment and significant leverage on results. Transparent procedures for selection of
contractors and consultants, combined with support to building up the construction and
consultancy industry, led to increased competition, better quality of works, and lower costs.
SMEs can enter the market and perform satisfactorily and abide by procedures given the right
supportive set-up under national competitive bidding that can enforce these procedures,
including the use of local unskilled workers. Moreover, from time to time, the PWP conducted
training to enhance consultant skills in specific and critical areas especially those concerning
environmental issues. Over time, the PWP has (since PWP-1) built a sizeable data base of
consultants that is being continuously updated through registration of new consultants, thus
giving equal opportunities to all those interested, while at the same time expanding the pool from
which competent and experienced consultants in various fields such as design and supervision of
complicated sub-projects can be drawn.

(e) Other Donor Financing:

66.    In addition to achieving the development objectives, the Project was also designed to help
Government attract additional funding from various donors. In this respect, the Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) was successful in securing donor financing.
During the processing of PWP-2, a co-financing target of US$40-50 million from donors was set.
The Government however, ended up mobilizing around US$53 million. While no such target
was set for PWP-3, the Government succeeded in raising US$303 million from various donors.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

67.    The objective of this annex is to assess the economic viability of the most significant
investments carried out by the PWP-3Project in social and economic infrastructure. About 75
percent of the total investments of PWP-3 in community infrastructure were made in the
education and water sectors through primary and middle schools (to increase enrollment rates),
as well as in water supply systems (water harvesting) in rural areas with no access to water. As
part of the economic assessment, this analysis estimates the ERRs and the NPVs of such
investments in order to determine their economic acceptability.

Summary of Costs and Benefits
68.     Costs: PWP-3’s investments covered seven different types of public works that were
implemented under component 1(“Community Infrastructure?). This component represents 90.5
percent of the Project’s total investment. It includes: the construction and expansion of schools
(US$41.3 million), water harvesting (US$18.8 million), water and sanitation systems (US$6.4
million), road paving (US$10.1 million), vocational training centers (US$1.4 million), and the
rehabilitation of health units (US$2.4 million). Considering the availability of relevant
information, the overall ERRs and NPVs have been computed for all school sub-Projects as well
as for all investments on water harvesting tanks in small villages. As mentioned above, these
investments cover 75 percent of the total investments of PWP-3.

69.     The analysis also focused on those investments for which the direct benefits are both
quantifiable and relevant for the purpose of this analysis. Therefore, this task excludes
investments in Component 2 (which refers to TA through consultant services for Project
preparation and supervision), as well as Component 3 (which covers PMU’s management and
operational/staff costs). The benefits of these types of investments costs are usually
unquantifiable and, hence, are not included in this analysis. These investments are equivalent to
about 9.5 percent of the Project’s total cost.

70.     Benefits: The Project contributed to the improvement of the quality of life of over
2 million low-income people. The most important population groups include about 256,000
children who were able to enroll in basic education, direct jobs created generated 118,000 work
months, women and children benefited from additional health units, and 421,000 3 rural residents
(mostly women and children) benefited from the new water harvesting schemes.

(1) Rural Elementary Schools:
71.    Objective: The PWP-3 built and expanded elementary schools (of about six classrooms
each) in rural villages, in order to assist in the effort to improve enrollment capacity in basic
education to cover 256,000new students, as part of both the overall and long term strategy for
poverty alleviation, as well as part of the goal of employment generation.

 The economic analysis was carried out on preliminary results as of December 31, 2011. The
actual final number of beneficiaries from water harvesting is 455,000.

72.     Without Project Scenario: There is a global consensus that universal access to basic
education is the right of each child, which poses enormous challenges particularly in Yemen that
is the poorest country in the MNA region. Yemen’s population is scattered among 41,800
villages with 74 percent of the population living in settlements of less than 5,000 people. The
overall quality of education remains poor and indicators are well below regional averages. For
instance, until recent years, only about 48 percent of the Yemeni adults were literate.

73.     A significant number of schools are still characterized for being overcrowded and same
temporary ‘solutions’ currently include, the use of mosques, tents, or shade areas provided by
trees. This situation is more critical in the rural areas than in the cities. Therefore, there is not
only a critical need for new rural schools/classroom, but also for the renovation of existing ones.
Most of PWPs involvement on school construction has been in small villages, and only in a few
cases new classrooms have been built in some urban areas.

74.     With Project Scenario: The goal was to improve enrollment capacity (students per year)
in yearly targets to reach an overall net increase of 200,500new enrollees. The actual enrollment
result (at the end of PWP-3) was 256,000. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is involved with
Project coordination, designs and school locations. The minister of education is a member in the
PWP’s steering committees. All activities regarding schools were handed over to the branches of
the MOE that worked in coordination with the local councils and the communities to ensure
proper O&M – as it has been done in previous PWP operations.

75.     Cost: In addition to the investment cost and the associated incremental recurrent O&M
costs, the analysis also took into account the private costs of attending school. These yearly costs
included both the expenditures that families needed to incur (such as school fees, books and
supplies, uniforms, transportation, etc.), which was estimated at US$4.00 per pupil; as well as the
relatively small opportunity cost (i.e., the forgone earnings) of middle and secondary students,
which was calculated at US$16.004 annually per student. In practice, it should be noted that both
public and the private costs per student usually turn out to be larger due to the system’s internal
inefficiencies (wastage) in the normal school cycle, which are generally reflected in the yearly
high rate of repeaters and dropouts (as estimated below in Table 3).

76.     Benefits: Basic education is instrumental for poverty alleviation because it is an
important channel for improving earnings for low income groups. However, the typical low
return to primary education indicates that continuing to provide a poor quality primary education
is inadequate for alleviating poverty. Therefore, the goal in the medium term includes not only
the improvement of coverage and quality, but also facilitating access to junior secondary
education, and in particular promoting girls education.

77.     In addition, the improvement in internal efficiency gains, through lower repetition and
dropout rates, could have significant financial savings (for both the government and the
families), as it would take fewer years of schooling to produce a primary school graduate. Also,
the nationwide positive externalities of basic education continue to provide ample public finance

This yearly amount is equivalent to about 2.3% of the average yearly income in Yemen, which is estimated at approximately
US$680 dollars.

justification for supporting universal basic education with public investment funds. Furthermore,
basic education is recognized as an essential precondition to improve workforce quality and
productivity, which contributes to Yemen’s developmental potential.

78.     Methodology: The usual economic assessment methodology relies upon household
(labor force) surveys to provide data on wages, levels of education, and occupations to determine
private rates of return to education. This generates a private income stream that can then be
combined with costs of education to estimate the internal rates of return. In Yemen, a household
survey on level of income and years of education has not been recently undertaken that could
provide the data for an economic analysis. For this reason alternative empirical information
sources on expected earnings have been used, as reported below.

79.    Also, the recurrent cost of education (as mentioned above) generally includes school fees,
books, transport, uniforms, etc.; these costs generally are determined in household consumption
surveys, of which there is not any in Yemen on rural population that could offer this type of data.
Considering this limitation again alternative sources of information have been used.

80.     The stream of net economic benefits of the overall investment in schools was computed
as the difference between the cash-flows of costs and benefits, “without? and “with? the Project.
Such cash-flows were discounted using a 10 percent rate. The economic analysis converted
financial prices into economic prices in order to correct for price distortions due to market
imperfections. This was done by applying the standard conversion factor of 0.9. Taxes and duties
were removed from financial prices, as these are not real costs in the economy, but rather a
transfer of financial resources from the private to the public sector.

81.      Main Assumptions: In summary: (i) internal inefficiencies have been recognized, that is,
not all students who entered the system were expected to finish school on time. Based on
international empirical data for similar socio-economic environments, promotion from one grade
to the next was estimated at about 90 percent, repetition was assumed at 8 percent and dropouts
at 2 percent of the student population; (ii) no more than 50 percent of the graduates from six-year
primary school are expected to continue into the next three-year cycle of middle/junior school;
(iii) graduates that enter the labor market are assumed to be employed throughout the analyzed
time period, and (iv) wages in real terms are assumed to remain constant during the period of
analysis. The empirical results of the assessment of the internal inefficiencies (reported in Table
3 below) were applied for the computation of the overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and
the NPV.

82.    Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV): Under the above
assumptions, the results indicate that the expected ERR for the investments in education is about
17.2 percent (Table 4) and the net present value of the net benefit is US$128 million, at a
discount rate of 10 percent. These results are consistent with the empirical evidence of the ERRs
for comparable sub-Projects which fluctuate between -2.9 percent and 29.2 percent. Based on
these empirical results, it may be concluded that the proposed investment in new
schools/classrooms is economically viable. The results of this analysis are included in Table 4
below.

(2) Rural Water Harvesting Schemes:
83.     Objective: The main objective of these types of subproject was to provide small scale
infrastructure to channel and accumulate rain water for human consumption in villages that lack
this type of infrastructure. Such water reserves are designed to meet basic minimum
consumption of water during the periods of water scarcity associated with the dry season.

84.     Without Project Scenario: Those villages that lack water reserves have primarily had to
depend on water from other jurisdictions; that is either transported by family members who, in
some cases walk up to 7 hours, or have to buy it from water-tanks-trucks that regularly come to
these villages. Given these circumstances per capita water consumption per day is very low. In
these jurisdictions average water consumption, for all daily uses, may be 20 liters per capita or
less.

85.    With Project Scenario: Over forty villages were selected to benefit from the
construction of water harvesting tanks, which on average have a capacity to store 4,500 cubic
meters. The selection was based on their actual needs and the commitment of their communities
together with the local district councils to assist in their construction, maintenance and operation.
The actual benefits of this new infrastructure were planned to gradually begin in FY05 and were
expected to be completed by the end of FY10. The economic benefits have been evaluated for a
20 year period – though the life-time of this infrastructure will be substantially much longer.

86.     Economic Cost: The total cost of the water harvesting schemes includes the investment
cost and the relatively small operation and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with this
particular type of infrastructure by design. The actual investment cost in financial terms has been
estimated at US$18.7 million dollars. The average investment per harvesting tank is about
US$120,000.

87.     The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of these schemes were equivalent to about
0.2 percent of the investment cost. Maintenance work was assumed to have taken place three
times per year, which includes mainly labor. Financial costs were converted in economic cost
applying the standard conversion factor. The details of the flow of yearly incremental economic
costs for these investments are illustrated in Table 5 below.

88.    Economic Benefits: Other than the temporary employment generated by the construction
of water harvesting schemes, the most important lasting benefits emerged from savings in water
expenditures by community residents. The situation “with? the Project in practice eliminate the
opportunity cost of the time of community residents who would have needed to travel relatively
long distances to transport water back from other villages. Though these additional benefits have
occurred, this economic analysis has focused in the net benefits directly related to the savings in
family budgets due to substantially lower water-expenditures “with? the Project. Therefore, the
estimated ERR may be considered a conservative indicator of the actual benefits.

89.    Methodology: The calculation was based on the difference between expenditure in water
“without? and “with? the Project for the expected daily water consumption per capita. The
annual streams of savings were calculated on the basis of the economic value of savings in water
expenditures (SWE). As noted above, the yearly estimates of SWE assumed an average water


                                                -31-
consumption of 20 liters per capita per day during the dry season, which was expected to last on
average about four months per year. In order to estimate the SWE it was estimated an amount of
YR 4.0 “without? the Project, which corresponds to the current average price per liter of water
sold by water-truck vendors and the average price per liter of water of YR 0.5 that was charged
at the harvesting tanks once they entered into operation.

90.     Economic Rate of Return (ERR): As illustrated in Table 5 below the estimated ERR is
108 percent which, as expected, is highly robust considering that water is relatively scarce
natural resource in most rural areas of Yemen. This is consistent with an NPV of 38.7 million.

91.      A sensitivity analysis was performed under the scenario of lower benefits in 25 percent
(i.e., lower water consumption from the new water harvesting schemes due to an unexpected dry
season). Assuming benefits lower in 25 percent the ERR is 28 percent (Table 6 below), which
makes these investments still economically justifiable and still greater than the opportunity cost
of capital, at about 10 percent. The NPV, in consistency with the above results, is positive and
fairly significant (US$17.7 million). Based on these solid economic indicators the overall
investment in water harvesting infrastructure was economically acceptable.

(3) Summary of the Economic Analysis:

92.     Considering the relative importance of the different type of public works executed by the
Project, the economic analysis has focused on the investments in the construction and expansion
of schools/classrooms (that benefited 256,000 new students), and on the investments in water
harvesting schemes (that benefited 421,000rural low income population). These two types of
investments represented about 75 percent of the total investments of PWP-3. The overall ERRs
for classrooms and water harvesting schemes are 17.2 percent and 108 percent respectively;
confirming the economic viability of these investments. These results are consistent with the
overall NPVs for schools and harvested water of US$128 million and US$38.7million,
respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis for water harvesting schemes considered
shorter rainy seasons, revealing that despite a 25 percent drop in benefits, the ERR for the water
schemes of 28 percent is still greater than the opportunity cost of capital, and it is supported by a
robust NPV of US$17.7 million.

93.      The financial impact of the above investments primarily impacts the respective sectoral
institutions and the direct beneficiaries who are all expected to contribute to their O&M. The
financial impact on the users is primarily reflected on user charges for water consumption and
voluntary contributions to school maintenance. For instance, beneficiaries of water harvesting
schemes will pay on average YR0.5 per liter of harvested water, rather than the current YR4 per
liter to the private water-truck vendors, which will constitute a net positive financial impact in
favor of the consumer, equivalent to average savings of about YR3.5 per liter of water.

94.    An explicit criterion in the design of the sub-Projects financed by the PWPs has been that
their O&M costs be low and affordable for the targeted beneficiaries. The ability and willingness
of the beneficiaries to operate and maintain these sub-Projects, was assessed during the
evaluation of subproject proposals to ensure compliance with established criterion, including
sustainability. The Projects built continue to use technologies that facilitate their financial
sustainability through the use of designs and construction designs that have low O&M

                                                -32-
requirements. This is particularly the case in subproject of water supply schemes (and in
improved access through stone paving).

95.    The main fiscal impact of the PWP-3is in covering the recurrent cost requirements for
O&M of additional classrooms for existing schools. The additional classrooms delivered are
spread all over the country, and they are unlikely to constitute a significant financial/fiscal
impact on any particular community and/or local government. The ex-post evaluation of similar
sub-Projects indicates that O&M has been handled adequately with few exceptions. The
processes for ensuring adequate O&M arrangements before implementation have contributed to
successful operations.

                                 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


96.     In 2007, a Socioeconomic Impact Assessment Study was conducted. Sampling
Procedure/Technique: Multi-stages stratified random sampling (stratification against type of sub-
projects, status of sub-project and Governorates) was used to draw 15 percent of the total completed
and that were under implementation sub-projects. Accordingly, the size of the sample was 46 sub-
projects, which were randomly selected from all sub-projects in a proportional manner according to
the number of each type of sub-projects (health, education, water; etc.) from the size of the
aforementioned sample (46 sub-projects). A ratio of 1/3 of the sample (15 sub-projects) was drawn
from sub-projects that were under implementation according to weighted average of sub-projects
types; whereas the remaining 2/3 (31 sub-projects) of the sample was selected from the completed
sub-projects according to weighted average of sub-projects types.

Summary of Main Findings

97.      The study reached the following conclusions, based on the results achieved until 2007:

•     The total number of beneficiaries is 2,218,370 beneficiaries, distributed among 21 governorates,
      in 7 sectors. The average number of beneficiaries from each sub-project was 6,868 persons.
•     Compared with PWP-2, high level of efficiency is observed in allocation of investment during
      PWP-3 with regard to the number of beneficiaries, whereby for each sub-project increased from
      3,800 persons to 6,868 persons in PWP-3 sub-projects that are contracted until now, representing
      an increase of 81 percent. At the same time, the average cost of each project increased by 43
      percent, thus indicating high capabilities with regard to investment allocation during PWP-3, as
      compared with the number of beneficiaries.
•     The share of each beneficiary from the total investments is reduced from US$14.54 in PWP-2 to
      US$.14.3 in PWP-3 in spite of increase in the average investment cost by approximately 64
      percent. This is a positive indicator that reinforces judging PWP-3 efficiency with regard to
      investments distribution and reaching the maximum number of beneficiaries that serve the final
      objectives of PWP-3.
•     In comparison with PWP-2, the ratio of skilled labor increase from 34.7 percent to 39 percent in
      PWP-3, with a ratio of increase of 12.4 percent. Furthermore, the average ratio of direct and
      indirect work opportunities per sub-project is increased from 111 person/months to 141
      person/months, representing an increase ratio of 27 percent.
•     PWP-3 activities are in the construction industry, accounting for 6.6 percent of the total
      economically active labor force. Unemployment in this sector represents 26 percent, according to
      the 2004 census. Direct work opportunities generated by PWP-3 during the period covered by
      this study provided work opportunity lasting a period of 7.4 months for approximately 4,684
      workers. Taking into consideration that the average dependency per person with income is 7
      persons, thus the number of benefiting from the generating income is approximately 32,785
      persons.
•     The community contribution in the sub-projects' costs amount to US$2,100,832, approximately
      equal to 7 percent of the PWP-3 invested amount. In comparison with PWP-2, the ratio of
      community participation decreased from 10.7to 7 percent only, representing a ratio of decrease of
      approximately 34 percent.


                                                  -39-
•   The average monthly income of the unskilled labors in Phase III of the project increased
    compared with PWP-2 from 18,545 YR/month to 27,598 YR/month, representing a ratio of 48.8
    percent. At the same time, the average income of the skilled labors increased from 35,304
    YR/month to 61,851 YR/month representing a ratio of 75.2 percent. Analysis results, also,
    showed that average income of skilled and unskilled labors increased by 14.1 percent
    respectively, compared with their average income before the project. Such increase matches with
    the new wages policy, which resulted in wages increase and Alleviation of subsidies to oil
    extracted by-products and therefore had impacts on the general average of prices and wages.
•   The average monthly income of the consultant engineers improved significantly by 87 percent.
    Their monthly income increased from US$231 per month to US$432 per month. This increase
    contributed in improving the living conditions of engineers significantly for a ratio of 15.4
    percent and to some extent for a ratio of 61.5 percent and slightly for a ratio of 23.1 percent of
    the engineers and consultants.
•   The conditions of 40 percent of the interviewed contractors improved significantly after working
    with PWP and conditions of 53.3 percent improved moderately; whereas, the conditions of 6.7
    percent did not improve as a result of the great competition among the contractors which lead to
    reduction of the bidding prices submitted by the contractors in order to secure the work.
•   Number and quality of education facilities had improved. Enrollment rate in basic and secondary
    education has increased for both sex (by 34 percent), total average increase was 57.6 percent for
    females versus 19 percent for males. Furthermore, assessment result indicated that the increase
    ratio in enrollment of female student was more compared with male, at 58.5 percent, 54.2 percent
    and 52.7 percent with regard to basic, mixed basic and secondary education, respectively.
•   Decrease in average ratio of students to the teachers from 60 students per teacher to 44 students
    per teach, which is indicator to improved teaching quality.
•   Education environment improved significantly, whereby the average density of student per class
    is reduced in both the basic and secondary education by 28.4 percent and 34.8 percent
    respectively. Thus, resulting in improving the comprehension of the students and capability of
    the teachers to render better quality of teaching. In addition, teaching aids are available, which
    include chairs, desks; etc. PWP-3 considered equipping schools with chairs and desks as a
    priority, which had a significant impact on improving education environment in primary
    educational institutions.
•   PWP-3also gave priority to construction of additional utilities (annexes) in implemented
    education sub-projects pertaining to construction of classes (new and addition/expansion), which
    include warehouses, laboratories, administration rooms, Toilets, and construction of fences in
    some schools, which had a significant impact in improving education environment in numerous
    educational institutions.
•   The study found that health indicators realized will, no doubt, lead to improvement of the health
    conditions within the beneficiary poor communities, in the long-run and will contribute towards
    improving post-natal life expectancy indicator and consequently improving human development
    indicator with regard to health. In addition, improvement of health conditions will contribute
    towards improving the production capacities of the communities and ultimately improve the
    living conditions, in general.
   Different services provided; more importantly are first aid and curing endemics, in addition of
    health enlightenment and awareness services, besides family-planning related services at a ratio
    of 22.2 percent each. In addition, the institutions provide medication for kidney diseases at

    11.1percent and other services, thus, emphasizing the large number of out-patients to the health
    sub-projects.
•   The total volume of water produced by the implemented water projects is approximately 5,790
    cubic meters, which in turn resulted in increasing the average share of water per capita by
    approximately 9percent annually.
•   Capacity of agricultural reservoirs totaled 9000 cubic meters. Agricultural sub-projects will have
    a positive impact on beneficiaries, regarding harvesting of water to be utilized in drinking and
    irrigation purposes and recharge ground and surface water and improvement of water resource
    use.
•   Positive environmental impacts of sanitation services on beneficiaries: Average distance between
    sanitation service and closest point to drinking source of water increased by (333 percent), which
    eliminated drinking water source contamination risks caused by waste-water, thus reducing soil
    and air pollution, unpleasant smell, diseases and infection (malaria, diarrhea, and skin diseases).
    Reducing water pollution and consequently minimizing risks of infection with diseases resulting
    from water pollution. Women and children benefited considerably from waste-water elimination.
•   PWP-3 implemented pavement of 1,360 linear meters, including 800 linear meter completed and
    560 linear meters ongoing, with an average width of 7.97 meters, thus, covering a total area of
    9,928 square meters. About 45 roads benefited in three governorates. In addition, approximately
    10,421 families benefited directly and 40,378 families benefited indirectly from the roads-sub-
    projects.
•   The number of vehicles using the roads increased by 75 percent due to facility of the movement,
    which also facilitated movement of people as a result of easy passage of vehicles on the roads.
    Various benefits gained: roads destruction reduced, elimination of stagnant water and
    mosquitoes, improved land and stores values surrounding the area. Garbage was also reduced and
    thus improving the landscape.
•   Pavement of roads also increased mobility of people/families and tourist on the paved roads. The
    residents indicated that the pavement contributed significantly in providing an aesthetical view to
    the region and improving environmental conditions, in addition to easy transportation of goods.
•   In general, the training programs provided by the Project for staff, consultant engineers,
    contractors and local communities proved to have positive effect at different levels such as on
    improving project design, supervision and implementation of sub-projects, the
    communities/beneficiaries participation and developing self-confidence on performing their roles
    as well which altogether contributed significantly to the project achievements. Staff and
    consultants have the technical capacity to further assist in the project in future. The objective
    related to local small contractors and consultants’ development was largely met. PWP-3
    conducted about 8 training workshops (2-14 days) in different governorates, covering all the
    subjects specified in PAD.
•   The study concluded that it is clear that the collaboration and/or coordination of the PWP-3 with
    other projects working in the same area(s) and having in the same/similar development
    activities/agencies and programs was sound and strong, especially with the IDA supported
    funds/programs work nationwide. Monitoring effectiveness was very systematic. Also, positive
    collaboration existed between PWP-3 and local councils, parliament as well as community
    members and all of them showed high satisfaction. This led to facilitate implementation of sub-
    projects.

•     Beit Al-Qanes, Manakha District, Sana'a Governorate: A beneficiary stated: “The subproject [a
      water harvesting scheme] has contributed to the reduction of emigration of individuals to the city.
      Before the subproject, eight families immigrated to the city due to shortage of water. In addition,
      coffee production has increased. We are now feeling safe with regard to water. We use water for
      drinking and for animals, and for cultivation of coffee and other crops.?
•     Suffering of farmers in Al-Husn, Al-Tayal District, Sana'a Governorate: “Our region is facing
      drought. Spring water started to cease and become dry. The ground water is very deep reaching
      1,000 meters and is also not suitable for drinking or cultivation. It contains a high ratio of iron
      and salinity. Doctors said that it results in dental problems to children. Nut trees are in course of
      extermination. Crops are minimal due to scarcity of water. This Project will help in provision of
      water and increasing productivity of nut trees and at the same time recharge spring water.?
•     An individual from Al-Ghoola Village, Dhibeen District, A'amran Governorate clarified: “The
      location of the school is in the middle of the adjacent villages, people in the village can now send
      their children to the school without being worried, and they may also permit their daughters to go
      to the school?

Background
101. The Government of Yemen requested the Bank to include the Public Works Project Phase III
within the 2002 CAS (for the period 2003-2005), in view of the immense and pertinent need for
basic infrastructure and community Projects especially in rural poor areas with high levels of
unemployment. This need continued to prevail in spite of interventions by several implementing
agencies. The PWP had registered over 14,000 requests for Projects from communities while it had
delivered just over 1400 during phase 2. The Project would support the CAS objectives of Improving
infrastructure, developing the human capital and granting social protection. These objectives were
also in line with the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP).

102. Several other justifications were stated such as demonstrated success and popularity of the
PWP, the highly efficient implementing capacity of the PMU as is evident from its excellent track
record in speed of delivery, reduced implementation periods and unit rates, competence and
dedication of the PMU staff, the constructive guidance and support provided by the Steering
Committee, and the streamlined procedures adopted, that all led to the Highly Satisfactory outcome
of the preceding operations (PWP-1 and PWP-2). Thus the Bank agreed to the Government’s request
to include a follow-on operation within IDA’s immediate lending priority.

1.1    Additional Financing
103. During 2005, the prices of building materials, fuel and labor wages increased significantly
resulting in overall increase in average cost of sub-Projects, leading to a reduction in numbers of sub-
Projects that could be financed under the Project. To enable the PWP to achieve original targets set
in the Results Framework and Development Objectives, an Additional Financing Credit 4419 was
approved during 2008 for an amount of SDR 18.8 equivalent to US$29.84 million.

2.0    Assessment of Development Objectives, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1    Higher Level / Original Objectives:
105. The Higher Level Development Objectives of the PWP III were consistent with the CAS of
2002 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that both aimed to contribute to several long
term objectives of strategic relevance to Yemen namely developing human capital, improving
infrastructure, achieving economic growth and granting social protection. Furthermore, the Project’s
design that focused on the poorer communities particularly the rural poor is in line with IDA’s
overall support for rural poverty alleviation which is based on: (a) comprehensive infrastructure and
service improvements (small public works, schools, roads, health centers); and (b) creation of
employment outside agriculture.

2.2    Specific and revised objectives (if any)
106. The specific development objectives as for previous Projects aim at poverty alleviation
measures targeted to the country’s poor communities. They specifically include (a) provision of
needed infrastructure to improve services and environmental conditions (particularly those affecting
women and children); and (b) creation of short term employment. To ensure sustainability seek to
ensure the sustainability of these measures through(a) community involvement in Project selection,
preparation, and implementation; and (b) the development of local contracting and consulting firms.

107. A detailed results framework was developed to monitor the Projects principal outcomes
which include (a) enrollment in schools (b) utilization of health facilities (c) beneficiaries of water
supply schemes (d) creation of short-term employment to improve livelihood/decline in population
below upper and lower poverty. Baseline date for the results framework was established based on the
Socio- Economic Benefit Impact Assessment conducted for PWP-2.

108. At the beginning of Phase III, significant comprehensive improvements were made for Data
collection tools for each sub-Project type that is entered in the MIS and covers detailed information
on sub-Project need, beneficiaries committees, socio-economic data, site specific data, environmental
checklist, etc. The aim was to enable better monitoring in selection of sub-Projects, reliable data for
reporting, data analysis and baseline data for conducting SIA at end of Phase III. The SIA was
scheduled to take place during 2011, but unfortunately due to the unforeseen sudden uprising/ civil
unrest during the same year the SIA could not be conducted.

2.3    Revised Objectives.
109. Due to the fact that PWP III is an extension to the previous two phases and the original
objectives are still very relevant and well defined, no revisions were made during course of
implementation of Project.

                                                  -45-
110. During the MTR conducted in 2007, it was agreed that the output and outcome indicators
originally targeted will not be achieved due to the significant increase in cost of construction inputs.
Thus to enable a realistic evaluation of the Project at completion, the targets were revised. The new
targets were in the range of 60% to 70% of the original targets, hence total number of SP reduced
from 700 to 490, while no of jobs to be created from 90,000 work months to 60,000.

111. Soon after the MTR, the Bank took the decision to grant an Additional Financing Credit in
order for PWP III to scale-up the outputs and outcomes to their original targets thus achieving its
Development Objectives.

2.4     Critical Assumptions and Risks involved.
112. Within the PAD, several critical assumptions were made with adequate mitigation measures.
Below is brief description of how the PWP overcame the risks:-

2.4.1   Appropriate selection of subproject with high labor content.
113. The average Labor Content achieved reached 34.5 % higher than envisaged at Project design
of 30%. The increase can be attributed to several factors. In addition to the rigorous selection
process, almost 35% of all sub-Projects implemented are in stone paving and water harvesting where
the labor content ranges between 40-60%, implementing sub-Projects in remote rural areas where
implementation is highly labor intensive and improved reporting on labor wages.

2.4.2   Construction costs to be maintained at competitive rates.
114. The hike in construction costs since 2005 has affected the construction industry as a whole.
The average cost of sub-Projects has increased from US$60,000 as estimated during Project appraisal
to US$110,000. The PWP still maintains its competitive edge through transparency in bidding
process, simple and timely payment procedures, contractors confidence in the PWP management that
has now spanned over 15 years, number of bidders per sub-Project are still high, on average 7.5
bidders per sub-Project resulting in its rates being among the most competitive.

2.4.3   The capacity of PMU to adjust to output requirements.
115. The autonomy and flexibility the PMU has enabled it to adjust its human resources needs as
and when needed. During implementation peaks, additional staff (as consultants) has been recruited
to assist in sub-Project preparation and implementation supervision. Furthermore, to cope with the
increase workload arising from additional sources of finances, during 2008, the PMU was
restructured to include a Third Area Manager and branch offices were increased from 6 to 10; a new
M&E department and a Design & Review unit. The new structure allowed for a well-balanced and
efficient performance of the PMU whereby it could manage between 450–500 ongoing SP at the
same time and disburse a monthly average of US$ 6 million from all donors.

2.4.4   Timely allocation of local counterpart funds.
116. The Ministry of Finance allocates annual budget for counterpart funding based on PWP
liquidity forecasts. The funds are then transferred on a timely basis upon PWP completion and
compliance with all necessary supporting documents.

2.4.5   The use of consultants with adequate competence.
117. The PWP has overtime (since PWP-1) built a huge data base of consultants that is being
continuously updated by allowing registration of new consultants, thus giving equal opportunities to

                                                  -46-
all those interested, while at the same time expanding the pool from which competent and
experienced consultants in various fields such as design and supervision of complicated sub-Projects
can be drawn out. Moreover, from time to time the PWP conducts training to enhance consultant
skills in specific and critical areas especially those concerning environmental issues.

2.4.6      Future of the PWP/PMU
118. During 2008, the PWP conducted through international consultant a study on the future of the
PWP. The outcome of the study entailed several recommendations among which to transform the
PWP into a permanent institution namely Public Works Fund. An excerpt from the study is hereby
quoted5“Given the current position and role of the PWP in Yemen, its high and unmatched levels of
efficiency and effectiveness and its relevance within the Social Safety Net, making PWP a permanent
institution within the State of Yemen is not a dream or luxury but an urgent necessity. The Final
Report of the study undertaken recommends, therefore converting the PMU of the PWP into a
permanent entity. For reasons of convenience and as long as final decisions have not been made, the
study neutrally refers to such a permanent entity as ‘the Public Works Institution’ or PWI. With the
moral and political support of Yemen Governments and its donors, members of parliament and other
stakeholders, the (PMU of) the PWP can successfully and painlessly be transformed to a permanent
institution, with the potential to significantly contribute to the objectives of Yemen’s Social Safety
Net in the coming decade. Considering the available options and their (dis)advantages, the study
concludes that the most realistic option seems to be to transform the current PWP and its PMU in
order to establish it as a Public Fund?.

119. With formation of the new reconciliation government, most members of the Steering
Committee are new and the PWP intends to raise recommendations of the study once again for
discussion and appropriate decisions to be taken.

2.5        Quality at Entry.
120. The Project design took into consideration the importance of quality at entry parameters that
are prime determinants of successful development outcomes. The Project’s higher and specific
objectives and their relevance (being the main parameters) are consistent with the CAS of 2002,
2006 (for AF) and the PRSP. The Project design took into account experience and lessons learned
during previous phases in terms of implementation arrangements, technical, financial and
procurement aspects. Risks and assumptions were all realistic and measures taken to minimize them
were appropriate, such that, as mentioned above all risks were adequately mitigated. Adequate
baseline data was made available for the results framework to ensure satisfactory monitoring and
evaluation. In compliance with Bank’s safeguards policies, comprehensive environmental
management plan was put in place that took into account need for training and awareness for staff
and consultants involved. The highly efficient implementation capacity of the PMU as is evident
from its excellent track record in speed of delivery, reduced completion periods and unit rates, would
ensure minimal implementation risks.

2.6        Original Project Components.
121. The PWP III has three components that are the same for both the original credit (3859) and
the Additional Financing (4419) as follows:-



5
    Study on the future role of the PWP “Establishing the Public Works Fund November 2008?


                                                          -47-
(i).     Community Infrastructure: US$ 39.5 million + US$ 26.69 (IDA Financing only)
122. Community infrastructure includes small scale civil works for construction, rehabilitation,
and / or extension of infra-structure works in areas of rural and urban water supply and sanitation,
storm water drainage, flood protection, rural roads and sidewalks, schools and health centers, with an
average cost US$60,000, and implemented over a period of 6-12 months. Subproject will be selected
from proposals submitted by local communities and local governments according to a set selection
criteria and should have national coverage, with emphasis on poverty areas and above-average
unemployment rates They should also have a high labor content and include community
participation.

123. The PWP implemented 716 sub-Project with a total cost of US$ 80.35 million (including
government contribution) accounting for 89.5% of the total cost of the Project, creating around
118,000 work months at a total cost of approximately US$ 27.7 million, attaining a labor content of
34.5 %, more than the target set at 30%. All sub-Projects have been completed before the new
closing date of June 30, 2012.

(ii).    Technical Assistance: US$ 3.5 million + US$ 1.86(IDA Financing only)
124. Technical assistance and consultancy services for Project preparation, implementation and
capacity building of local councils and consultants and contractors and will include:- (i) assisting
districts (50) to carry out assessment of their infrastructure needs, their capacity for implementation,
preparation of medium term investment plan, assessment of sources of revenues and establishment of
management information systems; (ii) preparation of design and supervision, and (iii) carrying out of
a study on the future options for the PWP including the role of the PMU.

125. To achieve the above requirements for Technical Assistance, the PMU used the services of a
large number of well experienced local consultants. In total for IDA sub-Projects 522consultants
have been utilized out of which 206 are new. The PMU contracted the services of one International
Consultant to conduct the study on the future role or the PWP.

126. Consultants’ services were used for preparation of designs and tender documents mainly for
non-typical Projects such as water harvesting structures, conducting EIAs for environmentally
sensitive Projects, undertaking training for PMU staff and local consultants on a number of relevant
issues aiming at increase environmental awareness, community participation, supervision of Projects
to improve quality of works, and quality control of works.

(iii).   Project Management: US$ 2.0 million + US$ 1.29 (IDA Financing only)
127. Maintaining and further strengthening the Project Management Unit (PMU) including
financing of incremental operational costs of the PMU including training costs of the PMU staff.

128. The PMU has continued to perform in an efficient manner keeping its operational costs as
low as possible at 4.1%. This figure although within the budget allocation, is marginally higher than
in previous phases due to the general inflation in the cost of living, increase in fuel prices, office
rentals, etc.

2.6.1    Revised Components.
129. The DCA has a provision to provide Technical Assistance to about 50 districts in preparing

Accordingly the DCA was amended on July 19, 2007.

3.0      Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
3.1     Provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and environmental conditions
(particularly those affecting women and children); and creation of short term employment.
130. Overall PWP III, has achieved to a high degree all of its Objectives as originally set out in the
Project Documents in spite of numerous factors/events that took place since the beginning of the
implementation Phase (as detailed in paragraph 5.0.) Annex 1 shows comparison between the
Original, Revised and Actual targets achieved. Most indicators surpassed the revised targets. In
sectors where sustainability is difficult to obtain such as in health and water supply, targets are less
both number of sub-Projects and beneficiaries. There was a huge increase in indicator “enhancement
of income? compared to the baseline, that can be attributed to the high increase in inflation during
this period.

131. Including the Additional Financing, 716 sub-Projects are completed in all sectors benefitting
more that 2.3 million direct beneficiaries out of which 50% are females. 378 schools (2,000
classrooms) have been completed providing over 257,000 students (amongst which 50% are girls)
with appropriate education facilities especially in rural and remote areas. Similarly 188 rain water
harvesting sub-Projects have been completed benefitting over 456,000 beneficiaries in very remote
mountainous areas where women and girls are the prime beneficiaries, thus improving to a great
extent their living and environmental conditions. Out of the 10 vocational training centers, 8 are
specifically for women to enhance their market skills. Based on the study conducted on a random
sample of trainees, several benefits were noted mainly (i) Increase in income: (Out of the sample
surveyed, 55% of the sample indicated an increase in income by 25%, 23% of the sample by 50% ,
20% of the sample by 75% and 2% of the sample by 100%), (ii) increase in income is used for
improving standard of living such as contributing to family income, financing children to attend
school, provide clothing & medicine, (iii) improved awareness on health issues, (iv) availability of
new facilities built by PWP enabled centers to expand their activities & introduce other training
programs.

132. Based on data collected from Branch offices6 of random samples of schools (sample size
ranged from 10-30 schools) completed in various governorates (during preparation of the ICRR) the
following results were ascertained on increase in enrollment for IDA financed sub-Projects: In Ibb
girls enrollment increased by 40%: in Taiz the increase ranged from 25% to 30% for girls and 50%
for mixed schools, in Amran increase in girls enrollment reached 75% while for boys 32%, while in
Hajja & Saada girls enrollment increased by 160% while boys 115%.

133. Furthermore, with creation of 118,000 direct work months as short-term job opportunities
with an average monthly income of approximately 235US$, will have created several positive
economic impacts for the laborer’s families as a whole (average household size 6.4 persons) in the
form of improved food security / consumption smoothing, especially that since the increase in global
food prices exacerbated by the financial crisis there has been severe increase in numbers of food in-
secured people in rural areas. Second round benefits are also derived from the on job training that the
laborers gain to enhance likelihood of getting re-employed. In addition, at least 55,500 indirect jobs

infrastructure developed.

134. The most deprived segment of rural communities are the women and children who suffer the
most from lack of services, yet bear the highest burden of providing the basic amenities of daily life.
Improving access to basic services especially health, education and water benefits the whole segment
of the community, but in particular women and children accrue highest benefits from such services.
Besides the economical advantages gained from reduced cost of traveling, increase in incomes due to
increase in level of education (long-term benefit) improved health thus better output; there are
significant improvements in the general quality of life of rural communities especially women and
children. Over 85%of IDA financed sub-Projects were implemented in rural areas where rural poor
make up for at least 80% of total number of poor in Yemen, hence targeting areas with highest
incidence of Poverty. Thus the outcomes achieved are not only of high relevance to the DO, but also
support both the CAS the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) – viz., developing human
resources, improving infrastructure, achieving economic growth and granting social protection.

Analysis of the main indicators directly attributing to achievement of DO is as follows:

3.2     Community Participation:
135. In view of success community participation during the previous 2 phases it has once again
been made an important cornerstone in implementation and sustainability of subproject. Positive
experience gained in working closely with local communities that resulted in improved sustainability
of completed sub-Projects further consolidated imposing a minimum of 5% community contribution
in cash or kind as a Rejection Criteria for selecting sub-Projects.

136.     “The PWP-3 would build on the experience and momentum of PWP-2, while at the same
time laying a more consistent foundation for local governments and communities to maintain and
sustain investments made?. 7

137. Total Community Contributions in cash & kind reached 7.0% for IDA financed sub-Projects
while on overall for all Donors reached 8.6%. The efforts expended during Phases 1&2 reaped
fruitful results during Phase III whereby communities were more responsive and took responsibilities
seriously. Their willingness to cooperate extended not only in providing contributions, but also to
participate in a pro-active manner during the various stages of the Project cycle noticeably during
implementation and O&M stages. Awareness on the importance of their role has increased especially
in governorates where previously responses were very slow.

138. Phenomenon worth of mention is the cooperation of the communities (in some governorates)
in times of crisis where they took over operational expenses for schools by contributing to pay the
teachers daily wages, food and accommodation until MOE could resume its operations again.

3.3.1       Identification Phase.
139. As in previous phases the PWP received requests for sub-Projects from communities, local
NGO’s and local authorities. At the beginning of Phase III verification tools and reports were
improved to a large degree. This ensured that for each sub-Project, thorough surveys and reporting is
done that in addition to socio-economic data, details on site location, environmental checklist,
prioritization of the communities’ needs, and election of beneficiary committees who are later in-
charge of follow-up Project implementation, mobilization of contributions and O&M and
endorsement of the Local Authorities are all completed. Issues of Land acquisition, normally
contributed by the communities is also documented as part of this process.

3.3.2       Preparation Phase.
140. Communities through the elected committees may get involved in discussions on scope of
sub-Projects, but in particular for non typical sub-Projects such as water supply schemes, the PWP
has laid down comprehensive procedures starting from establishing a committee elected through
general elections and ensuring all segments of the communities are represented including women
before commencement of Project. This general committee is officially registered with the Min. of
Social Affairs to give it a legal status. Designs and technical issues are discussed with all members,
followed by signing an agreement / MOU between the PWP and the beneficiary committee, endorsed
by the Local Council and Governor that specifies obligations of each party. The agreement spells out
in detail, scope of the work to be undertaken, community’s contributions to the Project, its role in
facilitating implementation and obligations for operation & maintenance. Signing and endorsing the
agreement is pre-conditional to commencing implementation.

3.3.3       Implementation Phase.
141. Local Contractors from beneficiary communities are highly encouraged to participate in the
bidding process although no preferences are granted. Objective is for the communities to benefit not
only from the infrastructure but also from economic activities generated, especially that the
contractor is most likely to employ local labor. However, as the PWP strictly abides by the World

Bank Procurement Guidelines local contractors have to participate in tendering process and fulfill all
requirements. Numerous contracts have been awarded to eligible contractors from beneficiary
communities to implement sub-Projects in their own locality.

142. The PWP noticed increased awareness of communities during implementation, in coming
forward with their comments and views albeit their involvement in the supervision is on an informal
basis, they are encouraged to report to the PMU on any shortfalls by the contractor or supervising
engineers.

3.3.4   Operation & Maintenance Phase.
143. Communities play a pivotal role in the O&M of completed sub-Projects even those that are
handed over to line ministries / concerned agencies. The PWP has deeply consolidated its practices
with local communities through ensuring that they understand their role. Parents’ councils for
schools, beneficiary committees for water supply, rainwater harvesting, stone paving and sanitation
are established to either be the sole operators of the sub-Projects or follow-up and monitor concerned
agencies on O&M issues. This approach has yielded highly satisfactory outcomes for the
sustainability of completed sub-Projects.

3.3.5   Coordination with Local Councils.
144. PWP has continued and further consolidated coordination procedures established during
Phase-2 whereby Local Authorities (LA) are informed on Project objectives, selection criteria,
available funds and quarterly investment programs. During Phase III, it has become good practice
that all requests from the communities are also endorsed by the LA therefore reducing incidents of
same request being submitted to numerous implementing agencies. Furthermore the PWP has built a
very strong rapport with LA resulting in strong confidence, trust and credibility of the PWP at the
local levels, hence facilitating its operations throughout the Project-Cycle.

3.4     Development of Local Contracting and Consulting Firms.
145. The contracting industry has to a great extent benefitted from the development of small
contractors to undertake small scale works. In total for all three phases the PWP has contracted with
over 1800 contractors (out of which 871 from previous phases). During Phase III, including for all
Donors financing 1011 contractors have been contracted, out which 811 are new, indicating that
awarding of contracts is not limited to few contractors, but new entrepreneurs are encouraged to
participate. For IDA financed sub-Projects 469contractors have been contracted (at an average of 1.5
sub-Projects per contractor. Giving opportunities to small and un-institutionalized contractors to get
first hand on-job training under the guidance of competent supervision consultants to develop their
technical, administrative and financial skills including preparation of bids, understanding
procurement procedures, contractual obligation, compliance with specifications, improved quality of
works and best practices enables them to participate in tenders from different implementing agencies
and the private sector. An important addition to contractors obligations is compliance with the
Project specific EMP that has a number of items that the contractor needs to provide during
construction phase such as a temporary latrine, safety measures on site, including storage and
handling material, avoiding noise pollution, etc. Being engaged in such measures enhances
awareness that could be integrated in their skills.

146. They also get acquainted with transparent award and payment procedures that they may in the
future insist on the same from others. Quite a large number of contractors who worked with PWP’s
over the three phases have developed into large scale contractors working nationwide including the
Private Sector.

                                                 -52-
147. The PWP has, as in previous phases used the services of a large array of consultants from
short-term design & supervision to longer term consultants at the head office for such activities as
design review and tender preparations as and when needed. In total for all finances so far 1064
consultants have been contracted out of which 440 are new, while for IDA financed sub-Projects
522have been contracted out of which 206 are new consultants.

148. During Phase III, PWP focused on training consultants in several aspects, mainly compliance
with environmental issues related to the EMP, factors to be considered during design phase such as
site selection, design of rain water harvesting structures including additional environmental
mitigation measures, ensuring compliance by the contractor of EMP measures during construction
phase, and the importance of regular reporting.

4.0    Output by Components.
4.1 Community infra-structure.
149. In total 716 sub-Projects were implemented through IDA finance while for PWP as a whole it
is expected to complete 2470 sub-Projects, distributed geographically among all the twenty one
governorates in almost all the 333 districts. As for previous phases funds were distributed amongst
the governorates in accordance with the set criteria 50% based on 2004 population census, 30%
Poverty indicators (published by the CSO) and 20% according to remoteness and deprivation.

150. In total for both credits 91.5 % of all resources went for community infrastructure (89.5% for
civil works and 2% for school furniture), a true measure of the efficiency and transparency of the
PWP. Ensuring targeting the poorest communities resulted in 91% of all sub-Projects being
implemented in rural areas. On average, the PWP was able to manage 450-500 sub-Projects under
implementation at the same time. Although numbers reduced during 2011, it took all measures to
ensure implementing and supervising all sub-Projects even during times when for security reasons
access was extremely difficult. Quality of completed sub-Projects was satisfactory. This factor has
been enhanced with the regular the random quality control checks conducted by the M&E
department. IDA supervision Missions conduct regular site visits for a number of randomly selected
sub-Projects to assess appropriateness of investments / selection process and quality of delivered
works. Feedback in majority of the visits was satisfactory, while minor observations were rectified
and reported in a prompt manner.

151. Furthermore, result of diligent supervision and strict application of contractual clauses, total
amount of additional works reached only 1.8%, a figure that is rather low for a large number of
relatively small sub-Projects implemented in rural areas.

152. The education sector still occupies highest share due to the continued demand for school
building in the rural areas although quite a significant drop from Phase -2 ( 51.6% compared with
57%).

153. The rigorous screening to ensure strong commitment for O&M in place, as a prerequisite for
selection, has significantly reduced number of sub-Projects implemented in sectors of health, water
supply schemes and sanitation, while sub-Projects with low O&M requirements / and or have higher
sustainability have increased such as stone paving and rain water harvesting. In addition to the fact
that sub-Projects in these sectors are more labor intensive thus attaining higher score for selection.
Moreover the PMU has modified many technical design aspects to improve lowering O&M costs
such as provision of roof rainwater harvesting for schools to be used for toilets in the dry seasons,
low-water consumption flushing cisterns for school toilets, improved technique for stone paving
using small quantities of cement to allow growth of grass that reinforces the bonding, hence
increasing lifespan. In addition this technique renders the sub-Projects to have high labor intensity
averaging 60%.

154. Provision of school Furniture. All schools have been provided with combined school desks
and some schools with administrative furniture. In total 35,178 combined desks have been supplied
for schools financed by IDA.

Disbursement by Categories.
155. Due to increase in SDR rates versus the USD since beginning of Phase III from 1.437 at time
of signing DCA to an average of 1.51, total value of Credit 3859 (SDR 31.3 million) increased to
US$ 47.35 million as opposed to US$ 45.0 million, while Credit 4419 Additional Financing
decreased by approximately US$1.0 million from 29.84 during 2008 to 28.8 by end of 2011, as at
time of signing (during 2008), the SDR rate was much higher 1.587.

156. Government Contributions amounted to US$ 8.56 million i.e. 18% and US$ 4.7 million i.e.
16.3% for Credits 3589 and 4419 respectively.

4.2        Technical Assistance.
157. As mentioned under paragraph 3.4 above, the PWP has effectively used technical assistance
in the form of local consultants for numerous activities such as verification of Projects and site visits,
community mobilization, preparation of designs, conducting training workshops, environmental
assessments and supervision of sub-Projects on site.

158. With a total of 404 supervision consultants for 716 sub-Projects, average number of sub-
Projects per consultant is 1.8for IDA Credit. These figures indicate maintaining a balance between
giving opportunities to significant number of consultants while at the same time maintaining cost
benefit of awarding almost 2 sub-Projects to be supervised at the same time.

4.2.1      Support to Local Development Component.
159. To support of the Government’s strategy for Decentralization a budget of US$ 1.0 million
was allocated under Category for Technical Assistance to finance preparation of 50 District Plans
which included: assessment of their infra-structure needs, their capacity for implementation,
preparation of medium-term investment plan, assessment of sources of revenues and establishment
of MIS. Due to time and budget constraints it was agreed during the MTR to reduce the number of
districts to 20 distributed amongst 6 governorates.

160. In line with the MOLA National Strategy for Decentralization and the methodologies
adopted, plans for the 20 districts were completed, the teams at the district and governorate level
were trained and logistic support provided. The PWP also participated in developing training
manuals in particular the Gender & Environment that focused on Reflecting Women &
Environmental needs in the Development Plans.

4.3        Project Management Unit.
161. The PMU has continued to perform in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In spite of the
high inflation and increase in cost of living, its operational costs for both credits remained less than
budget allocation 4.1% as opposed to 4.4%. Staff have maintained high levels of motivation and


                                                           -55-
diligence, and has utilized experienced gained over the years to manage a much larger finance
portfolio for Phase III that reached over US$400 million compared to US$ 30 million and US$116
million during Phases 1 & 2. Disbursement capacity doubled from monthly average of US$3.0
million in Phase 2 to over US$6.0 million in Phase III, while sub-Projects under implementation
simultaneously averaged 450 to 500.

162. The high credibility, confidence and trust among its stakeholders have played an important
role in attracting additional sources of finance that have increased from six (6) Financiers in Phase 2
to seventeen (17) in Phase III. The diversified nature of the finances requiring interventions in non-
typical fields such as infrastructure and equipment of fish wealth sector, medical stores and
procurement of medical equipment, array of reporting requirements, posed a significant challenge on
management.

Improvements to the PMU.
163. During Phase III a number of developments have been made to the PMU to further enhance
and improve its management capabilities essential for coping with the large volumes of workload.

164.   These include:-


Restructuring the PMU Organization
•   The Steering Committee and the Bank approved the new organization of the PMU. The major
    changes included dividing the country into three areas instead of two, thus a third Area Manager,
    4 additional Branch Offices bringing them to ten, a Design and Review unit and Monitoring &
    Evaluation Dept.
•   The design & review unit’s objective is to enhance and expedite tender preparation process and
    reviewing designs for non-typical sub-Projects before tendering. The M&E objectives are to
    improve planning & monitoring of finances to ensure timely completion of individual Donor
    funds, monitoring status of activities in relation to implementation capacity, monitoring Actual
    disbursement against Planned, regular quality control of completed sub-Projects and under
    implementation. Improved planning for disbursement enabled to reduce deviations in recent
    IFR’s to (< -6%).
Further development of the MIS
•   The Management Information System can be regarded as the backbone of the PWP. To keep in
    pace with expansion of activities and additional workload, renders its continuous development an
    absolute necessity. During Phase III important developments undertaken include:-
•   Data Base was changed from Access to SQL Server and applications to Visual Basic
•   The MIS was linked to the Finance system to enable ease of data exchange
•   Addition of new modules for monitoring of commitments for individual contract, planning for
    IFR’s, monitoring design & review cycle.
•   Several improvements for reporting.
•   In addition the PMU was involved in preparation of specifications, procurement and installation
    of Software and Hardware for the fisheries and medical stores Projects activities that are not
    within its normal expertise.
Introducing Electronic Management System ( E-Management)
•   In order to improve its communication, simplify and expedite handling large quantities of
    correspondence & paper work, the PMU, since 2009 introduced E-management for its public

                                                 -56-
      services and internal administrative procedures. The system allows public to follow-up their
      needs such as request for sub-Project, payments, or any other correspondence on screen, thus
      allowing for staff to better utilize time that was spent on dealing with communication. The
      system allows for better monitoring and accountability by management on staff responses in
      handling issues.
Finance Department
•     The Finance department is now linked to the Loan & Grant MIS (LGMIS) established by the
      MoF, whereby payments to contractors, consultants, suppliers and staff are processed
      electronically from the PMU to MoF and hence the CBY. The system is extremely efficient, each
      payment can be followed up electronically, eliminating huge amount of paper work and manual
      follow up, hence reduced workload of the finance dept. to a large extent. Staff of the department
      received several rounds of training on using the system.
Capacity Building of PMU staff
•     Staff of the PMU received several training sessions on different aspects of sub-Project design &
      supervision with the objective of enhancing awareness especially those related to environmental
      issues in general, and in particular those related to rain water harvesting schemes site selection
      and incorporating mitigation measures in the design. Furthermore, after each supervision
      mission, sessions are held with sub-area managers and governorate consultants to brief them on
      feedback, recommendations and measures to be taken. Such feedback has played a positive role
      in improved staff performance. Several workshops were held to discuss the new improved tools
      for site data collection of the beneficiary communities, improved methodology for targeting poor
      and deprived communities, community mobilization, with particular attention to O&M issues for
      ensuring Project sustainability, selection of ideal site location for sub-Project implementation and
      coordination with local authority/local councils.
5.0      Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project.
165. By the end of Phase III, the PWP will have completed about 2470 sub-Project (716 being
IDA financed), benefitting a total of 6.5 million beneficiaries (50% females) all over the country. No.
of sub-Project implemented in rural area is over 85% (for all Donors, 91% for IDA Finances) where
incidences of poverty and unemployment are highest, at least 84% of poor live in rural areas making
poverty by and large a rural phenomenon.8

166. Total no. of Direct Jobs created reached 325,000work months (as of March 2012), with
additional indirect jobs estimated at 130,000 work months. With a dependency ratio (average
household size) of 6.4 over 2.9 million beneficiaries have benefitted from income gained. This is in
addition to the 2.3 million direct beneficiaries of infrastructure delivered.

167. Total disbursement up to Dec 31, 2011 reached US$ 296.3 million. In total, PWP managed to
announce 250 tenders out of which 32 are from IDA funds (25 Cr 3859 and 7 AF). No. of sub-
Projects under implementation simultaneously increased from around 200 at the beginning of Phase
III to an average of 450 – 500 during 2009 and 2010. The magnitude of individual sub-Projects from
some sources of finances reached over US$ 1.0 million with one going to US$ 2.5 million. The PWP
managed a diversified portfolio that included construction of hospitals, medical stores, fishing
loading centers, procurement of medical equipment, software and hardware tools. Total finances
during Phase III reached over US$ 400 million.

5.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation
168. Since beginning of the Phase III, several events took place in the country that had major
impacts on the implementation process namely:

Price increases in 2005
•     At the beginning of 2005 i.e. soon after announcing first few tenders( first tender was announce
      on Nov 2, 2004) prices of steel and cement increased by 60% and 100% respectively. Initially
      progress of works was very slow, some contractors refrained from signing contracts, number of
      bidders per Project was on average less than five that in turn led to significant increase in cost of
      sub-Projects.
•     In July of the same year prices of Fuel & Wages increased as well, that prompted the
      Government to decide to compensate contractors. A PWP-SFD joint committee was formed to
      assess the impact of increase in prices of building material, fuel and wages on construction costs.
      A very comprehensive study was conducted based on market survey of prices prevailing before
      and after the increase based on which a cabinet decree was issued on January 3, 2006 (Decree
      No. 7 for the year 2006) to compensate from Government Funds as follows:
Projects financed from local funds:
      •   Building works and Water Structures: 12% for works implemented after July 21, 2005
          according to the agreed implementation program i.e. delays will not be included; 3% for work
          items where cement is the main material.
      •   20% for road works excluding civil works items already included in above.
Projects Financed from Foreign Funds:
      •   Building works and Water Structures: 8% for works implemented after July 21, 2005
          according to the agreed implementation program i.e. delays will not be included; 3% for work
          items where cement is the main material.
      •   10.8% for road works excluding civil works items already included in above.

The Financial Crisis and Global Fuel Price Increase 2008
169. Again during 2008, the global Financial Crisis and increase in fuel prices affected cost of
construction inputs. As shown below, unit cost of Reinforced Concrete being the major construction
item was significantly high during 2008 and 2009, again increasing average cost of sub-Projects.

Average increase in Prices of Reinforced Concrete (Cost in US$ per Cu. M)

 Including Government Funds.

                                                        -58-
Civil Unrest of 2011
170. The civil unrest of 2011 imposed major implementation hurdles most important of which
were, initially severe shortages in fuel that led to sky rocketed prices in the black market, later during
the year, official fuel prices increased from YR75 to YR 175 per liter, lack of security that made
access extremely difficult, delays in completion of works, suspension by contractors or unwillingness
to continue with works and hence termination of contracts. Contractors were faced with severe
shortages and or increase in prices of all input materials in addition to labor shortages. The PWP had
to deal with and solve all arising issues/disputes on a daily basis under stressful circumstances and in
most instances on a case by case basis increasing workload to a large extent. Furthermore, all
contracts that are terminated needed to be re-advertised, and in order not to compromise on quality of
works, staff took all measures to ensure supervision and site visits are conducted by using all
available means of transportation, making security arrangements...etc. In all circumstances the PWP
continued to apply conditions of contract in a strict manner. To avoid the risk of high prices no
tenders were announced during 2011.

171. Lack of funds due to suspension by donors of replenishments was the most critical factor that
affected implementation and posed serious problems for the PWP. Contractors and consultants could
not continue to work without being paid their dues, many threatened litigation. The PWP took a risky
decision of transferring amounts from the Community Contributions accounts to cover immediate
expenses, later to be refunded once suspension is lifted.

172. Fortunately, sub-Projects under IDA financing had reached Substantial Completion, thus
were not affected as far as new commitments were concerned but delay in payments to contractors
posed problems for the PMU.

173. In addition to the increased period allocated for the Additional Financing, the above
mentioned events in all increased the overall implementation period of the Phase III from the usual
five to eight years; hence increase in overheads/ operational expenses that reached 4.3 compared to
overall operational costs of 3.02 for all three phases.

Disruptions in Replenishments
174. The PWP encountered disruptions / delays with its replenishments several times due to
change in locations of IDA Disbursement Department, first time when it was moved to Chennai –
India and later to Zagreb-Croatia. The process of familiarizing with procedures took a long time,
with large amount of correspondence being requested over and again until replenishments are
released.

175. Furthermore, suspension of replenishment by the Bank caused major constraints for the
PMU, whereby prior commitments to contractors, consultants and suppliers could not be met hence
having to respond to continuous complaints, communication, and to take measures to avoid
litigations.

176. Although the suspension letter stated that withdrawal applications received on or before Oct
26, 2011 covering payments for contracts made prior to suspension July 28, 2011 would be
replenished, PWP’s withdrawal applications sent during March & June of 2011 were not processed
until February 2012.



                                                  -59-
6.0    Sustainability & Environmental Issues.
177. Experience gained in the past has rendered sustainability the key issue during selection of
sub-Projects and commitments for O&M are thoroughly investigated. As in previous phases, Plan for
sustainability remained as one of rejection criteria in selecting Projects. The result of the rigorous
screening has reduced number of sub-Projects in sectors prone to problems of O&M such as health,
water supply and sanitation to 2.9%, 4.3% and 3.6 % respectively. Interventions in health sector are
limited to extensions and or rehabilitation, while sanitation was mainly in urban cities where
treatment system already exists or implementation of disposal and treatment sites are pre-condition
to selection. Furthermore, improved awareness and the pro-active role of local communities, early
coordination with local authorities and concerned agencies has improved to a large extent
sustainability of investments.

178. The Education sector has the highest rate of sustainability especially as almost all schools
selected replace existing schools functioning in temporary shelter, extension or rehabilitation where
operational budget is already available and the Ministry of Education branch office is involved in site
selection.


179. The designs of Rain Water Harvesting sub-Projects include several measures for ease of
maintenance that have largely improved sustainability such as introducing slow sand filters,
sedimentation traps and public taps for water collection, in addition to training of the beneficiary
committee on all aspects of O&M.

6.1    Environmental Improvements.
180. Phase III has seen a leap forward towards major environmental improvements, most
significant being increased awareness of staff and consultants, improvements in designs that will
mitigate negative environmental aspects such as introducing a roof rainwater harvesting tank in
schools for flushing latrines during dry season, design of low–consumption flush toilets, selection of
site for rainwater harvesting tanks to be above villages to ensure clean catchment area in addition to
adding sedimentation traps and sand filters; testing wells for quality and quantity in water supply
schemes led to rejection a large number of requests.

181. The PWP has introduced innovative designs for utilization waster water from treatment
plants. In flat land areas, treated water is conveyed in trenches / perforated pipes covered by gravel
and trees are planted along to avoid contamination of ground water. In mountain areas the treated
water is conveyed in closed pipes and used for irrigating large trees.

182. To ensure compliance of the EMP at all stages, IDA Supervision Missions requested Project
Specific EMPs’ matrices to be in Arabic for individual sub-Projects and to be distributed to all
concerned persons. Site specific EMP for the construction phase is annexed to the contracts of both
the contractor and supervising engineer and includes safety & hygiene on construction site.

183. The supervising engineer reports on all mitigation measures during construction in each
periodic report submitted to the PMU. The PMU and supervising engineer make certain that local
stakeholders are prepared to address the mitigation measures for the operational phase required in the
EMP prior to handing the Project over to the community.



                                                 -60-
6.2    Re-Forestation Activity.
184. Due to Yemen’s acute problem of deforestation, it was decided with IDA (during the
Supervision Mission of August 2005), that the PWP would pioneer to contribute to mitigate this
problem through adding a Re-forestation activity within its community infra-structure component.
The initiative is aiming at improving ecology and enhancing communities’ pro-active involvement in
protecting the environment.

185. An additional item has been added to the Bills of Quantities with specifications to select trees
most suitable for the locality. The idea is not only to replace trees that may need to be removed
during construction but to plant additional trees ranging between 50 to 200 around / in the vicinity of
each sub-Project implemented depending on the size. For IDA financed sub-Projects around 58,000
trees have been planted and 245,000 by all donors so far.

186. It is worthy to mention that this experience has prompted many other development Projects to
initiate similar activities. Also it has been commended as a success story several times in the Bank’s
supervision mission’s aide memoires and endorsement letters.

7.0 Bank & Borrowers’ Performance
7.1    Borrower’s Performance.
187. The Borrower represented by the MOPIC has as in the previous phases continued to support
PWP’s role as one of the main implementing agencies of the Social Safety Net. This role was further
consolidated through allocating government funds for implementing labor intensive Projects, fish
wealth sector and local government funds for Abyan Governorate. The PWP was also entrusted as
the implementing agency for Ministries of Education and Health for some Donor financed Projects.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of MOPIC and Chairman of the SC played a pivotal role in
mobilizing finance that reached over US$400 million.

188. The main reasons attributed to this staunch support are PMU’s transparency and honesty in
dissemination of information to all its stakeholders, unqualified audits reports, credibility with
beneficiaries that have in turn positive feedback. As in the past, the Steering Committee, and its
Chairman continued the excellent rapport, constructive guidance, exchange of views and their role
as facilitators.

189. The MOF has been cooperative in ensuring Counterpart funds were made available on time,
prompt payment of dues and streamlined and simplified procedures especially with introduction of
the Loan & Grants MIS.

190. Members of Parliament have also been very supportive of PWP in all aspects in particular
approving allocation of Donor funds. Overall, serious efforts were taken by all to facilitate successful
implementation of the Project.

7.2    Bank’s Performance.
191. The Project’s objectives are highly relevant to the countries urgent needs of Poverty
Reduction, consistent with the Government’s development strategy, the Bank’s CAS of 2002 and the
PRSP. To ensure achievement of DO, design of Phase III took into consideration quality at entry
parameters, risks anticipated and necessary mitigation measures were appropriate. Based on lessons


                                                  -61-
learned from previous phase, realistic targets were designed in terms of performance indicators,
financial management systems and monitoring.

192. IDA Task Team conducted regular supervision missions. Issues raised by the PMU were
addressed promptly, decisions and necessary actions were taken that supported and facilitated the
smooth implementation of the Project. The task team was extremely supportive at all times and
valuable input and feedback was given that contributed in major improvements especially those
concerning environmental aspects. Site visits were conducted that acted as check on quality of
deliverables, targeting of poor communities, extent of the need of investments made and their
sustainability. Again extensive feedback was given after each site visit that prompted PMU staff to
comply with suggestions and recommendations.

193.       The overall performance of Bank staff was Highly Satisfactory.

7.3        PMU Performance.
194. PMU staff continued with high performance levels, work ethics, and efficiency that enabled
them with nominal additional staff to manage 3.5 times more financing, hence workload compared
with Phase II. Levels of commitment and dedication have remained the same as in the past. The
PMU continued keeping up with its credibility with stakeholders especially beneficiary communities
who, due to the trust and confidence built helped in resolving a lot of conflicts and that could have
impeded progress, have become proactive in their contributions and sustainability issue. The PMU
has complied with all covenants in DCA and World Bank Guidelines. Progress & Audit reports of
the required standards have been submitted on time. Operational Costs have remained within
allocated original budget.

195. It is worthy of mention that based on the review of the PWP the Bank’s Quality Assurance
Group rated both the Development Objectives and Implementation Performance as Highly
Satisfactory. This was endorsed in the Director’s (MENA Region) letter of December 31, 2008.

8.0        Additional Information
8.1        Procurement Issues.
196. The Procurement department has undertaken several improvements such as archiving of the
complete dossier for each works, goods and services contracts, bid evaluation reports to include
number of bidders participated, comparison of unit cost of major work items, modification in tender
announcements to include bid security as lump sum and add note for requesting consultants
interested in supervision to register. Automation of all procurement procedures including linking
with the Accounting System has been completed, thus affording even higher transparency.

197. The PMU is strictly abiding with all World Bank guidelines for its procurement procedures.
After each supervision mission, post review is conducted and no issues have been raised. Due to the
improved procurement capacity Prior Review Thresholds were raised from US$ 200,000 to US$
300,000 for IDA Credits while for the SEDGAP10 Prior Review was fixed at US$ 1.5 million. For
Consultants services an improved QCBS is applied. Furthermore, staff have had rigorous on-job
training that has enabled them to handle diverse and in some cases rather complicated procurement
procedures for multi donors.



10
     Secondary Education Development & Girls Access Program.

                                                               -62-
198. In addition, repercussions of the 2011 civil unrest on contractual obligations imposed heavy
workload in dealing with complaints, applying contract conditions, terminating contracts and need to
re-advertising, settle disputes, etc.

199. Out of the 716 sub-Projects contracted, 582 were awarded to the Lowest Evaluated Bidder
i.e. 81.3%, 120 or 16.7% to the second lowest and 14 or 2.0% to the third lowest. In some cases the
PWP cannot award to the lowest bidder due to several reasons such as non- competence of the
contractor technically and / or financially, or if the contractor already has been awarded two or three
sub-Projects thus poses risks to award more. In some cases when sub-Projects are of rather
specialized nature the PWP stipulates in the ITB that the contractor should have experience in similar
Projects. For the 716 contracts, 469 contractors have been assigned i.e. on average 1.5 contracts per
contractor. Advantages of reducing number of contracts per contractor are affording opportunities for
larger numbers of smaller contractors to participate and minimizing risks in case of unsatisfactory
performance.

200. Similarly for the 716 contracts, 404 supervising engineers have been contracted i.e. approx
2.0 contracts per engineer. To reduce supervision costs sub-Projects within certain geographic
proximity are grouped together so that one engineer could supervise more than one sub-Project at the
same time.

8.2      Contribution to the National Water Strategy.
201. The PMU through its Water & Environment Unit actively participated in preparation of The
National Water Strategy. PWP’s extensive experience in rainwater harvesting played an important
role in convincing all actors in the water sector on its importance as one of the major available water
sources in Yemen. This led to incorporating rainwater harvesting in the Strategy, in addition to
include it in the inventory conducted for water coverage in Yemen. The water mapping will also
identify appropriate locations for water harvesting in addition to water supply through wells.

8.3      Audit Reports.
202. During Phase III, IDA finances were audited by four different external auditors, appointed
with approval of the IDA and the SC. Audit Reports have been submitted in a timely manner, no
discrepancies have been reported by auditors in management and accounting procedures, including
internal controls, and all other aspects. All Audit reports are unqualified.

9.0      Lessons Learned.
203. During implementation of Phase III, several key issues were addressed that can be regarded
as Key Lessons Learned, in addition to those from previous phases that are still relevant and useful
for consideration in designs of future Projects. They are summarized as follows:-

•     The Autonomous status of the PMU enabled it to take appropriate measures at times of crisis that
      facilitated continuation of its operations that would otherwise have created stagnation, havoc and
      endless litigation. This in particular refers to flexibility in transferring funds from community
      contribution account.
•     Flexibility of the PMU structure enabled to reduce capacity of staff when workload reduced.
•     Labor intensive works such as stone road paving and rain water harvesting create high numbers
      of jobs 50-60%, thus can play an important role in absorbing sudden unemployment in times of
      crisis.

                                                   -63-
•     Having developed a strong bond with communities they have become more responsive, proactive
      in participating in the Project cycle and have proved to be very capable of managing O&M of
      most type of sub-Projects. This aspect can be further consolidated in future Projects.
•     Several lessons learned from previous phases are still relevant to Phase III include:-
•     Government agencies can be supportive and play a positive role of facilitator to PMU’s that have
      proven to be efficient, transparent, built trust and deliver tangible results.
•     Transparent procedures for selection of contractors and consultants satisfy all parties concerned
      and reduce pressure and unqualified claims on the PMU.
•     Non Institutional contractors can perform satisfactorily and abide to procedures given the right
      set-up that can enforce these procedures.
•     Transparent procedures and timely payment has had a significant impact on reducing unit rates.
•     Coordination with Local Councils at early stages of Project cycle yields positive results in
      avoiding duplication of services provided by various implementing agencies, enhances their
      institutional development, consolidates decentralization and improves sustainability of Projects.
9.0 Assessing Performance in Selected Thematic Areas
9.1      Poverty Alleviation and other social Objectives.
204.     The major outcomes indicated the following:

205. Sub-Projects implemented have been targeted in areas of high poverty; over 85 % of Projects
implemented are in rural areas, where highest poverty prevails in Yemen. Districts with highest
poverty were targeted within the governorates.

206. The Project did not adversely affect indigenous people, nor cause involuntary resettlement.
All Bank’s safeguard policies were adhered to.

207. Gender Concerns: In selecting sub-Projects, the PWP gave highest priority to those
benefiting women, such as schools for girls, for all water Projects the main beneficiaries are women
& children, women training centers for income generating activities.

208. Environmental objectives: The Project diligently undertook environmental issues through
enhancing awareness of its staff, consultants working with PWP and local communities benefiting
from Projects. Screening of sub-Projects led to only those with positive impacts to be implemented.
Mitigation measures were seriously implemented and included in designs, and monitoring is still
being undertaken.

209. Private Sector Development Objectives: The PWP contributed to development of the private
sector through capacity building of local contractors and engineers, in many aspects of Project
implementation such as: tender preparation, understanding and complying with World Bank
Guidelines, complying with specifications, delivery of good quality on time and at minimum costs,
and increased environmental awareness. Quite a few initial small contractors have grown to large
scale contractors working for the Private sector. Similarly many local consultants have developed to
become consultancy firms.
