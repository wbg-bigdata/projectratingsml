MEKORANDUff AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMNT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 120.6 million (US$159.3
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a general education
project.  The project will be cofinanced by the Royal Netherlands Government
with a grant equivalent to US$14.0 million; and the Swedish Government with a
grant equivalent to US$14.0 million. Each will delegate administration of its
portion of the project to IDA, which will follow its own procedures. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) will provide financing equivalent to US$57.5 million.
The United Kingdom will provide a grant equivalent to US$5.7 million. The
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will provide a grant equivalent to
US$5.0 million. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will provide a
grant equivalent to US$10.0 million. The United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) will provide a grant equivalent to US$2.4 million. Each
will administer its portion of the project and follow its own guidelines for
procurement and employment of consultants.
2.       Background.  Education services are constrained by rapid population
growth, low expenditure levels and weak administrative capacity. Adult
literacy rates are under 30? and primary schools enroll only 60? of their age
cohort. Teachers are inefficiently deployed and student wastage rates are high
at every level. The very poor, especially females, are under-enrolled. In
1980 the Government began an increasingly effective program to address these
issues by renovating and constructing primary school classrooms to increase
access, and by recruiting women teachers to attract girls. Initial
improvements in quality and efficiency in primary education have been achieved
by providing textbooks for every student, in-service teacher training, and
increased supervision. The Government strategy is to achieve universal primary
education (902 of the age cohort) by the year 2000; to improve equitable access
by continuing to increase the number of female teachers and by using Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to supplement the capacity of Government
schools to reach girls and the very poor; to improve and expand in-service
training; to provide textbooks and teachers' guides; and to strengthen
supervision. It plans to extend its quality enhancement program to the
secondary schools by strengthening the examination system, curricula and
textbooks. A consensus on the strategy was developed among Government
officials, IDA and the donor community during the IDA sector review (Report No.
6770-BD) and subsequent project preparation missions.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has supported the GOB's sectoral
strategy as a major donor since 1980 with two successive primary education
projects, Credits 1054-BD and 1574-BD. The proposed project would continue
that support, building upon the foundation laid in the primary education
projects, and extending it to secondary education. While the previous projects
have been generally successful, as a result of lessons learned, the proposed
project would emphasize stronger project management, flood resistant school
designs, and more frequent field supervision. The proposed project would



- 2 -
coordinate and focus the support of seven cofinanciers. SIDA and DOTS will
finance supplementary supervisory services to provide full-tine project
monitoring for IDA and cofinanciers. 8
41
4.       Project Obiectives.  The project woulds  (a) increase equitable access
to primary and secondary schooling; (b) improve the quality of education at the
primary and secondary levels; (c) strengthen the management capacity of the
primary and secondary sub-sectors; and (d) prepare future policy options and
programs to reform the structure and financing of higher secondary and post-
secondary education.
5.       Proiect Description.  In line with the above overall objectives, the
project comprises three major componentst (a) the expansion of equitable
access to primary and secondary schooling; (b) the improvement of the quality
of general education; and (c) institutional development.
6.       The first component is designed to increase equitable access to
primary and secondary schooling, through the construction and renovation of
22,000 primary school classroom, in part on a commmnity-financed basis, and to
construction standards, enabling new schools to serve as flood refuges. The
responsibility for the construction of rural primary schools will be shifted to
the upazilas. Two hundred experimental satellite schools, clustered around a
government *mother school, will be established to achieve provision of
education, closer to the homes of poor students, particularly girls. Through
NGOs, non-formal primary education programs will be funded and a school
attractiveness program initiated to provide incentives to teachers, students
and the comunity to improve the environment for learning. Finally, as a
follow-on to a very successful existing program, scholarships will be financed
to encourage the enrollment and attendance of female secondary students.
7.       Building upon a number of successful, but small-scale innovations,
developed by the government as part of preceding projects, the second component
will provide for a greatly expanded in-service teacher training subcomponent,
building on and improving the successful cluster training model. This will be
closely linked to the process of revision of textbooks and the development and
dissemination of a new simplified primary curriculum, with associated
continuous pupil assessment. The new curriculum will draw on mastery learning
techniques and activity methods, already extensively pioneered and piloted In
some government schools. The project will also extend support to the secondary
level, by improving school supervision and examinations, as well as introducing
the integration of teacher education, curriculum development and textbook
revision into the lower classes of the secondary schools. Additional
curriculum development and teacher training support will be provided for
population education and a Population Education Unit will be established in the
National Curriculum and Textbook Board.
8.       The third component is designed to strengthen the management capacity
of the sector in the areas which Government has identified as of highest
priority. The capacity to train members of the education cadre in essential
managemnt skills will be increased, data collection and utilization will be
reorganized through the establishment of a sectoral Education Management
Information System, and the ability of Government to monitor secondary schools
will be improved. Additionally, the project will finance studies necessary for
the formative evaluation of project activities, in order to provide feedback to



- 3 -
management. Subsectoral assessments will be conducted and program options for
higher secondary and tertiary education will be identified for the development
of a proposed follow-on project.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) annually the Ministry of Education will prepare and review with IDA in
advance of its budgetary requests its proposed sectoral budgets; (b) redeploy
primary school teachers on the basis of one teacher per classroom; (c) by
June 30, 1991 include credit for in-service training as a promotion criterion
for teachers; and (d) by November 1, 1992 prepare for IDA comment a mid-term
project review. Conditions of Effectiveness would be: (a) amendment of the
Ministry of Education's recruitment rules to include a recruitment ratio of
female teachers to male teachers of 60:40 to increase the percent of female
teachers from the current 182 toward a goal of 50X; (b) the fulfillment of
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of The Netherlands and Swedish Grant
Agreements; (c) the establishment of the Project Coordination Unit; and (d) the
Borrower's approval of the Project Proformas for carrying out the project.
10.      Project Benefits.  Primary school enrollment would increase by about
4a per annum and new methods to attract and retain the very poor and girls
would be established. The cost per primary graduate would be reduced due to
lower dropout and repeater rates. The relevance of primary schooling would
grow due to increased classroom application of literacy and numeracy skills to
real-life situations facing students. Programs to improve secondary school
quality and efficiency would begin, but tangible benefits such as increased
pupil achievement and reduced costs per graduate is not expected to occur
during the project period.
11.      Risks.  Possible risks include continued inefficient deployment of
teachers and poor management of classroom construction. Additionally, the
Government may find it difficult to continue to resist interest group pressure
to increase subventions for private secondary school and college teachers. To
minimize these risks the project incorporates a teacher deployment policy of
one teacher per classroom and double shifts, and improves promotional
opportunities for primary school teachers to serve as a quid pro quo for
increasing their teaching load. The project would increase construction and
maintenance supervisory capacity. An additional supervisory and evaluation
capacity, financed outside of the project by DGIS and SIDA, provides for random
field evaluations of all project inputs. Joint annual GovernmentlIDA reviews
of budgetary allocations to primary education provide a forum for ensuring
adequate funding of the primary education subsector.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
