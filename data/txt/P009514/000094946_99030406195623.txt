IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 2118-BD
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the General Education Project
in Bangladesh for which Credit No. 2118-BD in the amount of SDR 120.6 million (US$159.3
million equivalent) was approved on March 29, 1990 and made effective on December 20, 1990.
The Credit was closed on April 20, 1997 after a one year extension with SDR 93.3
million disbursed. At the request of the Government SDR 23 million was cancelled during
implementation and the balance of SDR 4.3 million was cancelled effective May 7, 1997. The
project was cofinanced by seven multi- and bilateral donors: ADB, UNDP, Unicef, UNFPA,
Sida, DGIS and Norway.
The ICR was prepared by Audrey Aarons, Population and Human Resources Division,
Country Department 1, South Asia Region (SA 1 PH) and reviewed by Barbara Herz, Division
Chief and Fakhruddin Ahmed, Project Adviser. The Borrower and cofinanciers provided
comments that are included as annexes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission, November 1996. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed
to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and
commenting on the draft ICR.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 2118-BD
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A.    Introduction
(i)    This was the third education project financed by the International Development
Association (IDA) in the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It was the first project to cover
primary, secondary and nonformal education and to be cofinanced by a large number of donors.
The project became effective December 20, 1990. With a 12-month extension, the project was
completed December 20, 1996. The reasons for the extension were: (a) to allow full
implementation of major project innovations to increase enrollments and girls' participation, and
(b) to develop and supply quality-related inputs (especially learning materials and teacher training).
B.    Project Objectives
(ii)   The project objectives were to support Government policy objectives for the education
sector, especially in primary education. Specifically, the objectives were to: (a) increase equitable
access to primary and secondary schooling; (b) improve the quality of education at the primary
and secondary levels; (c) strengthen the management capacity of the primary and secondary
subsectors; and (d) prepare future policies and programs to reform the structure and financing of
higher secondary and post-secondary education.
C.    Implementation Experience and Results
(iii)   Overall, the Project substantially achieved its objectives. The Project made a major
contribution to developing and implementing sector policies, especially to expand capacity in
primary education and improve quality through better inputs. The Project also began strengthening
the management capacity in the education system, but much more is needed before significant
improvements in capacity can be expected.
(iv)   The Project contributed to the poverty reduction effort of Government by expanding access
to education, mostly for girls and disadvantaged rural population. The Project also has been
successful in enhancing the role of NGOs in primary education. Lastly, a major aid coordination
effort was involved in this project.
(v)    Key factors contributing to achieving the project results were: high Govenmuent
commitment to achieving universal primary education, adequate funding from Government
budgets, a strong monitoring effort by Government through the Project Coordination Unit and a
strong supervision effort by donors through the Project Monitor financed by two donors.



ii
D.    Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
(vi)   The Project has good prospects for sustaining its results: Government commitment is high
to continue investing in education; the role of NGOs and communities has expanded and the trend
seems to continue; and Government and donors have recognized that increased efforts are needed to
improve quality and management of the system to achieve better and more cost-effective outcomes.
(vii)  The Project has been successful in achieving its objectives and has met its physical targets
for construction, curriculum revisions, textbook distribution, teacher training, girls participation in
primary and secondary education and the recruitment of female teacher.
(viii)  Other operations in the education sector have built on the GEP experience: The Female
Secondary School Assistance Project (FSSAP) expanded the stipend program for girls in secondary
schools and the Nonfornal Education Project (NFEP) built on GEP's experience with NGOs as
delivery channel. The Primary Education Development Project (PEDP) under preparation will
focus on quality and efficiency/capacity building in the primary education subsector, building on
the strategies introduced and tested under GEP.
(ix)   There are four major lessons learned from the General Education Project. First,
Government's sustained commitment to improving education was crucial for the Project's
success. The commitment translated into formulation and implementation of policies which
aimed at improving access to and quality of education; the commitment also was reflected in
adequate and timely government funding of GEP. Second, Government involved all the major
stakeholders in the education sector - especially communities and NGOs - in increasing capacity
and improving outcomes. Third, the Project highlights the importance of capacity building
within Government to increase the efficiency of resource use and improve project outcomes.
Fourth, the objective of achieving better education outcomes requires large-scale changes,
especially in key quality inputs and management, and is a process that requires longer than the
implementation period of a typical project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PEOPLE'S RLEPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 2118-BD
PART I: PROJECT IM[PLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Statement/Evaluation of Project Objectives
1.    The project objectives as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were to support
Government policy objectives for the education sector, especially in primary education. The
objectives were to: (a) increase equitable access to primary and secondary schooling; (b)
improve the quality of education at the primary and secondary levels; (c) strengthen the
management capacity of the primary and secondary subsectors; and (d) prepare future policies
and programs to reform the structure and financing of higher secondary and post-secondary
levels.
2.    While the overall project objectives are stated in broad terms, they are translated into
clear and realistic objectives under each of the project components. For the first objective,
equitable access, the SAR specifies a realistic objective of a primary school construction
program which would satisfy 30 percent of the enrollment needs projected for the project period.
The objective takes into account the limited implementation capacity and the financing
constraints, and the project addresses these issues through developing lower-cost construction
and through capacity building. Similarly, the objective of improving the quality of education is
specified as a large teacher training program, including pre- and in-service training, combined
with curriculum and textbook reform. The third objective, institutional development, is focused
on areas Government identified as the highest priorities: increasing management skills in the
education cadre and improving management information systems. For the fourth objective, to
prepare reforms of the structure and financing of higher secondary and post-secondary education,
the SAR specifies several studies to address the issues.
3.    There is agreement between the Borrower and the Bank that the objectives of the project
have been extremely relevant for the country's development strategy and remain relevant, as
stated in the most recent full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of September 26, 1995. Within
the education sector, the issues of access, quality and management have been correctly identified
and addressed through the Project's objectives. The education sector has been, and remains, a
key element of the human resources development strategy IDA has articulated in its CASs
throughout the years.
4.    While the objectives were relevant for Bangladesh's development, and realistic with
respect to implementation capacity, the project overall was very demanding for the borrower: the
objectives, and the project coverage, were sector-wide; and, though not stated as an objective per
se, the project also aimed at achieving a coordinated approach from seven donors in support of



2
Government's objectives. As a result the project was large in terms of sector coverage,
implementation requirements, cost and number of cofinanciers, line agencies and NGOs
involved. During implementation, the Borrower's strategies for the education sector did not
change; hence there was no need to adjust overall project objectives.
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
5.    Overall, the Project substantially achieved its objectives. The Project made a major
contribution to developing and implementing sector policies. It particularly contributed to
implementing the Government's recently adopted compulsory primary education policy through
the school construction program, the establishment of satellite schools and expanding the
capacity of NGOs. The only specific targets in the original Staff Appraisal Report were for
numbers of classrooms to be built, community satellite schools to be opened, and recruitment of
female teachers: all were met. The project made important contributions to the quality of
primary education, through improving quality of inputs: teacher training, curriculum reform and
textbook development at both primary and secondary levels. However, the impact of these
inputs on actual teaching and learning achievements has been limited. As regards institutional
development, the project strengthened the National Academy of Education Management
(NAEM) through training and revision of courses. It also helped established management
information systems at the various education directorates and the Bangladesh Bureau of
Education Information and Statistics (BANBEIS). However, this is only a modest beginning of
strengthening management capacity and systems in the vast education sector, and a much larger
effort is needed before significant results can be expected.
6.    As a project focused on education, GEP has contributed to the Government's poverty
reduction objectives. Expanding access to primary education was the most important measure in
this respect. The Project also included measures to increase enrollment of girls in primary
education (social mobilization, hiring of female teachers) and a stipend program for girls in
secondary schools. The targeting of poor rural communities for new schools also reflected the
poverty reduction objective. The design of the Project thus included several features to target the
disadvantaged, and the statistics suggest substantial improvements: Bangladesh has reached a
GiER of 106 in 1996 and near-parity in enrollment and completion of girls, both of which are
outstanding achievements for a country in Bangladesh's income bracket. However, the poverty
reduction impact of the education program is lessened by the remaining problems in the quality
of education, reflected in low achievements and high dropout rates.
7.    The Project has been successful in contributing to a larger NGO role in the primary
eiducation sector. The Project funded 17 NGOs to establish primary education centers, and about
3,000 centers got established. As regards the broader institutional setup of the sector, the Project
contributed to setting the stage for better cooperation of Government and NGOs in the education
sector.
8.    As regards aid coordination, GEP provided an innovative framework in which
Governrnent was able to coordinate the multi- and bilateral financing support to achieve its
policy objectives for education. Donor coordination has been successful in channeling resources
to support Government's goals and programs and in utilizing resources more efficiently.



3
C.    Major Factors Affecting the Project
9.    The major factors contributing to the success of the project have been the very high
commitrnent of Government to achieving its education-for-all goals; the high level of donor
coordination and support for Government's objectives; and changes to the education
administrative structure to reflect the needs of the expanded education sector. In turn,
Government recognizes the role of civil society in achieving its goals and established
mechanisms for public financing of a variety of community and NGO providers of education
services. IDA and donor technical support was high during implementation through joint bi-
annual supervision missions, donor funded full-time supervisory capacity and technical
assistance from headquarters and the field office on procurement, disbursement, accounting and
audit issues.
10.   In 1992, the Ministry of Education was bifurcated and a separate Primary and Mass
Education Division (PMED) was created with the Prime Minister as Minister-in-Charge. The
Directorate of Primary Education was placed under the PMED and additional directorates for
Nonformal Education and Compulsory Primary Education were created, each headed by a
Director-General. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that had been established to coordinate
donor financing and reporting became attached to PMED. Whilst additional line agencies have
been created to meet the needs of an expanded education system, this also led to overlap of some
functions such as data collection for monitoring and evaluation and weakening of other functions
such as program planning and budgeting.
11.   During implementation the PCU developed its capacity to provide quarterly financial
and physical reports and prepared implementation status reports for the joint supervision
missions. However, annual financing and work plans were not prepared in advance; this led to
budget overruns on some categories of expenditure, overproduction of textbooks in some years,
and under-utilization of funds available for teacher training.
12.   Full-time project supervision through the offices of a Project Monitor financed by the
Swedish and Netherlands Governments improved the sharing of information and donor
coordination. Creating a working relationship amongst so many Government and donor agencies
has not been easy but the benefits of such relationships are reflected in Government's decision to
continue this arrangement in the forthcoming primary education subsector program.
13.   The financing arrangements set up for joint cofinancing by IDA, Sida and DGIS were
complex and difficult to manage involving reporting in several currencies and cost-sharing on
line items. In addition, the Special Account which was established was extended to second
generation accounts in 338 sub-branches, without IDA's prior approval, across the country. Due
to weak accounting and reporting capacity, this created considerable difficulty in financial
management. IDA has since obtained the consensus of GOB to refrain from the general use of
second generation accounts in its projects.
D.    Sustainability
14.   The probability of the project's sustainability is high. Government continues to give a
high priority to poverty alleviation with an emphasis on the provision of basic services,
especially primary and nonformal (literacy) education, and strategies to raise female
participation in education. This commitment is evident in the level of government expenditures



4
and strategies to achieve universal access to primary education, to increase the participation of
girls at all levels of education and to increase national literacy through a variety of nonformal
education programs. The education sector receives 14% of Government's budget (compared to
7% for health) and Government continues to mobilize wide support from the donor community
for education. In the period of project implementation ten or more multilateral and bilateral
donors contributed to Government's program in the education sector. And, there is continuing
support from seven donors for the proposed follow-on Primary Education Development Program
which is under preparation.
15.   The Government's administrative structure for the sector now has three clearly defined
directorates: for primary education, for nonformal education, and for secondary and higher
education. These, together with other supporting agencies, provide a sound education
infrastructure to support delivery of services. The next step is to improve the system's efficiency
and the quality of the outcomes of schooling with major emphasis on raising teaching standards
through a variety of inservice training strategies. Decisions on resource allocation remain highly
centralized and the challenge will be to allow more decision making at the subnational levels.
16.   Government is working with private sector providers: NGOs, communities and religious
organizations in providing education. This expands implementation capacity and has helped
Gjovernment to reach its goals for equitable access. Government plans to strengthen the quality
of these schools by providing access to teacher training and certification for nongovernment
teachers.
E.    Bank Performance
17.    World Bank staff, working with other donors, played a key role in helping Government
to design this innovative project. The appraisal work was satisfactory (although more attention
to indicators and to institutional capacity building would have been desirable). Implementation
experience from the first two education projects contributed to project design and to donor
coordinated financing in support of Government's objectives. Lessons learnt led to increased
emphasis on community management, expansion of the school-based cluster system of inservice
training and efforts to introduce data based planning. During implementation IDA carried out an
education expenditure review to review progress in the sector and to provide the technical and
financial context for development of the follow-on primary education project. The donors
provided a high level of supervision during implementation. In addition, IDA provided technical
support to strengthen PCU's accounting and reporting capacity and helped Government develop
its management capacity to prepare regular financial and project implementation reports.
18.   IDA's procurement guidelines require transparent and efficient procedures; Government
found compliance with these difficult especially in the case of textbook production where the
National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) negotiates a single price with over 300
printers and binders. NCTB then sells these books to the Department of Primary Education
(DPE) for distribution at a 25% mark-up. IDA provided procurement advice, but Government
was not able to achieve more transparent and efficient procurement of primary school textbooks;
hence the Bank did not finance procurement of textbooks under the Project.



5
F.    Borrower Performance
19.   Overall, the Government's performance in implementing this complex multi-donor
financed project has been satisfactory. With a one-year extension it was able to meet most
targets and to disburse 77% of the Credit. A large number of agencies and institutions were
involved in implementing project components over a period of rapid expansion of the education
system and of organizational change. There were also sustained periods of disruption due to
political activities which hampered movement around the country and delayed implementation of
some changes e.g. on textbook procurement.
G.    Assessment of Outcome
20.   The project outcome is satisfactory. It has been successful in achieving its objectives
and has met its physical targets for construction, curriculum revisions, textbook distribution,
teacher training, girls participation in primary and secondary education and the recruitment of
female teachers (see attached Aide-Memoire Table 1).
21.    The education infrastructure that has been put in place provides a solid basis for future
programs to build on. This includes: schools managed by both private and public organizations,
revised curriculum and textbooks, full-time as well as school-based teacher training, increased
supervision and professional support; strengthened school management and local level planning.
However, the investment in quality inputs (teachers trained, curriculum revised, textbooks
provided) has not yet achieved high quality outcomes. School enrollments have increased
considerably, especially in primary schools but daily attendance is poor and only about half the
children who enroll complete the five-year primary school cycle. After seven years of schooling
students have achieved only minimal levels of literacy at about class three level.
H.    Future Operations
22.   As a reflection of Government's and IDA's continued commitment to the education
sector in Bangladesh, it is to be noted that during project implementation IDA financed two
additional projects in the education sector: the Female Secondary School Assistance Project
(Credit 2469-BD) approved in March 1993, and the Nonformal Education Project (Credit 2822-
BD), approved in February, 1996. The FSSAP supports Government's national program for
financial support to girls to attend secondary school; and the NFEP provides grants to NGOs to
conduct one-year literacy programs for adolescents and young adults, mostly female.
23.   IDA, with seven other development partners, has been assisting Government prepare a
five year primary education program which they will support. This builds on the strengths of
past interventions and donor coordination in the subsector. For the first time, Government has
prepared a costed detailed five-year program for primary education. The policies and strategies
proposed for primary education give priority to improving learning achievements, strengthening
capacity of PMED and DPE to plan, implement and report on the primary education system and
ensuring equitable access to quality schooling for all children. Institutional capacity to manage
the primary education subsector will be strengthened under the follow-on subsector project
through skills development in program planning, monitoring and evaluation, and financial
management at both the central and district/thana levels. The follow-on project proposes to pilot
a system of block grants to support decision making at the district and thana levels.



6
I.    Lessons Learned
24.   There are four major lessons learned from the General Education Project. They relate to
government policies and commitment, the involvement of stakeholders in the sector, institutional
development, and the continuing challenge to improve outcomes of education.
25.   First, an important element in GEP's implementation was Government's sustained
commitment to improving education in Bangladesh, especially primary education. As a result,
despite tight budget constraints at the macroeconomic level, the project did not experience
funding constraints. The Government commitment also translated into the formulation and
implementation of policies which aimed at improving access to and the quality of education.
Particular examples are policies to get girls into primary and secondary education and
curriculum/textbook reform. Similarly important was that all the donors involved supported the
same Government policies.
26.   Second, Government has increasingly worked with all the stakeholders in the education
sector to augment implementation capacity and improve outcomes of education. Particularly
important were the larger roles of communities in establishing and managing schools, and the
participation of NGOs in the sector. The Government has established mechanisms for
channeling public resources to schools managed by NGOs, communities, religious institutions
and other private sector providers.
27.   Third, the project results underscore the importance of institutional development for both
increasing the efficiency of resource use and improving the project's outcomes. Considering the
need, the scope of GEP's institutional development component was limited. In the future,
institutional capacity needs to be strengthened for program planning and monitoring, for
developing cost-effective impact strategies and for financial management. This will require a
considerable investment in staff development at different levels of the system. Sectorwide
projects that involve many government and non-government agencies as well as a large number
of donors require a high level of institutional capacity to program, to monitor, evaluate and
report (on financial, physical and qualitative aspects of implementation).
28.   Fourth, it takes the combination of many elements and a longer-term process to achieve
better education outcomes. While GEP addressed several of the key ingredients for improving
outcomes, they have to be dealt with on a larger scale - important examples are teacher training
amd management of the education system. Improvement in education quality requires intensive
sustained effort over a longer period than the life of a typical project.

GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT, Credit 2118-BD
Joint IDA, DGIS, Sida Supervision Mission
November 17 to November 27, 1996
Aide Memoire
1.     A supervision mission for the General Education Project (GEP), Credit 211 8-BD was
conducted jointly by IDA, DGIS and Sida and in consultation with UNFPA, UNDP, NORAD,
Unicef and ADB (other cofinanciers supporting the GEP). Mission members were
Mmes.MNIessrs. Audrey Aarons, Task Manager, Owaise Saadat, Mir Bashir Ahmed (IDA);
Monica Malakar (Swedish Embassy, Dhaka); and Elsa da Costa (Royal Netherlands Embassy,
Dhaka) and Boem van Ravenswaaij (DGIS).
2.     The joint supervision objectives were to review achievements in meeting project
development objectives, to review the status of physical and financial aspects of project
implementation, agree on actions to be taken to close the project and to prepare the
Implementation Completion Report. Terms of reference for the Joint Supervision Mission are
attached, Annex 1.
3.     To review progress and to establish the steps to be taken towards project closing,
December 20, 1996 the mission met with the Secretaries, Primary and Mass Education Division
(PMyIED), Ministry of Education (MOE) and Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
Division (IMED), Ministry of Finance; the Director-General, Primary Education (DPE);
Members and Chairman, Textbooks and Curriculum, National Curriculum and Textbook Board
(NCTB); Chief Engineer, Local Government Engineering Division (LGED); and the Project
Coordinator and staff of the GEP Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The mission also met with
representatives of NGOs providing project financed 'feeder' and primary schools; and with
representatives of the Development Planners Consultants (DPC) which provides monitoring
services. The mission made a field trip to Jamalpur and Sherpur to visit feeder schools (NGO
ancl satellite schools) and schools included in the School Attractiveness Program (SAP).
4.     The mission was greatly assisted by the PCU's preparation and distribution of financial
and implementation status reports. The review meetings at the PCU provided an effective forum
for the mission and Government to decide on the next steps to be taken. The mission would like
to thank Government officials and representatives of NGOs and monitoring firms who assisted
the team to complete the mission in a timely and fruitful manner. Agreements reached at the
wraip-up meeting at PMED on November 26, 1996 and recorded in the Aide-Memoire have been
confirmed by IDA management.
The General Education Project
5.     Achievements    The project was designed to support a number of important
Government policy objectives for the education sector, especially those in primary education.
The project objectives were to (a) increase equitable access to primary and secondary schooling;
(b) improve the quality of education at the primary and secondary levels; (c) strengthen the
management capacity of the primary and secondary subsectors; and (d) prepare future policies



Annex 1
26                                         2 of 16
and programs to reform the structure and financing of higher secondary and post-secondary
levels. To achieve the objectives to increase equitable access to primarv and secondary
schooling
17,114 classrooms were constructed for an estimated 855,700 additional students;
*  199 satellite schools were established and 3,136 NGO primary education centers were
supported with combined enrollments of 160,260 students, especially girls and children from
poorer households, who progressed to class three or four at other schools;
*  689 schools received grants of Tk 24,000 to make schools more attractive to students;
*  50,000 female secondary school students received scholarships.
To improve the quality of education the project
*  revised the primary school curriculum, classes I to 5, to reflect continuous pupil assessment,
population education and gender sensitivity;
*  prepared textbooks for all subjects, all classes, based on the new curriculum and distributed
them free to all primary students annually - three books per child each year in class 1 and 2,
six books per child per year in class 3,4 and 5;
*  revised the lower secondary school language and mathematics curriculum and prepared
accompanying textbooks;
* integrated initial and inservice teacher education by revising the teacher education
curriculum and disseminating the revised curriculum across 64 districts; and through cluster
and school based inservice training in 36 districts;
-  improved facilities at teacher training institutes and the National Academy of Primary
Education; and established the Directorate of Training at DPE to coordinate and monitor
inservice training programs; conducted studies and initiated action research at PTIs and
introduced library development planning at PTIs;
To strengthen the management capacity of the sector the project
*  strengthened the National Academy of Education Management through staff development
and training and revision of courses;
*  established Educational Management Information Systems through staff development and
training and provided computers at the Directorates of Secondary and Higher Education,
DPE and the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics;
*  conducted policy studies on primary school textbook reuse and post-primary education.
6.     Outcomes   During the six years of project implementation Government placed a very
high emphasis on implementing its compulsory primary education (CPE) policies. Special
attention was given to reaching the girl-child and children from hard-to-reach communities.
Social mobilization programs and local level CPE committees supported the drive to increase
access and to involve communities. A range of school management types in the public and
private sectors provided primary education programs and were supported in different ways
through public financing. The GEP supported a number of innovative strategies to support the
achievement of these goals such as the satellite schools program and the school attractiveness
program. The result has been a Gross Enrollment Ratio of around 100% for the past three years
with the number of over-age children in the system declining over time and the Net Enrollment
Ratio around 75%. The recruitment of female teachers has been on a 60:40 ratio and the
proportion of girls in school is near that of boys: they attend as regularly and are equally as likely
to complete primary school as are boys. The results also show the role of specific WID/Gender
interventions implemented in the GEP in contributing to this, and the need to institutionalize
gender at various levels of planning and implementation. Teachers have become more aware of
improved ways of teaching as a result of school and cluster based training and the emphasis in
the new curriculum to assess children's learning. School management and district planning has a



Annex 1
27                                         3 ofl6
new role in developing school quality and accountability of schools to their communities. The
education infrastructure that has been put in place provides a solid basis for future programs to
builid on. This includes: schools managed by both private and public organizations, revised
curriculum and textbooks, full-time as well as school-based teacher training, increased
supervision and professional support; strengthened school management and local level planning.
Attention now will focus on ensuring that all children enter school and complete the five year
primary education program and achieve basic learning competencies for sustainable literacy and
life skills. These are the goals of the next five year primary education program.
7.     Lessons from experience GEP provided an innovative framework in which Government
was able to coordinate the multilateral and bilateral financing support to achieve its policy
objectives for education. The donor coordination and the relationship between the cofinanciers
and Government has been successful in channeling resources to support Government's goals and
programs and in utilizing resources more efficiently. Full-time supervision through the offices
of a Project Monitor financed by Sida and DGIS contributed to the sharing of information and
the processes of donor and Government coordination. Creating a working relationship amongst
so nmany Government and donor agencies is not easy but the benefits of such relationships are
reflected in Government's decision to continue this arrangement in the forthcoming five year
primary education subsector program. For example, during preparation of the primary education
development program, 1997-2001 Government and development partners, under the leadership
of PMED, have been collaborating in developing an investment program to support
Government's policy objectives in the primary education subsector.
8.    The project was designed within the line agency of the Ministry of Education prior to the
creation of a separate Primary and Mass Education Division. Subsequently, the project did not
fully reflect the changes in management structures and responsibilities for implementation. The
Project Coordination Unit was established to coordinate and manage donor funds but carried out
some functions that were the responsibility of other line agencies, such as the Directorate of
Primary Education. Under the next five year program the administration, finance and
procurement, planning and monitoring functions will be institutionalized within the structures of
the Directorate of Primary Education with some additional strengthening.
9.     Disbursement arrangements for donor financing were complex and not very flexible.
These placed great demands on financial management and reporting mechanisms at the field and
central administration levels and may have contributed to the under-utilization of Sida and DGIS
funds. Government auditing under GEP was not adequate and needs to improve. In the next five
year program a time-slice financing arrangement which provides greater financing flexibility
will be followed by some donors. Uniform financial reporting procedures will be introduced to
serve the needs of Government and the majority of the donors.
10.    There are great achievements in provision of schools, teachers and books but there is still
a long way to go to achieve universal school completion and levels of learning that will support
sustainable literacy. Government is preparing a program that focuses on teaching and learning
processes and investments in staff development and training. Monitoring student completion and
learning achievements will be carried out.

Implementation Status
11.    Legal Covenants. All but one of the covenants set out in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) have been fulfilled. See Annex 2, Status of Covenants. Under Schedule 4
(1) of the DCA, Government agreed to "furnish to IDA for comment the proposed financing plan
for the education sector and enrollment growth targets for each level in private and public
schools not later than May 30 in each year commencing May 31, 1991". It was expected that
this information would provide relevant data for annual physical and financial planning
(classroom, furniture, teacher and textbook supply) and to assess the institutional demands that a
rapidly expanding school system would require. However, data based annual implementation
plans were not prepared partly due to lack of adequate data.. This resulted in financial overruns
in some categories of expenditure, overproduction of textbooks in some years and lower
implementation of some training components. In recent years, the PCU has regularly prepared
quarterly financial reports and biannual implementation status reports. For improved planning
and programming in future, it has been agreed that for the primary education program, 1997-
2002, DPE will prepare data-based annual operational and expenditure plans for the primary
education subsector. These will be jointly reviewed by Government and development partners
and monitored against performance indicators.
12.   Disbursement  See Annexes 3 and 4: Allocation and Disbursement of IDA, Sida and
DGIS trust funds. The original allocations for the five year project were: IDA SDR 126.6
million, SEK 86.20 million and DFL 26.50 million. The project was extended to a sixth year of
implementation and a total of SDR 23 million of the IDA Credit has been canceled. As of
November 24, 1996 SDR 76.22 million has been disbursed and further withldrawals of SDR
16.57 million are expected to be claimed by April 20, 1997 making a total disbursement of SDR
92.79 million (74% of the original Credit). Based on activities being undertaken now,
disbursements from the DFL and SEK grant financing are expected to be DFL 16.47 million and
SEK 65. 88 million by April 20, 1997. This represents 62% and 76% respectively of the two
grants. Sida and DGIS disbursements were on a 50:50 cost share basis. The difference in
disbursement between the two grants is due to exchange rate fluctuations.
13.    Recovery of the US$ I I million from the Special Account began in August, 1996 and
will achieve 100% recovery by December 20, 1996. The amount still to be recovered is US$6.77
million (SDR 4.70 million). PCU will need to ensure that all field level bank accounts are closed
and outstanding vouchers from the field are collected and cleared by December 20, 1996.
Action required by PCU.
14.    Financial reports reviewed during the mission indicate that there is an over-disbursement
in the IDA financed civil works category, and several of the Sida and DGIS financed categories.
Government requested, and the mission agreed, that in principle, these eligible expenditures
mav be recovered from the Unallocated Categories of the IDA Credit and the Sida and DGIS
grant funds. Action required by IDA.
I 1.    Salaries of satellite school teachers and community school teachers are financed from
project funds and as of January 1, 1997 Government will meet full costs of salaries for these
teachers. Government requested, and the mission agreed, that salaries for these teachers for the
wdhole of December can be met from project funds so long as the funds are committed before
December 20, 1996. Action required by PCU.



Annex 1
29                                      5 of 16
16.    Claims totaling SDR 16.57 million (US$ 23.86 million) and US$ 3.2 million from the
Sidla and DGIS grant funds will need to be processed in the next five months. The claims on the
Credit represent a very large amount and considerable efforts will be needed to ensure that the
claims can be made before the Credit is closed. All remaining withdrawals from the Credit and
the Sida and DGIS grants must be completed by April 20, 1997. Claims after April 20, 1997
would need to be met by Government. Action required by PCU.
17.    Government's Project Proforma for the General Education Project and its Government
financed activities (that is, staff salaries) continues to June 30, 1997. A list of activities that
Government will finance under the revised project proforma for the period January to June, 1997
should be forwarded to IDA for review by December 15, 1996. Action required by PCU.
18.    Audits. The audit report for FY 95 has been submitted to IDA. The FY96 audit report
is cdue by March 31, 1997. As final withdrawals from the Credit may be made up to April 20,
1997 it should be noted that a final audit report would be required no later than nine months from
that date. The mission noted that a large number of audit observations of the past three years are
still pending, especially relating to reports of the Facilities Department and LGED. These need
to be addressed immediately and the status of audit observations submitted to IDA by December
20, 1996. See Annex 5: Statement of Audits. Action required by PCU.
19.    Follow-up actions since last supervision mission. The mission was informed of actions
taken to: (a) distribute library books to PTI and to develop a librarian training program; (b)
coniduct additional training programs; (c) monitor satellite schools, NGO primary education
cernters and the schools in the School Attractiveness Program; (d) implement a textbook reuse
scheme for the school year 1997.
20.    Government has agreed that NGO-managed primarv schools under GEP that cover the
cornplete five grades could, if meeting national policy guidelines on criteria for registration,
apply for registration and be eligible for subventions on the same basis as all other registered
schools. The registration process is underway and needs to be completed by December 30, 1996
andi so that there is no gap in the financial support to these schools. Action required by DPE.
21.    Government is currently reviewing the status of NGO-managed 'feeder' schools which
offer the first two or three years of primary and transfer students to other schools to complete the
five year program. Government's recent revision of registration criteria for nongovernment
schools and the Director-General's letter of instruction on 'feeder schools' and mainstreaming of
these children into regular primary schools needs to be widely circulated amongst NGOs as well
as communities. 'Feeder' schools, under GEP, were managed by both communities (satellite
schools offering the first two years of primary education) and by NGOs (formerly called
nonformal primary education and offering the first twvo or three years of the primary education
program). Criteria for establishing 'feeder' schools (both community managed satellite schools
and NGO managed primary education centers) need to be common to all feeder schools no
matter who manages them. Once such criteria is agreed then eligibility for support from public
resources needs to be determined. Government informed the mission that PMED, through DPE
and in consultation with communities managing satellite schools and NGOs managing primary
education centers, is examining the eligibility criteria for feeder schools and considering how
existing NGO-managed feeder schools under GEP can be incorporated into Government



Annex 1
30                                   6 of 16
programs. Action required from Government in consultation with local communities and
NGOs supported through GEP.
22.    The mission understands that NCTB is exploring the possibility of future links with the
Graphic Media Development Center (GMDC) in order to ensure the sustainability of the
achievements so far in developing NCTB's book production capacity. The mission recommends
that NCTB discusses with GMDC possible links in the context of negotiations underway with
ADB.
23.    The mission was informed that NCTB's desktop publishing equipment purchased under
the Sida and DGIS financed components has not yet been received. Training in its use will be
completed by December 20, 1996 at the premises at the Graphic Arts Institute which has similar
equipment. NCTB has received confirmation from the supplier that the equipment will be in
country by December 20, 1996. Follow-up action required by NCTB.
24.    Disbursement of funds for the NORAD financed Female Education Scholarship Project
has been delayed during 1996 due to non-receipt of final Audit Reports for the period 1993/94
and 1994/95 financial years. In accordance with the Agreement the audit reports are required
after each financial year. One of the reasons for the delays is that NGOs' participation in the
implementation of the project makes the audit process more cumbersome and lengthy compared
with other projects where Government is the only implementing entity. The project will close in
December, 1996. However, in order to fulfill the obligations of the Agreement (e.g. progress
report, audit reports and completion report) there seems to be a need for the FESP project unit to
continue their work beyond December 1996. The Norwegian Embassy is expecting a proposal
from MOE through the Economic Relations Division (ERD) for a continuation of the FESP
project unit for the completion of the ongoing project. The evaluation of the project will be
undertaken in February 1997. Action required by MOE.
25.    Government has submitted a request to NORAD for an extension and expansion of the
Female Education Scholarship Project. During the Annual Program Consultations in October
1996 Norway expressed willingness to continue support for the project within a financial frame
of NOK 25 million annually. Any future project would be institutionalized within the
framework of MOE's female secondary school stipend programs.
26.    Under GEP NORAD has contributed paper for textbooks produced by NCTB. Through
an addendum to the Agreement, Norway has provided additional support of NOK 35 million in
1996. The final progress report will be submitted in April 1997. Evaluation by NORAD will be
undertaken in September 1997. The mission notes that in spite of reminders by letter and in
meetings between NORAD and PMED, the revised TAPP for the remaining fund for the
technical assistance components is still pending. Action required by PMED.
27.    Sixth Technical Assistance Project (TA-VT Credit 2393-BD) subproiect 027:
Institutional Development of PMED. The subproject cost is USS432,696. The midterm review of
the overall TA project carried out in August, 1996 recommended the following actions:
procurement of MIS equipment to be completed by February 28, 1997; PMED to ensure that by
October 3 1, 1996 MIS compatibility in procuring a system (without network); PMED to prepare
a training plan for implementation which has been reviewed by IDA. The midterm review
mission also noted the slow disbursement of the Credit. It recommended that PMED examine
alternative uses for the estimated savings of US$ 73,000 and to prepare a proposal utilizing the



Annex 1
31                                     7 of 16
Credit to strengthen DPE. The mission was regrettably informed that PMED has already
requested ERD to seek cancellation of the savings. The mission feels that the Credit savings
could have been used to strengthen the divisional units at DPE in preparation for their tasks in
planning, monitoring and financial management under the primary education sector program.
The mission recommends that PMED reconsiders their decision and seeks DPE assistance in
preparing a technical assistance plan for DPE to utilize the available funds. Action required by
PMED.
28.    Schedule of actions to project closing. December 20. 1996. All activities to be financed
from the Credit and the Sida and DGIS Grants must be completed by December 20, 1996.
Annex 6 shows the status of all donor financed project components. An implementation schedule
and expected expenditures for IDA, Sida, DGIS financed components is attached as Annex 7.
The mission notes that Government's project proforma for GEP covers the full FY97 financial
year. Government will meet all expenses for activities carried out after December 20, 1996 from
its own resources. This includes staff salaries. Currently, the project finances the salaries of 130
PCU staff, 363 DPE headquarters and field staff, and 30 staff in other project units. The mission
requests information on the numbers of PCU and DPE staff to be retained after December 20,
1996 and the financial and institutional arrangements being proposed. A staffing plan indicating
deployment of staff by level, function and location and the sources of salary should be sent to
IDA for review by December 20, 1996. Action by PMED.
29.    The mission informed Government that as of December 21, 1996 no further financial
commitments may be made against the Credit and the DGIS and Sida grant funds. Withdrawals
for goods and services contracted and completed by December 20, 1996 may be claimed against
the Credit and Sida, DGIS grants up to and no later that April 20, 1997.
30.    Project evaluation and completion reports  After project closure, Government and the
development partners will complete project evaluation reports. For this purpose IDA prepares an
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) and a copy of the ICR format has been distributed to
PCU and to GEP confinanciers for their information to assist preparation of data. The report is to
be completed within six months of project closing. It is recommended that the PCU, acting on
behalf of the borrower, begin to draft the relevant sections of the ICR in readiness for a
completion mission in February, 1997 to complete drafts of the ICR. Action required PCU,
[DA, Sida and DGIS.
31.   It was agreed that representatives of IDA, Sida and DGIS will meet with PCU on
December 18, 1996 to review progress on closing activities; and to meet monthly thereafter to
draft the completion reports.

Borrowers Contribution to ICR
Part I - Project Implementation Assessment
Project Objective:    The main objectives of GEP as stated in the SAR are the
following:
1)    Increase equitable access to Primary and Secondary schooling by: (a) constructing and
renovating primary school classrooms; (b) establishing satellite schools; (c) financing
non-formal primary education programmes; (d) making Government schools more
attractive; (e) and providing scholarships for female secondary school students.
2)    Improve the quality of education at the primary and secondary levels by expanding
teacher training sub-component by reforming textbooks & curricula; by increasing, as
well as, improving the supervision of the schools and also by strengthening population
education by including it with the curricula of the primary and secondary grades.
3)    Strengthen the management capacity of the primary and secondary sub-sectors; and
4)    Prepare future policies and progress to reform the structure and financing of higher
secondary and post-secondary levels.
Achievement of the project objective:
So far the 'access' part is concerned significant gains have been achieved. A new concept of
community school was introduced in the project. For construction of community school as well
as for primary schools three new designs were developed and introduced in the project area. PP
target was exceeded by more than 200 percent in reconstruction of rural, city & town primary
schools. Regarding establishment of satellite schools about 98% of the target has been achieved
and out of 200 schools 197 schools have been constructed. The over expenditure on civil works
has been adjusted by inter category readjustment of DCA allocation.
Commendable progress has been achieved in quality improvement. Enrollment and retention has
steadily been increasing & dropout rate decreasing. Curriculum has been revised and new
textbook has been developed and introduced accordingly. CPA tools, achievement tests,
supervision manual, training packages, monitoring instruments, training plan has been
completed. The development of curriculum materials, dissemination of new curriculum have
been performed. Development of professional capacity of NCTB and DPE, development of PTI
syllabi/curriculum partly achieved. Cost savings in textbooks have been introduced in phases in
the project by recycling one old textbook in class II and 2 old textbooks in class II from the year
1997. A policy of recruiting 60% of the female teachers has been in progress and the target
would be achieved within a couple of years.
Attitudinal changes in the clientele groups have been brought about through Population
Education Project. It has a positive linkage to the realization of GOB's population policy and
demographic targets of reducing population growth.



Annex 2
2of4
F or strengthening the management capacity of the secondary education sub-sector initiatives
were taken for establishing an education managementladministration training network to
facilitate and co-ordinate improved school based management training through a national level
workshop. NAEM prepared course materials for management training programmes for head
mnasters of secondary schools which had been tested through a test training course. These course
nnaterials are now being used in NAEM's on going courses for head masters. Training
programmes for in-country staff development in specialized areas of project management and
educational planning has been undertaken.
Enrollment and retention of girls in secondary schools have increased through Female Secondary
Education Stipend Project. Close monitoring and supervision has been possible through
NGOs/FESP for ensuring quantity and quality. Schools have been benefitted by providing
regular tuition fees to students.
Implementation record and major factors affecting the project.
Implementation record for projects under GEP will be supplied lateron. Implementation record
for Primary Education Development Project under Dhaka, Rajshahi & Khulna Division
(including Barisal) Divisions (both physical and financial) is appended (Annexure-1).
Major factors affecting the project are as follows:
(a)    The depreciation of taka currency over the years created extra fund for the same credit.
Moreover, due to reconstruction of primary schools with the amount less than the unit
cost approved in the original PP also created considerable amount of savings. Besides
this, the amount allocated for incremental staff salary cat-6 couldnot be spent as Govt.
did not agree to create posts for the teachers under revenue budget. The total utilization
of these savings funds could not be done and even a part of the savings could not be
utilized as IDA took long time to reach decision on reallocation of savings fund from
DCA's allocation of 120 m SDR. Some part of savings as for example teachers' salary
couldnot be utilized in other catagory of expenditure.
(b)   Imposition of pre-condition for donation of taka 10,000/- in cash and 33 decimal of land
for establishment of low-cost/community school created hindrance in implementation.
Moreover, decision taken by the IDA without consultation regarding construction of 2
class room school building instead of 3 class room has also affected the implementation
process.
(c)    Sudden withdrawal of US $ 8 million out of US $ 19 million from SAFE account in the
midst of implementation process affected the subsequent project implementation.
(d)    Delay in approving the no cost extension of the project, delay in finalizing the PCP for
the 2nd phase of FESP (in. case of FESP)
i)    Delay in signing the PRODOC (in case of NAEM & BANBEIS)
ii)    Change in the administrative set-up resulting in the creation of a separete
division for primary education (in case of NAEM & BANNEIS)
iii)   Non release of fund in due time (in case of NAEM & BANBEIS)

Project sustainabilitv: The amount of success gained to achieve the objectives of the project
will be sustained by institutionalizing some of the activities, as well as, by expanding the process
in the follow-up porjects.
IDA performance:
IDA's performance by and large was satisfactory. IDA extended all cooperation an
implementation of the porject. But at the final stage of implementation when all bills and
vouchers are required to be settled by payment the project management faced problems in fund
disbursement to implementing agencies like FD, LGED, DPE etc. as the Bank according to their
procedures started to recover the SAFE amount from the account several months prior to the
closing of the project. This procedure of the Bank instead of facilitating implementation caused
insurrrmountable problems for the porject management. It was GOB who came to the rescue of
the management by providing loan of Tk. 800 million. Had there been no loan the project would
have nose dived in the morass of implementation. affected project implementation to a
substantial extent. Moreover, the policy taken by IDA regarding construction of 2 class room
school instead of 3 class room school also discouraged many local communities to participate in
construction of low cost schools.
Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the borrower was highly satisfactory. This is because that the GOB,
the borrower, could successfully complete such a multidonor funded project in time. Targets on
almost all the objectives could be achieved fully and in some cases, targets achieved by more
than 200%. The Borrower also successfully completed the re-imbursement of RPA fund during
the stipulated time disproving the profound apprehension in the highest quarters of the Bank on
the ability of project management in claiming re-imbursement of the amount which far execided
the amount of the precedies years. Moreover, timely forward planning and projection of
activities made it possible for the borrowers to adjust inter category reallocation of DCA fund
and also to surrender 23 million SDR in time.
Assessment of out come:
The project was instrumental in assisting the GOB in increasing the gross enrollment ratio of
Bangladesh from 73% in 1990 to 95% in 1996. Girl students have become aware of the
education. Now-a-days greater number of girls are attending primary schools and it would now
be easier for GOB to fill the 60% quota of female teachers soon. The Female Secondary
Education Stipend Project has been successful in bringing and retaining more girls at secondary
level. Attendance of girl students in schools as compared to the boys has also increased. Number
of SSC graduates has also increased during the last four years. The project had been successful in
educating the girls on the ill effects of early marriage.
A new curriculum, textbooks and other instructional materials were introduced in class I to V.
Teacher training was organised under cluster and sub-cluster system and institutionalised
throughout the country.
For strengthening the management capacity all the activities have been successfully completed
by releasing GOB fund in time. But majority of the activities to be funded from the UNDP could
not be completed for non-release of fund due to administrative complications.

F'uture operations:
A follow up project (the PEDP) is being undertaken to sustain the performance achieved in the
present project.
!Cey lessons learned:
Projects having multi-donor co-financing arrangements with different types of donor requirments
and conditionalities can effectively be implemented if a separate office such as PIU or PIMU or
PCU is established with adequate financial and administrative authority.
From the experience it is felt that there should be a single donor for individual component of a
project. If the responsibility of implementing the programme is limited to single or minimum
number of agencies any lapses can easily he detected and remedial actions can be taken
immediately.
IThe key lessons learned form this project is that projects that seek to improve efficiency &
quality require significant investment on human resource development.

Joint DGIS and Sida Inputs for the General Education Project
(GEP) Implementation Completion Report - World Bank
General:
The GEP provided an innovative framework particularly for
primary/basic education in Bangladesh, in which the government
was able to coordinate the multilateral and bilateral support to
achieve its policy objectives for education as outlined in the National
Plan of Action (NPA), 1992, end the implementation of the
Compulsory Primary Education (CPE) Act, 1992, under the Primary
and Mass Education Division (PMED), specifically created to
undertake the development and strengthening of the prmary/basic
education system in Bangladesh. Given the status of formal
schooling at national level before the implementatlon of the GEP,
particularly from a priority, quality, and gender perspective,
significant achievements have taken place in some areas under the
project, while others require further deliberation and commitment
within the framework of a coherent, realistic, and sustainable policy
framework to create a positive impact on the education system in the
future. The following provides some insights into the experiences
gained under the GEP.
1. Access:
Given the magnitude of the task, significant quantitative
achievemnents were made in promoting equitable access through
expanded and Innovative coverage consisting of the construction of
new schools, establishment of low cost community schools,
improvement of existing physical facilities, Satellite Schools (SS),
School Attractiveness Programme (SAP), collaboration with NGOs,
and the Female Education Stipend Programme (FESP), to-attract
and retain students, particularly the disadvantaged and girls. These
interventions combined with better social mobilization efforts'
resulted in higher enrollment and near parity gender-wise spetially
at the primary level. All this constituted a major step in proviing
equitable access to schooling. However, despite the existence of
criteria for the location and establishment of primary schools\
throughout the country, the lacik of a reliable and effective school
mapping exercise raised the issue of overlapping between the
different types of schooling that exist and the actual needs in the
context of access. It is essential that access to schooling and the
planning and resource allocation it entails, be built on a verifiable
process identifying the actual needs of the country.
2. Qualily;
Ensuring adequate and more equitable access to education is the
first step to be taken in an effective schooling system. Sustainable
quality inputs address the key issues of attendance, retention,
completion and mainstreaming to the next level of education. Under
the GEP, statistics revealed that attendance, retention, and
*completion improved considerably, however the verification of this



Annex 3
on a qualitative basis was difficult due to inherent weaknesses in the  2 of 10
monitoring structure, and tlieleck of adequate cross-checking
mechanisms throughout the management system. This yet remains
to be developed adequately on an institutional basis, an essential
* ingredient in the qualitative devefopment of formal education.
A. Teacher Training - Commendable quantitative achievements
took place with regard to certain aspects of teacher training. Nearly
100% of teachers in government primary schools (GPS) received the
CinEd training offered at the Primary Teachers Training Institutes
(PTIs). More than 300,000 teachers from the primary school system
were provided with the curriculum dissemination training based on
the revised curriculum. What could not be adequately addressed
under the GEP was the formal training of teachers in more than
20,000 non-government/private primary schools. Also lacking was
the in-depth assessment of the structure and quality of teacher
education and its impact on current learning, and the necessary
reforms needed to address this key area - the qualitative
irnprovement of learning. The whole issue of effective teacher
deployment in relation to teacher education in the context of
maximising returns from investment was not adequately addressed.
B. Curriculum and Textbooks - A inajor achievement under the
GEP was the revision of the entire primary curriculum and its
implementation, particularly from a gender perspective that included
population education and environmental aspects, and thb
introduction of a primary textbook. reuse policy. Although certain
mechanisms were placed to monitor the effects of these initiatives
under the GEP, the need to assess the adequacy of these
mechanisms in fulfilling their objectives particularly in relation to the
relevance of the curriculum in the context of socio-economic
realities, remains to be addressed. The production and distribution
of textbooks to millions of children annually is a daunting task for a
developing country, but despite its limitations the government
managed to carry this out quite effectively. However, the fotrnulation
of a cost-effective textbook production and distribution polid9 that
ensures quality production and timely distribution on a competitive
basis as undertaken by the secondary education sub-sector,\Nas not
undertaken at the primary leve( in GEP. X
C. Innovative Programme - The introduction and implementation of
innovative programmes - SS, SAP, and the government's
collaboration with NGOS in non-formal primary education (NFPE)
was a major breakthrough in terms of expanding equitable access
and gaining insights on qualitative and management improvements
at the primary level. NGO collaboration also took place under FESP.
The success of the SS programme was demonstrated in its
replication on a wider scale, Various innovative activities were
experimented upon under the SAP, and the NGOS were able to
demonstrate their complementarity to govemment's own efforts to
met the goals of EFA through their NFPE activities. Key concerns
that emerged during the implementation of the GEP which were not
adequately assessed or addressed were the satisfactory
mainstreaming of graduates from the SS and NGO programmes, the
impactJtelevance of the SAP, and the future of NFPE and SAP in the



48
areas of enrollment, attendance, retention and completion at the  Annex 3
primary level. However, It was, encouraging to note that some of the  3 of 10
insights generated by the innovative elements in the GEP have been
firmly translated into the PEOP documentation, and have helped
shape the government's current thinking on various approaches
towards quality primary education for all.
D. Siipervision and Monitoring  Under the GEP various steps
were taken to strengthen these key areas of implementation to
assess the gradual impact of the various interventions, but there
remained considerable room for improvement, specially in the
context of increasing efficiency in the system. In this context, it is
important to mention that the training received on monitoring at the
Hague, Netherlands, at the beginning of the project was not
satisfactorily integrated into the system based on annual operational
plans that adequately defined and measured project Inputs to annual
outputs. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit set up for the project
was often stretched to its limits capacity-wise, by being given
additional tasks such as the overseeing of the SS and SAP and
others, which diverted scare resources from its primary function of
monitoring overall project inputs and outputs. Satisfactory retums in
terms of performance in a project are dependent on the adequacy
and reliability of the supervision/monitoring system. Competence
building through training adequate numbers of central and field
personnel, streamlining functions tro avoid overlapping, appropriate
suppcrt staff and equipment, and an independent verification of
monitoring data for follow-up, planning, and policy formulation; are
pre-requisites for the development of an effective
supervision/monitoring structure for education. This was lacking in
the GEP.
E. Gender- The GEP demonstrated government's commitment in
trying to address existing gender disparities in the education system.
The recruitment of primary school teachers on a 60:40 female/male
ratio, efforts to reduce gender disparity in the curriculum, the
innovative programmes, and other interventions intended to address
gender inequality were all implemented and achieved varyir.g\
degrees of success. Although some indicators were included. in the
monitoring system to obtain gender disaggregated data on a \
quantitative basis, the project lacked this on a qualitative basis\The
lack of sufficient trained gender staff in most of the planning and
implementing agencies under the GEP added to this shortcoming.
Analytical research on the status and effects of on-going
WID/gender interventions related to access, quality, and
management, that would inform and address gender concerns on an
on-going basis was lacking In the project.
F. Learning Assessment - Under the GEP, the basic competencies
developed to assess student learning achievement was well
intended, but in practice proved to be too complex for the existing
teaching system to use effectively. Based on this experience,
measures were introduced to simplify the process. This was a
positive development, however, the formulation of a national
standardized student assessment system is long overdue, as huge



49
investments in formal education are wasted when their impact   Annex 3
cannot be measured in terms .of learning.                       4 of 10
G. Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Project Monitor (PM)
- The Interagency (GOB) coordination was quite effectively managed
by the PCU of the GEP. However during the course of the project it
became apparent that this coordination could have been more
effective if such an entity was located within tha structural framework
of the Directorate of Primary Education (OPE), the main
implementation agency of the GEP, accompanied by adequate
resource altocation wherein the PCU expertise could be utilized to
support the coordinating functions of the OPE. Furthermore, due to
the monitoring deficiencies of various implementing agencies, the
PCU sometimes took on the role of monitoring the various activities
which distracted from its function as a coordinating body. The PCU
provided GEP progress reports to both the government and the
donors, and contributed to the deveiopment of the GEP. However,
as stated before the location of such an entity in terms of
effectiveness/efficiency needs to be seriously addressed in the
context of future programmes.
The Project Monitor's position In the GEP was an effective
mechanism for donor coordination in terms of information sharing,
reporting, and verification, from an alternative source. The PM's
biannual supervision mission reports were very useful in discussing
the project's overall progress in relation to set objectives, and
provided important insights to the underlying ccncerns that needed
to be addressed. Various recommendations were presented in each
bi-annual report highlighting the relevant issues both quantitative
and qualitative. This process was hampered when the PM's position
came to an end in June 1996 before completion of the GEP in
December 1996. A shortcoming that gradually became evident
during the course of the GEP, was the lack of a mechanism to utilize
the PM's monitoring skills to help develop 'the monitoring capacity of
the DPE.
Both the PCU and PM's reporting contributed positively towards a
better understanding of the project, however, what was lacki g in
both cases was more analytical discussions on the various fihdings
or recommendations emerging from the reports, particularly th\PM's
bi-annual reports.
H. Studies - The studies undertaken under the GEP fell into two
categories, those undertaken by the GOB, dealing mostly with
"hardware issues', and those commissioned from the Project
Monitor's Fund, mostly on qualitative issues. Some studies appeared
elther less relevant or did not materialize at all.
It was agreed during various supervision missions that a final
evaluation of the GEP, particularly on the impact of the project,
would be undertaken. Both Sida and DGIS have expressed interest
to contribute to such an evaluation, which wculd normally have
preceded future commitments to a follow-up project/programme. As
the World Bank requires for its purposes an evaluation of each
activity, it was suggested to add to this, an in-depth evaluation in a



50
limited number of thanas to assess what difference the GEP has  Annex 3
made at the local level,                                      5 of 10
3. Management:
The successful management of a formal education system is the key
to gaining optimal returns through efficient use of resources. Under
the GEP, certain measures were adopted to enhance the
management aspects of the project, however, the following key
concerns remained-
* adequate development of institutional planning, implementation
and monitoring capacity.
* the lack of efficiency of the system to deliver desired results.
' the lack of an appropriate MIS that supports adequate planning
and monitoring.
* the lack of annual operational plans that form the basis of
implementation and follcw-up.
* overlapping of functions in various agencies.
 lack of appropriate coordination mechanisms between key policy,
planning, and implementing agencies.
' problems arising out of the bifurcation of the MOE and the roles of
Implementing agencies like NCTB, BANBEIS.
* frequent transfer of skilled/trained personnel within the system,
* the whole issue of decentralized management - this includes the
redefining of the role, functions, decision-making authority, and
resource allocation at the local government level, particularly in
relation to the local government education structures, and the
restructuring of the roles and functions of the PTAs, SMCs, Mothers
Clubs, and the community in general.
* the lack of an overall gender integration plan at the policy,
planning, management, and operational levels of the education
system.
4. Financial; - The modalities that were chosen for financing by Sida
and DGIS (joint-cofinancing a number of categories with the World
Bank on the basis of reimbursement of claims from the GOB)
whereby Sida and OGIS shared costs on a 50-50 basis), tumi\d out
to be less flexible than anticipated. It also put a heavy admirsistrative
burden on the GOB staff involved at various levels, when it came to
preparing reimbursement claims (percentages, currency fluctuations
etc).
Financial reporting that should enable development partners to
assess financial and actual progress compared to the original
budget was insufficient. Intermediate changes In targets and
therefore in the budget were not communicated/recorded in a user-
friendly manner, which made the task of monitoring even harder.
Audit reports were not shared on a regular basis with the co-
financiers, and appeared to be inadequate for a project of this size
and scope, nor was the assessment of the World Bank of these
reports adequately shared with the co-financiers.
Financial reporting by the World Bank to its joint co-financiers on
depletion of the respective Trust Funds at WS, Washington, Ihe
status of claims In the pipeline, and the process leading to requests
for replenishment should be improved. Financial reports prepared by
the PCU were often presented late, and did not always serve as a



51
useful tool for supervision during missions. Follow-up on      Annex 3
recommendations in aide-merpoires on financial matters appeared to  6 of 10
be limited.
Although DGIS and Sida agreed to an extension of the project in
order to ensure proper completion, particularly of the
experimentallinnovative programmes and the NFPE component, it
seemed that little additional effort was put into achieving this, which
resulted in considerable hardship for the involved NGOs and their
students, and a large underspending of Sida and DGIS funds.
Now that the final levels of expenditure in each category are known,
it would be useful to know what are the reasons for the major
differences between the appraisal estimates and the actual
disbursements, which are in several cases considerable (see Table
7C of ICR).
5. Sustainability: - Arguably, GEP's sustainable impact on the
primary education sub-sector would have benefited from a follow -
on programme/project, which was to cover the sub-sectcr with
flexible financing, and which could have started immediately after the
end of the GEP, so as not to loose momentum. Since (his is not the
case, it remains to be seen how the delays and recent developments
in the sub-sector have affected the sustainability of undeniable
achievements under the GEP, and it is therefore difficult to assess
the sustainability of the GEP itself. Relative success still depends to
a large extent on committed individuals, rather than on an adequate
institutional and organizational structure. Training abroad, as part of
the institutional capacity building effort, seems to have had limited
impact, as not always the most relevant individuals were sent for
training, and in some cases trained individuals were transferred
shortly after their return to Bangladesh.
Lessons learnt from the GEP should be used for planning and
resource allocation of future education programmes, however, at
present critical assessment in this context seems lacking.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PRIMARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
LOAN NO. 1026-8AN(SF)
A.    Introduction
1.           The Bank's first Primary Education Sector Project (PESP)' was implemented In
Chittagong division and aimed to (i) increase equitable access; (ii) improve the quality, relevance
and efficiency of primary education: (fli) strengthen management capability and standards; and
(iv) enhance the teaching of population, and environmental education. The Bank's piggy-backed
teohnfical assistance (TA)' helped develop and strengthen the management capability of the
Directorate of Prnmary Education (DPE). The Project succesafully achieved its overall objectives.
B.    Evaluation of the Project
2.           Civil works constituted a major component, comprising the cor.struction,
reconstruction and repair of rural, town and city schools. Against the appraisal target of 2,566
schools, the Project successfully completed a total of 3,207 schools, exceeding by over 25
percent the appraisal target. The Bank approved this additional civil work in order to rehabilitate
many schocis in the Project area which had suffered extensive damages caused by the April
1991 cyclone. Construction of a Divisional Education Office in Chittagong, District and Thana
Education Offices and the upgrading of the primary training institutes were also completed as
per appraisal.
3.           Facilities improvement to the schools significantly Increased the enrollment level.
Sy the end of the Project, the total enrollment had increased by over 34 percent from about 3.53
million (SZ percent boys, 45 percent girls) in 1 990/91 to 4.75 million (53 percent boys, 47 percent
girls) in 1 996. Over SQ percent of the Project schools were in rural and disadvantaged areas
which helped increase equitable access and reduce rural-urban inequities. Moreover, with the
introducticn of the new concept of 'comrnunity schools', constructed on community-donated
land, the Project helped to generate community interest in overall school operations. The
community participation in overall school management has started yielding positive results in
terms of higher enrollment, particularly of girls, reduction in dropouts and higher attendance
rates. The overall gross enrollment in the Project area has increased from about 70 percent
(1 990/91 ) to around 89 percent in 1996. During the Project period (1990-96), the overali dropout
rate declined from 47 percent to 34 percent, and the attendance rate increased from 50 to 89
percent, As all schools are now completed and with new facilities in place, enrollments are
projected to grow steadily over the next 5 years.
4.           Other Important activities implemented under the Project were the establishment
of 56 satellite schools in underserved areas which generated a lot of interest and community
involvement. A nonformal primary education (NFPE) program   was implemented through
nongovernmental organizations in selected thanas for drop-outs of the primary system. A total
Loan No. 1026-SAN(SF): Primary Educatfon Sector Project, for 568.3 million, approved on 21 August 1990
and c:rnpieted In December 1996.
TA Na. 1 359-EAN: Innutona[ Strengthening of the Directorate of Primary Educaton, for r400,000, approved
on 25 Cc.ober 1990.

of 6S,12C N.FPE centers were set up which benefittad about 1 -3,600 students. A large program
(70,336 z:erson-days) of local dissemination training on the new curriculum was provided to
t-a.c-ers and prirnar education officers atvarious levels, and _rientation on school management
f_r sch,_e. managementcommittee(SSMC) members and parent teacher associaticn chairpersons
was alz: successfully completed. About 2.84 million sets of textbooks were provided to the
studernts in the Project area, against the appraisal provisirn of 2.34 million. Oistribution of
tesxt.boos was efficient and books reached schools at the beginning of the Ichool year, The TA
provice5 data base development, orientation of field staff, training of assistant monitoring officers,
fve rssearo,cn projects, a tracer study and benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) piloting in five
distrirc.s, analysis and reporting. A major outcome was the awareness the TA raised of the
weaknesses cf the current data systems and sources; the need for improved decentralized
systerns; a useful BME modei; and the implementa'ion constraints at the local levels.
5.            The Project was originally scheduled for physical completion on 30 November
1 9SiS, wit. t.he loan cicsing on 31 May 1996. With a six-month extension of the loan, the Project
was successfully ccmpleted on 31 December 1996. Although the Project's overall scoce cf work
wa.s fily achieved, there was a loan saving of around $20.0 million, or about 30 percent of the
original can amount. The lcan savings resulted frorn (i) the reclacement of $7 million loan funds
by rant: f_ nds for local training, satellite schools and NFPE; (Ii) the cverestimation of Civil works
cost a: a=.-raisal; and (iii) currency fluctuation due to SDO asopreciation and the dev.iuaticn of
Taka.
C..    Executing Agency Performance
6,      .    The leadership of the Project Implementation Management Unit (FIMU) was initially
weiak due to lack of experience in project management. The problem was, however, overcome
with tte support of the cther qualified operational staff of PIMU and througn graduai.
farniliarization with the Bank's procedures and guidelines. The overall performance of the PIMU
wass e,fective. It competently handled Project implementation in close coilaboration with the
implementing agencies, (i) Local Gcvernment Engineering Department (LGE3) and Facilities
Deparmient responsible for executing the Project's main activity, i.e. civil works, and (ii) the
National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) for provision of textbcoks. P!MU aiso nonitored
the irrmpierentation of the grant financed components of the Project as par, ef GEP.
D.    Lessons Learmed
7.            A number cf Important lessons have been learned from the Project, some of which
concern, general issues of the primray subsector; other are specific to the Project. These issues
are summarized below.
8.            Need for Decentralization. A key lesson Learned is the need to strengthen district,
thana, and community-evel paricipation in the planning and implementation of facilities
developmwrt Wntder PESP, thana education committees (TECa) and SMCs were not involved
to the extent expected in the identiflcation, selection and planning of facilities development, and
the plans fcr schools' improvement went through several approval layers, resulting in dalays, and
occasicnally in inappropriate changes to the plans. The Project wiil adopt a simplitie4 approval
procedure, and provide training to ensure active involvement of TEC, SMC and community
'eat42 in the identification of schools for facilities improvement and various stages of



*  54                            Annex 3

implementation, including direct responsibility for preventive maintenance work and targeted
assistance programs for school supplies.
9.           Inadequate Monitoring at Investments. Project monitoring is improving but there
are sysaematic weaknesses in data-based planning and decision making. AJthough Bangladesh
has received substantial support for school infrastructure over the last decade, there is currently
no organized monitoring of investments in civil works. The Project will strengthen school
perform,ance monitoring and the existing central monitoring and management system and help
establis,n a decentralized management information system (MIS) and monitoring aysterm.
10.          Need for Improved Ste Selection. Some new PESP schools were constructed
inapprccriately on low tying or unstable land donated by the community, In other caces, new
schoc's were built on sites where existing buildings could have been reconstructed or extehded,
resulti,ng in loss of useable space. Better planning of the facilities is needed, e,g., to allow vertical
extension or future addition of classrooms as required by the student population. There i also
a need tc allow the flexibility to adapt standard school designs to meet local conditions and
without any sharp distinction between urban and rural schools. In PESP this distinction proved
to be inzppropriate in many per-urban thanas that are classilled as rural but have the
charact.arl,tics of urban areas. The proposad Project will strictly adhere to the techniical and
topographical suitability of the sites to be certified by LGED, and will adopt flexibility in
construction design to meet local conditions,
11.          Delayed Appointment of Teachers. Because of lack of advance planning,
appointments of teachers to the newly constructed schools were very much dela-ad under
PESP: In same cases, teachers were not deployed even within 1-2 years after the ccnstruction
of schools. The Project will closely monitor appointments and link the scope of the ct 1struction
of new schcols to timely appointment of teachers,
12.          Inadequate Supernision and Maintenance of Facilities. Because o' the large
number of individual contract packages and their scattered locations, there was inadequate
supervision of work at the construction sites. Some facilities constructed under the PFSP have
already t eagun to deteriorate because the initial construction was of poor quality. In otner cases,
lack of ct eventive and routine maintenance led to early deterioration of the facilities. Te address
these concems, the Project provides lccal consultants for construction supervision, and supports
a prevernive maintenance program, including the preparation of a Maintenance Master Plan.
13.          Low StudentAchievement, In spite of increased enrollment and reduced drop-out
rates during PESP and GEP, student achievement was still very poor. There is a need to couple
quantitatve expansion with improved quality measures and a focus on outcomes. Poliance on
a single taXtbook, inadequately trained, supervised and supported teachers, and the lack of SMC
involvement contribute to poor student performances. Therefore, the Project will 1linance (i)
IParvsvd ahysical environment: (ii) the professional development of teachers through subcluster
inservice training anc an improvel supervison system: (i!i) a greater variety and quality of
teaching and learning resources; (iv) decentralized planning, management and monitoring, and
(v) a revisssd, more relevant curriculum. In addition, to assess to the students' learnins outcome,
the Project will establish an Assessment Cell at NCTS and support national sample testfng of
grades 3 and 5 In core subjects.
