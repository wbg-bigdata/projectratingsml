IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan 2910-MOR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Distribution Project in
Morocco for which Loan 2910-MOR in the amount of US$90 million was approved on February
16, 1988 and made effective on May 9, 1990. The loan was closed on June 30, 1996, one year
later than originally envisaged, at which time the undisbursed amount of US$12.79 million was
canceled. The last disbursement was made on November 5, 1996.
The ICR was prepared by Alvaro J. Covarrubias, Consultant, under the supervision of
Jorge A. Larrieu, Principal Power Engineer. The ICR was reviewed by Amir Al-Khafaji, Division
Chief, Private Sector Development, Finances and Infrastructure, and Rene Costa, Project
Advisor, Maghreb and Iran Department. The Borrower and Beneficiaries provided comments
which are incorporated in the ICR as Appendix B.
Preparation of the ICR began during a mission carried out by Mr. Covarrubias in
December 1996 (Appendix A: ICR Mission Aide Memoire). It is based on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the loan and project agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower (the Government) and beneficiaries (ONE, RAD, RADEEF, RADEEM and
RAK), internal Bank memoranda, and interviews with Bank and Borrower officials and staff
involved in project implementation. The Borrower provided a project completion report on the
components carried out by RAK, RADEEM and RADEEF. Additionally, ONE and RAD,
directly provided the Bank with completion reports on the implementation of their components.

POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan 2910-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The broad objectives of the project were to: (a) encourage the power subsector to satisfy
growing electricity demand at least cost and without deterioration in quality of service; (b)
achieve financial and managerial autonomy for the National Electricity Office (Office National de
I' Electricite, ONE), and the municipal distribution utilities, (referred to as Regies); and (c) reduce
Government contributions to ONE. The institutional development objectives of the project were
to assist in implementing policy actions derived from studies carried out under the Public
Enterprise Rationalization Loan (PERL, Loan 2820-MOR) and assist ONE and the Regies in
improving their management, planning, accounting, technical capabilities and financial
performance (paras. 3-5).
2.    To achieve these objectives, the project included components for ONE and the R6gies of
Casablanca, Fes, Kenitra, Meknes, and Tetouan, comprising: construction and rehabilitation of
power transformer substations; extension and rehabilitation of distribution networks; rehabilitation
of thermal power plants; acquisition of equipment for hot line maintenance, telecontrol and
communication; and various studies to find solutions to ONE's operational and managerial
problems. The project's objectives were relevant to the power subsector of Morocco. They were
congruent with the Government's and the Bank's policy for the power subsector prevailing at that
time. The project focused on power distribution because in 1986 Morocco's per capita
consumption of electricity (343 kWh) was the fifth lowest in the MENA region and the majority
of the population lacked --and still lacks-- access to electricity service (paras. 6-9).
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Physical objectives were partially achieved. ONE completed the rehabilitation of thermal
plants, introduced hot line maintenance equipment, and achieved most of the communication
components but completed only 88 percent of the power distribution part financed by the loan.
While RADEEF, RADEEM, and RAK almost fully completed their components by end of 1995,
RAD completed only 75 percent of its project component. The RDE (T6touan) component was
withdrawn and the funds were reallocated to ONE to do sector related studies. Overall, 85
percent of the physical components were completed, 90,000 new consumers were added, and
some improvements were made in the efficiency of ONE's thermal power plants (paras. 10-25).



iii
4.    Institutional objectives were partially achieved. The project accomplished very little in
improving financial and managerial autonomy of ONE and the Regies. Until 1993 cash generation
made it possible for ONE to self-finance less than 19 percent of its annual investment program (in
1992 it was not able to self-finance any portion of this program). Since 1994 cash generation has
financed 30 percent or more of ONE's investment program because of less investment, less fuel
consumption, more hydroelectric generation, and more revenues from a boost in sales and tariffs.
Accounts receivable of ONE and the Regies were very large until 1992 (in the range 9.2-9.5
months) and declined steadily to 4.7 months in 1996, yet remained far from good practice of 45 to
60 days. The Offices, which represent about 10 percent of ONE's sales, account for more than 20
percent of the arrears The Regies buy about 50 percent of ONE's output and have arrears to ONE
as high as 6-10 months (paras. 26-32).
5.    Electricity tariffs. The level and distorted structure of the tariffs prevailing during the period
1988-1995 were not appropriate to recover cost based on economic principles nor were they sufficient
to meet the self-financing ratio in every year. Tariffs had remained at an average of DH 0.8 5/kWh
(about 10 UScents per kWh) since 1992. Tariffs had subsidized residential consumption of up to 500
kWh per month (industrial and commercial consumers bearing the difference) and differentiated tariffs
applied to bulk sales to the Regies were inconsistent with the uniform tariff schedule applied to the end
consumer countrywide. The tariff schedule effective since 1996 has eliminated part of these problems:
average tariff was increased by 6 percent, the same tariff will be gradually applicable to all Regies, and
the subsidy limit is now lowered to 200 kWh per month for domestic consumers (nonetheless still
high). Moreover, it would be desirable for the Government to adopt a policy to index tariffs to pass to
consumers changes in fuel prices, exchange rates, and inflation (para. 36).
6.    Project costs andfinancing. The project was completed at a cost of US$135.4 million,
or 19.1 percent below the appraisal estimate of US$167.4 million. The decrease is explained by
ONE's significant lower investment in distribution and thermal equipment and by a slight decrease
in distribution investment by the Regies. The Bank loan financed US$77.2 million, or 57 percent
of project financing requirements. ONE financed US$40.6 million (30 percent), and the Regies
financed the balance US$17.6 million (13 percent) (paras. 38-39).
7.    Project economic performance. The project's economic performance was reevaluated
using the method described in the SAR, i.e. calculating the internal rate of return of the stream of
net benefits of ONE and the Regies over the period 1988-2021. The result is a project economic
rate of return lower than the appraisal estimate (9.8 versus 12.4 percent), mainly because of lower
sales and tariffs (as a proxy for project benefits) than estimated at appraisal (paras. 40-41).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    The major factors affecting the achievement of program objectives were tepid commitment
by the Government to implement measures that would make ONE and the Regies more
autonomous, slow procurement of goods and services, and uncontrollable natural events (the
1992-1995 drought that drastically reduced hydroelectric generation). The Government was
committed to the implementation of the physical part of the project but tepid in implementing the
measures needed to improve the power subsector performance. For example, it did not provide



iv
financial and management autonomy to ONE and the Regies, nor did allow the cost of service to
be fully recovered through an appropriate level and structure of tariffs, nor did it pay off its
arrears. It fail to simplify the bureaucratic procedures, in particular those affecting procurement of
goods and services as well as disbursement of funds (paras. 42-43).
9.    ONE-Government Contract Program. The 1989-1991 Contract Program did not achieve
the objective of improving the finances of ONE. The revised Contract Program for 1993-1995
achieved part of its objectives: tariffs were increased in 1994 and 1996 and measures were taken
to decrease arrears (paras. 34-35).
10.   Procurement of goods and services had an initial delay of about one year because the
Moroccan bidding documents did not fully meet the Bank's procurement guidelines. The
Moroccan Government refused to follow the Bank guidelines requiring a bid security issued by a
bank (foreign or local) elected by the bidder. In order not to delay procurement, the Bank had to
accept the Moroccan practice of requiring by law a bid security issued by a local bank and a
deposit of 10 percent of the bid security in the Treasury. Although standard bidding documents
were subsequently agreed upon with the Bank, procurement was later slowed down by
cumbersome bureaucratic procedures within the beneficiaries; and by slow approval of relatively
large contracts by the Government. Also, inadequate procurement arrangements created a large
number of small contracts (about 340 contracts) many of them under local competitive bidding
which, inter alia, burdened supervision by the Bank (paras. 44-46).
11.   Loan disbursement was very slow. Disbursements began with a delay of more than 2
years and reached a cumulative level of less than 3 percent of the appraisal estimate three years
after loan approval. This was caused by the 27 month delay in making the loan effective and the
initial procurement problems. Taking into consideration that in June 1995 the sector began to
show progress on reforms and financial matters, the Bank extended the loan closing date by one
year to June 30, 1996. At that time hardly 60 percent of the loan was disbursed, but procurement
was expedited and US$77.2 million (86 percent of the loan) had been disbursed when the last
disbursement occurred on November 5, 1996 (paras. 47-48).
Bank Performance
12.   Project identification was deficient. The Bank staff identified and prepared the project as
a power subsector adjustment loan. However, at time of project appraisal the Loan Committee
instructed the staff to appraise it as a mere power distribution investment project and rely on
conditionalities to improve the institutional aspects of the sector that were already part of the
PERL. That led to a project whose major conditionalities were elsewhere, and a poor design of
the procurement of goods and services. During project preparation the Bank provided
satisfactory support to the Government, ONE, and the Regies, but appraisal of the project by the
Bank is deemed deficient (para. 50-51).
13.   Bank supervision was mixed, but overall it was marginally satisfactory. After loan
approval, several supervision missions were lax in recommending remedies when the Borrower
was in noncompliance with guidelines applicable to Bank loans: during 16 months the



v
Government avoided signing the loan agreement and it took an additional 11 months to meet the
conditions of effectiveness. Perhaps the Bank would have been more effective in expediting
project implementation by threatening to cancel the loan in 1989. Until 1993, Bank supervision
continued to be deficient: little pressure was exerted upon the Government and beneficiaries to
meet the institutional objectives of the project. In 1993 Bank supervision improved as it reacted
and reallocated project funds to carry out additional studies intended to enhance the sector. It
gave good advice, not always heeded by the Government, about the importance of increasing
electricity tariffs and eliminating subsidies at a fast pace, and of giving full autonomy to ONE as a
way to improve its financial and operational performance (paras.52-53).
Borrower Performance
14.   Project preparation by the Borrower (the Government) and the beneficiaries (ONE and the
Regies) was very slow but satisfactory. It took the Borrower about two years to prepare the project
and 27 months to meet the conditions for loan effectiveness. On the institutional development front,
until 1993 the Government was lax in increasing tariffs and in taking measures to reduce the arrears
due to ONE and the Regies. It was not until 1994 and 1996 that the Government approved tariff
adjustments allowing ONE to be in compliance with the self-financing covenant, and established tariff
margins enabling the Regies improve their financial situation. But it did not devolve power to ONE,
which would have enabled to become autonomous in managing its operations and finances. All of the
above dwarfs the good accomplishments (albeit with delays) by ONE and the Regies in imnlementing
85 percent of the physical components of the project. Consequently, Borrower performance in project
implementation is deemed deficient on account of the unsatisfactory performance of the Government
and the marginally satisfactory performance of the beneficiaries (paras. 54- 57).
Project Sustainability
15.   Prospectsfor the project to be sustainable are uncertain because: (i) the tariff margin
given to most Regies is not yet enough, in some instances, to cover even their investment and
operating costs; (ii) the reorganization of ONE is still on-going and full satisfactory results are yet
to be shown; and (iii) some of the measures (reduction of arrears, enacting of the Electricity
Code) contemplated under a proposed power sector loan (Power Sector Reform Project,
appraised in March 1996) have not yet been implemented (para. 58).
Project Outcome
16.   The outcome of the project is unsatisfactory because: (i) physical achievements were
partial; (ii) the economic rate of return of the project (9.8 percent) was lower than the appraisal
estimate (12.4 percent); (iii) the finances of ONE and the Regies were only partially improved
with some key indicators of financial performance (mainly tariffs to the Regies and the arrears due
to ONE and the Regies) remaining below targets; (iv) coordination among the sector entities
continues to be weak; and (v) sustainabilitry of the project is uncertain (para. 59).



vi
Future Project Operation
17.   Several measures recently taken or to be taken by the Government, ONE, and the Regies in the
areas of sector reform, private participation, arrears, and sector monitoring and evaluation would
reflect a satisfactory plan for fuiture project operation. The Government is considering implementing
several reforms (through a Power Sector Reform project, appraised by the Bank in March 1996)
which aims to restructure the Moroccan power sector (separating the regulatory and policy making
role of the Government from the commercial functions of power generation, transmission, and
distribution, to enable efficient private participation in the sector through fair competition). Also, the
proposed IPP at Jorf Lasfar (the Bank would provide a Partial Risk Guarantee for this operation) is
another good example of opening the sector to private operators. Moreover, in 1996 ONE initiated a
reorganization. Although the decentralization of activities (the first phase of the ONE's reorganization)
and the appointment of new directors and managers slowed operations initially, it was followed by the
injection of a new dynamic to ONE's operations. On the pervasive problem of arrears, ONE and the
Regies have initiated aggressive measures to abate them, such as cutting service to delinquent
ciustomers, replacing the monthly billing with a quarterly billing system, and rescheduling payments of
arrears with entities providing essential economic benefits for which cutting service is not an option
(pas. 60-64).
Key Lessons Learned
18.   The following main lessons can be drawn from the project (para. 66):
Lesson 1. Bank management and staff should strictly enforce the Bank's guidelines for project
processing to avoid problems during project implementation. For example, in cases when
signature of the loan and its effectiveness take excessively long time, there is an obvious lack of
commitment by the Borrower to the project's objectives, the Bank should cancel a loan having
excessive delays in effectiveness.
Lesson 2. Bank management and staff should strictly enforce compliance with critical
covenants to prevent the project from deviating from its objectives and, to preserve Bank
credibility. For example, in this project Bank management and staff were tepid in enforcing
covenants in tariffs and accounts receivable and, as a consequence of noncompliance with
those important covenants, the financial problems of the power subsector persisted throughout
implementation.
Lesson 3. Project design should avoid procurement arrangements involving: (i) allocation of
small amounts of funds to many beneficiaries; and (ii) local competitive bidding for small
construction services (it invites the Borrower to split procurement among a large number of
contracts to favor local contracting). As was the case in this project, that situation introduces
implementation delays and high costs of coordinating and supervising suppliers.
Lesson 4. With hindsight, projects with many institutional development objectives should
have all the reform measures and related covenants included in one loan covering all the
activities of the target institution and not dispersed among other operations.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan 2910-MOR)
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    The degree of electrification in Morocco is low compared to other Middle East and North
Africa countries. Electricity consumption per capita is now about 455 kWh (it was 343 kWh in
1986), reflecting a low level of rural electrification. This value is low compared to 650 kWh in
Algeria, 669 kWh in Tunisia, 755 kWh in Egypt, and 1,016 in Jordan. It is growing at an annual
rate of about 5.7 percent.
2.    During the period 1973-1992 the Bank made five loans to Morocco's power subsector of
Morocco totaling US$320 million. These have assisted Morocco in developing thermal and
hydroelectric generation, transmission system, power distribution, and rural electrification. These
loans have also attempted to improve the organization of the Moroccan power subsector and its
economic, operational, and financial performance. In particular, the ongoing loan 3262-MOR
(Rural Electrification Project approved in 1992) followed and largely overlapped with loan 2910-
MOR (the subject of this ICR). These two loans have common objectives regarding the
institutional side of the power sector.
Project Objectives and Components
3.    The broad objectives of the project were to: (a) encourage the power sub-sector to satisfy
growing electricity demand caused by economic growth at least cost and without deterioration in
quality of service; (b) achieve financial and managerial autonomy for the National Electricity
Office (Office National de 1' Electricite, ONE), and the municipal distribution utilities, (referred to
as Regies); and (c) reduce Government contributions to ONE.
4.    The institutional development objectives of the project were to assist in implementing
policy actions derived from studies carried out under the Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan
(PERL, Loan 2820-MOR)1 and assist ONE and the Regies in improving their management,
1 The PERL committed the Government to develop and furnish to the Bank by September 1988, a proposal of
policies and procedures for the oversight of ONE, and by January 1, 1989 and after exchanging views with
ONE and the Bank, implement these policies and procedures. It also committed ONE to prepare and, by
October 31, 1988, furnish to the Bank for review and comments a three-year, corporate development plan
setting forth its development objectives and performance targets and actions to achieve them. By November
30, 1988 and after exchanging views with the Government and the Bank, conclude arrangements with the



2
planning, accounting, technical capabilities, and financial performance. These objectives were to
be met through actions specified and covenanted in the loan agreement and its subsidiary
agreements.
5.    The physical objectives of the project were to support ONE and the Regies in: (i)
rehabilitating and upgrading their existing facilities with a view to reducing energy losses,
improving the reliability and quality of service and saving investment in new capacity that would
otherwise be needed; and (ii) expanding their networks at least cost, enabling extension of
electricity service to a greater share of the population.
6.    To achieve these objectives the project included components for ONE and the R6gies of
Casablanca, Fes, Kenitra, Meknes, and Tetouan, as follows:
(a) construction of one new substation (225/20kV - 160MVA), reinforcement of four
existing substations (60/20kV -11 OMVA), rehabilitation of two substations (60/20kV -
240MVA), and construction and reinforcement of distribution stations (20/0.380kV,
totaling about 250 MVA) involving the supply and installation of about 750 transformers
and about six stations (20kV);
(b) network extension and rehabilitation of old distribution networks involving about 900
km of 20-kV lines and cables, about 1,700 km of low voltage cables, and about 90,000
electricity meters;
(c) construction of about 50,000 square meters of space for ONE's operations centers
consisting of customer service offices, warehouses, workshops, training centers, and
housing;
(d) import of spare parts and replacement items required for thermal plants,
(e) materials, equipment, utility vehicles, and training for hot line work;
(f) tele-protection and telecommunication equipment, computer hardware and software,
training material, training fellowships; and
(g) studies to: (i) develop an improved information system for ONE's investment planning;
(ii) identify, evaluate and recommend measures to improve the organization and efficient
operation of ONE's distribution department; and (iii) identify, evaluate, and recommend
least-cost equipment norms and work practices for ONE's distribution system.
7.    The project, once completed, was to connect to the main grid some 90,000 new
customers, improve the availability of power facilities and the quality of service, contribute to the
Government to implement the corporate plan. The plan and the procedures and policies were to be included
in a contract-program between ONE and the Government.

reduction of distribution losses, and improve the planning, managerial, and financial capabilities of
the beneficiaries.
8.    The project's objectives were relevant to the power subsector of Morocco. They were
congruent with those pursued by the Government and the Bank policies for the power subsector
prevailing at that time.2 The objectives were clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report. One of
the important reasons why the project focused on power distribution was that in 1986 Morocco's
per capita consumption of electricity, 343 kWh, was the fifth lowest in the MENA region and the
majority of the population lacked (and still lacks) access to electricity service. Also, because of
the lack of coordination among the utilities operating in the sub-sector, it was appropriate to
include ONE and the main Regies in the project.
9.    With the benefit of hindsight it can be stated that the original project's components were
appropriate to achieve the physical objective of extending electricity service (ideally at least cost)
but they were not suitable to pursue the important institutional development objectives of
improving sector coordination, giving financial and operational autonomy to ONE and the Regies,
and improving their management and operational performance. That is why, during project
implementation, the Government and ONE agreed with the Bank on the allocation of funds to
finance studies (on the Electricity Code, organization of ONE, IPPs) to enhance sector
performance. The actions taken as a result of the studies somehow improved ONE's finances and
autonomy from the Government toward the end of the project. However, since the Regies were
already beneficiaries of Bank assistance in the water sector, it would have been preferable to lend
to the Regies for both sectors (this would have given the Bank more leverage in handling these
entities).
B. Achievement of Objectives
Implementation Organization
10.   Physical components were implemented by each beneficiary i.e., ONE, RAD, RAK,
RADEEF and RADEEM. Each Regie set up a project coordination unit. In ONE, the
distribution component was assigned to a Project Unit in the Distribution Department and the
rehabilitation of thermal generation plants, the communication equipment, and the high voltage
hot line equipment components were assigned to corresponding departments. In ONE, overall
project coordination and financial matters were handled by its Finance Department. Loan
disbursement was handled by ONE's Treasury Department. With respect to the Regies, loan
disbursement and financial matters were coordinated by the Directorate of Distribution and
Concessions at the Ministry of Interior and Information. Physical components are expected to be
completed, with a delay of two years, by the end of 1997.
2  The Bank's policy for the electric power sub-sector prevailing in 1988 is detailed in OMS 3.72.



4
Physical Objectives
11.   Physical objectives were partially achieved. ONE completed the rehabilitation of thermal
plants, the introduction of hot line maintenance equipment, and most of the communication
components but completed only 88 percent of the power distribution part financed by the loan.
While RADEEF, RADEEM, and RAK almost fully completed their components by the end of
1995, RAD completed only about 75 percent of its project component. The RDE (Tetouan)
component was withdrawn and the funds were reallocated to ONE for doing additional studies.
12.   ONE-Distribution: Under the project fewer medium-voltage lines were reinforced as
compared with the appraisal estimate (392 km versus 730 km), significantly more low-voltage
lines (1,484 km versus 1,260 km), but less than half the distribution substations appraised (319
versus 690 substations), and built about 45,000 sq. meters (50,000 sq. meters were appraised). It
connected about 90,000 new customers. The decreases are explained by: (i) overestimates made
at appraisal; (ii) the postponement of non-priority works; and (iii) the cancellation of underground
medium-voltage lines in relatively small villages.
13.   ONE-number of new connections: Connections increased from 677,000 in 1988 to
1,208,000 in 1996, an increase of 531,000 or 78.4 percent (a cumulative annual growth rate of
6.6 percent). The project contributed 90,000 new connections to this increase, equivalent to
about 17 percent of the total increase.
14.   ONE-rehabilitation of thermalplants: This component was fully and satisfactorily
completed. However, the loan financed only about 85 percent of its cost because ONE had to
acquire some urgently needed equipment and material without a prior no objection by the Bank.
15.   ONE-protection/communication/carrier equipment: Only 50 line carrier links were
installed because the supplier failed to supply the 70 contracted. Tele-control of 13 points was
added and 29 switchboards were commissioned.
16.   ONE-hot line maintenance equipment: Albeit with some delay, the equipment and utility
vehicles for doing hot line maintenance work on 225-kV and 60-kV lines were commissioned,
personnel were trained, and, by mid-1996, this component became fully operational. This
equipment is helping ONE improve the maintenance and operational conditions of its high voltage
network.
17.   RAD: This Regie expanded the transformation capacity of the 220/20 kV substations Sidi
Othman and Dar Bouazza by 240 MVA (160 MVA guaranteed), and rehabilitated 80 MVA and 240
MVA, respectively, at the 220 kV and 60 kV Oulad Haddou and ADE, Camiran, and Chavigne.
Regarding low voltage distribution, RAD added 136,320 consumer meters a figure that well exceeds
the 86,000 meters estimated at appraisal. With agreement of the Bank, the 290 km underground cable
extension was abandoned (instead overhead distribution lines were constructed), and an 80 MVA
transformer was purchased using proceeds of the loan. Overall RAD completed about 75 percent of
the physical components financed by the loan.



5
18.   RADEEF: This R6gie completed the Narjiss and Zouaghas distributors and the 20 kV feeder
expansions, as considered at appraisal, but canceled those at Bensouda; instead the Fes-South
substation was expanded (SF6 power circuit breakers and a calibration desk).
19.   RADEEM: The main components (reinforcement of the Zehrom substation and acquisition of
circuit breakers, transformers, meters, cables and hardware) were completed with some minor changes
and about one year's delay when compared to the project appraisal.
20.   RAK: The main components were also completed with some changes and about one year's
delay when compared to the appraisal (reinforcement of the substations Maamotra and Fouarat,
extension and reinforcement of switching substations, and acquisition of cables, measurement
instruments and a meter calibration bench).
21.   RDE: This component was canceled and the funds reallocated to finance consultant services
for additional studies for the Government and ONE (on the Electricity Code, asset insurance, IPPs,
stock control, ONE reorganization)
ONE: Technical Operations
22.   In spite of past financial problems, the technical operations of ONE have somehow improved.
Electricity production increased steadily from 7,710 GWh in 1988 to 12,330 GWh in 1996 (average
growth of 5.7 percent per year), including electricity imports from Algeria and purchase from local
suppliers (Table 1.1). The imports and local purchases increased to about 11 percent of total electricity
output during the dry hydrology experienced in years 1992-1994, especially in 1993 when the
hydroelectric plants delivered only one third of their average generation.
23.   With respect to physical expansion of the power system, ONE's installed capacity grew from
1,952 MW in 1988 to 3,414 MW in 1995 (average growth of 8.3 percent per year) of which 3,019
MW is guaranteed because a substantial part of the increase was in gas turbines (Table 1.2). A major
capacity addition to the system occurred in 1995-1996 with the commissioning of the JorfLasfar
thermal power plant. Also, the transmission and distribution systems were significantly extended
during the period 1988-1995, with the addition of 1,316 km of 220-kV lines; 1,009 km of 60-kV lines;
6,362 km of distribution lines, 1,534 MVA in 220-kV and 60-kV power transformers; and a large
number of high and medium-voltage substations (Table 1.3).
24.   Energy losses. Distribution losses have remained on the order of 9-10 percent in RAK,
RADEEM and RADEEF, and about 6 percent in RAD. ONE is making an effort to keep distribution
losses in the range 6-7 percent, which is considered the economic level for large distribution systems.
ONE will benefit from the implementation of the recommendations made by the EdF/ESMAP loss
reduction study (a one percent reduction in energy losses could save ONE about DH 32 million/year).
ONE's losses in power plants (due mainly to consumption by auxiliary services) and its high voltage
transmission system are in line with utility experience elsewhere and do not pose a particular problem.
25.   Some improvement was achieved in the efficiency of thermal plants. Oil and coal steam
plants decreased fuel consumption to 2,444 kCal/kWh in 1995 from 2,542 kCal/kWh in 1991 (a



6
3.9 percent improvement). This improvement was due mainly to the commissioning of the Jorf
Lasfar coal-fired thermal power plant, which has a lower specific coal consumption. Also, gas
turbines decreased their fuel consumption to 3,228 kCal/kWh in 1995 from 3,491 kCal/kWh in
1991 (a 7.5 percent improvement) because of the installation of more efficient gas turbines.
Similarly, diesel plants improved to 2,156 kCal/kWh from 2,513 kCal/kWh (14.2 percent
improvement). For all plants combined, the average fuel consumption improved to 2,499
kCal/kWh in 1995 from 2,588 kCal/kWh in 1991 (a 3.4 percent improvement).

Institutional Objectives
26.   Institutional objectives were partially achieved. The project accomplished very little in
improving the financial and managerial autonomy of ONE and the Regies, as indicated below.
27.   ONE 'sfinancial performance. Although in recent years the self financing and the debt
service coverage improved and reached the covenanted targets, the accounts receivable and
arrears to ONE remained very high and never met the covenanted targets. Also, tariff levels and
structures were not set in accordance with LRMC principles, nor were they adjusted timely when
changes occurred in fuel oil and coal prices.
28.   ONE's selffinancing and debt service coverage. Until 1993 cash generation enabled
ONE to finance less than 19 percent of its annual investment program (in 1992 it did not finance
any). Only in 1994 did cash generation begin to finance 30 or more percent of ONE's investment
program because of less investment, less fuel consumption (and more hydroelectric generation)
once the drought was over, and more revenues from a boost in sales and tariffs. Until 1992 debt
service coverage was adequate. Although in 1993 and 1994 the debt service coverage ratio was



8
below 1.5, ONE did not default on this covenant. In 1995 and 1996 ONE's debt service coverage
again met an acceptable target (Table 1.4).

29.   Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable and arrears have become a chronic problem for
ONE and the Regies. They were very large until 1992 (in the range 9.2-9.5 months) and declined
steadily to 4.7 months in 1996, yet are still far from the two months required by the Bank (Table
1.5). Although ONE has made a considerable effort to reduce them (it rescheduled 90 percent of
the arrears of small, non-solvent communities and that of ONCF and ONEP) until early 1997, no
satisfactory plan to reduce arrears of the Regies to acceptable levels has been submitted to the
Bank. (submission of this plan is a condition for negotiation of the Power Sector Reform Loan).
To reduce arrears, ONE will replace monthly billing with quarterly billing to the Administration
and cut service to delinquent customers. It should be noted that the purchase contract for private
power, possibly starting by mid- 1997, will require ONE to pay invoices to the private operator
within 45 days. Consequently, if electricity bills are not paid to ONE in full and on time, ONE's
finances will be in jeopardy.
Table 1.5: ONE's accounts receivable (1991-1996)

1991               4.5         9.2

1993               4.8          8.5

1995               3.9          5.8
1996               3.4          4.7
30.   The Regies buy about 50 percent of ONE's output and payment of their electricity bills is
very important for ONE's finances. In this regard, it has been very difficult to reduce the arrears
of RAD and RADEEM, which have exceeded 6 months and 10 months, respectively. Their
arrears to ONE are explained by: (i) the insufficient margins between the bulk tariffs of ONE and



9
the retail tariffs; and (ii) the poor payment records to the Regies by the Administration and local
governments. The Regies have initiated new measures to improve collection rates, primarily by
cutting service to all delinquent customers. The results were effective in 1994, but the measures
lost momentum in 1995 and 1996.
31.   The Offices, which represent about 10 percent of ONE's sales, account for more than 20
percent of arrears. These are mainly the railways, the water utility, and the phosphate concerns,
which were reported to be incurring in heavy losses. Because of the economic importance of
these companies they have not been disconnected from electric service. Payment of their arrears
has been rescheduled.
32.   The Administration and local governments have always had a poor payment record. In
1992-93 the Government initiated a coupon system (vignettes) earmarked for the payment of
utility bills, which, however, proved to be insufficient to cover electricity bills.
33.   Financial management: After much prodding from the Bank, ONE agreed to conduct
studies on risk assessment (its assets are not insured) and stock control. In April 1996, foreign
consultants issued a report on asset insurance, their recommendations will be implemented during
1997 following internal consultation. Also, local and foreign consultants reviewed the stock
control management and recommended changing over to a more efficient system (particularly the
procurement of equipment and spare parts for the operational units), which is now being put in
place. External auditing of accounts is done routinely.
34.   ONE 's Contract Program: To improve the financial situation of ONE, the Contract
Program for 1989-1991 specified the measures to be taken by the Government and the
complementary actions to be taken by ONE. This Contract Program did not achieve its
objectives. Since the Government did not meet its commitments, ONE, in turn, could not meet its
requirements, as indicated below.
The Government: (a) did not introduce a new tariff structure based on LRMC principles (a
study began in 1988 and by end 1991 was not finished); (b) did not increase tariffs by 5
percent in May 1989, January 1990, or January 1991 (no adjustment in 1989, only 4.5
percent in 1990, and no adjustment in 1991); (c) did not pay off existing arrears to ONE
nor prevent accumulation of new arrears (by end 1991 arrears to ONE were about 9.2
months of billing); and (d) did not increase financial autonomy by reducing controls
(while approval by the General Comptroller was mandatory for large contracts only,
clearance by the General Accountant continued to be mandatory for all cash transactions).
ONE: (a) invested only DH7,400 million over the period 1989-1991 and not the DH8,700
million target; (b) was unable to finance its capital expenses as agreed (ONE's cash
generation was DH2,700 million or well below the DH4,400 million target; ONE
borrowed DH3,900 million instead of the DH4,900 million target; it was unable to reduce
the accounts receivable to two months: arrears mounted to 9.2 months of billing by end
1991).



10
35.   ONE's financial situation was reviewed in 1992. It led to a revised Contract Program for
1993-1995 which set up the measures to be taken by the Government on tariffs, contribution to
investment, and pay-off of arrears, as well as complementary actions to be carried out by ONE.
The objectives of the revised Contract Program were partially achieved; in 1994 and 1996, the
Government authorized appropriate increases in electricity tariffs and initiated measures to reduce
the arrears due to ONE, which was reduced to 4.7 months by end 1996.
36.   Electricity tariffs. The level and distorted structure of the tariffs prevailing during the period
1988-1995 were not appropriate to recover cost based on economic principles or sufficient to meet the
debt service coverage and self financing ratio in every year. They had remained at an average of DH
0.85/kWh (about 10 UScents per kWh) since 1992. Tariffs had subsidized consumption of up to 500
kWh per month (industrial and commercial consumers bearing the difference) and differentiated tariffs
applied to bulk sales to the Regies were inconsistent with the uniform tariff schedule applied to the end
consumer countrywide (tables 1.6 and Table 1.7). The small tariff margins for the Regies compounded
with the high level of accounts receivable, have been stressing their finances to the limit. The tariff
schedule effective since 1996 has eliminated some of these problems: the average tariff was increased
by 6 percent, the same tariff will be gradually applicable to all Regies, and the first and second block of
domestic consumption (subsidized) limits were set at 100 and 200 kWh per month, which nonetheless
still high (Table 1.8). Moreover, it would be desirable to adopt a policy to index tariffs to pass to pass
changes in fuel prices, rate of exchange and inflation, on to consumers.

Training
37.   The training component was vaguely defined in the SAR and, despite the specific assistance
given by a Bank specialist during project supervision, neither ONE or the Regies were able to define a
training program for their staff. This was so because donor countries (France, Canada, and Italy) made
available training programs under bilateral agreements at better financial terms than the Bank, most of
them non-reimbursable. Thus the training component included in the loan, other than providing
training to ONE's operational staff on hot line maintenance, had a negligible impact on ONE and the
Regies. Consequently, funds allocated in the loan for staff training were not utilized.
Project Costs
38.   The project was completed at a cost of US$135.37 million, or 19.1 percent below the
appraisal estimate of US$167.37 million. The decrease is explained by the significantly lower
investment in distribution and thermal equipment done by ONE (about 22 percent below the
appraisal estimate), and by a slight decrease (5.4 percent less) in distribution investment done by
the Regies, in particular the cancellation of the US$2.72 million component of RDE (Tetouan). It
should be noted that the total project cost was only about 3.1 percent of the 1988-1996
investment program of ONE and the Regies combined.
Project Financing.
39.   The Bank financed US$77.21 million (57.0 percent of the US$135.37 million project
financing requirement). ONE financed US$40.58 million (30 percent), and the Regies financed
the balance US$17.58 million (13.0 percent). Contribution of local funds to project financing was
not a problem since it represented about 1.4 percent of the financing requirements of the 1988-
1996 investment program of ONE and the Regies combined.
Project Economic Performance.
40.   The project's economic performance was reevaluated using the method described in the
SAR, i.e., by calculating the internal rate of return of the stream of net benefits. Net benefits of
the program were taken as the difference between (a) the actual incremental revenues plus
rehabilitation benefits, and (b) the actual investment program of ONE and estimated programs for
the Regies, plus fuel costs and operating and maintenance expenses (O&M) over the period 1988-
2021 (Part II, Table 9). The result is an economic rate of return lower than the appraisal estimate
(9.8 versus 12.4 percent)
41.   Since the information on the Regies' actual investments is very incomplete (moreover, the
Regie of Tetouan was removed from the project), their investment program over the period 1988-
1996 was assumed to be about 10 percent of ONE's investment program, which is consistent with
the estimate made in the SAR. The rehabilitation benefits were estimated as 1.2 percent of sales
(the same proxy used in the appraisal), incremental O&M costs were the actual costs over the
period 1988-1996, and estimated for 1997 and beyond. Incremental fuel costs were the actual
costs for the period 1988-1996 and were estimated for 1997 and beyond by taking fuel prices



14
equivalent to US$180/ton for fuel oil and US$60/ton for coal. While less thermal generation
decreased fuel consumption in 1993, ONE's O&M costs increased significantly due to additional
gas turbine based generation and to power purchases from Algeria (at 4 UScents/kWh). Also, the
additional purchases from autoproducers is reflected in higher operating costs beyond 1997.
Actual benefits are lower than the appraisal estimate because of lower actual sales and tariffs.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
42.   The major factors affecting the achievement of project objectives were the Government's
tepid commitment to implementing measures which would provide autonomy to ONE, slow
procurement of goods and services and an uncontrollable natural event (the 1992-1995 drought
that reduced hydroelectric generation).
43.   The Government was committed to implementing the physical part of the project but tepid
in implementing the measures needed to improve performance in the power subsector e.g., it did
not provide financial and management autonomy to ONE, nor did it allow the cost of service to
be recovered through appropriate levels and structures of tariff, nor did it pay off its arrears, nor
did it simplify bureaucratic procedures, in particular those affecting procurement of goods and
services as well as disbursement of funds.
44.   Procurement of goods and services was initially delayed for about one year because the
Moroccan bidding documents did not fully meet the Bank's procurement guidelines. The major
point at issue was the bid security required from the bidder. The Moroccan Government refused
to follow the Bank guidelines requiring a bid security issued by a bank (foreign or local) elected
by the bidder. Following a lengthy exchange of views, the Bank, in order not to delay
procurement any further, had to accept the Moroccan practice requiring, by law, a bid security to
be issued by a local bank and a deposit of 10 percent of the bid security in the Treasury. This
exception was made only for the distribution project. Although standard bidding documents were
subsequently agreed upon with the Bank, procurement was later slowed down by two factors: (i)
the slow issuance of specific bidding documents because of the beneficiaries' cumbersome
bureaucratic procedures; and (ii) the slow approval of relatively large contracts by the
Government.
45.   Project implementation involved about 340 contracts, of which the Bank reviewed and
financed 74 contracts for ONE (41 ICBs, 31 LCBs and 2 Other) and 30 contracts for the Regies
(RAD 11, RADEEM 7, RADEEF 7 and RAK 5). ONE alone approved of about 290 contracts.
The large number of contracts was the consequence of inadequate procurement arrangements for
installation/civil works. US$22 million (25 percent of the loan) was allocated to ONE to finance
works through contracts of less than US$500,000 under LCBs. Obviously, this invited the
beneficiaries to create a large number of small contracts to maximize local participation. This
resulted in slow procurement and a heavy supervision burden for the Bank, which had to review
every procurement exceeding US$200,000 equivalent in accordance with provisions established in
the loan agreement.



15
46.   The performance of contractors was satisfactory, the supply of goods and services was of
good quality, and ONE's and Regies' technical staff performed marginally satisfactorily in
supervising the supplies and the works. ONE and the Regies carried out the physical components
in a satisfactory manner. But, although the loan closing date was extended by one year, ONE and
RAD could complete only 88 percent and 75 percent of their respective project distribution
components.
47.   Loan disbursement was very slow compared to the appraisal estimate. Disbursements
began with a delay of more than 2 years and reached a cumulative level of less than 3 percent of
the appraisal estimate three years after loan approval. This was caused by the 27 month delay in
making the loan effective and the initial procurement problems. Taking into consideration that in
June 1995 the sector began to show progress on reforms and financial matters, the Bank extended
the loan closing date by one year to June 30, 1996. No more extensions of the closing date were
granted. At that time hardly 60 percent of the loan was disbursed, but procurement was
expedited and when the last disbursement occLrred on November 5, 1996, US$77.21 million, or
85.8 percent of the loan, was disbursed.
48    To facilitate disbursements and payments to a large number of suppliers, the Bank and the
Government had agreed that a special account was to be opened in the Treasury. However, the
special account was never opened by the Government because of two obstacles which were never
removed: (i) no simple procedure was found acceptable by the Treasury to pay suppliers directly
or through letters of credit; and (ii) ONE and the R6gies would have been required to pay first
and then submit documentary evidence to obtain reimbursement from the Treasury. This
procedure could not work. ONE and the Regies could not afford to finance the payments to
suppliers and obtain refunds through the slow and cumbersome Government bureaucracy. Thus,
the burden to pay all suppliers directly or through letters of credit was placed mostly on the Bank.
49.   The adverse hydrology during the period 1992-1995 forced ONE to decrease low cost
hydroelectric generation, install inefficient gas turbines, to generate more from thermal plants, and
to purchase more power from Algeria (at 4 US cents/kWh) and local suppliers. This situation
increased ONE's operation costs during the dry years.
D. Bank Performance
50.   Project identification was deficient. The Bank staff identified the project as a power
subsector adjustment loan and prepared it as such. However, at time of project appraisal the
Loan Committee instructed the staff to appraise it as a mere power distribution investment project
and rely on conditionalities to improve the institutional aspects of the sector that were already part
of the PERL. Unfortunately, this led to a project whose major conditionalities were elsewhere,
compounded by poor design of the procurement of goods and services. For these reasons,
project appraisal is deemed deficient.
51.   During project preparation, the Bank provided satisfactory support to the Government,
ONE, and the Regies by doing five preparation missions in the period July 1985 to November



16
1987. Unfortunately, changes in the project team caused by the Bank's reorganization process in
1987 introduced unwanted delays in project preparation and appraisal.
52.   The Bank made extensive supervision of the project. Over a period of 7 years spanning
June 1988 to September 1995 (15 supervision missions comprising 91 staff-weeks, costing about
US$450,000). After Board approval and before the loan had been signed and declared effective,
the Bank staff carried out three supervision missions. However, none of them raised the issue of
poor ownership of the project by the Government as demonstrated by the unusually long time it
was taking to sign and comply with the conditions to make the loan agreement effective. The
Government avoided signing the loan over a period of 16 months. It signed the loan agreement in
June 1989 and 11 months later met the conditions of effectiveness. The Government argued that
there was no point in making the loan effective and paying commitment fees while the
beneficiaries were not ready to initiate procurement of goods and services. The Bank accepted
that argument. Perhaps the Bank would have been more effective in expediting project
implementation by threatening to cancel the loan in 1989. Until 1993, Bank supervision
continued to be deficient and little pressure was exerted upon the Government and Beneficiaries
to meet the institutional objectives of the project.
53.   On the positive side, the Bank reacted to the problems by reallocating project funds to
carry out a series of studies intended to improve the sector. It gave good advice, not always
heeded by the Government, about the importance of increasing electricity tariffs and eliminating
subsidies at a fast pace, and of giving full autonomy to ONE as a way to improve its financial and
operational performance. In the later stages of project implementation, as a result of the Bank's
close dialogue with the Government and ONE and pressure exerted by the Bank (informal
suspension of disbursement to the Regies, including cancellation of US$3.5 million for RAD) the
sector began to show improvements. Then the Bank was flexible; waived noncompliance with
important covenants when progress was made in the tariffs, arrears and reorganization of ONE,
and extended the loan closing date by one year.
E. Borrower Performance
54.   Project preparation and implementation by the Borrower (the Government) and the
beneficiaries (ONE and the Regies) was very slow but satisfactory. It took the Borrower about two
years to prepare the project and more than two years to meet the conditions for loan effectiveness.
Procurement of goods and services was very slow, and the Government did not make arrangements for
a special account facilitating loan disbursement. Although the loan agreement gave the Borrower and
Beneficiaries plenty of time (6 years), it took 7 years to complete about 85 percent of the physical
components of the project (see Part II, Table 6: Key indicators of project implementation).
55.   On the institutional development front, until 1993 the Government was lax in taking measures
to initiate payments of its arrears to ONE and the Regies. Also, it was not until 1994 and 1996 that the
Government approved tariff adjustments allowing ONE to start meeting compliance with important
financial covenants (self financing,) and approved tariff margins enabling the Regies to improve
financial position. But the Government did not devolve power to ONE to enable it to become



17
autonomous in managing its operations and finances. This shows the initial low level of commitment
the Government had to the institutional objectives of the project, although it did react positively late in
project implementation. (see Part II, Table 10: Status of Covenants).
56.   Regarding training, ONE and the Regies did not avail itself of all opportunities offered by the
project to enhance the skills of their staff through a well-prepared training program. Instead, they
preferred to use ad-hoc training offered by bilateral agreements with donors. This is understandable
because of the grant element of the training offered by the bilateral donors.
57.   All of the above overshadowed the relatively good accomplishments (albeit with delays) of
ONE and the Regies in implementing 85 percent of the physical components of the project. In view of
the great importance that the Bank attached to the financial and institutional development objectives of
the project, overall Borrower performance during project implementation is rated as deficient on
account of the unsatisfactory performance of the Government and the marginally satisfactory
performance of the beneficiaries.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
58.   The prospectfor the project to be sustainable is uncertain because: (i) the tariff margin
granted to most Regies is not yet enough to cover in some instances their investment and
operating costs; (ii) the reorganization of ONE is still ongoing and fully satisfactory results have
yet to be shown; and (iii) some of the measures (reduction of arrears, enacting of the Electricity
Code) contemplated under a proposed power sector loan (Power Sector Reform Project,
appraised in March 1996), have not yet been implemented.
Project Outcome
59.    The outcome of the project is unsatisfactory because: (i) physical achievements were
partial; (ii) the economic rate of return of the project (9.8 percent) is lower than the appraisal
estimate (12.4 percent); (iii) the finances of ONE and the Regies were only partially improved
with some key indicators of financial performance (mainly bulk tariffs to the Regies and arrears
due to ONE and Regies) remaining below targets; (iv) coordination among the sector entities
continues to be weak; and (v) the project sustainability is uncertain.
G. Future Project Operation
60.   Several measures taken recently or to be taken by the Government, ONE and the Regies in the
areas of sector reform, private participation, reduction of arrears, and sector monitoring and evaluation,
may reflect a satisfactory plan for future project operation.



18
61.   On sector reform, the Government is about to implement a Power Sector Reform project. This
operation is aimed at restructuring the Moroccan power sector along the lines of the current Bank
paradigm for power sector development (unbundling of the commercial functions of distribution,
transmission and generation of power from the regulatory and policy making functions of the state,
enabling efficient private participation in the sector through fair competition, and extension of electric
service when justified, without endangering the natural and the social environment).
62.   The proposed IPP in Jorf Lasfar (the Bank would provide a Partial Risk Guarantee for this
operation) is a good example of opening the sector to private operators. When this operation is
implemented, the market will send a clear message on the willingness to pay for power generation by
the Government and, consequently, it will serve as reference point for gauging and adjusting electricity
prices. Otherwise, the sector will be subjected to more financial stresses than in the past.
63.   In 1995, ONE initiated a reorganization. The implementation of the first phase of the
reorganization (decentralization of activities) and appointment of new directors and managers initially
slowed down ONE's operations, but it has been followed by the injection of a new dynamic into ONE's
operations, this was already sensed by the ICR mission in December 1996.
64.   On the pervasive problem of arrears, ONE and the Regies have initiated aggressive measures to
abate arrears by cutting service to delinquent customers, replacing monthly billing to the Administration
with a quarterly billing system., and rescheduling payments of arrears with entities providing essential
economic benefits, when cutting service is not an option.
65.   Last but very important, ONE, the Regies, and the Government are already monitoring the
sector through a set of performance indicators in line with those recommended by the Bank (Table 6 of
Part II of this ICR).
H. Key Lessons Learned
66.   Based on the experience of this project, the following lessons can be offered:
Lesson 1. Bank management and staff should strictly enforce Bank guidelines for project
processing to avoid later problems during project implementation. For example, in cases when
signature of the loan and its effectiveness take an excessively long time, there is an obvious lack
of commitment by the Borrower to the project's objectives, and the Bank should cancel a loan
having excessive delays in effectiveness. In this project, loan effectiveness took 27 month and
project implementation was later plagued with problems caused by weak ownership by the
Borrower.
Lesson 2. Bank management and staff should strictly enforce compliance with critical
covenants to prevent the project from departures from its objectives as well as to preserve the
Bank's credibility. For example, in this project Bank management and staff were tepid in
enforcing covenants in tariffs and accounts receivable early in project implementation, and as a



19
consequence, the financial problems of the power subsector persisted throughout
implementation.
Lesson 3. Project design should avoid procurement arrangements involving: (i) allocation of
small amounts of funds to many beneficiaries; and (ii) local competitive bidding for small
construction services (it invites the borrower to split procurement into a large number of
contracts to favor local contracting). As was the case in this project, that situation introduces
implementation delays and high costs of coordination and supervision of suppliers. It would be
better to concentrate procurement in one beneficiary and arrange turn-key contracts for
complete and easily supervised works.
Lesson 4. With hindsight, projects with a high number of institutional development
objectives should have all reform measures and related covenants included within one loan
covering all the activities of the target institution, rather than dispersing them among other
operations. In this case, lending to improve ONE should have covered all related actions,
studies, and covenants should all have been included in this loan and not dispersed in the
PERL.
Lesson 5. A Contract Plan between the Government and a Government-owned power
utility is not by itself an effective mechanism for improving the operational and financial
performance of the power utility because there is no legal check on the Government's
tendency to act on the basis of political forces. This tendency usually results in the
Government's not complying with the agreements contained in the Contract Plan, which,
eventually, makes it impossible for the power utility to comply with its own commitments.

and promote a meaningful dialog between the Government and the power utility.

AIDE MEMOIRE OF THE ICR MISSION



34
ROYAUNlE DU MAROC
Projet de Distribution de L'Electricite (Pret 2910-NIOR)
Mission de Preparation du Rapport d' Achevement du Projet
Aide - Memoire
1.    Une mission de la Banque Mondiale, composee de M. Alvaro J. Covarrubias a visite le
Maroc du 3 au 13 decembre 1996 afin de demarrer la preparation du Rapport d'Achevement du
Projet de Distribution d'Electricite (pret 29 1 0-MOR). La mission remercie les representants des
Ministeres de l'Interieur et des Finances ainsi que ceux de l'Office National de l'Electricite (ONE)
et des Regies de Casablanca, (RAD), Fes (RADEEF), Meknes (RADEEM) et Kenitra (RAK)
pour la collaboration efficace, et pour I'accueil que lui a et reserv& L'aide memoire resume les
sujets principaux discutes et les accords conclus lors de cette mission. La liste des personnes
rencontrees se trouve en Annexe 3.
Rapport de I'Emprunteur
2.    La mission a confirme aux representants du Gouvernement, de 1' ONE et des regies RAD,
RADEEF, RADEEM et RAK que, dans le cadre des directives et accords des prets de la Banque
Mondiale, les agences qui beneficient des emprunts ont la responsabilite de preparer, apres cl6ture
du pret, un rapport d'achevement du projet conjointement avec la Banque. Le rapport de
1'emprunteur represente la derniere etape du suivi du projet de distribution de l'e1ectricite. 11
devrait etre prepare et soumis a la Banque dans un delai de six mois apres la cl6ture du pret, c'est
a dire, le 31 decembre 1996. La mission a encourage le Gouvernement, l'ONE et les Regies a
saisir cette occasion pour faire une evaluation retrospective du projet qui vient de s'achever et
presenter un point de vue independant sur la mesure dans laquelle le projet a rempli ses objectifs,
ainsi que de s'exprimer librement sur la qualite de 1'action de la Banque. La Banque, de son cote,
preparera un rapport d'achevement du projet dans lequel le rapport de 1'emprunteur et ses
commentaires sur la partie preparee par la Banque seront annexes sans aucune modification. Le
rapport sera transrnis aux membres du Conseil d' Administration de la Banque.
3.    Puisque le projet de distribution de 1'electricite a eu des composantes qui sont propres
pour chacun des beneficiaires du pret de la Banque, la mission a convenu avec le Gouvernement
que l'ONE et les Regies preparent des rapports d'achevement des composantes du projet qui les
concernent lesquels seront parties d'un rapport global d'achevement du projet du point de vue de
l'emprunteur (le Gouvernement). Ce rapport devrait avoir un resume analytique d'environ 10
pages et, si necessaire, avec des annexes detailles. La Direction des Regies s'est engage a
coordonner les Regies, preparer le rapport de 1'emprunteur et de l'envoyer a la Banque le 21
Janvier 1997.



35
4.     La mission a suggere aux autorites marocaines que les rapports mentionnes ci-dessus
fassent le point sur les realisations physiques, les problemes poses par la passation des marches et
le decaissement du pret, les etudes realises (tarifs, coordination de l'expansion a coat minimum,
organisation de l'ONE), la formation du personnel technique et administratif, et en general sur
I'achevement des objectifs envisages initialement (voir Annexe 1). Par exemple, les rapports
discuteraient les raisons pour lesquelles le projet n'aurait pas accompli les buts financiers (tarifs,
arrieres, creances) et d'autonomie operationnelle et financi6re de l'ONE et les Regies.
Plan d'operation future du projet de distribution de l'electricite
5.     La bonne operation future des composantes physiques du projet semble etre assuree par la
qualite satisfaisante de l'equipement acquis, la bonne execution du montage, les programmes
d'entretien mis en place par l'ONE, la RAD, la RADEEF, la RADEEM et la RAK, et par les
stages a 1'exterieur du personnel technique charge de l'operation des nouvelles technologies
utilisees dans les systemes de production, transport et distribution d'electricite.
6.     Neanmoins, le projet, n'a pas accompli les buts d'assainissement financier et d'autonomie
financiere et operationnelle de l'ONE et des Regies. Donc, le Gouvernement, l'ONE et les Regies
devront travailler ensemble pour arriver A une solution permanente des problemes financiers qui
posent aux Regies d'un c6te les marges prix d'achat/prix de vente aux abonnes, et de l'autre les
arriers crees par le long cycle de facturation, particuli&rement celles des administrations.
Indicateurs clis de performance du projet.
7.     L'ONE et les Regies deja utilisent un ensemble d'indicateurs techniques et de gestion qui
permettent d'evaluer leurs performances. Au minimum, les indicateurs cles de performance
presentes dans l'Annexe 2 seront utilises par l'ONE et les Regies pour faire le suivi du
performance du projet de distribution de l'electricite.
Renseignements et donnees complementaires
8.     L'ONE, la RAD et la RADEEF ont prepare et delivre a la mission une bonne partie des
renseignements supplementaires et donnees statistiques demandes par la Banque, ainsi que des
parties des rapports d'achevement des composantes du projet qui les concernent. Les
renseignements et les donnees statiques de l'ONE et des regies RAD, RADEEF, RADEEM et
RAK qui n'ont pas pu etre delivres a la mission seront envoyes A la Banque Nfondiale par courrier
au plus tard le 30 decembre 1996.

QUATRIEllE PROJET D}E DISTRIBUTION D'IECMCITE
(PPET BIRD 2910-MOR)
ObAet: Observaons reawives au rapport d'Achevement du pret BIRD 2910-MOR
Dans le rawrt d'Ach6vement B              on note que le taux do rfaisaiion des
composantes matiienles des projets R.AD  s'61&v a  75%; cdla appcie de notre part lcs
renarqus swvantes:
- physiquement l'enscmble des projet pr6vu et r6ajustds avec les differentes missions
BIRD ont 6t realis a  1'excepton des servies des consultan  prevs pour un montan
de 440.000 Dollans US; En effet, le projet d'acquiston des cibles de disibufion prevu
imdement a t armul6 et mpLace en accord avc la mission BIRD par l'achat d'un
tr-nsfonnazw de puiswice.
- le mnontant totai des deblocages correspondant a la rialiaaton physique s'd5ve a
11.336.959,29 Dollars US, rapport6 au montanl total du pret de 14.410.000,00 DoILe
US, doime un taux de r6iisation de 78,67%
Ccci se justfie par:
* le fait que les esfrnanons originales tajient lcvda et comportaient des cningenwes ge
sitant autour de 9,25%
* la fluauaion des diffrentes monnaies a I'avantago de la R.A.D, notammcnt pour la lie
ItajOienne.
* Ia fouritutre des tableaux 20 KV destnes aux postes Sidi Otlunane ct Dar Bouazza
etant produite localement, la Banquc n'=n fiancc que 78 % du montant du m=arh, cc
qi permet de raser les composantes mairteIcUs et &nancikrcs respectent i  100 %
ot 78 %.
Nous pemso  par cons6qunt, qu'il faut retoucher tous les paragaphes qi baitant du tauW
de r6alisation de la composante mafielle.

Resultat du Proiet: Dames V et 19:
11 nou semble quo La rivi1ion des tari& appliques par 1'O.N.E aux Repes n'a jamis &h
cibWe. Ce n'est qu'en 1995 que le probleme a Zte pose par la RA.D. et cxpliqu6 aux repisctnts
de la BRD.
Dans la page S (Raifisanon des objectf) . n nous semble qu'il y a une confusion entre
<( compteuis >> et << m6tres >> c'est pourquoi nous proposons la redacion suIvante:
<< Cett Rdgic a rtiforc la capacit6 des sous-staions de 225KV/20KV de Sidi Otmiane et
Dar Bouaz72 de 240MVA (160MVA garants), et rehabilite 80 MVA et 240 1MVA aux sous-
stations 225KV et 60 KV d'Oulad Haddou et AD.E, CAMIRAN & CHAVIGNE.
En cc qui concenme la distbouton basse tens, la RAD, en aocord avec la mission, a actd
136.320 comptcus d'&ne4ie electrique au leu de 86.000 compteurs prvus lon. de P'ivaluatin
irale, a cause du prx rie1 qui s'averait bas par rapport a 1'estnmaron orinale.
Quant aux cables sout=rra=s, A etait preiu imtaxnent 290 Km de diff6rentes sectons. le projet a
ete remplac4, en accord avec la mission, par 'achar d'un transfoimateur de puis
225KV/20KV de SOvIVA pour la sou-stadon d'Oulad Haddou. Globalemnt, la RAD a acbe
1'ensemble des compoantes maztrielles nancees par lc pr6t (a 1'exccpbon des serces des
