OF THE INTERNATIENAL RANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEELOPIKENT
TO TaH EaECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OK A PROPOSED LOAN TO ECUADOR
FOR A SECOND NAIORAL LOW-INCOME HOUSIC PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Government of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$60.0 million is
submilted for approval.  The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years,
including four years of grace, with interest at the Bank's standard
variable rate. Proceeds of the loan denominated in Sucres would be on-lent
to Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV) at a variable Interest rate
established from time to time, equivalent to the rate paid by BEV on
savings deposits.
2.        Background.  About half of Ecuador's 9 million residents live in
urban areas, where population growth has averaged a rapid 4.5 percent p.a.
over the past decade. About 45,000 new households are formed annually.
The overall housing deficit is estimated at about 430,000 units. In
comparison, housing production of the formal sector recently averaged about
15,000 units per year.
3.        Lower income housing is developed and financed mainly by the
Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV) and its related development arm, the
Junta Nacional de la Vivienda (JNV). The Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguro
Social (IESS) is a major financing source for middle-income housing; a
number of savings and loans, cooperatives and commercial banks also finance
housing for middle and upper-income groups. Main sector problems
identified during implementation of two previous Bank projects in the urban
sector (the Guayaquil Urban Development Project partially financed by Loan
1776-EC of 1980 and the National Low Income Housing Project partially
financed by Loan 2135-EC of 1982) and through a Bank review of the public
investment program in 1985 are: (i) inadequate mobilization and allocation
of domestic savings for shelter development; (ii) insufficient production
of housing employing norms and standards affordable by lower income groups;
and (iii) lack of financial instruments adequate to promote housing
affordability under prevailing conditions of inflation and interest rates
in the 20-30 percent range. While progress has been made in recent years
with improving housing affordability and levels of cost recovery by
lowering the norms and standards within a share of BEV/JNV's investment
program and developing a program of home improvement lending through
BEV/JNV, much remains to be done to reduce construction norms and standards
more widely and to improve financial policies and instruments in the sector
to step up resource mobilization and improve affordability and cost
recovery.
4.        The Government has made development of low income housing a top
priority, and has given BEV/JNV--with the help of private contractors
primary responsibilities for implementing a housing program estimated to
cost US$312 million between 1988-93. This program would be financed by
USAID (US$23 million); IDB (US$57 million); GTZ (US$3 million); BEV/JNV
(US$138 million); beneficiaries (US$31 million), and the proposed Bank loan
(US$60 million).



-2 -
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the
sector is to help the Government develop policies and institutions to
increase the supply of affordable housing for lower income groups while
minimizing public subsidies.  The project's objectives would be fully
consistent with this strategy and would complement the objectives of the
proposed Financial Sector Loan, which include development of improved
long-term lending instruments and the use of market-deterrined interest
rates thrcughout the economy.  Moreover, during project execution the Bank
would continue to coordinate closely with the other international agencies
active in the sector to ensure that mutually consistent and reinforcing
policies and activities were pursued in the housing sector.  The focus
within the project on applying reduced norms and standards to BEVYJNV's
entire investment program and developing such program on the basis of
demand surveys would ensure that all of BEV/JNV's investmients would meet
the needs of lower income groups. The institutional separation and
strengthening of BEV and JNV, respectively as a financial institution and
as a public sector developer, and the inclusion of private contractors as
suppliers of lower-income housing should improve the capacity of formal
sector institutions to supply shelter for the poor. Finally, the adoption
of a mortgage instrument hearing variable, market-related interest rates
would improve the levels of cost recovery under BEV's programs, and enable
BEV to mobilize an increasing share of its resources from the market. In
summary, the project would provide an important vehicle to enable the Bank
to continue its dialogue concerning affordability, cost recovery and
institutional reform in BEV/JNV begun under previous loans, while extending
its wider dialogue on financial issues to the housing sector.
6.        Project Objectives.   Specific project objectives include:  (i)
increasing the production of low-income housing; (ii) adoption by BEV of
interest rate policies and a new mortgage instrument designed to improve
resource mobilization and allocation and affordability in the housing
sector; (iII) further streamlining and strengthening of the financial,
administrative and productive efficiency of BEV/JNV; (iv) better targetting
of BEVIJNV's production to make it more responsive to low-income
beneficiaries; and (v) fostering greater participation by private
contractors and developers in the production of low-income housing.
7.        Project Description.  The project would finance a share of BEV's
1988-93 investment program. It would be executed throughout the country
and would comprise: (i) development of about 12,500 serviced lots with and
without different types of dwelling units; (ii) provision of about 15,000
home improvement loans; (iii) technical assistance to BEV/JNV to help
improve norms and standards, contracting and supervision practices,
portfolio management and operational efficiency; and (iv) vehicles and
equipment to facilitate project implementation. Concurrent with
implementation of the project, BEV would put itnto practice a new lending
instrument bearing market-related, variable interest rates and providing
for capitalization of interest. Under such instrument, monthly payments
would be capped at 25X of beneficiaries' household income. Any payment due
in excess of this amount would automatically be capitalized for later
payment, with the life of the loan adjusted to accommodate such deferred
payments.
8.        The project would be carried out over five and one-half years.
Its execution would be coordinated by BEV, which would act as the financial
intermediary and which is adequately staffed. Development of urbanized



lots and housing units would be carried out by JNV (subcontracting to
private contractors) and private developers. Home improvement loans would
be extended through BEV's specialized home improvement lending unit.
Technical assistance activities would be carried out by consultants
acceptable to the Bank. In order to facilitate procurement and
supervision, during project execution there would be strict advance
identification and separation of works to be financed by the international
agencles cooperating in the funding of BEV's investment program. Moreover,
to assure that the investment program remains responsive to market demands,
BEV/JNV's yearly decisions on the composition of its entire investment
program would be based upon annual demand surveys which would be acceptable
to the Bank. BEV will pay the Central Bank for the use of loan proceeds,
an.d will charge on all loans it makes in the coming years, an
annually-adjusted variable rate linked to the rate BEV pays on demand
savings deposits. Currently, this would mean that BEV would pay 20% per
annum to the Central Bank and lend to homeowners at 21.5Z, including
spread. The latter exceeds by 8.5 percentage points the average interest
on BEV's portfolio. It is expected that the spread charged by BEV
will increase over the next two years based on the results of an upcoming
study of its administrative costs. The adequacy of the new rate formula
will be reviewed yearly with the Bank and, at all times, BEV will ensure
that it does not lag behind the average rate paid by commercial banks on
demand deposits by more than two percenitage points. As a result of BEV's
adopting a more realistic loan pricing policy, in place of the fixed-rate
lending it nas been doing uneer inflationary conditions, its financial
outlook should improve. During the twelve months needed to get the new
system in place, BEV could lend to homeowners a maximum of US$6 million of
the proposed loan at the fixed rate prevailing under Loan 2135-EC (19%).
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$85.7 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$21.7 million (26 percent). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Croup Operations in Ecuador are given in
Schedules C and D. A map is also attached. Staff Appraisal Report No.
6948-EC dated December 15, 1987 is being distributed separately.
9.        Main Actions Agreed To.  During negotiations, the main actions
agreed to were that (i) the new lending instrument would be fully
implemented by November 1988; (ii) investment decisions on quantities and
types of shelter units to be built would be based on annual demand analyses
in order to maintain the marketability of BEV/JNV's products among the
project target group; (iii) BEV would adopt an Action Plan, to be reviewed
with the Bank annually, establishing its performance targets; (iv) BEV and
GTZ would enter into a contract acceptable to the Bank whereby GTZ would
continue its role as coordinating agency for technical assistance; (v) the
Bank and BEV/JNV would agree to terms of reference and an implementation
schedule for a program to rectify deficiencies in BEV/JNV's accounting
systems; (vi) Government and BEV would enter into a subsidiary Agreement
acceptable to the Bank; (vii) BEV and JNV would enter into a Subsidiary
Agreement acceptable to the Bank; and (viii) JNV would appoint five senior
level staff to facilitate project implementation. Points (iv) to (viii)
would be conditions of loan effectiveness.

10.       Benefits.  Apart from the construction of shelter, major benefits
would be the adoption by BEV of market-related interest rates and the new
lending instrument. This would promote mobilization of resources for
shelter from the domestic capital market while improving resource
allocation and shelter affordability and providing for cost recovery of
investments under the project, As a result of the restructuring of BEV and
JNV, by the end of the project JNV and BEV would function more effectively,
respectively, as a developer and as a financial institution. The project
would also encourage private developers to build low-income housing. The
internal economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 13S.
Project works are targetted at beneficiaries in the 15-60 percentile range
of household incomes with the majority being below the 50 percent level.
11.       Riskse  There is little risk regarding physical works; JNV has an
adequate land acquisition program underway and ample experience with
developing necessary services. Moreover, home Improvement lending faces no
particular physical risk. The main risks would be that the new Government
entering office in August 1982 would not maintain the new lending system,
interest rate policies, and institutional reforms which are integral to the
project. These risks are tempered by the fact that reversal of these
policies by any new Government would involve policy reversals at various
levels (e.g., in monetary policy and economic philosophy), and more
importantly, it would require the new Government to provide greater public
subsidies (to the extent that beneficiaries do not bear project costs and
current projected output levels are maintained). This is a step which
would be difficult, given the likely climate of economic austerity in
Ecuador over the next few years. It is therefore not expected that
policies would be adopted which would negatively affect the proposed
project.
12.       rcoumudation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
