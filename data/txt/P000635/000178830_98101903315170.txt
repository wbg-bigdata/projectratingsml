APPRAISAL CF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUNIARY
i.        This report appraises a project for improving highway administra-
tion and maintenance in Equatorial Guinea. The project would be the first
Bank Group operation in this country which attained its independence from
Spain in October 1968, and which became a member of the Bank in July 1970,
and of IDA in April 1972.
ii.       The country's cash economy depends almost entirely on the export
of agricultural and forestry products, and except for some lumber transport
on the Benito River, roads are the only means of evacuating these products.
Although the network is quite extensive, the condition of the roads is deter-
iorating, primarily because the present highway administration cannot cope
with the needs of maintenance and improvement. It is therefore urgent to
establish an effective highway organization, and to train Guineans to man it.
iii.      The purpose of the proposed project is:  (i) to provide technical
assistance for managerial and operational support to the highway administra-
tion; (ii) to procure essential maintenance equipment; and (iii) to carry
out about 30 km of road improvement work by contract. The estimated cost of
the project is US$2.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of
about US$2.4 million. Of this amount, the United Nations Development Pro-
grarmme (U1DP) will provide US$40o,000 for the required technical assistance
under item (i) above, and the proposed Credit of US$2 million will help to
finance items (ii) and (iii). The Association will act as Executing Agency
for UNDP. The Government of Equatorial Guinea will provide the local costs
of the project in the amount of about US$300,000.
iv.       The highway organization as restructured under the project will
provide better management and supervision of maintenance and improvement
works. The road maintenance investment will prevent further deterioration
of the network, thus generating savings in road user costs; it is expected
to yield an economic return of over 40%.  The road improvement component of
the project will serve to demonstrate efficient methods of design, bidding,
and construction, and can also be expected to generate road user savings
yielding an economic return of at least 15%.
v.        The project represents a departure from normal Bank Group practice
in that equipment and civil works to be financed by the Association will be
identified and prepared only during implementation of the project. This
definition of project items will be done by the UNDP technical assistance
team provided under the project, who will also prepare a comprehensive five-
year program for highway maintenance and development. Final decisions on
implementing the experts' recomnendations will be agreed between the Govern-
ment and the Association. In particular, most of the equipment items will
be procured only after the Government provides assurances that it will finance



- ii -
the five-year program to be proposed. These procedures are considered
necessary in order to permit an early start on reorganizing the highway
administration, and to enable the experts to demonstrate up-to-date maint-
enance and improvement methods with the equipment and funds provided under
the project.
vi.       The project is suitable for an IDA Credit to the Government of
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in the amount of US$2 million.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has asked the
Association for financial assistance to help implement a program to: (i)
provide managerial and operational support to the highway administration;
(ii) procure scme essential road maintenance equipment; and (iii) carry
out a small road improvement project.
1.02      A first Bank Group exploratory mission which visited Equatorial
Guinea in November 1970 identified the need for general improvement of the
highway maintenance organization. Subsequent missions prepared the present
project in February 1971, and appraised it in August 1971.
1.03      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$2.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of US$2.4 million.  Of this amount,
the Association will provide US$2 million towards the purchase of road maint-
enance equipment and for the road improvement work. UNDP will provide
US$400,000 to help finance expert services for support to the Directorate
of Public Works; the Association will act as Executing Agency for UNDP.
1.04      The use of UNDP experts for tecbnical assistance under the project
conforms with the Government's preference to use such experts rather than
consulting firms. In view of the particular nature of the project, super-
vision missions by the Association will have to be undertaken more frequently
than is customary to make sure that the experts are given access to all neces-
sary data, and that their recommendations as agreed between the Government
and the Association are being implemented. The success of the technical
assistance will be a major determinant of proper execution of the project,
since it is this item on which all other project components depend.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of the August 1971 appraisal
mission comprising Messrs. A. van Dijck (Engineer), and P. Gyamfi and A.
Soto (Economists). Final preparation was delayed to accommodate the Govern-
ment's request for revisions in the project content, and the report takes
account of these changes.
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Country and Its Economy
2.01      Equatorial Guinea is composed of two provinces: Rio Muni (26,ooo km )
on the western coast of Central Africa, and Fernando Poo (2,000 km2) - the
administrative center - an island in the Gulf of Guinea 50 km off the coast of
Cameroon. A 1970 estimate set the country's population at about 300,000, of
which 210,000 in Rio Muni.  The total figure includes about 1,600 Europeans2/,
l/  Until independence in 1968 the European population had been about 7,000.



- 2 -
mainly Spanish, and about 60,000 Nigerian contract laborers employed mostly
in the cocoa plantations on Fernando Poo. Unemployment exists especially on
the mainland, largely due to the sharp decline in forestry activities. The
rural population has been migrating to the towns in increasing numbers, but
remains more than 70% of the total.
2.02      The economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture and fores-
try; cocoa, coffee and lumber account for more than 90% of the total volume
of exports.  Over the past five years, however, export levels of these products
have declined sharply. GDP was estimated in 1970 at about US$212 per capita
(US$350 in Fernando Poo and US$150 in Rio Muni).
B. Transport Modes
(a) Highways
2.03      Details of the highway systam and its administration are given in
Chapter 3.
(b) Maritime Transport
2.04      The country has five seaports:  Santa Isabel (the capital and major
port) and San Carlos in Fernando Poo, and Bata, Rio Benito, and Cogo on the
mainland. The port of Santa Isabel has a deep natural harbor adequate for
existing traffic; a US$3 million expansion is being planned. The existing
port at Bata is the principal one on the mainland, but it cannot be used by
sea-going vessels because of excessive siltation. A new port (including an
access road) is being constructed south of Bata at a cost of about US$11
million.
2.05      In 1970 the ports handled about 200,000 tons of cargo, mostly in
international traffic; 60% of the total were exports, including wood (67%),
cocoa (25%), coffee (5%), and other agricultural products. For transport
between the provinces, plans are being made to purchase passenger and cargo
ships.
(c) Air Transport
2.06      There are two main airports:  the international facility at Santa
Isabel is capable of handling DC8-type jet aircraft, and the airport at Bata
is adequate for two-engine turbo-props. The Government is now planning a
US$3 million expansion for the Bata airport to handle jet aircraft.
2.07      The Government airline LAGE (Lineas Aereas de Guinea Ecuatorial)
is equipped and operated by the Spanish airline company IBERIA. LAGE operates
between Santa Isabel and Douala (Cameroon), and between Santa Isabel and Bata,
the latter service providing the only link between the island and mainland
provinces.
C.  Transport .Po&2   Planning, and Coordination
2.08      Responsibilities for transport are centralized in the Ministry of
Public Works, Housing, and Transport (MOP) which is divided into three



-3-
corresponding Directorates. The Directorate of Public Works (DPW) is responsi-
ble for the administration, design, construction, and maintenance of all trans-
port infrastructure; the Directorate of Transport is responsible for road trans-
port, the merchant marine, and civil aviation. In the absence of a transport
sector plan, projects are being selected and carried out without benefit of well-
established priorities. There is a clear need for technical assistance in eco-
nomic planning both sectorally and for the whole economy.  In this regard, the
Bank Group has already provided some assistance through an economic adviser
recruited for short-term secondment on the recommendation of the August 1971
economic mission.  During his two one-month visits to Equatorial Guinea  during
1972, the adviser was assigned directly to the Office of the President, and
reported to him on how best to improve the efficiency of existing arrangements
for technical assistance, planning, and development institutions. The present
project includes some support to MOP in its planning role (para. 4.02), and
will provide the opportunity for the Bank Group to keep informed on progress
in this area.
2.09      In the past there has been no inter-modal competition, and conse-
quently no issues in transport coordination or risk of resource misallocation
between modes. It will however be necessary to coordinate air and sea trans-
port if the proposed maritime connection between Santa Isabel and Bata (para.
2.05) is established.
3. HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
3.01      The highway network consists of about 1,300 km of national roads
(Table 1), 700 Ian of local tracks, and a substantial length of forestry roads
which were constructed and maintained by the lumber companies until they left
the country in 1969. About one-third of the national network (400 km) is paved,
and most of the rest are good, all-weather laterite roadsi/. Fernando Poo has
about 220 km of national roads, four-fifths of which are paved. The road
system on the island consists of a circumferential paved road linking Santa
Isabel with the coastal towns of San Carlos and Concepcion (see Map). The
main trunk roads in Rio Muni are the north-south axis connecting the largest
production and population centers of Ebebyin, Mikomeseng, and Niefang with the
port of Bata.
3.02      The road system serves both island and mainland reasonably well in
terms of accessibility to the main areas of economic activity (agriculture
and forestry). The system has adequate capacity to handle the present low
traffic volumes and the needs of the immediate future. However, lack of maint-
enance has caused some paved roads to deteriorate badly. Laterite roads are
generally in better condition than the paved roads, but here also the effects
of poor maintenance are evident; if not corrected, this situation will lead
progressively to the loss of an important capital asset.
1/ Laterite deposits in the country are of generally good quality.

B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.03      According to available data on vehicle registration, there were in
1970 about 6,700 vehicles, of which 67% were cars, 23% trucks, and 10% buses
(Table 2). The distribution of these vehicles is about equal between the two
provinces. Recent average annual growth of the vehicle population has been
about 10%. All the abovementioned figures are however somewhat overstated,
since they do not account for an undetermined number of vehicles taken out of
the country by the departing Spanish population (para. 2.01). Since 1970,
importation of vehicles has been restricted to those used for agriculture or
productive purposes.
3.04      There are no traffic counts in the country, but volumes are generally
low, probably less than 100 vehicles per day (vpd). The most important roads
are the Bata-Niefang section of the east-west road in Rio Muni, and Santa
Isabel-San Carlos in Fernando Poo. The decline in fuel consumption (Table 3)
is evidence that traffic decreased considerably in recent years, as did the
registration of new vehicles; there was however some recovery in these items
in 1969/70. In both provinces, the consumption of gasoline has begun to pick
up again, but diesel consumption has diminished, reflecting not only a decrease
in truck traffic, but also a reduction in other activities, for example, the
use of equipment in lumber operations.
3.05      There is free entry and competition in road transport, and except
for a few inter-urban bus companies, most public transport vehicles are owner-
operated. Road transport regulation is limited to vehicle weights and dimen-
sions, but these regulations are not enforced. The Government has agreed at
negotiations that it will in future ensure that this is done.
C. Administration
3.06      The Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Transport is responsible,
through its Directorate of Public Works, for the road network (para. 2.08).
The staff of the Ministry has limited administrative experience. Spanish
Government engineers and administrators left soon after independence in 1969,
and have since been replaced only by two foreign civil engineers stationed
in Santa Isabel and in Bata. These two engineers prepare cost estimates,
and design and supervise construction of roads. Since DPW is also responsible
for other transport infrastructure and construction of public facilities, the
two engineers must also deal with water supply and harbor construction; the
workload and the lack of staff and equipment make it almost impossible for
them to organize and supervise highway maintenance and construction works
adequately. So far, insufficient effort has been made to train Guinean na-
tionals for key senior positions in the transport sector.
3.07      The Government is aware of the shortcomings of road administration,
and of the need to train local staff.  The country does not however have
vocational or professional schools adequate for this training, and the 5overn-
ment has not encouraged training of Guineans abroad. UNDP and Unesco - are
helping make a start in primary and secondary education, but it will take time
1/ United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.



to establish adequate technical training capacity in the country. The tech-
nical assistance under the project contains an important element of job-
directed training (para. 4.04), and will be the first real attempt to train
DPW personnel in techniques of road design, construction, and maintenance.
D. Planning and Financing
3.08     During the period 1960-68, annual road expenditures were about
EG pes 100 million (US$1.5 million equivalent), with roughly 60% for Rio
Muni and 40% for Fernando Poo. Since then, road expenditures have declined
considerably. In 1971, out of a budget of EG pes 1,300 million (US$20
millior. equivalent), EG pes 180 million (US$2.8 million equivalent) were
allocated for public works. Of this, EG pes 113 million were earmarked for
construction and 12 million for road maintenance; the construction allocation
included EG pes 80 million for a new port and access road at Bata, 23 million
for the water supply system of Bata, and 10 million (US$0.15 million equivalent)
for road improvements.
3.09      Revenues from road users are not earmarked for highway purposes,
but go into general Government revenues. Over the period 1969-71, road user
charges were estimated at about EG pes 112 million per year, which was far
higher than the amounts expended on roads. The main sources of road user
charges are import tariffs on vehicles, spare parts and tires, import taxes
on gasoline and oil, fuel, sales taxes, and registration and licensing fees.
3.10      As mentioned earlier (para. 2.08), the Government has no plan for
the transport sector nor for highway investments, and no unit in DPW capable
of preparing one. Decisions on what projects should be undertaken are made
on a case-to-case basis. Under the present project, the UNDP experts will
assist the Government in developing rational methods of planning (paras. 4.02
and 4.03). The Government has agreed at negotiations to facilitate collection
by the experts of the required traffic data, and to institute regular traffic
counts.
E. Engineering and Construction
3.11      Owing to staff limitations, DPW carries out road design on a'"rough-
and-ready" basis.  Neither of the road laboratories in Rio Muni or in Fernando
Poo is adequately equipped for soils and materials testing. Surveying and
drafting equipment are scarce and in inadequate condition.
3.12      Road construction, reconstruction, and improvement are undertaken
by contract without public bidding; contracts are negotiated directly with
locally established road constractors which are mainly foreign-owned, but
often managed by local staff. Skilled labor is recruited mainly from among
the Nigerian population (para. 2.01); there are only a few Guinean mechanics
and equipment operators. Construction supervision is insufficient. An intro-
duction to proper methods of preparing, tendering, and supervising road works
will be provided by technical assistance under the project, in which an amount
has been allocated for some improvement works (para. 4.09).



-6-
F. Maintenance
3.13      DPW has no organized maintenance division, and. owns hardly any
maintenance equipment. Routine day-to-day maintenance is performed by small
teams of laborers (one based in Fernando Poo and seven in Rio Muni) under
the direction of the Delegate (Deputy Director) for Public Works in each of
the provinces; recently, however, responsibility for routine maintenance in
Rio Muni was handed over to the Ministry of Interior. Major periodic maint-
enance is carried out by contract which usually also involves some reconstruc-
tion and improvement, including partial realignment, and construction of new
bridges.
3.14      The establishment of a road maintenance organization within MOP is
a matter of high priority, and constitutes an important part of the proposed
project. The Government has provided assurances at negotiations that it would
in future maintain its highway network adequately, and would provide all neces-
sary funds required to achieve this; the exact needs will be determined on the
basis of a program to be developed by experts under the project (para. 4.02).
The Government has also agreed that MOP will in future be responsible for all
road maintenance operations.
4. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project consists of:
(i) technical assistance to help MOP improve the highway administra-
tion, and to enable it to carry out road maintenance and road
improvement work efficiently;
(ii)  purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment, vehicles,
spare parts, and materials;
(iii)  construction or improvement of workshops, garages, and ware-
houses; and
(iv) execution of about 30 km of road improvement work by contract.
B. Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Public Works
4.02          UNDP technical assistance experts will provide managerial and
operational support to MOP, and will prepare a plan for improving its organi-
zation. They will also prepare a five-year (1974-78) maintenance and improvement
program, and other priority highway investments as identified. The experts
will determine in detail the needs fcr maintenance equipment, vehicles, and
materials, and will prepare the engineering for improvement works to be carried
out under the project. Training of nationals will be an important part of
their function, and this is expected to be undertaken at two levels: (i)
training of counterparts to the experts; and (ii) training of a lower-level
non-profession&l group as equipment operators and mechanics (para. 4.04).



-7-
4.03      The experts will assist MOP in improving all operations affecting
transport on the road network. To this end, they will do, inter alia, the
following:
(i)  collaborate with IPW in compiling inventory data regarding the
road network, workshops, road maintenance equipment, and
personnel;
(ii) recommend appropriate procedures for maintenance operations
and improvement work, and develop appropriate design standards
to this effect;
(iii) establish a traffic census system;
(iv) recommend improvements in vehicle weight control;
(v) estimate vehicle operating costs for different types of roads,
and collect other data required for the economic evaluation
of road projects; and
(vi) develop maintenance and investment budgets appropriate to the
country's financial situation.
4.04      The training program will be based on a study of the availability
and qualifications of personnel in Equatorial Guinea. Counterparts wil1 be
trained, although this may be difficult as there are as yet few Guineans with
higher education who would qualify. M;ore success can be expected from the
training of operators and mechanics for work on maintenance equipment.
4.05      The UNDP program provides for the purchase of items necessary to
enable the experts to carry out their tasks: vehicles, equipment for offices
and drafting, and for laboratories and surveys.
4.06      The UNMD technical assistance team will consist of four highway
experts as follows:
-    1. Head of Team, a civil engineer experienced in highway
administration;
-    1 civil engineer experienced in highway design and con-
struction, and with some knowledge of transport economics;
-    1 road maintenance expert;
-    1 equipment expert with experience in road maintenance.
These UNlDP experts will stay in Equatorial Guinea for about 2-23 years, or up
to a total of 108 man-months. The Government has already given its formal
approval to a list of four highway experts selected by the Association and
UNDP; however, should the need arise, it would be possible for the Government
to substitute other highway experts for those previously approved, provided
the conditions of their employment are satisfactory to the Association. Addi-
tionally, the project provides for the employment of other senior experts,



-8-
if required, for short-term assignments such as economic evaluation of road
investmernt projects, or special training courses.
C. Purchase of Equipment and Construction of Workshops
4.07      Following an overall review of existing road maintenance and workshop
equipment, the experts will prepare lists of items required, including vehicles,
spare parts, and tools. These items will be purchased in two installments. In
order to start the operations and the training programs without undue delay,
the first lot covering equipment needs for a pilot district would be ordered
soon after Credit approval (para. 4.13). A second more comprehensive list
would be prepared later, and procurement of those items would takB place after
the Government and the Association have agreed on the road maintenance and
improvement program for 1974-78 (para. 4.02), and after the Association has
received adequate assurances on the level of budgetary provisions to be made
for its implementation.
14.08     Workshops, garages, and warehouses must be improved; the experts
will develop the necessary plans for these works, and will prepare tender
documents. After the scope of works proposed has been agreed between the
Government and the Association, these works will be tendered among locally
established contractors (para. 3.12). The total cost of this item has been
roughly estimated at about US$150,000 equivalent.
D. Road Improvement Work (30 kim)
4.09      The project includes an amount of US$800,000 equivalent for a road
improvement scheme which would serve to demonstrate proper methods for en-
gineering, tendering, and supervision of this type of work. On the basis of
experience in other West African countries, it is expected that about 30 km
of road could be improved with the allocation provided. The experts will
recommend an appropriate road section, and the Association will approve the
selection on the basis of an economic evaluation by the experts.
E. Cost Estimates
4.10     TIhe total cost of the project is estimated at US$2.7 million equi-
valent as follows:

4.11      The cost of the technical assistance has been calculated provisionally
on the basis of the draft agreement between the Government and UNMDP. The foreigr,
exchange component has been estimated at 75% for road construction work, and l00%
for equipment costs (c.i.f.).  The Government confirmed that it wants equipment
to be imported duty-free.  An unallocated item of about 15% of the Credit amouwt
has been included.
F. Execution
4.12      Execution of the project will be the responsibility of DPW, assisted
by the UN1P experts, and if necessary by other experts employed directly by the
Government (para. 4.06). The experts will be employed under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association and to the Government. During Credit negotiations,
the Government agreed to these arrangements, and gave assurances that it would
implement the experts' recommendations after consultation and as agreed with the
Association. Signing of the technical assistance contract by UNDP, the Govern-
ment, and the Association is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
4.13      The first order of maintenance equipment, spare parts, and vehicles
(para. 4.07) will total about US$150,000; these items will be purchased through
competitive bidding among local agents and import companies, as it is desirable
to obtain them with the minimum of delay. The remainder of the equipment
(US$850,000) will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with normal Bank Group procedures. Equipment suppliers will be
required to provide an adequate servicing organization, including supply of
spare parts.



- 10 -
4.14      Procurement for improvement work by contract will follow normal Bank
Group procedures. Because of the limited size of the works (US$800,000), it
is likely that only contractors already established in Equatorial Guinea or in
neighboring countries - Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon - would be attracted. Adver-
tisements for the project will be announced in the local press as well as in
selected foreigii newspapers as agreed between the Governmernt and the Associa-
tion. The embassies of member countries of the Bank Group and of Switzerland
which are accredited to Equatorial Guinea will also be informed.
4.15      The procurement procedures detailed in paras. 4.13 and 4.14 above
have been discussed and agreed with the Government during Credit negotiations.
G. Financing and Disbursements
4.16      The Association will finance the actual foreign exchange cost of
maintenance equipment (c.i.f.), of the extension of workshops, garages, and
warehDuses, and of the cost of improvement works. UNDP will finance the
foreign exchange cost of the services of its highway experts, and of the
equipment necessary for their work. The Government has provided assurances
that it will finance the local costs of the project.
4.17      The experts are expected to comence work in the second quarter of
1973, and to complete their contracts towards mid-1975.  On this basis, the
annual breakdown of total expenditures between the Association, UNDP, and the
Government would be approximately as follows:
(in US$ millions)
Calendar Year         IDA           UNDP             Government
1973             0.15           0.16                 0.03
1974             0.95           0.16                  0.07
1975             0.90           0.08                 0.20
TOTAL     2.00          0.40                  0.30
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
5.01      The benefits attributable to a large part of the investment cannot
be exactly quantified. The institution-building character of this project
will, however, lead to benefits in more effectively managed highway operations
in the future. In regard to the investments in equipment and road improvement,
the evaluation that follows is only illustrative, because the equipment to be
purchased and the programs for maintenance and improvement will be defined only
during the course of the project.



- 1Jl -
B.  Hi_ w aintenance
5.02      The maintenance program under the proposed project will yield savings
as a result of the immediate reduction and the avoidance of future increases in
vehicle operating costs. The establishment of an efficient maintenance division
will reduce the cost of regular and periodic maintenance. Unquantified benefits
attributable to the project would result from extending the life of roads which,
without the project, would soon deteriorate to the point where their reconstruc-
tion would be necessary.
5.03      The above benefits will result from:  (i) capital expenditures in the
provision of technical assistance, new equipment purchases, the construction of
workshops, garages, and warehouses; and (ii) recurrent expenditures comprising
equipment operating costs, labor, materials, and general overhead.  The costs
used in the economic analysis are based on estimates of the appraisal mission,
And on Bank Group experience in other West African countries. The economic
life of the maintenance project has been taken as seven years, which represents
the expected economic life of the equipment to be purchased. However, in view
of the large institution-building element of the project, the actual impact
would be longer than seven years; the results are therefore conservative. Bene-
fits have been estimated based on initial traffic levels of 40 vpd with a growth
rate of 4% p.a., a figure for which no data basis exists but which is conserva-
tive compared to other West African countries. A 20% reduction in vehicle
operating costs due to road improvements resulting from adequate maintenance
of the entire network has been assumed; this figure is in line with Bank Group
experience in other West African countries following similar improvements.
On the basis of the above assumptions, the investment would yield an economic
return (ER) of over 40%, or a Benefit/Cost (B/C) ratio of over 1.4 at 10%
discount.
C. Road Imrovement Work
5.04      Road improvement works are at present executed by contractors on the
basis of negotiated contracts (para. 3.13). These works are carried out without
proper design, and with little supervision. The small improvement scheme in-
cluded in the project will demonstrate efficient methods for engineering, bidding,
and construction, and will also yield benefits in the form of road user savings.
5.05      For the economic analysis, it has been assumed that the 30 km section
to be selected for this scheme carries about 100 vpd at a growth rate of 6% p.a.
It is also estimated that vehicle operating costs will be reduced by 30% after
the improvement works.  These assumptions reflect closely existing conditions
on the first 15 km of the road frcm Bata to Niefang. Moreover, Bank Group
experience in other West African countries has shown similar savings in
vehicle operating costs after comparable improvements. On the basis of the above,
the road improvement scheme would yield an ER of at least 15% over the assumed
12-year economic life of the road, and a B/C ratio of about 1.4 discounted at
10%, which is satisfactory.

6. AGREEIVIENTS R3ACHED ADD RECONNENDATI0N
6.01      During Credit negotiations, agreements were reached with the Govern-
ment on the following principal matters:
(i) enforcement of regulations for vehicle weight control
(para. 3.05);
(ii)  instituting of regular traffic counts, and collection of
traffic data required for developing rational methods of
planning (para. 3.10);
(iii)  adequate maintenance of the highway network, and provision
of all necessary funds required to achieve this (para. 3.14);
(iv) a list of four highway experts for technical assistance under
the project (para. 4.06), and an assurance that their reccm-
mendations will be implemented (paras. 4.03 and 4.12);
(v)  procedures for procurement (paras. 4.13 - 4.15);
(vi) provision of funds to finance local costs of the project
(para. 4.16).
6.02      The Govermnent and the Association should agree on a five-year
maintenance and improvement program, and the Association should receive
adequate assurances on the level of budgetary provisions to be made for its
implementation. Agreement to this effect is a condition for disbursement
from the Credit for procurement of the second group of maintenance equipment
(para. 4.07).
6.03      Signing of the technical assistance contract by UNDP, the Govern-
ment, and the Association is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit
(para. 4.12).
6.04      The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit to the
Government of Equatorial Guinea in the amount of US$2 million.
