MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND COMMUNAL IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of the Philippines for US$46.2 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would assist the
Government of the Philippines in its efforts to provide continuity and
improvements in implementing its ongoing communal irrigation development program.
2.    Background. The Government, through the National Irrigation Administration
(NIA), provides services to national, communal and privately owned pump
irrigation systems throughout the Philippines. Of a potential suitable area of
about 3.2 million ha, some 1.45 million ha are currently irrigated:  (a) 600,000
ha under the large national systems, which NIA constructs and manages, and for
which it collects irrigation service fees from beneficiaries for operation and
maintenance; (b) 150,000 ha under privately owned pump systems, for which NIA
simply provides technical assistance; and (c) 700,000 ha under small run-of-
river gravity communal systems (CIS) that are owned and operated by farmer
groups. Some CISs have been built with NIA assistance and others without. When
NIA is involved, it provides financial and technical assistance in planning and
construction of the physical works, and develops and trains the irrigator
associations (IAs).  UAs are required to provide 1OZ of the chargeable costs
during construction, and to pay the remainder in not more than 50 years without
interest.   In selected areas NIA is also trying out alternative methods of
repayment which are expected to be moxe effective in recovering the chargeable
cost.    NIA's  communal  irrigation  development  program  is  well-regarded
internationally as a very successful effort at actively involving smallholder
irrigation beneficiaries in the design, implementation and O&M of their systems.
3.    The ongoing Communal Irrigation Development Project (CIDP I, Bank Ln. 2173-
PH/IFAD Ln. 108-PH, of June 1982) was the first foreign-assisted project in the
Philippines to focus entirely on communal irrigation development based on active
beneficiary participation. CIDP I was originally designed to cover 33,500 ha,
comprising about 22,800 ha of new area and 10,700 ha of rehabilitation. Initial
implementation delays were due mainly to general budgetary constraints during
the early and mid-1980s, but as these constraints have eased in recent years,
NIA has accelerated its communal program. Project implementation costs in US
dollar terms proved much lower than expected, mainly because of the lower peso
exchange rate and the fact that relatively more rehabilitation work (v. new
construction) was undertaken, as compared with appraisal estimates. In early
1988, the Bank and IFAD therefore agreed to almost a doubling of project targets
to about 65,200 ha; the Bank loan was reduced to USS 38.5 million through the
cancellation of US$ 20.1 million effective March 3, 1988 and US$ 12.5 million
effective December 22, 1989, and the closing dates of the Bank and IFAD loans
were extended thrice to December 31, 1990. Full utilization of the revised loan
amount, by this date, is expected. Nearly 1002 of all original and part of the
new targets have already been met, but completion of all incremental targets
would require several further extensions. The Government has decided instead



- 2 -
to formulate the proposed second stage project, using the   opportunity to
incorporate lessons learned during the implementation of CIDP I. These lessons
concern mainly the need for increased attention to the quality and intensity of
agricultural support services in irrigated areas; improvements to hydrological
and service area assessments of irrigation system; better financial management
and accounting of subproject capital cost recovery by lAs and NIA; greater
independence of IAs from NIA following completion of construction; improved
project benefit monitoring and evaluation systems, refinement of communal
irrigation subproject selection criteria suitable for nationwide application;
and more effective measures to ensure good quality construction and O&M of
communal irrigation facilities.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.   In the past,  the Bank's extensive
involvement in Philippine irrigation development related mainly to the larger
national systems. CIDP I marked the beginning of Bank assistance for smaller,
communally based irrigation efforts. The proposed project affords an opportunity
to build on achievements made and lessons learned under CIDP I. expanding Bank
support for NIA's pioneering approach to participatory irrigation development
and management. Communal irrigation development in the Philippines is also an
excellent avenue for poverty alleviation, wide dispersal of economic
opportunities, and improving the quality of life of remote rural communities.
5.    Project Objectives.  The project aims to provide for continuity and im-
provements in implementation of the Philippines' ongoing communal irrigation
development efforts, based on experience gained under the first Bank and IFAD-
financed Communal Irrigation Development Project (Bank Ln. 2173-PH/IFAD Ln. 108-
PH).  It would help to rehabilitate existing systems and extend smallholder
communal irrigation services to other new areas in impoverished rural locations
where over 90Z of the farmers live below the poverty threshold, thus contributing
to the Government's goals of poverty alleviation and food sufficiency.    The
project would also strengthen both the National Irrigation Administration (NIA)
and Irrigator Associations (TAs) throughout the country, in the fields of manag-
ement, financial administration, design and construction, and operation and
maintenance of communal facilities.
6.    Project Description.  The proposed five-year project would be nationwide
in scope, commencing during late-CY 1990, and would include:
(a)   the  construction  of  new  (10,000  ha)  and  rehabilitation  and
improvement of existing (15,000 ha) communal irrigation systems,
including provision of adequate service and access roads and simple
IA storage facilities and drying floors, and erosion control measures
in subproject catchments, where necessary;
(b)   development of communal lAs, including training of related NIA staff,
community organizers and IAs, with particular emphasis on management,
financial and O&M aspects;
(c)   institutional  strengthening  of NIA  in  the  field  of communal
irrigation, including improvement of NIA's communal accounting system
and collection efficiency;  improvement of the   monitoring and



- 3 -
evaluation capabilities of the Communal Irrigation Department;
upgrading of the physical facilities and equipment of the Provincial
and Regional Irrigation Offices; training of irrigation technicians
and designers;  and upgrading of NIA's ability to assess micro-
catchment hydrology; and
(d)   preparation and implementation of agricultural development plans for
each communal scheme financed.
7.    The total project cost, including physical contingencies and expected
price increases, is estimated at about US$64.4 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$28.3 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$46.2 million would
finance about 75? of total cost excluding taxes, including 100? of the foreign
exchange requirement and about 49? of local costs. The remaining project cost
of US$18.2 million would be funded by NIA and the Government. To facilitate an
early start-up of the project, expenditures of up to US$ 1.0 million, incurred
after July 1, 1990, would be considered for retroactive financing. A summary
of project costs and the financing plan is given in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8724-PH, dated August 31, 1990, is
being distributed separately.
8.    Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, Government and NIA confirmed that:
(a) NIA would adopt agreed nationwide selection criteria and design standards
for all communal irrigation systems; (b) NIA would exclude from the project any
irrigation systems which have been constructed or rehabilitated during the
preceding five years except those damaged by natural calamities, and schemes with
more than 20? of land still eligible for redistribution under the comprehensive
agrarian reform program would be included only after emancipation patents have
been issued; (c) to encourage increased IA independence, NIA would initiate a
pilot project to test the use of lead farmers instead of regular NIA staff in
developing IAs, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (d) NIA would retain
consultants, by January 1, 1991, to review and recommend improvements in the
financial accounting and management of communal irrigation systems, and commence
the implementation of the results of the said study by July 1, 1992; and (e)
prior to finalization of construction-level designs, NIA would furnish to the
Bank for its review and comments full evaluation reports for irrigation systems
estimated to cost more than USS 350,000 each and summary reports for irrigation
systems estimated to cost up to US$ 350,000.
9.    Benefits.  Through its support for NIA's communal irrigation program, the
proposed project would directly enhance and stabilize the incomes of about 20,000
low-income farm families, by increasing cropping intensities and output through
reliable irrigation and improved agricultural support services.  Indirectly,
through the institutional strengthening components for the beneficiary IAs and
NIA, the project would also improve the incomes of many additional small
irrigator families in the nearly 3,000 NIA-assisted communal schemes throughout
the country. The estimated economic rate of return of the project is 19?.



- 4 -
10.   Risks.  The investments to be made under the project do not face any major
risks, although implementation could fall short of expectations in some areas
due to sporadic peace and order problems. As the project is national in scope,
such problems would not seriously affect the overall project impact. Also,
potential difficulties would be eased by the opportunities afforded for active
farmer participation through the lAs, thereby instilling an increased sense of
responsibility on the part of the beneficiaries.
11.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
