F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Poverty Reduction and Public Management Operation (PRPMO) supports the
Government's efforts to implement critical reforms in public sector management and
poverty reduction programs identified in Guyana's 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy


                                                ii

Paper (PRSP) and the 2004 and 2005 Progress Reports.               Building on the reforms
supported by PRSC-I, the proposed operation aims to improve the transparency,
accountability, and efficiency with which overall resources are utilized across the public
sector.   In addition, the PRPMO will help improve the Government's institutional
capacity to monitor progress under the PRSP, evaluate the impact of poverty reduction
programs, and improve the statistical information for poverty analysis and targeting.
Finally, the operation will support actions to strengthen environmental management and
regulations to ensure the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources.

6.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)

Guyana is a low-income, commodity-based small economy that faces significant development
challenges. In the late 1980s, following more than a decade of disastrous performance under
socialist policies, Guyana embarked on a comprehensive program of reforms to liberalize the
state-controlled economy.1 A vast range of market-oriented reform measures was implemented,
including the elimination of most price controls, unification of the exchange rate, trade
liberalization, and large-scale privatization. These reforms resulted in a strong economic recovery,
with average growth of 7 percent from 1991 to 1997 and a fall in inflation to single digits from a
peak of about 100 percent in 1991. But by 1998, the initial gains of reform and stabilization
seemed exhausted. From 1998 to 2005, growth averaged only ¼ percent and the public finances
deteriorated reflecting a series of external and domestic shocks and delays in the implementation
of key structural reforms. A difficult security situation and social and political tensions, including
tensions between the two major political parties that are deeply divided along racial lines, also
contributed to hampering growth and poverty reduction efforts, weakened investor confidence
and resulted in high migration of Guyana's skilled manpower abroad.2

Guyana prepared its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2001. The strategy had
seven pillars: (1) broad-based, jobs-generating economic growth; (2) environmental protection;
(3) stronger institutions and better governance; (4) investment in human capital, with emphasis on
basic education and health; (5) investment in physical capital; (6) improved safety nets; and (7)
special intervention programs to address regional pockets of poverty. The Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board in September 2002, focused on supporting the policy
reform agenda of the PRSP, notably through interventions to support actions and policies to
stimulate growth, to improve governance and increase public sector efficiency and accountability
and to improve delivery and quality of basic services and safety nets. The CAS envelope was
US$25 million over a three-year period. The CAS marked a shift away from project lending to a
series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) that aimed to support the implementation of
the reform agenda set out in Guyana's PRSP. Drawing lessons from the implementation of the
1993 CAS, emphasis was also given to technical assistance, through the Public Sector Technical
assistance Credit (PSTAC), to help address key capacity constraints and support the
implementation of the PRSP.

Lessons from PRSC I indicated that Guyana did not have the capacity to complete a PRSC every
year and the reform agenda needed to be simplified and focused (Simplified ICR, June 2004; ICR,



1 The socialist policies, which were initiated in the mid-1970s, resulted in a drastic decline in income levels,
growing poverty, and a buildup of large external imbalances that culminated in an economic crisis in the
late 1980s. In 1988, official reserves were depleted and external payment arrears amounted to over 315
percent of GDP.

2 Guyana has one of the highest rates (89 percent) of skilled migration in the world (see World Bank (2006)
International migration, remittances, and the brain drain, Report no. 33988).




                                                                                                             1

March 2006). This led to a shift from PRSCs to a Development Policy Operation (DPO) series
that would be timed to match the speed of the Government's implementation performance,
focused on a narrower reform agenda and accompanied by enhanced technical assistance. The
Poverty Reduction and Public Management Operation (PRPMO) built on the achievements of
PRSC I and supported reforms to strengthen public management systems to increase the
efficiency of public resource use and to enhance capacity for poverty monitoring. In addition, the
operation supported actions to provide an adequate legal and regulatory framework to ensure
environmentally sustainable development.

At the time of the approval of the PRPMO Guyana's macroeconomic indicators were strongly
affected by significant exogenous shocks that hit the country. However, the situation was
expected to improve under the policies the government was implementing in the context of the
IMF-supported PRGF approved in 2002, for which the fifth review was successfully completed at
the end of January 2006.3 Significant exogenous shocks that hit Guyana in 2005 included the
closure of OMAI, the country's largest gold mine, the severe flooding early in the year and
higher-than-expected oil prices. These adverse shocks (anticipated and unanticipated) led to
                                         4

some deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, although the outcomes were broadly in line with
revised expectations under the IMF program. Guyana reached the Enhanced HIPC (E-HIPC)
Completion Point in December 2003, qualifying for US$329 million of debt relief in NPV terms,
in addition to the debt relief of US$256 million in NPV terms obtained under the original HIPC in
May 1999. However, by the end of 2004, concerns regarding debt sustainability had re-emerged.
However, improved growth prospects and revenue effort, as well as the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) significantly improved Guyana's debt outlook.

6.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Poverty Reduction and Public Management Operation (PRPMO) supports the Government's
efforts to implement critical reforms in public sector management and poverty reduction
programs identified in Guyana's 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the 2004 and
2005 Progress Reports. Building on the reforms supported by PRSC I, the operation sought to
improve the transparency, accountability, and efficiency with which overall resources are utilized
across the public sector (please see annex 7). In addition, the PRPMO aimed to help improve the
Government's institutional capacity to monitor progress under the PRSP, evaluate the impact of
poverty reduction programs, and improve the statistical information for poverty analysis and
targeting. Finally, the operation supported actions to strengthen environmental management and
regulations to ensure the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources. Technical assistance for
the implementation of the reform measures supported by the PRPMO was provided by IDA
through an ongoing Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC, US$4.8 million), a
Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant (US$595,000), and a Trust
Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) grant (US$ 285,000).

6.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

A. Ensuring a Sound Macroeconomic Framework. The PRSP includes as one of its pillars the
    maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework through satisfactory implementation of
    the macroeconomic program prepared in consultation with the IMF under the PRGF (2002-05
    and later extended to September 2006). The PRPMO incorporated the maintenance of a
    sound macroeconomic framework as a prior action.

B. Improving the Quality, Transparency and Accountability of Public Sector
    Management. The Government's agenda laid out in the PRSP gives priority to reforms
    aimed at improving the quality, transparency and accountability of public resource
    management. The PRPMO supports the Government's efforts in four critical areas:

        Improving the quality of the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). To increase
        the efficiency and transparency of public resource use, the Fiscal Management and
        Accountability Act enacted in 2003 required the preparation of a PSIP as an essential
        input into the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).               The Government,
        therefore, undertook to prepare and publish five-year rolling PSIPs consistent with PRSP
        objectives and debt sustainability. The PRPMO supported the preparation of the 2005
        rolling PSIP and the formulation of the methodology for selecting and ranking future
        projects. The government also committed to subject all new public investment projects
        appraised after June 2005, estimated to cost over US$10 million (net of grants),
        excluding those financed by multilateral financial institutions, to a detailed feasibility
        study reviewed by the World Bank or IDB for economic, environmental and financial
        viability. The PRPMO also foresaw the integration of the PSIP into the 2006 budget.

        Audit. To strengthen accountability and efficiency in the use of the public resources in
        Guyana, the PRPMO supported (i) the adoption of a new Audit Act and accompanying
        regulations detailing rules, policies and procedures regarding the management and
        operation of the Audit Office (AO) and the conduct of audits; and (ii) the implementation
        of the Auditor General's key recommendations contained in his 2004 report (see details
        in Annex VII of the PD).

        Fiduciary Oversight. To enhance transparency and oversight over the use of public
        resources, the PRPMO supported the first phase of the Government's fiduciary oversight
        strengthening program (see details in Annex VIII of the PD).

        Procurement. The PRPMO supported the implementation of public procurement reform
        consistent with established international standards, notably: (i) the adoption of the
        amended National Procurement Act and regulations as well as their dissemination; (ii) the
        appointment of staff for the National and Regional Tender Boards and Secretariat; (iii)
        the adoption of standard bidding documents and evaluation criteria; and (iv) the
        completion of first annual audit of procurement operations.

        Monitoring and Evaluation. The PRPMO supported the Government's efforts to set up
        a monitoring and evaluation system, including through: (1) the publication of a summary
        of the 2002 census data; (2) the launch of a household income and expenditure survey;
        and (3) the publication on a semi-annual basis of executed current and capital public
        expenditures by sector and priority poverty-related programs.

C. Improving the Climate for Environmentally-Sustainable Development. The operation
    supported the Government's commitment to sustainable development and improved
    environmental management in the following areas:



                                                                                                3

        Guyana Sugar Corporation's (GUYSUCO) Environmental Management Plan
        (EMP). The PRPMO supported the preparation of an EMP for the new sugar mill
        (Skeldon) and associated canefields expansion. The EMP would allow GUYSUCO to
        manage the Halcrow and GUYSUCO Conservancies (comprising some 7,500 hectares of
        freshwater swamp and reef forest) in a manner consistent with wildlife and biodiversity
        conservation, thereby effectively mitigating the natural habitat loss associated with
        expanding cane cultivation.

        Forestry. The PRPMO supported the preparation of a new Forests Bill, expected to
        ensure the sustainable development of Guyana's forest resources, while protecting the
        environment and advancing land tenure and the rights of indigenous peoples.

        Mining. The PRPMO provided technical assistance for the preparation of a Strategic
        Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the mining sector to serve as a basis for the drafting
        of the new legislation (see Annex XII for further details). The Government intends to
        draft and table in Parliament a new Mining Bill improving the regulatory environment for
        the mining sector (including issues such as environmental impact, taxation, and the rights
        of Amerindian communities). While the Mining Bill is likely to help attract new large-
        scale mining by international companies, such investments will need to minimize and
        mitigate a range of possible adverse environmental impacts. The submission of a new
        Mining Bill to Parliament is expected to be a prior action for PRPMO II.

    endorsement through policy statements by the Recipient's Prime
    Minister, the Recipient's Minister of Finance and Recipient's
    Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, in the Recipient's Parliament
    specifying reforms agreed to with stakeholders; and (v) submission
    to Parliament of the revised standing orders.

3. Continue the satisfactory reform of the regulatory and institutional     Met
    public procurement framework consistent with established
    international standards, through: (i) the adoption of the amended
    National Procurement Act and its regulations, and their
    dissemination; (ii) the appointment of staff for the Recipient's
    National and Regional Tender Boards and Secretariat; (iii) the
    adoption of standard bidding documents and evaluation criteria; and
    (iv) the completion of the first annual audit of procurement
    operations.

4. On monitoring and Evaluation: (a) issue the first semi annual            Met
    publication of executed current and capital public expenditures by
    sector and priority poverty related programs; (b) publish a summary
    of the 2002 census; (c) launch a household income and expenditure
    survey; and (d) complete the mapping of access to basic services.

5. Adopt and make satisfactory progress in the implementation of an         Met
    Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the Skeldon sugar
    factory and associated cane field expansion.


7.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Overall, the PRMPO supported key elements of the reform agenda in the PRSP and the
government was committed to their implementation. The key reform measures supported by



                                                                                     5

the PRPMO were presented in the Government's 2005 draft Annual Progress Report (APR) of
the Poverty Reduction Strategy as integral elements of its development agenda. The draft APR
was extensively disseminated, including by its posting on the web, and was discussed in several
public meetings involving a diverse range of stakeholders throughout the country before it was
considered by Parliament. The consultations broadly confirmed the importance and direction of
the government reforms supported by the PRPMO, with emphasis on those related to
strengthening government capacity for monitoring and evaluation. Consultations made to
prepare the fiduciary oversight reforms contributed to increased dialogue between the main
parties and resulted in a program of reforms with bi-partisan support, an outstanding
achievement in the Guyanese context. Bi-partisan support of the fiduciary oversight reform
agenda represents an unprecedented and encouraging development in Guyana's highly polarized
political environment, highlights the commitment across the political spectrum to these reforms
and contributes to their sustainability.

The design of the operation benefited from a wide range of Bank and other development
partners' analytical work, both formal and informal. The Development Policy Review
completed by the Bank in 2003 and endorsed by the government stressed the need to enhance
public sector efficiency, transparency and governance and improve the business environment.
The Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2002), the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA, 2002) and the 2004 IMF AAP update highlighted the actions needed to improve
transparency and efficiency of public expenditure and strengthen financial management, while the
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) of 1999, subsequently updated by Bank
specialists for the preparation of the PRSC I and PRPMO, supported the dialogue on procurement
reform.    The PSTAC, together with trust funds, provided funding for analytical work
underpinning the strengthening of fiduciary oversight and the reform of the social protection
system. The PSTAC and trust funds also supported the preparation of two poverty and social
impact analyses (PSIA) of key adjustments in the bauxite and sugar sectors5, as well as the
strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation system through the preparation of an M&E plan, a
diagnostic of the Bureau of Statistics, and the provision of technical assistance for the preparation
of a poverty map and the Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The Bank engaged
actively in the development of the PRSP and subsequent Progress Reports, and the content of the
PRPMO reflects this work. The analytical work for the new Audit Act derived from work funded
by the IDB.

Technical assistance to support the implementation of the reform agenda and good donor
co-ordination were critical elements. The technical assistance, both informal and through the
PSTAC, the PHRD Trust Fund and the Statistics TA had a positive effect on the operation.
Similarly, the close coordination among donors supporting the areas of reform covered by the
PRPMO, notably IMF, IDB and DFID, added momentum for the Government to act. The risk that
Bank funds could be used for questionable purposes in an election year or in the run up to the
cricket world cup was successfully mitigated through conditionality embedded in the IMF PRGF
program and coordinated monitoring from IDA, IMF and IDB.

Close Government and IDA coordination and regular monitoring contributed to the
successful implementation of the reforms. The close coordination and monitoring allowed the
timely identification of problems and bottlenecks and their rapid resolution. Notable in this

requirements of the Skeldon sugar expansion which was promoted under PRSC 1) are not part of the
PRMPO.




                                                                                                   6

respect was the presence of the PRPMO first task manager in the field for long periods during
the preparation of the program and for six months after the PRPMO was approved, ensuring
close monitoring and supervision.

The polarized nature of Guyana's politics poses inherent risks and lead to delays in
implementation of the reform agenda. For example, the political stalemate of the period
2002/04 delayed the passing of the Amended Procurement Law and accompanying regulations.
Also, the members of the independent Public Procurement Commission have not yet been
appointed because Parliament has not approved the candidates proposed by the Government.6

Program implementation was also adversely affected by the Government's weak
capacity. Years of political instability, insecurity and low pay have led to the loss of skilled
staff. The reversal of these constraints will take time, particularly given the budgetary constraints
faced by the Government that limits its ability to attract and retain skilled civil servants.

QAG assessed the PRPMO and rated the operation Moderately Unsatisfactory (4) (please see
discussion in section 10.1).

7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Policy Coordination and Program Management Unit (PCPMU) in the Office of the
President was responsible for coordinating and overseeing all aspects of the program supported
by the PRPMO. Other ministries and agencies, notably the Ministry of Finance, the Office of the
Auditor General, the Parliament Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, GUYSUCO and the Mining
Board also had key roles in executing the program, and worked with the PCPMU in
implementing program components under their respective jurisdictions.

The Bank monitored implementation through regular supervision missions, some of which
were joint missions with IMF and /or IDB as well as through the extended presence in the field
of the first PRPMO task team leader and frequent phone and video conferences from Washington.
Technical assistance from the PSTAC, the Statistics project, and the PHRD grant supported the
design and implementation of measures supported by the PRPMO. Close coordination with IMF
and IDB ensured additional technical assistance while conditionality embedded in the IMF PRGF
program mitigated some of the risks associated with the operation, notably regarding fiscal
discipline. With this assistance, all the measures supported by the PRPMO were undertaken prior
to Board approval and the reform agenda continues to be implemented.

The monitoring of the PRPMO program was based on the use of a matrix to track reform
implementation. This matrix identified pending reform measures, bottlenecks or pending
problems, expected next steps and institutional responsibilities for follow-up (on both the
Government and IDA sides).         This matrix was updated regularly by the Government PRPMO
coordinator and IDA PRPMO task team leader and was used by both teams during the regular
implementation review meetings and supervision missions.




6 The Constitution foresees the establishment of an independent Public Procurement Commission to
provide oversight for procurement matters. The appointment of the members of the commission require
approval by 2/3rd majority in Parliament.




                                                                                                    7

7.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The Government has indicated its interest in a PRPMO II, focused on deepening the reforms
introduced under PRPMO I. The indicative actions incorporated in Annex VI of the PRPMO are
being implemented and are expected to be supported by a new operation. A new PRSP is under
preparation in Guyana and is expected to be completed in early 2008. The new PRSP will inform
a new CAS. The PRPMO II would be scheduled for the Bank's Board in early FY09, after a new
CAS is adopted.7 Staff continues the policy dialogue and monitoring and supervision of the areas
of reform supported by PRPMO I.

8. Assessment of Outcomes

8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(To current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The PRPMO objectives, design and implementation arrangements were highly relevant, and
remain so today, to Guyana. First, the operation supported critical areas of the PRSP agenda,
namely stronger institutions and better governance; and environmental protection. The PRPMO
is also in line with the 2002 CAS, which focused the Bank's support on the implementation of the
reform agenda set out in the PRSP.

Second, a relevant design was achieved through close collaboration with other donors providing
assistance in the areas targeted by the PRPMO, notably the IMF and the IDB and complemented
their efforts. This ensured that Government efforts were focused on a commonly agreed and
supported reform agenda.

Third, the operation recognized the high level of risk involved in the implementation of the
reform program (including the complex political situation, particularly in the run up to the 2006
elections, capacity constraints in the public sector, fiscal pressures and vulnerability to exogenous
shocks) and tried to mitigate these risks through the provision of significant technical assistance,
close donor coordination, careful consideration of the delicate political balances, and
communication and outreach efforts. Also, the implementation of the operation was supported by
very close collaboration between the Government and IDA staff, and regular and frequent
program implementation monitoring meetings and supervision missions. Finally, the operation
relied heavily on earlier studies conducted by IDA and other institutions and by additional work
commissioned specifically to inform measures supported by the operation (such as the studies on
fiduciary oversight).

8.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)
A. Ensuring Macroeconomic Stability. With PRPMO support, the Government introduced
    measures and policies which contributed to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.
    Macroeconomic developments in 2006 were the most favorable in nearly a decade and
    outcomes were better than anticipated during the preparation of the PRPMO (Table 1). Real
    GDP is estimated to have increased by 5.3 percent, reflecting high growth in the timber and
    bauxite sectors. Inflation remained low, at 4.2 percent at end-December 2006. The external
    current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 25 percent of GDP, reflecting



7 This is in line with a recommendation from the QAG panel.




                                                                                                   8

       increased imports due to high fuel prices and large capital imports associated with significant
       public sector investment and a strong recovery in foreign direct investment. Nevertheless,
       financing was adequate and international reserves at end-2006 corresponded to 3.1 months of
       imports. The Guyana dollar remained stable at about G$200 per U.S dollar. In real effective
       terms, the dollar depreciated by 4 percent from end-2005 to end-2006. The overall fiscal
       deficit declined from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to 11.3 percent in 2006 and the primary
       balance improved from a deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to 1.4 percent in 2006. Tax
       revenues were higher than projected in 2006, largely offsetting the deterioration in the current
       balance of public enterprises resulting from lower-than-expected GUYSUCO receipts and
       higher payment for material and supplies by Guyana Power and Light (GPL). Broad money
       grew 18.6 percent in the 12 months to February, in line with the economic recovery.

       The medium-term macro framework suggests that macroeconomic stability will be
       sustained. Economic growth is projected to remain at 5 percent in 2007 and average about
       4.5 percent a year in the period 2008­11, reflecting a recovery in gold and bauxite
       production--in response to foreign direct investment in these sectors--a substantial increase
       in sugar production, and somewhat stronger economic activity in the rest of the economy.
       Inflation is projected to decline to 4 percent after the increase observed in 2007 caused by the
       introduction of the VAT.8 The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 13.5 percent
       of GDP by 2011--equivalent to the 1999­2004 average--owing to a deceleration of imports
       of capital and intermediate goods and higher exports of sugar, bauxite and gold. The 2006
       joint Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that concerns regarding debt
       sustainability in Guyana have been eased. The additional forgiveness of US$354 million from
       the IDB will reduce the NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio from 183 percent in 2006 to
       120 percent in 2007. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses indicate that the 250 percent
       threshold could be breached in the long run under a few of the standard and country specific
       alternative scenarios and Guyana's risk of debt distress is moderate.

B. Improving the quality of the PSIP. The PRPMO supported actions and policies that
       resulted in the preparation of a five year rolling PSIP as part of the budgetary process. A
       methodology for selecting and ranking projects was prepared by the government and was

    applied in the preparation of the 2005 and 2006 PSIPs, which were incorporated in the 2006
    and 2007 budget respectively.9 Projects included in the 2005 and 2006 PSIPs are broadly
    consistent with PRSP objectives and debt sustainability. However, two projects included in
    the first draft of the 2005 PSIP were the cause of particular controversy between the
    authorities and development partners, including IDA: (i) the construction of a sports stadium
    to host the 2007 Cricket World Cup (equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP); and (ii) the
    construction of a bridge over the Berbice river (6 percent of GDP). Even though the
    economic feasibility of both projects was subsequently confirmed (subject to certain
    contingency measures for revenue shortfalls in the case of the cricket stadium), they still
    spurred concerns about the government's priorities. The Berbice Bridge was ultimately
    undertaken by the private sector with limited participation from the National Insurance
    Scheme.10 However, the cricket stadium was maintained in the 2005 PSIP and was built to
    allow Guyana to host the 2007 Cricket World Cup, along with other Caribbean countries.
    Financing of US$25 million was provided by the Government of India (a US$5 million grant
    and a US$20 million concessional loan) and expenses related to the stadium were maintained
    within the limits agreed under the 2006 IMF supported program. The government maintains
    its commitment to subject all new public investment projects appraised after June 2005,
    estimated to cost over US$10 million (net of grants), excluding those financed by multilateral
    financial institutions, to a detailed feasibility study reviewed by the World Bank or IDB for
    economic, environmental and financial viability. Two projects of that size were appraised
    since June 2005 and both were subject by feasibility studies. The feasibility study for the
    Berbice Bridge was financed and reviewed by the IDB while the feasibility study for the
    Cricket Stadium was commissioned by the Government with financial support from the CDB.
    The completion of the feasibility studies for these projects was a condition under the IMF
    supported PRGF.

C. Improving Financial Management. Preliminary results of the Public Expenditure and
    Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, being prepared jointly by the Bank, IDB and
    EU, suggest that public financial management in Guyana improved considerably in the last
    five years. Most notably, new laws and regulations have been enacted to address systemic
    weaknesses and close loopholes in public financial management and procurement. The
    PRPMO contributed to these results in the following areas:

         Audit. The reform agenda supported by the PRPMO included the enactment of a new
         Audit Act and gazetting of regulations, and the implementation of the Auditor General's
         key recommendations contained in the 2004 report (Annex VII of the PD). The new
         Audit Act was enacted by Parliament in April 2004. Regulations detailing rules, policies
         and procedures regarding the management and operation of the Audit Office (AO) and
         the conduct of audits were approved by Parliament in May 2005 and gazetted in July
         2005. The Audit Act of 2004 gives the Auditor General key constitutional and legal
         requisites to carry out effective and independent audits. According to the Audit Act, the
         Auditor General (AG) is required to report annually, and within nine months of the end of
         each fiscal year, on the results of the consolidated financial statements and the accounts
         of budget agencies. The AG has delivered its 2004 audit opinion on the Public Accounts
         within 12 months, despite the disruption caused by the exceptional floods in 2005 and
         limited resources. The 2005 Public Accounts were submitted on July 31, 2007. Lack of

       personnel as well as problems affecting the Integrated Financial Management System
       (IFMAS) reconciliation module seriously hampered the government's ability to produce
       financial statements with the required timeliness. Nevertheless, preliminary results from
       the PEFA exercise indicate that the scope, nature and follow-up of external audit in 2006
       have improved compared to the situation reported by the 2002 CFAA.

       The Auditor General's reports are submitted to the speaker of the National Assembly.
       According to parliamentary rules, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is in charge of
       issuing reports on the Audit.     11  The latest report available from PAC was issued in
       February 2006 and concerns FY 2000 and FY 2001. Despite these delays, there is now a
       formal system in place for the follow-up of audit recommendations and the PEFA
       exercise indicates improvements in legislative scrutiny of external audit reports compared
       to the situation described by the 2002 CFAA. The MOF issued in April 2006, following
       the report from the PAC, a Treasury Memorandum, instructing Ministries to implement
       the recommendations from the PAC. In addition, the Government implemented key
       recommendations of the 2004 Auditor General's report (please see Annex VII of the PD).
       On the lottery fund: (i) the criteria for the selection of projects to be financed from the
       Lotteries Fund were defined, submitted to Parliament and published; (ii) a financial audit
       of the Lottery Fund for 2004 was completed in late 2005 and submitted to Parliament;
       (iii) reports of all projects submitted and selected for financing, including the amounts
       provided, were submitted to Parliament in 2005 and published. Reports have continued to
       be published semi-annually; and (iv) a compliance audit of the terms of the Lottery
       Agreement including validation of the calculation basis for determining the amounts
       owed to the Government was completed and approved by Parliament in May 2005. On
       the Wildlife Division: (i) the revenues derived from the operations of the Wildlife
       Division (1998-2002) were transferred to the Consolidated Fund; and (ii) the Wildlife
       Division was transferred from the Office of the President to the Environmental Protection
       Agency (EPA). On the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA): (i) the audit of the GRA's
       operations for 2003 was completed and tabled in the National Assembly; and (ii) the
       Government appointed the commissioner and deputy commissioner of the GRA in 2005
       as required by the law. Finally, in 2005, the Government undertook to table all existing
       external loans in the National Assembly, thereby increasing transparency and has done so
       since then.

       The AO is implementing a three-year strategic development plan - with IDB support -
       which when fully implemented, should allow it to perform operational, performance and
       forensic audits better. The implementation of state-of-the-art International Auditing
       Standards and auditing methodology has commenced and the AO is developing in-house
       skills to start auditing through the IFMAS system and to operate a data extraction and
       analysis application to support analytical reviews on government financial accounting
       databases. The recruitment of skilled auditors is also ongoing.

       Fiduciary Oversight. The reform agenda supported by the PRPMO included the
       launching of the first phase of the fiduciary oversight strengthening program (please see
       details in Annex VIII of the PD). The Government commissioned a series of studies,
       which made recommendations in three mains areas: (i) effective parliamentary oversight
       over public finances; (ii) curtailing discretionary powers of public officials; and (iii)




11Those rules are found in the Standing Orders of the National Assembly as amended on 2nd May, 2006.


                                                                                                   11

       disclosure of assets of public officials.12 The recommendations were subject to broad
       consultations and the Government selected 30 out of 60 recommendations detailed in the
       studies, for first phase implementation by end 2007. The Government is implementing
       the time-bound action plan for these 30 recommendations and most actions selected from
       the recommendations towards building an effective parliamentary oversight over public
       finances were completed or are ongoing (see details in Annex 8). Progress in the
       implementation of the actions planned to curtail discretionary powers of public officials
       and to provide the framework for the disclosure of assets of public officials has been
       sluggish.

       With IDB support, the Government's efforts have led to the revision of Parliamentary
       Standing Orders and measures to strengthen the Integrity Commission to effectively
       review the assets of public officials. The system of Parliamentary Committees has been
       revitalized with the establishment of four Sectoral Committees on: Natural Resources,
       Economic Services, Foreign Relations and Social Services. In addition, operations of the
       Public Accounts Committee and the Economic Services Committee have been
       strengthened through training and funding of specialized studies and consultants.

       Procurement. Measures in the area of procurement envisaged under the PRPMO
       included (i) the adoption of an amended National Procurement Act and respective
       regulations, and their dissemination; (ii) appointment of staff for the National and
       Regional Tender Boards and Secretariat; (iii) adoption of standard bidding documents
       and evaluation criteria; and (iv) completion of the first annual audit of procurement
       operations.. The Amended National Procurement Act was passed by the National
       Assembly in July 2003 and gazetted in November 2004. Regulations were adopted in
       December 2004 and disseminated. Board members for National and Regional Tender
       Boards and Secretariat were appointed in 2005 and the training program began in July
       2005. Standard bidding documents were completed and disseminated in a pilot phase in
       2005. The standard bidding documents have been extended to all government institutions
       at ministerial and regional tender board levels. Although candidates for the Public
       Procurement Committee (PPC) were proposed by the government, the Public Accounting
       Committee of Parliament has yet to decide on these appointments. The Audit Office has
       reviewed Government compliance with the Procurement Act in the context of the annual
       audit report for 2004, and has made recommendations to correct deficiencies. Likewise,
       compliance with the Act has been reviewed in the 2005 Audit of National Accounts. In
       addition, a consultancy was carried out in 2006 on Strengthening of Procurement
       Administration. This consultancy produced a series of recommendations that are being
       incorporated into an action plan. The recommendations include the development of an e-
       procurement system, for which a stand-alone strategy was submitted in March 2007. The
       new legal and regulatory framework provides Guyana with the framework needed to
       render public procurement more efficient, competitive and transparent. Further adaptation
       and simplification of the bidding documents might be required to cover the full range of
       the smaller value threshold procurement in Guyana, so as to have the desired effect of
       increasing competition. The nomination of the PPC and its secretariat would also
       strengthen the framework.




12Assets are disclosed to the Integrity Commission.


                                                                                             12

       Preliminary results of the ongoing PEFA exercise show that competition, value for
       money and controls in public procurement improved in te last few years as a result of the
       reforms introduced.

  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PRPMO supported measures aimed at improving the
  Government's ability to monitor and evaluate the impact of policies introduced in the context
  of its PRS. Actions undertaken by the government (which were PRPMO prior actions) are:
  (i) strengthening of the Statistics Bureau, notably through technical assistance; (ii)
  publication of 2002 census data; (iii) completion of the Household Income and Expenditure
  Survey in May 2007 and preparation of a poverty report that will inform the new PRSP now
  under preparation; (iv) publication of the executed public current and capital expenditures by
  sector and by priority poverty-related programs on a semi-annual basis ­ the last report was
  published in June 2007 and is available to the public in hard copy from the Office of the
  President. It is expected that it will be among the documents available on the PRSP website
  when fully operational; (v) preparation of a map describing access to basic services, which
  will be updated regularly.      In addition, the government is developing a systems-based
  approach to monitoring and evaluating the PRS. The Government intends to further
  strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of its PRSP implementation, including by
  expanding its public expenditure tracking system and using census and household income and
  expenditure survey results to inform the PRS progress reports and budget allocations.

D. Improving the Climate for Environmentally-Sustainable Development. The PRPMO
  supported actions and policies to protect the environment in the sugar, forestry and mining
  sectors. Progress made in this area includes:

  Sugar Sector. The Government is undertaking a major restructuring and modernization plan,
  including the construction of a new sugar mill (Skeldon) and development of canefields, to
  improve the competitiveness and viability of its sugar industry after the erosion of the EU
  preferential regime. The Government adopted and is implementing, through GUYSUCO, an
  Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the new sugar mill and associated canefields. In
  this context, GUYSUCO is managing the Halcrow and GUYSUCO Conservancies,
  comprising some 7,500 hectares of freshwater swamp and reef forest, in a manner consistent
  with wildlife and biodiversity conservation, thereby effectively mitigating the natural habitat
  loss associated with expanding cane cultivation. With technical assistance provided by the
  Bank, sites were selected for the new landfill that GUYSUCO will need for waste generated
  by construction and operation of the Skeldon facilities, as well as for a Rapid Biological
  Assessment of the conservancy area to provide useful baseline data for biodiversity
  monitoring and management.           GUYSUCO has also prepared, and is systematically
  implementing, a detailed Pest Management Plan that emphasizes integrated pest management,
  careful selection of compounds, safe pesticide use and storage. GUYSUCO is also providing
  technical assistance and free pest management support to private farmers who are or will be
  supplying cane to the new Skeldon factory.

  Forestry. The Guyana Forestry Commission Bill 2007 was passed by Parliament on July 26,
   2007. The new bill repeals the Guyana Forestry Commission (GFC) Act 1979 and re-
   establishes the Guyana Forestry Commission. According to the Bill, the purpose of the
   Commission will be to encourage the development and growth of forestry in Guyana on a
   sustainable basis. This Bill will be followed by a new Forests Bill which is expected to be
   tabled before the House by end 2007. Among other features, the new Forests Bill will
   increase transparency in the establishment of conservation concessions and special protected
   areas, while respecting Amerindian rights and allowing for opportunity for community-based
   forestry on Amerindian lands. The Government also intends to update the Code of Practice
   to support implementation of the new Forests Bill.


                                                                                             13

     Mining. The Government is drafting a new Mining Bill, which will improve the regulatory
     environment for the mining sector (including issues such as environmental impact, taxation,
     and the rights of Amerindian communities), and is expected to be submitted to Parliament by
     mid 2008. While the Mining Bill is likely to help attract new large-scale mining by
     international companies, such investments will need to minimize and mitigate a range of
     possible adverse environmental impacts. The Bank provided technical assistance for the
     preparation of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the mining sector to serve as a
     basis for the drafting of the new legislation (see Annex XII of the PD for further details). The
     SEA was completed in 2006.


8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Satisfactory

Objectives, design and implementation were relevant to Guyana's priorities as defined by the
PRSP and confirmed in the PRSP Progress Reports, and to the Bank strategy. The operation's
objectives were achieved and the sustainability of the reforms implemented is likely over the
medium-term. The Government has continued implementation of the reforms and has indicated
its interest on a follow-on IDA Operation (PRPMO II), supporting the second phase of the reform
program introduced by PRPMO I

8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The PRPMO's strategic contribution to the reduction of poverty was through (i) building the
capacity and setting up the mechanisms (institutional arrangements, formats, etc.) and systems to
improve the monitoring and evaluation of poverty-related programs and interventions; (ii)
enhancing the impact of public spending and reducing the level of discretion of top officials while
supporting accountability, transparency and participation; and (iii) strengthening environmental
management and regulations to ensure the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources, which
are key sources of economic growth13. These are steps that equip the country with the basic
information and reporting system that it will need to really develop an effective strategy that
focuses on the poor, while enhancing public management systems to increase efficiency in the
use of public resources. Guyana has benefited from large aid inflows over the years, but the
impact on economic growth and poverty reduction has been limited, raising doubts about the
efficiency of the projects and highlighting the need for improvements in this area. The Bank's
intervention would also inform direct interventions of other donors such as the IDB. In addition,
the PRPMO is expected to have a positive impact on improving the social conditions of the
Amerindian population ­ the poorest group, through its support to sustainable development of
natural resources (Forests Bill and SEA of mining sector to inform new Mining Bill). The Bank's
support should be seen as one building block of the government's anti-poverty strategy provided
by a donor with limited levels of financial support. Obviously, the immediate impact of this type
of policy is difficult to assess.




13 These areas are consistent with the CAS agenda.




                                                                                                  14

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

As the PD acknowledges, implementation capacity in Guyana is weak and was a key factor in the
past delays in PRSP implementation. The PSTAC and resources from two Bank-managed grants
(PHRD and Statistics), provided technical assistance for the implementation of several measures
supported by the PRPMO, such as: (i) assistance to the preparation of the fiduciary oversight
studies and of bidding documents; (ii) the training of public officials in procurement and M&E;
(iii) TA to strengthen capacity for the treatment and analysis of census and household survey
data; and (iv) TA for the preparation of the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Guyana's
mining sector, to help ensure that the future Mining Bill will more adequately address a diverse
range of environmental and social issues. In addition, close coordination with the IDB ensured the
additional technical assistance needed to sustain the reforms supported by the PRPMO, notably
for the preparation of the PSIP and to build the capacity of Parliamentary commissions in charge
of fiduciary oversight. As a result of these interventions, capacity improved considerably in the
areas of statistics (census and survey data manipulation and reporting). The regulatory framework
and capacity have also improvement in the areas of procurement and auditing. However, the
reliance on consultants to perform many of the functions in these areas will need to be reduced.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
The PRPMO increased the visibility of the government reforms in the areas of procurement and
fiduciary oversight, which are now receiving support from other donors, notably the IDB and the
MCC Threshold Program.

8.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
Neither surveys nor stakeholder workshops were undertaken.

9. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned in paragraph 76 of the PD, critical risks to the operation were: (i) lack of national
consensus, ethnic and political tensions, and security; (ii) implementation and institutional
capacity; (iii) public spending pressures in the run up to the 2006 elections and the 2007 Cricket
World Cup; and (iv) developments in the world economy. To address capacity constraints,
extensive technical assistance by IDA (PSTAC and a PHRD grant), IMF and IDB was provided
to mitigate some risks (paragraph 76 of the PD). The risk that Bank funds could be used for
questionable purposes in an election year was mitigated through conditionality of the IMF PRGF
program. The IMF program, the preparation of PSIP (incorporated in the budget and monitored
by the IMF) and the monitoring of large projects (Skeldon, by IDA and the IMF, with DfID
support, the Cricket Stadium, mainly by the IMF, and other large projects by the IDB) address the
broader fiscal discipline issue. Data on the 2005 and 2006 budget execution shows that the
mitigating measures were adequate. The reforms supported by the PRPMO were implemented
prior to Board approval precisely because the team recognized the risks (paragraph 76 of the PD).
The preparation of the PRPMO contributed to increased dialogue between the main parties and
resulted in a program of reforms with bi-partisan support, an outstanding achievement in the
Guyanese context.




                                                                                                15

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

The operation was prepared carefully, paying great attention to the client's needs, capacity
constraints, political circumstance and the Bank's comparative advantage. Careful attention was
also given to donor coordination to leverage support for the implementation of the measures
supported by the operation and ensure effective mitigation of risks. These efforts combined with
strong country ownership resulted in the successful implementation of the actions supported by
the operation and the sustainability of the reform program.

10.1.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
    Rating: Satisfactory

The operation was prepared carefully, paying great attention to the client's needs, capacity
constraints, political circumstance and the Bank's comparative advantage. Moving away from
the annual PRSCs model and implementing a strategically focused programmatic DPL tailored to
take account of Guyana's needs, its capacity, IDA's comparative advantage and the role of other
donors, was fully adequate and justified. This was the best instrument to support Guyana, given
this country's specific circumstances. The decision to follow this approach benefited from broad
consultations in the region and the Bank (DEC, OPCS, etc.), several review meetings and
consultations with other donors.

The risk-reward tradeoffs were adequately assessed and mitigated. Macroeconomic outcomes
(please see 8.2 A. above) in 2006 were the most favorable in nearly a decade, expenditures
related with the Cricket Stadium and the elections were contained broadly within the program's
limits; preliminary indications from an ongoing Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) assessment showed that much progress was made in PFM as a result of recent reforms;
the action plan for fiduciary oversight is being implemented; the PSIP was updated in 2006 and
integrated in the budget, the 2005 audit report was tabled in Parliament and the new Forests
Commission Bill was passed. Finally, donor coordination was deepened and IDB resources were
leveraged for the implementation of a number of the reforms supported by the PRPMO.14 These
developments show that reforms were well justified and timely, adequate risk mitigation
measures were applied and the reforms are sustainable.

QAG assessed the PRPMO and rated the operation Moderately Unsatisfactory (4), but the team
and the regional management disagree with assessment and presented a rejoinder. In QAG's
view, the operation was moderately unsatisfactory because (i) government ownership and
commitment to the reforms was weak, as evidenced by the slow progress in key elements of the
PRSP program in the areas of the regulatory framework for mining and forestry and financial
accountability; and (ii) the poverty focus of the operation was weak, undermining its rationale.
Furthermore, the panel is of the view that the overall government expenditure program in 2006,
involving a significant expansion of public spending as a share of GDP without commensurate
expansion of implementation capacity, did not justify the provision of incremental financing by
IDA. The key reasons raised by the team and regional management to contest the assessment are
(i) the final judgment was largely an external opinion on the country strategy which did not take
into account the particular circumstances surrounding the country and the development of this
operation and hence did not address policy lessons or weaknesses in operational policy; (ii) the


14 One example is the "Support for the Implementation of the Strategic Plan of the Auditor's Office",
approved by the IDB's Board in December 2006 (GY-T1030).


                                                                                                      16

assessment does not address the PRPMO and its achievements (which were impressive) but a
different operation that the panel seems to believe should have been undertaken (PRSC type)
even though the approach followed by the PRPMO was strongly endorsed by the project team,
regional management and development partners such as the IDB and IMF; and (iii) the
assessment does not take into account that the operation introduced innovative reforms which are
resulting in remarkable changes in fiduciary oversight. Measures are being sustained and
deepened with support from other donors, notably IDB and MCC.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

    Rating: Satisfactory

After disbursement of the PRMPO, the Bank remained fully engaged with the authorities,
providing technical assistance and closely monitoring the implementation of the actions and
policies supported by the operation. In order to address capacity bottlenecks, IDA complemented
the assistance under the PRPMO with technical assistance provided by (i) the Public Sector
Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC) and; (ii) the multi donor financed Guyana National
Statistics Strategy and Statistical Development grant. Supervision and monitoring activities
included visits to Guyana as well as phone, video conferences and email exchanges with the
authorities. IDA staff also worked closely with partner donors notably the IMF and the IDB.

The work with the authorities continues and a follow-on PRPMO II is being considered to
support the second phase of the reform program supported by the PRPMO, thus
providing continuity and sustained support for these reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory.

The overall performance of the Bank is considered satisfactory. Analytical work, including work
prepared or commissioned by IDA, informed the Government reforms (2005 PRSP Progress
Report) from which measures supported by the PRPMO derive. IDA also provided extensive
technical assistance for the preparation and implementation of the PRPMO supported program
and helped leverage resources of other donors, played a key role in coordination with the IMF,
IDB and other donors and ensured close monitoring of the PRPMO program implementation
through frequent and regular reviews.

10.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

The rating for Borrower performance is satisfactory. Despite a challenging political situation
and delays, the Government exerted committed efforts to implement the reforms supported by the
PRPMO. In particular, it should be noted that the Government made considerable effort, with the
support of IDA's staff, to pro-actively engage and find a common ground with opposition parties
to define an action plan for the fiduciary oversight reforms -- a demonstration of its commitment
and determination to pursue its governance efforts in this area -- and as a result cross party
Parliamentary support for the reforms was reached. Also, despite the difficult country
environment, the Government implemented all the PRPMO conditions and several of the other
reforms included in the PRSP program.




                                                                                              17

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

The Policy Coordination and Program Management Unit (PCPMU) coordinated and oversaw all
aspects of the PRPMO supported program and to coordinate the work of other ministries and
agencies, notably the Ministry of Finance, the Auditor General Office, The Ministry of
Agriculture, the Mining Board and GUYSUCO. The PCPMU was proactive in anticipating
implementation issues and by holding regular meetings and contacts to monitor progress, helping
solve difficulties faced by other implementing agencies as they emerged. In addition, the PCPMU
was proactive in maintaining contacts with the Bank's team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory.

As a whole, the Government's reform program was well focused and designed and it has been
implemented despite the difficult circumstances. Identification and implementation of
the program had to take into account the possible impact on the program of a fragile political
situation, a serious shortage of skills in the public sector, possible external shocks, and weak
economic management in the preceding years. Macroeconomic stability was maintained
and Guyana is negotiating a new IMF-supported PRGF arrangement. Most PRPMO conditions
were met and several other reform measures covered by the Government's program have been
implemented. The authorities continue to implement measures to (i) build the capacity and setting
up the mechanisms (institutional arrangements, formats, etc.) and systems to improve the
monitoring and evaluation of poverty-related programs and interventions; (ii) enhance the impact
of public spending and reduce the level of discretion of top officials while supporting
accountability, transparency and participation; and (iii) strengthen environmental management
and regulations to ensure the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources.

11. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Choice of lending instrument. Experience from the implementation of the PRSC I showed that:
(i) Guyana did not have the capacity to complete a PRSC every year and (ii) the reform agenda
needed to be simplified and focused (Simplified ICR, June 2004; ICR, March 2006). These
lessons led to the move from PRSCs to a series of programmatic DPLs, while keeping the
fundamental goal of pursuing the most effective tools to improve the capacity of the country to
reduce poverty. The implementation of the PRPMO demonstrates that the decision to move from
annual PRSCs to a series of programmatic DPLs was adequate in view of the period required by
the Government to implement reforms. It also indicates that reforms need to be sensitive to the
political context and to IDA's comparative advantage. In the post-MDRI environment with
limited IDA resources, the Bank's true value added is in policy dialogue and policy-based lending,
while also leveraging support for the execution (implementation) of the reforms from other
development partners with larger resource envelopes. Hence, follow-on support should be timed
to meet the pace of reforms depending on the Government's capacity, political context,
commitment to reforms and IDA's comparative advantage, while continuing a focus on core
priorities of the PRSP and privileging coordination with other development partners.

Client commitment. The successful implementation of the Government's program followed
from its ownership and degree of commitment. The PRPMO supported key pillars of the PRSP.
Specific policies in the area of fiduciary oversight were included in the 2005 PRSP Progress
Report and endorsed by Parliament. Moreover, the action plan for fiduciary oversight reform was
adopted after broad consultations and had support from the main political parties. This helped



                                                                                              18

strengthen the Government's ownership and commitment to the PRPMO supported program and
to its medium-term sustainability. Also, the emphasis on communication and monitoring by civil
society of these reforms had a positive impact on the Government's commitment to its
implementation.

Institutional capacity. The PRPMO PD acknowledged that weak institutional capacity
represented a critical risk for the implementation of the reform program (paragraph 76 of the PD),
and judiciously coordinated TA through other Bank programs and with other development
partners (paragraph 59 and 62). However, experience during twelve months has highlighted how
severe this problem is and the significant amount of technical assistance and realistic time frames
needed for implementation of reforms in Guyana. In this respect, the timely delivery of technical
assistance by the international community has been and remains critical to making sufficient
progress in the reform program. Also, it confirms the need to continue pursuing the reform
program incrementally. Finally, the implementation of the PRPMO underscores the need to
support the development of permanent capacity to sustain the reforms in the long run.

Donor coordination. As mentioned earlier, close coordination among donors in the provision of
financial and technical assistance greatly contributed to the outcome of the reform program.
Going forward, as Guyana enters a more complex phase with the agenda of PRSP II, it will be
critical that coordination with the other donors active in this area continues to be further
strengthened. The PRPMO also confirms that the Bank's strategic role in Guyana is in supporting
policy reform while coordinating its policy work with financing and implementation support from
other donors, in light of the limited resource transfers anticipated for the post-MDRI era.

The lessons detailed above are being taken into account for the preparation of PRPMO II.
