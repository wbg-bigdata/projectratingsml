INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO JAMAICA FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following repolt and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of $13.5 million to help finance a pro-
ject for the construction of arterial roads. The loan would have a tenm of
25 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Economic Report (No. 257a-JM) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 12, 1974.   Country data sheets are attached as Annex I to this report.
3.        During the decade 1962-72 the economy has expanded rapidly with
the annual rate of growth accelerating from about 4.5% to about 5.5%. At
the same time the economy has undergone major structural changes. Mining,
alumina production and tourism' all supported by large private capital
inflows, have expanded, while agriculture has stagnated and agricultural
exports, notably of sugar, have declined. This shift in the production
pattern has been accompanied by rapid urbanization, and by the emergence
of severe and persistent unemployment and of sharp disparities in income
distribution. Large-scale emigration abroad during the decade has resulted
in the loss of significant numbers of skilled and semi-skilled workers; the
consequent shortage of technically qualified personnel has been aggravated by
deficiencies in the academically oriented educational system.
4.        As a result of its limited resource endowment and the small size
of its domestic market, Jamaica has a very open economy heavily dependent
on the external sector. Until 1972 a widening current account deficit in
the balance of payments had been offset by substantial private capital in-
flows for expansion of the bauxite/alumina industry. These inflows fell
off sharply in 1972 with the completion of major investments in alumina
capacity. Partly as a consequence, but also due to some weakness in
monetary and fiscal programs, Jamaica for the first time since independence
experienced serious balance-of-payments difficulties. Corrective action
taken late in 1972 and early 1973, including devaluatiors, the imposition
of import restrictions and a tightening of credit policy, was successful
in temporarily reversing the reserves drain during the middle of 1973.
However, subsequently exchange reserves have fallen again and by the end



- 2-
of 1973 were down to about one monthst imports. The situation has been
aggravated by the tripling of petroleum prices at the end of 1973 which
will cost Jamaica about US$100 milli-n extra in 1974, equivalent to about
, of 1973 export earnings.    To conserve fo:-eign exchange reserves the
government in early 1974 took additional mea;ures including an increase
-n gasoline taxes, further restrictions on imports and credit availability
and an increase in interest rates. Jamaica has recently obtained increases
in the prices of its sugar and banana exports to the United Kingdom and in
May of this year announced increases in taxes and royalties on the U.S. and
Canadian-owned bauxite companies, estimated to yield an additional $155 mil-
lion in 1974. The greatly increased revenues in prospect from bauxite taxa-
tion would provide substantial relief to Jamaica's balance of payments during
the rest of 197h and in ensuing years. The government action followed the
failure to reach negotiated agreement with the ccmpanies on new tax measures.
The companies have objected to the tax increases announced and indicated that
they would take legal action; three US-owned companies have requested arbitra-
tion before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID). In addition to the issue concerning the taxes and royalties, there
are other outstanding issues (such as land ownership, government participa-
tion in companies, and guaranteed supply of bauxite for companies), on which
the companies and the government have indicated their willingess to negotiate.
5.        In recent months there has been a sharp increase in Jamaica's
donestic price level which during 1973 increased by an average of 19% over
the previous year and by February 1974 the consumer price index had inrerased
by about 27% over February 19730 In part the increase can be attributed to
recent increases in world prices and higher import prices resulting from
devaluation. However9 under the pressure of active trade unions, wage
settlements in recent years have outstripped increases in productivity and
have been particularly high during the last few months, reaching 25% in the
construction industry and even higher levels in other sectors. The government
is considering the early implementation of a iices and incomes policy which, if
effective, would help Jamaica retain its international competitiveness. The
government is keeping under review action to progressively increase interest
rates, which have becoms negative in real terms as a result of recent price
inflation.    This would encourage savings, and help reduce the present interest
rate incentive to invest funds abroad rather than in Jamaica.
60        Without a sustained rate of economic growth of about 7% annually
it will bs difficult for the country to achieve its principal objective of
a significant reduction in the high rate of unemployment, currently about
15%. The need for increased job creation will become even more acute in
the years ahead since the growth rate in the total population of working
age is expected to rise from 0.5% to 3% during the period to 1980 due to
falling emigration and an increase in the birth rate in the 1950so For
the immediate future the potential for increased growth and employment
is encouraging. In agriculture, a comprehensive review of the sector has
recently been undertaken with assistance from the Bank; government initia-
tives are already under way to rehabilitate the important sugar industry,
and other government plans to revitalize the sector include land-use
reorganization to increase productivity and employment, and measures
to stimulate other export crops and domestic food production. In the
mining sector, bauxite and alumina output should increase substantially
as a result of recent investments. A substantial investment in an oil



refinery is in prospect with the possibility of associated investments in
retro-chemicals; and in manufacturing, there is potential for increased
contribution to export growth. However, the sxtent to which Jamaica's
agricultural and industrial growth potential can be realized will depend
in large part on how successful the government is in implementing policies
to improve Jamaica's competiti-v position and to overcome existing insti-
tutional constraints.
7.        The increased rate of growth necessary to make a significant
impact on unemploy1mnt will reciuire substantially higher inflows of private
and public capital than in the recent past. Such inflows are in prospect
over the next few years and given continued progress in public policies, it
is likely that they could be maintained for the rest of the decade. The
source and direction of commitments of external public loans (including
government-guaranteed loans) from 1965 to 1972 are given in the table in
Annex I and have averaged over $40 million per annum. For the five-year
period 1974-78, public capital inflows, including guaranteed loans to
the private sector, could reach J$450 million. From existing indications,
about 60% will be raised from official sources - the Bank, IDB and bilateral
aid sources, while the remainder would consist of medium-term loans from
suppliers and financial institutions. Private capital inflows in the form
of equity and loan payments are also forecast to be substantially above the
recent past, mainly because of private loans projected for the proposed
oil refinery.  Jamaica will also need to mobilize increased domestic fi-
nancial resources, both public and private. It will thus be necessary for
the government to take measures to restrain the growth of government current
expandit.ures and to achieve a further growth of revenue relative to GDP. A
recovery in private sector savings can also be expected provided the govern-
ment maintains fiscal discipline and discourages consumption by the appropriate
use of monetary policy.
8.        Jamaica will need to take prompt and determined policy measures
in the critical areas of the economy outlined above, and discussed at
greater length in the Economic Report, to maintain economic stability and
achieve a reasonable rate of sustained economic growth. Assuming sound
policies are pursued, public debt service as a ratio of export earnings
is projected to rise from about 4.0% in 1972 to perhaps 7.5% by 1980. Given
the importance of exports in Jamaica's GNP, this ratio is high but not
unmanageable, and the country remains creditworthy for further borrowing
on conventional terms. Although no special terms of Bank lending appear
justified on country grounds, the foreign exchange component of projects
in sectors such as agriculture, urban development and population planning,
may be relatively small; in order, therefore, to help achieve an adequate
level of external capital inflows some local currency financing would be
justified in these cases. While it has not yet been possible to assess
fully the impact of recent higher petroleum and other commodity import prices on
the Jamaican economy., the rise in tax revenues and export earnings in pros-
pect from bauxite, alumina and sugar may largely offset the increased costs
of petroleum and other imports (paragraphs 4 and 6 above), The Bank is
currently reviewing the situation more closely, with particular emphasis on
the external sector, following a recent economic mission to Jamaica in mid-June.



_4-
PART II  - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
Introduction
9.        Since the country's independence in 1962, the Bank has made ten
loans to Jamaica totalling about $90.0 iaillion. Of this amount about $h0.0o million
has been for infrastructural investments in electric power, water supply and
highways; the remainder has gone into education, family planning? agricultural
credit and a sites and services project. The proposed loan would be the third for
highways investment. The first highways loan (loan 408-JM) of $5.5 million, also
for the construction of arterial roads, was made in 1965; this was followed by
a road improvement and maintenance loan (loan 899-JM)  of $9.3 million in 1973.
There have so far been only two IFC operations; a loan in 1961 to a pre-mix
concrete company, and an equity/loan investment in 1968 in a hotel project.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as
of May 31,1974 together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
As noted in the Annex, the Bank has experienced problems in the execution of
projects in Jamaica, although the situation has improved in recent months.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
10.       The case for continued Bank lending rests on the need to provide
some of Jamaica's external financing requirements and to support appropriate
policies in critical areas of the economy mentioned in Part I of this report.
As in the past, Bank lending will also be directed towards achieving improve-
ments in infrastructure, at contributing to the alleviation of the unemploy-
ment problem and to assisting in the wider distribution of the benefits of
growth. After a lull in Bank lending 1972/73 - due largely to institutional
constraints and slow project preparation - the pace of Bank operations is
expected to accelerate over the next two years. The Bank's share of ext.ernal
public debt is projected to increase from an estimated 15% in 1974 to about
20% in 1978 and its share of external public debt service to increase from
about 10% to 12% over the same period.
11.       In infrastructure, the Bank plans to continue to lend support to high
priorlty investments in the transportation sector which were identified by a
transportation survey financed by CIDA and carried out in 1968/70. The project
now before you constitutes the first phase of the government's 1974-79 arterial
road construction program and includes heavily used sections forming part of the
important east-west and north-south road systems; it is expected that the govern-
ment will seek further Bank assistance for the second phase of the program to
start in about two years time.   An airport development project has been
prepared, which will shortly be submitted to the Executive Directors for
consideration; lt would help relieve constraints upon the fure growth o.f
international air traffic and provide a more sound financial and ir titutional
base for managing Jamaica's two international airports.



12.       Other infrastructure investments being considered by the Bank
would have as a primary objective improving essential facilities for the
rapidly expanding Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), which itself ac-
counts for over one-quarter (about 550,000) of the total population of
Jamaica and a large proportion of its industry and commerce. A proposed
sewerage and water supply project would provide limited extension of
Kingston's sewerage system to meet its most urgent needs, and also
additional water so as to avoid shortages which would otherwise
develop over the next three to four years. The project would also
include engineering studies and preparatory work necessary for the
next major water supply project for Bank financing. More widely the
proposed infrastructural investments would help strengthen the in-
stitutions concerned.
13.       In the social areas, in addition to the re¢ent sites and
services project, we propose to continue our association with the edu-
cation sector with a third education project. However, the scope of
this project will not be defined until the conclusions of a recent
survey of the education sector, undertaken by AID with Bank partici-
pation, have been discussed with the government and more progress made
in implementing the ongoing second project. Further ahead, it is
expected that a second family planning project, which might include a
nutrition component, would be considered.
14.       In the directly productive sectors, the Bank is already involved
in agriculture through a loan to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for
on-lending for agricultural credits and a second loan has recently been
approved. At the request of the government, the Bank assisted in the
conduct of an agricultural sector survey with a view to revitalizing
this sector as a means of promoting exports, stimulating import sub-
stitution and helping to check the population drift from the rural
to the urban areas. We expect to be able to assist the government in
implementing the program of action which is emerging from this study,
and will be placing increasing emphasis on agriculture in our future
lending to Jamaica. Detailed feasibility studies are already under
way which should result in a project for Bank financing to rehabili-
tate the important sugar industry. Looking further ahead, it is
expected that the government would wish the Bank to assist in the
preparation and financing of a project designed to ameliorate the
situation of small farmers; the content and scope of such a project
have not yet been defined but may take the form of a rural develop-
ment project including components for improving land utilization and
crop production.

PRART !II - TM NSPORTATION IN JAMAICA
15.        Jamaicals transport system consists of about 9,500 miles of arterial,
seccndary main and parish roads, a government-owned railroad of about 180
miles, 30 miles of private railway, five airports, 13 seaports and some
Detroleum product pipelines. The basic system is generally adequate serving
most of the population centers and productive areas, although there is
considerable need for expansion in capacity and improvement in condition, In
rnparat`orj for major investments in the system, the government engaged
Insnltants during 1968/70, financed by the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), to carry out a national tranEport survey to recommend appro-
priate policies and measures for the most economical development of the
countryts transportation system through 1979. Feasibility studies have sub-
sequently been undertaken as a basis for further investments in road and air
tran,sportation facilities.
16,       The railway, run by the JaLmaica Railways Corporation (JRC),has in
recent years lost most of its general traffic to the roads and is now largely
a contract carrier for the bauxite mining ccmpanies. Contract rates cover
capital and operating costs, including overheads, of moving the mining
traffic, but JRC is operating ata small loss (J$500,000 per annum) largely
because it provides a subsidized passenger service to some of the poorer areas
where the road system is deficient. JRC is currently preparing a five-year
rehabilitation program and is negotiating technical assistance from CIDA,
Jamaica has two international airports located at Montego Bay on the north
coast, serving mainly the tourist industry, and Kingston on the south coast,
catering primarily to business and private travel by residents. Rapid growth
in air traffic, primarily as a result of increased tourism to the island, has
led to congestion in aircraft ground operations and in passenger processing
at both international airports. The proposed Bank project mentioned earlier
was prepared on the basis of consultants' studies and includes limited
physical improvements at the two international airports to relieve immediate
capacity constraints. Jamaica's main seaports at Kingston and Montasy
Bay are primarily general cargo ports EziCT=g the bulk of the countrygs
imports.  The remaining ports are specialized and handle most of the country 
exports. A major program is under way for the development of Kingston as a
transshipment port at an estimated cost of J$41.0 million.
17.       Most of Jamaica's national transport needs are met by roads and the
road network is relatively extensive for the size of the island totalling
9,500 miles, with about 7,000 suitable for vehicular traffic. Road traffic
has expanded rapidly in recent years growing at an average rate of about 8.5%
per annum for the network as a whole over the period 1964 to 1972, with growth
rates on individual roads varying between 4% and 13% per annum, Geometric
standards are modest by modern standards though adequate over much of the
network where the volume of traffic is relatively low. However, pavement
structures tend to be in need of resealing or strengthening and the ongoing



- 7 -
Bank-assisted road improvement and maintenance project (Loan 899-JM), which
is progressing satisfactorily, is helping to improve some 690 miles of these
roads. In addition, for a number of arterial roads carrying heavy traffic
volumes, the geometric standards and the poor state of the pavements have
resulted in dangerous conditions and congestion requiring early improvement.
Under the first Bank-assisted project (loan 408-JM) construction was under-
taken of the busy Kingston-Spanish Town road (15 miles of four-lane road)
and of the Moneague-Crescent Park road (four miles of two-lane road). After
considerable delays in project execution and substantial cost overruns the
project was completed in March 1973. This proposed third highway project would
include further heavily trafficked sections of arterial road which are in urgent
need of constructien/reconstruction.
18.       Total expenditure on roais rose from $10.3 million in 1965/66 to an
estimated $23.7 million in 1972/73 and expenditure on construction almost
tripled over the period 1965/66 to 1971/7?2. Revenues from road users, although
not specifically earmarked for road financ ng, have been consistently higher
than total road expenditures. The external lending agencies--the Bank, IDB,
CIDA and USAID-- are adopting a coordinated approach in assisting the govern-
ment to implement its road investment program. In addition to Bank assistance
for arterial roads construction and roads maintenance, assistance is also being
provided by CIDA for a bridge construction program and for feasibility studies,
by the IDB for the construction of secondary main and parish roads, and by
AID for construction of rural feeder roads. The planning, construction and
maintenance of arterial and secondary main roads is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Wdorks (MOW). MOW's organizational structure is considered satis-
factory, although a program to improve its internal systems and procedures is
under way financed partly by CIDA and partly by the Bank under Loan 899-JN.
19.       In recent years the government has relied upon the national
transport survey (paragraph 15 above) and feasibility studies prepared
by outside consultants for the preparation of its various transport in-
vestment programs. In an effort to start developing its own planning
capability the government has recently established within MOW a traffic
unit to collect, on a continuing basis, the data necessary for road
transport planning. However, the government lacks qualified personnel
for analyzing various modal investments in the transport sector and for
updating the findings of the national transport survey as conditions
change. The sizable investments planned in the transportation sector
(about $160 million over the next four to five years) justify the
creation of a modest transport planning capability to review, analyze
and coordinate modal investment programs. For this purpose the govern-
ment is in the process of establishing a transport committee responsible
for defining and reviewing transport policy and investment and has agreed



.:a: -rs co=ni-utee should be assisted by a small unit in the MOW com-
r:s:-n-- a- least one economist/engineer specializing in transport to
De recruited ov June 30, 1975.  Technical assistance, to be financed
-nder the Bank loan, would be provided for about a year to provide
initial help to the unit.
3L:2T IV - fLEL PFJI=4
20.       The project was developed following the recommendations of the CIDA-
financed Jamaica national transport survey conducted by the consult::ng firm
of Lamarre Valois International Ltd. (Canada) in 1968-70. Subsequently in
1971, the government commissioned the same consultants, also financed by CIDA
to carry out the recommendations relating to hiigh-priority roads including
feasibility studies and detailed engineering of 70 miles of arterial roads.
The government originally proposed that the project should comprise its whole
1971X-79 arterial road construction program covering about 38 miles of road.
Howover, the government subsequently decided that it would be inadvisable at
this time to commit itself to the full investment program totalling nearly
$h0 million; the scope of the project has thus been reduced and will now
comprise the first phase of the 1974-79 program covering about 20 miles of
arterial road and four miles of main access roads.
21.       Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in May
of this year. The government negotiating team was led by Mr. H. Barber,
Financial Secretary, Ministry of Finance.   A report entitled "Jamaica - Appraisal
of a Third Highway Project"(No.441-A-JM dated June 24.,1974), is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and the
project are summarized in Annex III to this report.
Project Description
22.       The project consists of:
(i)  construction, including supervision, of three new arterial
road sections (about 16 miles) between Spanish Town and
Mandeville with three major access roads, and an arterial
road section from Bog Walk to Linstead (about four miles)
with two major access roads;
(ii)  construction/improvement of secondary access roads to the
arterial road sections;
(iii)  procuren-6nt and installation of permanent vehicle weighing
stations and procurement of geotechnical equipment; and
(iv) technical assistance for transport planning, aid to the
local construction industry and a study of pavement design,
evaluation and performance.



- 9 -
Construction of Arterial Road Sections
23.       The roads selected for inclusion in the project have an average
daily traffic of 4,000-6,000 vehicles and on each section included in the
project traffic growth has been between 7% and 9% per annum during the past
ten years. The average speed is low (between 20 and 30 miles per hour) due
to the very poor design characteristics, damaged paving and numerous
crossings through the centers of small towns.
24.       The Spanish Town-Mandeville road links the four important towns of
Spanish Town (population 48,000) May Pen (population 32,000), Old Harbour
(population 7,000) and Mandeville (population 13,000). The total population
of the direct zone of influence has increased rapidly during recent years and
reached about 185,000 inhabitants in 1972. The region has excellent prospects
for economic development and government is promoting industrialization of the
region in order to slow down the] rapid growth of the Kingston area. Three
road sections would be constructed between Spanish Town and Mandeville, i.e.
May Pen Bypass I, May Pen Bypass II and Williamsfield-Greenvale, The proposed.
construction standards aim at providing two-lane arterial roads with additional
climbing lanes on appropriate gradients.   The works would include three major
access roads.
25.       The existing 4.5 mile road from Bog Walk to Linstead is part of the
arterial road from Spanish Town to the North Coast at Ocho Rios; it gives
access to Ewarton, the largest bauxite mining center of the island, and carries
an increasing amount of tourist traffic between Montego Bay and Kingston. It
is narrow and winding and passes through the villages of Bog Walk and Linstead.
The proposed construction standards of the new road, which would bypass these
villages, would be similar to those for the Spanish Town-Mandeville Road. The
works would include two major access roads.
Construction/Improvement of Secondary Access Roads
26.       Sections of a number of existing secondary access roads will need
to be improved or reconstructed, mainly at the junctions with the arterial
roads.
Permanent Vehicle Weighing Stations and Geotechnical Equipment
27.       In order to help prevent overloading of road pavements, the govern-
ment now issues special permits on a more restricted basis under the Road
Traffic Regulations for loads in excess of the normally permissible maximum
limits. Furthermore, to deal with the problem of unauthorized overloading of
trucks, and consequent damage to pavements, the government, assisted by the
consultants retained under the road improvement and maintenance project, is
carrying out an axle load survey; however, to put vehicle weight control on
a more established and effective basis, about five weighing stations would be
installed under the proposed project at key locations to be agreed with the
Bank. Geotechnical equipment is required for testing and research work in
connection with road construction and maintenance works.



Tech-niial Assistance
Technicai assistance would be included in the project for trans-
pcrt planning, for aid to the local construction industry and for pavement
design.
29.       About 25 man/months of consulting services are envisaged to help
19v0fl a gtransport planning capability in the Ministry of Works. This
zsistance woula help the proposed new transport planning unit in analyzing
and reviewing the sizable transport investment program forecast for the next
five years and in defining priorities; training of local counterpart personnel
would also be included (paragraph 19 above).
I0.       The iocal contracting industry is reilatively small-scale and is weak
in road construction work apar-; from the production and laying of asphaltic
concrete in which it has a number of experienced firms operating. The industry
should benefit from the government's prssent policy to phase out negotiate(d con-
tracts and return to competitive bidding and from the substantially expanded
road investment program now being undertaken by the government. To help the
industry develop and i*prove its capability the project includes technical assistance
by experts working with the contractors' associations and with individual firms
in the fields of work planning, site management, equipment usage, personnel
trainirg and costing and bid preparation.  About 25 man/months of assistance are
envisaged for this assistance for which UNDP finance is being sought.
31.       There is little information available in Jamaica on the long-term per-
formance of its road pavements under traffic; a modest amount of research work
is needed on this and the necessary technical assistance, which would be provided
by the U.K. Transport and Road Research Laboratory and for which U.K. finance is
being scught, has been included in the project.
Cost Estimates and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project (excluding land acquisition costs and
net of duties and taxes) is estimated at $23.6 million equivalent, including
contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of $13.7 million (about 58%).
The govornment is seeking financing from the UNDP and British Government amount-
ing to about US$0.1 million each to meet the foreign exchange costs of consultants
for assistance to the local contracting industry and for road research work.
Failing this, the government will finance the costs itself. To meot the re-
maining estimated foreign exchange costs of the project a Bank loan of $13.5
million is proposed with a term of 25 years including four years of grace.
Local costs would be met from government budgetary appropriations.
33.       Since the local contracting industry is expected to be fully occupied
with other road maintenance and construction works, the cost estimates assume
that the arterial road construction would be carried out by foreign contractors,
with the exception of earthworks and pavement base works on the Bog Walk-



Linstead section(4.5 miles) which would be carried out by force account (para-
graph 35 below). The relatively high construction cost involved is largely due
to the difficult terrain to be covered, price inflation and high labor costs in
Jamaica, the need for rail/road grade separations and the risk factor perceived
by contractors as the result of recent experience of labor unrest in Jamaica.
Project Execution and Procurement
34.       MOW would be responsible for executing the project and would be
assisted by a firm of consultants Which wszld supervise the civil
works jointly with MOW. The number and qualifications of MOW staff to be
provided for the supervisory team and the proposed terms of reference for
hiring the consultants have been agreed with the. Bank.
35.        Contracts for civil works (excluding earthworks and pavement for the
Bog Walk-Linstead section and its two main access roads, but including all
asphaltic surfacing) and for the supply and installation of weighbridges would
be procured by international comp3titive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines.   Construction of the junctions between the secondary access roads
and the arterial roads would be included in the civil works contracts; other
minor improvements to the secondary access roads would be undertaken by MOW
and financed from budgetary funds. A small amount of specialized geotechnical
equipment, estimated to cost no more than $50,000 in the aggregate, will be
procured by direct negotiation. At the request of MDW, earthworks and pavement
base for the Bog Walk-Linstead section and its two main access roads, constituting
about 14% of the estimated civil works cost, would be carried out by force account;
this would help strengthen MOW's existing force account capability which is main-
tained, inter alia, to deal with emergency situations (e.g. hurricane damage),
enable MOW to determine more accurately the costs of performing various constiruction
operations and thereby provide MOW with a sounder base for reviewing unit prices
for contract work. The MOW has the necessary capability to execute this small
amount of force account work which would be supervised on the same basis as the
remainder of the civil works.
Disbursements
36.       Disbursements from the loan, representing the estimated foreign ex-
change costs of the project, would be over a three and a half year period and
would be made on the following basis: 60% of expenditures on civil works con-
tracted out; 50% of certified costs for civil works undertaken by force account;
and 100% of the foreign expenditures on weighbridges, geotechnical equipment and
on consulting services.  Costing procedures satisfactory to the Bank will oe
developed with the assistance of consultants retained under the road improvement
and maintenance project to identify the costs incurred by force account construction.
Project Justification and Economic Evaluation
37.       The proposed project would construct/reconstruct arterial road sections
on heavily trafficked routes (4,ooo-6,ooo vehicles per day) forming part of Jamaica's
main east-west and north-south road links. The geometric characteristics of the
existing road sections are poor leading to dangerous and congested conditions and
are in urgent need of improvement.

38.       The new road alignments with a design speed of 50-60 m.p.h. would
substantially reduce vehicle operating costs and for the purposes of the
economiic evaluation, benefits have been limited to such savings. On this
basis the economic return on the proposed irnvestment in each of the arterial
road sections would be 24% for the May Pen Bypasses, 17% for Williamsfield-
Greenvale, and 17% for Bog Walk-Linstead. Tte overall return is estimated
at about 20%. With a 15% cost increase the overall rate of return would be
about 17%. In addition to the economic benefits from vehicle operating
cost savings (which will initially accrue to vehicle operators but in part
will be passed on to shippers and the genera:L public) the project would also
result in important social benefits from a reduction in noise pollution, con-
gestion and accidents in the towns and villages which traffic will bypass on
the new road alignments.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

7rrciects in Execution!
Ln No. 727 Second Education ProJect; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971
Closing Date:  December 31, 159L
Managerial weaknesses in both the Education Ministry and the
project unit have caused delays in the implementation of the project; imple-
mentation is about two years behind appraisal schedule. It is now expected
that all the project items will be completed by December 1976. A postpone-
ment of the closing date by a year and a half is likely to be required.
. ;t  si mentation, devaluation of the Jamaican dollar and
international inflation a cost overrun of about 25% is likely. During the
latest supervision mission, in March 1974, some improvement was noted in the
performance and staffing of the project unit. The vacant post of architect
will be filled shortly. Howev6r, there is no candidate to replace the project
director, whose contract expires in July.
Ln No. 719 Agricultural Credit Project; US$3.7 million of December 28, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
After a slow start the project picked up momentum during the last
year and the Bank loan is now about fully committed. Disbursementtshave not
improved equally but the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) has taken steps to
streamline and simplify procedures which have mainly accounted for the delays.
The Bank has recently agreed to a second reallocation of the loan proceeds to
increase credit availability for beef and (dairy production.
Ln No. 690 Population Project; US$2.0 million of June 18, 1970
Closing Date: March 31, 1974
There have been delays in the design/construction programs for
the Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH) and ten rural maternity centers (RMCs),
due primarily to problems of coordination, and weaknesses in the management
of the family planning program. However, more recently improved progress
has been made in implementing some of the principal aspects of the program.
Construction of all ten RMCs has been physically completed, 5 are already
operating and the remaining five will open within the next 3 months. Con-
struction has started on the VJH expansion; during a Bank supervision mis-
sion in April, the Ministry of Works agreed to undertake stricter supervision
of the contractor and to provide site security, in response to earlier problems
that were causing construction delays. Progress has been slow in implementing
the training and home encouragement aspects of the family planning program,
but intensified efforts are being made in these areas through the use of com-
munity health aides. The family planning services have been integrated into
the Ministry of Health and the Bank is providing technical assistance for
redesigning the program.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken -to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln No. 598 Kingston Water Supply Project; uS$5.0 million of May 14, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 19 4
After initial delays over the acquisition of land rights and in
the award of contracts,implementation of the physical aspects of the project
has improved and the works are now partially in operation. Full service should
be in operation by July 1974 although optimum pressure wrill not be available
until after delivery of certain booster pumping equipment in about 6 months'
time. The loan closing date, originally June 30, 1972, has been postponed to
December 31, 1973 and again to December 31, 1974. However, the financial posi-
tion of the Water Commission remains weak and the annual rates of return over
ahe last three fiscal years were significantly below the 8% required in the
Loan Agreement. Substantial increases in water rates were introduced in June
1973, but since then increased operating costs, largely due to higher wages, have
again eroded the Commission's financial position. However, consideration is
being given to measures to reduce the institution's operating costs and to
ensure the maintenance of adequate revenues from water tariffs. Measures to
remedy staffing and management weaknesses are currently under discussion
between the Bank and the Borrower.
Ln No. 899 Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million
of June 1., 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan became effective August 31, 1973 and is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants to carry out the technical assistance component
of the project started their assignment in October 1973 and government has
appointed all counterparts. Contractors for the first phase of ths resealing
workh have been engaged and works will start in June. A number of roads to be
resealed under the project were damaged by floods in late 1973. In order to
get them back into operation as quickly as possible and prevent further
deterioration, the Bank agreed that about 40 miles of the total 250 miles to
be resealed under the project should be repaired by force account rather than
by contractors; this work is under way. Invitations to bid for equipment have
been issued and preparation is under way for the asphaltic conrete overlay.
