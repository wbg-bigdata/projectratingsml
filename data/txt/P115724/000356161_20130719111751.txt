1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. At project appraisal, Indonesia was in transition from an autocratic,
centralized state to a democratic, decentralized one. There had been a move toward public sector
and fiscal decentralization since 1999. Economic growth was below 4 percent, poverty reduction
remained a challenge, and governance concerns continued to cloud political achievements.
Indonesia continued to trail its neighbors in access to quality health, education, and other basic
services. Weak governance institutions, poor infrastructure, and shortages of high-level human
capital were keeping investors away and undermining service provision.

2.      The Government of Indonesia (GoI) had prepared a comprehensive package of reforms
covering macroeconomic management, financial sector reform, and policies to help raise
investment and reduce poverty. As part of that effort, government agencies developed their own
medium-term strategic plan called RENSTRA (Rencana Strategis). At that time, the Ministry of
National Education (MoNE - now Ministry of Education and Culture or MoEC) and the Ministry
of Religious Affairs (MoRA) produced a five-year medium-term strategic plan for education, or
RENSTRA, that focused mainly on three basic education priorities: (i) universal access to good
quality basic education; (ii) improvement in basic education quality; and (iii) more effective
basic education sector governance in the context of an overarching decentralization reform.

3.      Sector Context. The core of GoI’s strategy for quality basic education was derived from
its medium-term development plan, aiming at decentralizing education system governance and
management, and improving access and quality. GoI’s strategic medium term goals for the
mandatory nine year basic education sub-sector included: (i) increased financing for operational
budgets; (ii) expanded access to early childhood education, schools for children with disabilities
and inclusive schools, and basic education through non-formal education; (iii) special ‘one roof’
schools to provide basic education service in remote areas and sparsely populated islands; (iv)
recruitment of educators and education manpower; and (v) improved internal audit function,
planning, budgeting and education management.

4.      GoI was also committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
the Education for All (EFA) targets, and this commitment was embedded in the MoEC and
MoRA’s 2005-2009 RENSTRA. The RENSTRA priorities were to support: (i) universal access
by reducing school attendance costs to students’ families through the implementation of the
government’s free basic education policy and other related strategies; (ii) basic education quality
improvements through better facilities and teachers, the implementation of Minimum Service
Standards, the rehabilitation and reconstruction of basic education schools and the
implementation of a Teacher Reform Law to regulate teacher certification and corresponding
salary increase; and (iii) enhanced governance by strengthening the capacity of districts to use
their resources more effectively and efficiently given their new responsibility and power to
deliver quality education services, and supporting good planning, budgeting, procurement,
financial management and accountability practices to minimize leakages due to misuse of funds.

5.      At the time of project preparation, the GoI had expressed interest in a sector-wide
approach (SWAp) to education sector investment – one that would enhance the ability of GoI to
efficiently coordinate and maximize the overall effectiveness of donor assistance in achieving
Indonesia’s high priority objectives for the education sector. Previous donor assistance had been
fragmented, and piecemeal interventions had not been highly effective in producing large, visible
impacts on Indonesia’s education sector. Moreover, there was keen interest in finding new ways
of providing international assistance that would support the achievement of sector objectives
more effectively and comprehensively, disburse faster and meet fiduciary requirements.
Although country systems at the time were not sufficiently strong for a sector wide program, the
Netherlands, the European Commission (EC) and the World Bank responded by establishing the
Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund (BEC-TF) in support of the GoI’s education reform agenda
while preparing the ground for a sector-wide investment program in the future. Additional grant
funds were also made available by the Dutch Education Support Program (DESP) to fund
discrete activities.

6.      Project Context. BEC-TF’s five-year financial commitment from the Dutch and the EC
amounted to €39 million, which were divided into two parts: €25.60 million was Government-
executed and €13.40 million was administered by the Bank. The BEC-TF was also designed to
support the 2005-2009 RENSTRA and complement other bilateral and multilateral basic
education support programs. Furthermore, these financial commitments were supposed to help
the government develop its own sector wide program (the “Education System Improvement
through Sector Wide Approaches – SISWA?), under preparation at that time. Although GoI
never finalized the program and eventually abandoned the effort, this did not affect the BEC-TF
project design, which continued with its original focus on improving good governance, financial
management, budgeting and accountability within 50 districts. The BEC-TF project was also
designed to provide substantial technical assistance (TA) and respond to government requests for
rapid analyses to support GoI’s national School Operational Assistance Program (Bantuan
Operasional Sekolah - BOS). The BOS was established in 2005 to provide basic education
schools with block grants, which at the time covered 228,000 schools and an estimated 43
million students 1. The BEC-TF was also in line with the 2004 – 2007 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) themes of improving the investment climate and making service delivery
responsive to the poor: the BEC-TF supported capacity development at the local level in the
areas of finance and management, and improved governance so that local government could
provide improved service delivery and be responsive to the needs of the poor, particularly in the
education sector. Because of the integrated nature of the trust fund activities and to provide a
holistic picture of the project, the ICR team has chosen to report on the totality of both Bank- and
recipient-executed portions. Annex 1 “Project Costs and Financing? focuses solely on the
recipient-executed portion of the overall trust fund, while Annex 2 differentiates activities by
executing agency.




1
 The BOS program is regarded as a key pillar of the Government’s Basic Education Policy as it provides funding for school
operations and was thus expected to reduce school fees in general while reducing all school fees for the poor.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The overall project development objective of the program was to contribute to the GoI's
achievement of MDG and EFA goals through good governance in education. The purpose of the
program was to support GoI in improving the delivery of decentralized basic education services
by local governments and schools in selected program areas, and by extension in other
locations 2. Given the slight variations of PDO wording in various project documents 3, the ICR
will use as the project development objective “to contribute to the GoI's achievement of MDG
and EFA goals through good governance in education? which is found in the grant appraisal
document.

8.      Progress towards achieving the PDOs was measured using indicators reflecting the
national level goals of achieving the MDG and EFA. These were: (i) increased primary net
enrollment rate (disaggregated by gender and income quintile); (ii) increased primary gross
enrollment rate; (iii) increased junior secondary net enrollment rate; (iv) increased primary
completion rates; (v) increased junior secondary completion rates; and (vi) increased transition
rates from primary to junior secondary school.

9.       The intermediate indicators measured progress achieved within the 50 targeted districts.
These were: (i) number of education policy analyses and studies undertaken; (ii) number of
districts with at least 60 percent of schools providing BOS education budget information through
school announcement boards; (iii) number of districts provide education budget through local
mass media, official announcement boards or on a website; (iv) number of districts whose
education unit has a unit budget document with measureable outcomes related to its strategy; (v)
number of districts with a difference between planned and realized plans (disbursement rates) of
less than 10 percent in the last three fiscal years; (vi) number of districts where all of the awards
for education bids are published in the local newspapers, on official boards or a website; (vii)
number of districts where fixed assets are inventoried on an annual basis; (viii) number of
districts where internal audit results are filed and action taken to follow up as per
recommendations; (ix) number of districts where the Bupati/Walikota’s accountability report
(including Dinas Pendidikan) is made available to the public 4; (x) number of districts where
enrollment by gender is published annually and is easily accessed through local mass media,
official announcement boards, or a website; and (xi) number of districts where student
achievements reports are published annually and easily accessed through local mass media,
official announcement boards or a website.

  The trust fund agreements with both the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the European Commission (EC) states the objectives
as “to support the GoI’s achievement of MDG and EFA goals through better governance in education.? The Grant Agreement
between the Bank and the Government of Indonesia states the objective to be “to contribute to the achievement by the recipient
of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Education for All (EFA) goals through good governance in Indonesia.? In all
ISRs the objective is stated as: “To support the GoI achievement of MDG and EFA goals through good governance in education,
improving the delivery of decentralized basic education services by local governments and schools in selected program area, and
by extension in other locations.?

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.    The PDO and the key indicators were not revised during the project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The main project beneficiaries were: (i) national level education policy makers taking
part in the Thematic Education Dialogue (TED); (ii) provincial and district education offices in
the 50 districts supported by the project; (iii) school principals, school supervisors, and school
committee and community members who would benefit from the school-based management
support in selected schools in the 50 districts; and (iv) teachers and other educators who would
benefit from the new learning and knowledge-sharing systems.

1.5 Original Components

12.      Component 1: Policy Analysis and Dialogue included the following sub-components:
Sub-component 1.1: Thematic Education Dialogue (TED), which included a forum for key
stakeholders to have a dialogue on education sector issues. The objectives of the TED were: (i)
to provide strategic and policy recommendations on education sector reforms and development;
(ii) to coordinate cooperation among government institutions, and between GoI and international
development partners; (iii) to support preparation for a sector-wide approach and for external
financing to be delivered through the GoI system; and (iv) to review and evaluate progress on
implementation of policies and sector performance; and Sub-component 1.2: Analytical Studies,
which included research to support an overall education sector assessment and analysis to
support movement toward a sector-wide approach (SWAp).

13.    Component 2: Good Governance, Financial Management, Budgeting and
Accountability, which focused on strengthening education sector governance and management
capacity, particularly at district levels, and to use resources more effectively, efficiently and
equitably. It included the following sub-components: Sub-component 2.1: Good Governance &
Financial Management, focusing on financial management and good governance activities to be
developed for district level capacity development; Sub-component 2.2: Planning and Budgeting,
which focused on the use of performance-based budgeting and the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework, and to provide capacity development support for results-based planning, budgeting
and simplified reporting; and Sub-component 2.3: School Management, which would develop
capacity in the focus areas of the project, including financial management, good governance,
budgeting and planning, and information management.

14.     Component 3: Information Management: This component responded to the need to
strengthen systems of information and to develop capacity of key stakeholders to allow for
informed decisions on education policy and allocation of resources. The sub-components were:
Sub-component 3.1: Management Information Systems and Information-based Decision Making,
focusing not only on implementation of Management Information Systems, but also on
developing the capacity to properly manage the data, analyze it and make informed decisions
based on the results; and sub-component 3.2: Learning and Knowledge, which was to facilitate

                                                4
knowledge sharing and learning about good practices and making these accessible to all districts
and schools.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised during the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     On February 22, 2008, the Administrative Agreements between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, the EC and the Bank were amended following GoI’s decision to abandon the
development of the SISWA and to clarify some funding modalities. The amendment entailed: (i)
modifying the administrative agreement wording to refer specifically to the 50 districts supported
by the project to improve governance, financial management budgeting and accountability at the
local level; (ii) align the Description of Operations to focus specifically on strengthening
education governance just in the 50 districts as well as clarify the funding modalities to be used
for the local government BEC grants (L-BEC grants); and (iii) reallocating funds in line with the
project’s focus on the 50 districts.

16.     On October 21, 2011, the project went through a level two restructuring of the BEC-TF
Grant Agreement. The restructuring covered the following: (i) a €8.7 million reduction of project
funds following the Dutch government’s decision to reduce their development assistance to
Indonesia; (ii) the cancellation of pilot activities initially covered by the project but subsequently
financed by other sources of funds; (iii) the reallocation of grant proceeds due to exchange rate
fluctuations, and (iv) the extension of the project closing date from April 30, 2012 to December
31, 2012. The extension was made to enable districts to complete planned 2012 capacity
development plans (CDPs) contributing to the project’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
within a more realistic timeframe and make up for initial implementation delays. There were no
revisions to the PDOs or outcome indicators due to the fact that the Government of the
Netherlands and the EC required EFA PDO level indicators to be included in the results
framework.

17.     As part the BEC-TF restructuring, the two administrative agreements with the donors had
to be amended as well. The agreement between the Netherlands and the Bank was modified to
reflect: (i) the reduction in the grant as stated above; (ii) the extension of the closing date to
December 31, 2012; and (iii) the extension of the trust fund end disbursement date to June 30,
2013. The agreement between the EC and the Bank was modified to reflect the extension of the
closing date to December 31, 2012.

18.     In October 2012, the GoI requested the cancellation and transfer of €1.1 million from
their unallocated disbursement category back to the parent trust fund following lower-than-
anticipated disbursements caused by delays in hiring and contracting service providers. In
addition, approximately US$3.2 million remained undisbursed as of May 30, 2013, which was in
part due to the Euro exchange rate gains over the life of the project. Nevertheless, all project
related activities were completed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.    Project Preparation. The project fit squarely within the goals of the FY04-07 CAS goals
of improving the investment climate and making the service delivery system responsive to the
needs of the poor. BEC-TF focused on the themes of building capacity at the local government
level in the areas of finance and management and improved governance so that the local
governments could provide improved service delivery in the education sector.

20.      The Bank preparation team worked effectively with MoEC (then MoNE) and MoRA in the
development of the project. Extensive time was devoted to tailoring project activities around the
RENSTRA 5-year strategic plan with a strong focus on capacity building at the local district and
school levels, priorities of both MoEC and MoRA. The Bank team also worked with the GoI
preparation team in the development of the LGCA (Local Governance Capacity Assessment),
which was to identify the capacity development needs at the district level to be addressed by the
project. This task was an important aspect of design: it would allow districts to develop a
framework for the drafting of their Capacity Development Plans (CDPs) and include tailor-made
activities to address the capacity gaps identified in the LGCA baseline report. This was a key
departure from the top-down approach used in Indonesia prior to the BEC-TF and reflective of the
overall project design that supported a bottom-up approach to improving education at the local
level.

21.      Project Design. Since the project was to improve local capacity to deliver education
services, the Bank team appropriately considered lessons from earlier Bank-supported capacity
development programs such as: (i) districts were capable of building capacity given adequate
resources and authority to identify needs and carry out programs, and (ii) training of new staff as
well as maintaining staff are essential for successful implementation of a project. The design of
the components was appropriate to support the government’s decentralization plan and to
strengthen district capacity. Component 1 included support for studies on education policy issues
such as education financing (including analyses on adequate funding levels to schools), early
childhood education (ECD), which led to new guidelines for the ECD sector, and comprehensive
skills upgrading for education administrators that fed into national education plans. It also
included national and international study visits to learn lessons from other governments in
strategic areas to help increase the relevance and quality of the education system. Components 2
and 3 supported and fostered the government’s push for a decentralized education system with
increased focus on governance, financial management, and education service delivery at the
district level. The project design also supported the MoEC-managed block-grant mechanism at
the provincial level and the devolution of the grants to districts. The PDO was appropriate in that
it supported the government’s education strategy to achieve the MDGs and EFA, and the PDO
level indicators were appropriate to measure the national MDG goals. While the Bank team
recognized the difference between sector-wide PDO level indicators and the more circumscribed
nature of project activities in 50 districts, as mentioned previously, the PDO and PDO indicators
were included at the specific request of the Dutch and EC to link project contributions explicitly
to the larger EFA-MDG goals for Indonesia. Intermediate indicators measured progress of
project activities in the 50 districts.


                                                6
22.     Quality at Entry. Although no Quality at Entry Review was conducted, project
preparation did follow the Bank’s comprehensive quality assurance and review process, and led
to the government meeting all project readiness conditions by the effectiveness deadline. The
readiness conditions included: (i) establishing the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and the
Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) inside the MoEC, (ii) completing an Operations
Manual acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) developing the MoEC L-BEC Grant Manual that
specified grant selection, documentation and distribution criteria. As mentioned previously, the
Bank team worked closely with the CPIU in developing the terms of reference for the LGCA to
help assess the needs for each district and establish project baselines. This was an important
project preparation strength which, together with the readiness conditions in place, led to the
successful implementation of the BEC-TF project.

23.     Based on the analysis above, overall project preparation, design and quality at entry is
rated moderately unsatisfactory primarily due to the difference between national-level PDO
indicators and the localized nature of project interventions. That said, the project fit within the
goals of the CAS, focused on the themes of building capacity at the local government level and
was in line with the RENSTRA. Furthermore, project components were designed to support the
government’s decentralization plan and strengthen district capacity, as well as help MoEC
manage its block-grant mechanism at the provincial level. Although the PDO and PDO-level
indicators were sector-wide in nature, the intermediate indicators were appropriate to measure
progress in the 50 target districts. Lastly, preparatory work done to establish the LGCA was
instrumental for the project’s readiness and subsequent implementation.

2.2 Implementation

24.      Project implementation began with effectiveness in June 2008. The Bank and government
provided technical assistance to equip districts with the skills necessary to develop their CDPs
which, once approved, became the cornerstones of the project (L-BEC grants could only be
disbursed against activities outlined in the approved CDPs). Although district CDPs had been
developed, L-BEC disbursements were delayed by 18 months because the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) had not yet developed the Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) for the newly-
introduced on-granting mechanism 5. The absence of guidelines regarding the new mechanism
and clear roles and responsibilities of actors at all levels also created confusion, especially at the
district level. As a result, overall project disbursements stood at only approximately 10 percent
by June 2009 and it was during this period that the overall project was downgraded to
moderately unsatisfactory.

25.      Recognizing the negative effect these delays had on project implementation, the CPIU,
Bank and PSC proactively adjusted the sequencing of activities and rolling out activities not
affected by the new on-granting mechanisms instead. For instance, much of the training for
districts was originally planned to take place later in the project but was carried out during the

5
  After project effectiveness, MoF introduced a policy regulating regional grant channeling, which affected the way L-BEC funds
were to be transferred. Districts were now required to follow the newly established “on-granting mechanisms? rather than
receiving funds directly from MoEC. However, guidelines to support the roll out of the new policy were delayed, which slowed
down overall project implementation and CDP implementation in particular.


                                                              7
first two years of project implementation with MoEC funding. These targeted training and
socialization sessions focused on the five strategic pillars 6 of education governance and
management, and were crucial for maintaining project implementation momentum. Initial delays
in providing technical assistance to districts on the CDP process were also overcome by the
CPIU cancelling the complex procurement process to contract firms and hiring four individual
consultants instead. CDP process assistance together with the other training and socialization
activities were completed by the time the new MoF on-granting mechanism procedures were
fully articulated and L-BEC grants started to flow. This further helped improve overall project
performance.

26.     Although there were challenges related to the L-BEC on-granting mechanism, the policy
analysis and dialogue aspects financed largely by the Bank-executed portion under Component 1
continued to be implemented. These included workshops and study visits to expose key
education stakeholders to international experience on governance, financial management, and
efficient resource use, as well as analytical studies to support the GoI’s basic education
decentralization policy. In addition, the TED, which was the forum for high level discussions on
education thematic dialogue under component 1, enabled senior government officials and
development partners to meet and discuss key education issues, and provide strategic
recommendations on education reform, resourcing and planning.

27.      Prior to the October 2011 project restructuring, the PSC met to discuss overall
implementation challenges, the €8.7 million funding reduction by the Dutch government and a
possible extension of the closing date to allow districts to complete their CDP activities that had
been affected by delayed L-BEC disbursements. The MoEC was initially reluctant to extend the
project but eventually agreed in light of the unanimous requests from the districts. It was also
agreed by all interested parties not to modify the PDO or results framework because of the time
needed to make the modifications and get the required approval. In the end, an agreement was
reached between the GoI, donors and the Bank to: (i) extend the project closing date; (ii) return
funds to the Dutch government; and (iii) reallocate the remaining resources to ensure that project
activities could be fully implemented. By project closing, approximately 15 percent of project
funds remained undisbursed yet all project activities had been completed, which is explained by
significant Euro exchange rate gains.

28.     Based on the analysis above, the project implementation is rated moderately
satisfactory. This is mainly due to the substantial progress made once the L-BEC grants were
disbursed under component 2 and 3, and the number of analytical studies, policy briefs and
technical support provided throughout the entire project under component 1. Moreover, the Bank
and MoEC were proactive in finding a resolution to the flow of funds and other implementation
issues as described above.




6
  The five strategic pillars are: (i) Education Service Provision Standards, (ii) Efficient Resource Use, (iii)
Transparency and Accountability, (iv) Management Control Systems, and (v) Management Information Systems.


                                                      8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.     M&E Design and implementation. M&E for the project had several layers. The project
results framework was closely aligned with the donor and government’s desire to monitor
progress towards achieving the MDG and EFA goals as well as the project goals at the
intermediate level. The intermediate indicators were also aligned with the government’s
RENSTRA and were appropriate for the project. The data used to monitor progress toward
achieving the PDO level indicators were based on established data sources such as the
SUSENAS 7 and the “Education Statistics in Brief? published by MoEC. The project also funded
the development of a number of M&E information systems which included: (i) a “Tool for
Reporting and Information Management by Schools (TRIMS)?, which was to provide a
systematic approach to gathering and reporting data at the school level; (ii) a complaint handling
mechanism at the school and district level, which was supported jointly with DESP; and (iii) the
SupportMySchool (SuMS) program that was to deploy an online reporting system for the public
and schools to report critical needs.

30.     Project support for the LGCA survey 8 was also beneficial in a number of ways as it: (i)
helped districts assess their capacity development needs; (ii) provided a supplementary and
robust source of data which could be used to check data gathered by the districts and reported to
the CPIU and the Bank; and (iii) provided the Bank and government with a data set to
systematically compare changes in local education governance within the 50 BEC-TF districts
between 2009 and 2012. The inclusion of this capacity assessment instrument is judged to be of
singular importance for the project and a positive M&E design element.

31.     At the time of project design, it was agreed that the July round of SUSENAS data would
be used for measuring the PDO level indicators of gross enrollment rates at the primary level and
net enrollment rates at both primary and junior secondary levels. However, in mid-2012, the
Bank team discovered that the March round of SUSENAS data was the most reliable data source
for measuring net and gross enrollment rates over time. Therefore, the baseline values for
indicators 1, 2 and 3 reported in the ICR come from the March round of SUSENAS. Moreover,
the associated end-of-project targets were re-calculated by applying the same calculation method
used by the project preparation team to derive the end of project targets using the July round of
SUSENAS. This was done to ensure that the results were comparable over time. The targets for
the remaining PDO indicators 4, 5, and 6 were not modified since these were sourced from
MoEC’s Education Statistics in Brief 2008-2011. The intermediate indicators were not affected
because these were not sourced from the SUSENAS data.



7
  SUSENAS is the National Socioeconomic Survey conducted on March and July of every year by the government
of Indonesia.
8
  Through the BEC-TF, the Local Governance Capacity Assessment and an Indonesia Local Education Governance
Index (ILGI) were designed to provide a coherent national capacity development assessment system of performance
in education governance and service provision in the decentralized environment. The customized diagnostic tool
looked at the five strategic pillars of the BEC-TF: (i) Management Control Systems, (ii) Management Information
Systems, (iii) Education Service Provision Standards, (iv) Transparency and Accountability, and (v) Efficient
Resource Use.


                                                      9
32.      M&E Utilization. Results framework data was gathered and reported on after
supervision missions by the Bank in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). The data was
also used to inform discussions at the TED level. The TRIMS was introduced to all schools in
2011 as part of the Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) reforms and 4,993
schools are reporting data. The complaint handling system and associated socialization was
rolled out to 497 districts and 33 provinces by 2012. Since the launch of the SuMS in December
2012, there have been over 4,000 users, and MoEC is slowly adopting the system to address the
critical needs of schools. There were annual supervision missions by the Bank and CPIU, and
results were reported in aides-memoire. In addition, the findings of several policy studies
supported under Component 1 9 were used by the government to support education reforms. The
CPIU monitoring and evaluation of the L-BEC grant program implementation at the district level
occurred up to three times each year and included representatives from MoEC, MoRA and MoF.
The reviews highlighted successes, ongoing challenges and constraints for districts but also
enable GoI and Bank teams to provide ongoing monitoring support to districts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.    Safeguards: Compliance with environmental safeguards is rated satisfactory. BEC-TF
was rated a category “C? project based on the fact that no safeguards policies were triggered.

34.    Fiduciary Compliance: In October 2009, a financial management (FM) risk assessment
was carried out, which found weaknesses in the filing system for supporting. Following the
assessment, an FM action plan deemed adequate to bringing the project into compliance with
Bank requirements was developed and discussed with MoEC. The steps laid out in the action
plan were also meant to complement the FM section included in the operations manual.

35.     Financial management is rated moderately satisfactory. Financial management
implementation was carefully monitored by Bank financial management and procurement staff
who accompanied all six supervision missions. By March 2011, the FM ratings moved to
moderately unsatisfactory as the Bank team identified cases of questionable expenditures related
to reimbursed costs for a series of workshops. These cases were reported to the Institutional
Integrity Unit (INT) and the MoEC which, through its Inspectorate General (IG), conducted an
internal audit and determined that there was no evidence of loss to the state. INT also reported to
the task team that they were satisfied with how the issue had been handled by the MoEC IG and
closed the case. At that time, FM was upgraded to moderately satisfactory. The Bank also moved
proactively to hire a Bank-supported financial management specialist to work with MoEC to
strengthen their financial management oversight and procedures. Furthermore, the GoI Financial
and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) conducted audits at the national and district levels,
which were unqualified and presented on time.



9
 For example, (i) The Comprehensive Program for Skills Upgrading contributed to GoI’s ‘Skills for the Master Plan’; (ii) an
Education Public Expenditure Review highlighted the importance of efficiency in teacher management and improving the quality
of teachers; and (iii) rapid response outputs on Formula-based BOSDA and District Performance Based Grants as well as on
School Based Management were prepared based on inputs from the project.




                                                            10
36.     Procurement is rated moderately satisfactory. Procurement was limited to: (i)
consultants (service providers and individual consultants); (ii) goods (mostly computers and data
processing equipment); (iii) workshops, meetings, training and study tours; and (iv) incremental
operating costs. Procurement carried out by the CPIU and the districts was based on guidelines
laid out in the BEC-TF Operations and L-BEC Manuals.

37.     During implementation, procurement was rated moderately unsatisfactory twice. The first
moderately unsatisfactory rating was due to the 18 month delay in developing the on-granting
mechanism and the procurement of computers by the CPIU at the central level. Once the L-BEC
grants started flowing, however, these delay issues were resolved as districts used L-BEC grants
to procure goods at the local level, leading to a moderately satisfactory rating. The second
moderately unsatisfactory rating was due to the cumbersome MoEC procurement guidelines that
were to be used and which delayed the hiring of the three firms to provide the advisory and
training services for districts on the CDP process. The delays resulted in the cancellation of these
procurement activities and led the CPIU to hire four individual capacity development and
financial management consultants who successfully carry out the advisory and training tasks. As
a result, procurement improved and the rating for procurement moved to moderately satisfactory
by the end of the project. Furthermore, a 2011 Bank Trust Fund Portfolio Review found that
procurement was carried out in compliance with the applicable guidelines and procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     There are no plans for a future Bank-supported basic education project. The GoI’s
commitment to using 20 percent of its budget for education shows the government’s ability to
support the primary and junior secondary education sub-sectors from its own resources.
Moreover, 40 out of the 50 districts supported by the BEC-TF had developed post-project
sustainability plans focused on improving the delivery of decentralized basic education services
and improving student learning outcomes. The majority of districts have allocated funds in their
budgets to continue and strengthen the following interventions/activities: (i) the EMIS, including
the BEC-TF supported TRIMS; (ii) education service provision standards, including teacher
upgrading and competency-based curriculum development; (iii) financial management systems,
including performance-based budgeting and planning, asset management, efficient resource use
and procurement policies, procedures and controls; (iv) school-based management training,
including school committee development and community involvement programs; and (v) reform
to district education policies and regulations, including strengthening the BOSDA improvement
program 10 and creating incentive schemes to encourage the deployment of qualified teachers to
underserved provinces/districts in Indonesia. The government also indicated its intention to
include lessons learned on transparency, financial management, and budget planning from
successfully implemented BEC-TF activities in the BOS operations manual. This is important


10
   The BOSDA Improvement Program was initially piloted in 2 provinces and 18 districts. The main objective of the pilot was to
support regional governments in their efforts to narrow financing inequalities and improve both the efficiency and effectiveness
of education spending. The pilot focused on BOSDA allocations and aimed to: (i) improve current BOSDA allocation criteria to
address financing inequalities between schools; and (ii) create incentives for better school performance and encourage more
effective, transparent, and participatory school-based management involving all education stakeholders.




                                                              11
because the BOS manual is still being used nationwide for the implementation of the BOS
program and expected to remain in place.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39.      Relevance of Objectives and Design. The project objectives and design were highly
relevant. The PDO and the project components were in full alignment with the 2003 CAS
framework of contributing to improving governance at the primary and junior secondary
education levels. Support to innovations in governance and public financing in the 50 project
districts were expected to provide a model for the remaining districts as Indonesia looked to
continue its efforts to improve the efficiency of decentralized and democratized service
provision. The project was also seen by the GoI as central in taking forward the reforms
embedded in their RENSTRA which focused, among other aims, on improving basic education
sector governance and increasing the financial and budgetary capacity at the recently
decentralized district and school levels.

40.     At project closing, the project continued to fit squarely within the pro-jobs engagement
area of the current FY13–15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which: (i) supports the
strengthening of the overall governance and management of the education system to improve
education quality and teacher performance; and (ii) enhance human resource capacity of recent
graduates, which are expected to improve economic development results. The government
continues to support the education sector RENSTRA as the fundamental goal for ensuring higher
quality of management of the primary and junior secondary education.

41.     Relevance of implementation. The relevance of implementation is rated substantial.
While the 18 month delay in releasing the L-BEC grants had an impact on implementation, there
were several positive aspects of project implementation which must be noted: (i) the successful
implementation of district level training to increase good governance, financial management,
budgeting and accountability capacity at the local level; (ii) the completion of an impressive
number of studies, which supported the TED policy discussions; (iii) the execution of local and
international workshops and study visits aimed at equipping education stakeholders with the
skills sets required to effectively govern and manage the decentralized education system; (iv) the
carrying out Education Sector Assessments (ESAs), which informed the RENSTRA; (v) the
support for the development and implementation of district level CDPs in the strategic areas of
good governance, financial management, budgeting and accountability; (vi) the development and
strengthening of information systems (TRIMS, SuMS, complaint handling); and (vii) the
establishment of an online knowledge and learning forum (WAPIK). Annex 2 provides more
details on activities that were implemented during the life of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     Assessment of PDO Achievements. The overall rating for the achievement of the PDO
is moderately satisfactory. Progress from baseline was observed in the majority of the PDO
indicators while ten out of eleven intermediate indicator targets were either met or exceeded.

                                               12
These EFA-MDG PDO indicators that measured impact at the national level, which were
included at the request of the donors, showed positive trends for enrollment, completion and
transition rates. No direct project attribution can be made to improvements in the PDO indicators
related to the BEC-TF interventions. However, they are reflective of the government’s aim of
achieving the MDG and EFA goals for Indonesia and were to measure progress of the national
BOS program to which the BEC-TF provided technical support. The intermediate indicators,
which were strongly tied to the BEC-TF’s interventions, also showed gains during the project
period and showed good progress at the district levels in meeting the project development
objectives of improving good governance.

43.     The PDO Indicators. Progress towards achieving PDOs was to be measured against the
six key PDO outcome indicators 11. The indicators are reflective of the progress made toward
achievement of the PDO at the national level and show positive trends towards reaching the
MDG and EFA goals. The achievements are as follows: (i) primary net enrollment rates
nationally increased from 91.13 percent in 2007 to 92.52 percent in 2012. The modest
improvements in enrollment at the primary level would be expected given that they were already
close to universal prior to the launch of BOS. However, data also shows that the government has
made progress in reaching the disadvantaged regions: primary net enrollment rates for the
poorest wealth quintile increased from 90.93 percent in 2007 to 92.52 percent in 2012. The
disaggregated data associated with this indicator shows mixed results with primary female
enrollments surpassing targets by 0.45 percentage points and primary male enrollments missing
the end-of-project targets by 0.11 percentage points; (ii) primary gross enrollment rates
increased from 2007 to 2012 with primary females surpassing the target by 0.33 percentage
points and total primary and primary males missing the targets by 0.19 percentage points and
0.08 percentage points respectively; (iii) the increases in net enrollment rates at the junior
secondary level were particularly large within the poorest income quintile (rising from 53.03
percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012). These gains reflect the BOS program’s success in
expanding access to poor and disadvantaged children in Indonesia. Significant net enrollment
gains at the junior secondary level among both males (rising from 64.37 percent to 68.09
percent) and females (rising from 68.68 percent to 71.95 percent) were also observed over the
2007 to 2012 period; (iv) primary completion rates increased during the life of the project from
96.86 percent to 97.06 percent but were below the end-of-project targets by 0.70 percentage
points; (v) junior secondary completion rates increased during the project from 98.17 percent to
98.27 percent, falling short of end-of-project target by 0.40 percentage points; and (vi) transition
rates from primary to junior secondary school increased during the implementation of the
project from 75.58 percent to 77.26 percent but fell short of the target by 4.94 percentage points
(based on latest available 2011 data).

44.    Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The intermediate level indicators were closely
aligned to the BEC-TF scope and activities and showed significant gains throughout project


11
     See paragraph 31 for details on changed baseline and end targets for indicators 1, 2 and 3.




                                                                  13
implementation. The intermediate indicators are clustered under seven topics and will be
discussed below based on the cluster design.

45.     Cluster 1. GoI education policy reviewed through policy analysis and studies used to
inform education policy. The policy analysis and studies consisted of rapid reviews conducted
by the Bank at the request of GoI. The target set for measuring success of this cluster was to
produce two studies related to education policy. The project exceeded the target with the
completion of 19 studies. These studies are illustrated by the following: (i) an education
financing study that reviewed the formula used by the local government school grants (BOSDA)
program 12 when allocating school resources which is still being used by MoEC; (ii) an analysis
of the higher education law that led to MoEC integrating autonomy into the new 2012 higher
education draft law; (iii) a school based management study that showed there was limited
community participation which led to a requirement that a community representative be on the
school committees that review school budgets 13; and (iv) an analysis of the regulatory
framework for ECD, which has led to new regulations for the sub-sector. In addition to studies,
the project supported annual reviews of the BOS operations manual regulations that were
updated, reviewed and then used for implementing the national BOS program. This was
significant because the BOS operations manual sets the policies and criteria for the annual
implementation of the BOS program and utilization of BOS funds 14. Another rapid response that
made a substantial contribution was a review of the BOS financial mechanisms for providing
grants directly to districts. The provision of grants to districts was the primary cause of slow
implementation of the BOS program in 2011. The review findings led to a return to the
provincial block grant mechanism which streamlined the process and greatly improved on time
disbursements. The full list of studies can be found in Annex 2. However, the important outcome
of these studies is that they were systematically used by the government to inform their own
sector policy dialogue.

46.      Cluster 2. Education budget information available at the local level. This cluster of
indicators was designed to measure transparency within the system. They were: (i) number of
districts providing education budget information through local mass media, official
announcement boards, or on a website; and (ii) number of districts with at least 60 percent of
schools providing BOS education budget information through school announcement boards. The
number of districts providing education budget information through mass media increased from
16 in 2009 to 39 in 2012, exceeding the target of 35. This is impressive considering that many of
the 50 districts had no established local media outlets, lacked websites, and at the start of the
12
   BOSDA resources are local government funds that are additional to the National School Operational Assistance (BOS)
program and are allocated to schools based on a common per student formula. BOSDA also aimed to address the disparities
between the higher costs of school operations in peripheral locations compared with those in the district capitals. Eighteen
districts and two provinces are now using BOSDA, the more equitable formula-based approach (customized according to local
criteria) to provide supplementary funding to schools based on access and performance rather than student enrolment figures.
BEC-TF piloted this formula based approach focused on access and equity which was trialed on a ‘demand’ basis.
13
   This requirement was made part of the BOS operations manual to strengthen compliance and raise awareness.
14
   As an example, discussions about the eligible spending categories outlined in the BOS Operation Manual now include
“remedial teaching? rather than lumping it together with sports, art and scouts. Another recent modification has been a
clarification of the sub-district roles and the BOS audit procedures. Additionally, there were ICT technical and policy inputs to
enhance the 2012 BOS Manual to include information gathering tools for the “safe schools? program, which focused on school
safety and rehabilitation of damaged schools and is an outgrowth of a BEC-TF supported activity.




                                                              14
project, were not preparing budget documents in accordance with prevailing norms. The number
of districts with at least 60 percent of schools providing BOS education budget information
through school announcement boards increased from 16 to 37, missing the target of 50. While
the target was missed, this is still a substantial improvement. Field reports revealed that districts
increasingly circulated education data, plans and reports through local media outlets, such as
local newspapers.

47.     Cluster 3. Budget and expenditures are well defined, cost-based, and linked to
performance indicators. This cluster was measured by the number of districts with education
units that had a budget document with measurable outcomes related to its strategy. The target
within the 50 districts was achieved. This indicator was designed to measure progress in
developing performance-based budgeting at the district level, a newly introduced concept in the
education system. This concept underscored the importance of developing well defined, costed
budgets, ultimately linked to measureable district outcome targets.

48.      Cluster 4. Education budget execution rates at local levels. This cluster was also
related to financial management and budget planning, and was measured by the number of
districts with a difference between planned and realized programs (disbursement rates) of less
than 10 percent in the last three fiscal years. This indicator reflects the emphasis of the project on
the use of L-BEC grants to improve the capacity of districts in financial planning, budgeting and
execution. The number of districts with improved education budget execution rates increased
from 31 to 44, thereby exceeding the target by 4 districts. This is a substantial achievement that
was supported by extensive capacity development training. However, had the L-BEC grants been
released in a more timely and predictable fashion, districts would have had more time to increase
their funds usage rate and thereby narrowing the gap between planned and realized expenditures.

49.      Cluster 5. Effective internal information, audit and control systems in place. This
cluster of indicators was designed to measure transparency of education expenditures at the local
level. The indicators were as follows: (i) the number of districts where all awards for education
bids are published in local newspapers, on official announcement boards or a website increased
from a base of 12 to 48 by the end of the project, well above the target of 35. This large increase
is an indication of the improved transparency that districts sought to instill in their education
procurement process; (ii) the number of districts where fixed assets are inventoried on an annual
basis increased from a baseline of 23 to 36, well beyond the target of 28; and (iii) the number of
districts where internal audit results are filed, and action is taken to follow up on
recommendations was met by 40 of the 50 district, thereby surpassing the target of 26. This also
demonstrates increased accountability at the district levels, which was a specific goal of the
project.

50.     Cluster 6. Community-based accountability reviews take place. This cluster was
measured by the number of districts where the Bupati/Walikota's accountability report (including
Dinas Pendidikan) is made available to the public. The target for this indicator, 18 districts, was
exceeded by 10 districts. The fact that MoHA introduced a regulation that required district to
conduct community-based accountability reviews is confirmation of the achievement of this
indicator.



                                                 15
51.      Cluster 7. Accurate, reliable, appropriate and timely information available for
planning, budgeting and performance assessment. This cluster of indicators was measured by:
(i) the number of districts where student achievement (i.e. average national exam scores,
graduation rates, dropout rates, survival to grade 5 rates) are published annually, and can be
easily accessed through local mass media, official announcement boards or on a website. This
indicator increased from a base of 26 districts to 40 districts thereby achieving the target, and (ii)
the number of districts where enrollment by gender is published annually, and easily accessed
through local mass media, official announcement boards or on a website increased from 19
districts to 40 districts, surpassing the target of 25. These achievements indicate an increase in
the transparency at the local level in reporting information on student achievement and
enrollment by gender. The collected data is used to calculate the next year budget, which
includes the national and local BOS allocations. BEC-TF interventions have also contributed to
improved availability of data for use by education administrators and local communities.

52.     The substantial progress related to the intermediate indicators can be directly linked to
the BEC-TF activities: Transparency, financial management and budget planning at the local
level met the targets and have had the intended impact in the 50 districts. The PDO level
indicators show positive trends particularly related to increases in enrollments for the poorer
income quintile, which indicates the government is having some success in reaching the poor and
expanding enrollments. However, the gains in increasing completion rates and transition rates
were more modest over the project period. Based on these factors and the overall analysis above,
achievement of the development objectives is moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

53.     Positive Trends in Key Education Indicators and Internal Efficiency Gains. The
BEC-TF was designed to support the GoI in achieving the MDG and EFA goals through (i) good
governance in education; and (ii) improving the delivery of decentralized basic education
services by local governments. The BOS program, which received capacity building and
technical assistance from the BEC-TF, has contributed to the positive gains observed within the
education sector between 2007 and 2012. Net and gross enrollment rates at the primary and
junior secondary levels of education increased between 2007 and 2012. The increases in net
enrollment rates at the junior secondary level are particularly large within the poorest income
quintile (rising from 53.03 percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012). Significant internal
efficiency gains have also been observed over the 2007 to 2012 period, evidenced by: (i)
increased completion rates at the primary and junior secondary levels; (ii) increased transition
rates from primary school to junior secondary school; (iii) reduced drop-out rates at the primary
and junior secondary levels; and (iv) reduced repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary
levels.

54.    Unit Costs of Capacity Building Activities funded by BEC-TF. Component 2 sought
to improve governance and efficient resource use by providing targeted training in financial
management. About 50,105 local education staff benefitted from project-financed training at an
average cost of US$62 per person. The unit costs associated with this capacity building activity
are comparable to those charged by USAID, AUSAID, and UNICEF for a similar intervention.
The project also trained 13,274 local education staff in performance-based budgeting and

                                                 16
planning at an average cost of US$65 per beneficiary. Again, the unit costs for this three-day
activity are in line with the fees charged by USAID, AUSAID, and UNICEF for an equivalent
training program. 15 Under Component 3, 2,422 education staff received a three-day course on the
use of financial data to improve the efficiency of funds allocation/use at an average cost of
US$82 per person. Although no comparable financial data from other donor-funded activities are
available for this particular activity, feedback from the districts suggested the training provided
was highly relevant and comprehensive.

55.     Efficient Resource Use. The BEC-TF capacity development support has contributed to
improvements in the efficiency of funds usage among the 50 targeted districts. Over the life of
the project, local governments have registered important gains in the processes which determine
public resource uses. Results from the Indonesian Local Education Governance Survey (ILEGI)
indicate that the number of district education offices providing progress reports on their activity
plans have increased during the project. Improvements in the local planning and budgeting
processes have also been observed. More specifically, 74 percent of districts are now
establishing their own budget priorities and ceilings prior to the provincial/central offices even
begin their planning exercise, which is a substantial increase from the 44 percent in 2009 and is a
reflection of the positive progress of the education decentralization process. The number of BEC-
TF supported districts with improved education budget execution rates have also increased from
31 to 44 over the life of the project. While some of these efficiency gains may have been the
result of the central government’s efforts at introducing medium-term expenditure frameworks 16,
the BEC-TF program’s capacity building activities related to performance-based budgeting,
planning, and execution have been instrumental to the success of this process.

56.     Reduced Financial Leakage. Prior to the launch of the BEC-TF in 2008, the first
Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS1) found that approximately 70 percent of funds
allocated by all levels of Government reached the school. By 2012, nearly 90 percent of the total
funds disbursed by all levels of Government were received by schools. 17 These lower levels of
financial leakage within the education system are in part a result of the GoI’s overall efforts at
strengthening external and internal audit systems, as well as the BEC-TF’s increased focus on
improving financial management, transparency and accountability at the local level. The BOS
Operations Manual, which was updated and revised throughout the life of the project, played a
key role in minimizing the misuse of funds at the school level by: (i) clearly stipulating eligible
and ineligible expenditures categories; (ii) strengthening financial disclosure and reporting
requirements; and (iii) mandating community oversight of funds usage. Given that the BEC-TF
provided capacity development and technical assistance to the BOS program, this is an important
contribution by the project. It is also important to highlight that all BEC-TF audit reports were
unqualified, providing further evidence that no systematic financial issues were identified within
the 50 BEC-TF districts.

15
   The unit cost of capacity building activities tend to be relatively uniform across the various development agencies operating in
Indonesia because the government typically establishes a price ceiling (or “standard price?) which must be complied with by all
development agencies.
16
   Efforts to ensure better local resource management were embodied in the 2003 state finance law that started implementation in
2006. In particular, the law introduced medium-term expenditure frameworks into local planning and budgeting. This represented
a shift from earlier annual input based budgeting with a focus on the expected outputs of planning and budgeting decisions.
17
   Regional Independent Monitoring Survey, 2012.


                                                               17
57.    The ICR rates the efficiency of the project to be substantial. The eighteen month delay
slowed implementation of capacity development activities to be funded by the L-BEC grants.
However, over this initial period the Bank worked closely with the CPIU to maintain momentum
in the project implementation through several activities, such as: (i) local and international
workshops and study visits aimed at equipping education stakeholders with the skills sets
required to effectively govern and manage the decentralized education systems; and (ii) the
support for the development and implementation of district level CDPs in the strategic areas of
good governance, financial management, budgeting and accountability. Once the on-granting
mechanism was clarified and put into practice, the pace of the implementation of the project
increased considerably.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

58.      The objective and project design were highly relevant in that they fit squarely into the
government’s multi-year strategic plan program. The relevance of implementation is judged to
be substantial given that the implementing agencies worked to effectively resolve the
implementation challenges related to the 18 month delay in releasing L-BEC grants. The
efficiency of the project was substantial considering that improvements in transparency, budget
planning and financial management reduced financial leakage and contributed to better resource
utilization. Given these results and the detailed findings outlined above, BEC-TF overall
outcome as moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There is no additional information other than what has already been reported.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.      There has been an institutionalization of the BOS operations manual that directs the use
of BOS grants, financial reporting and budgeting at the school level. There has also been an
institutionalization of the annual reviews of the BOS operations manual so that relevant
modifications can be made based on lessons learned during the yearly implementation period.
The complaint handling mechanism piloted with BEC-TF support has been widely disseminated
across all 50 BEC-TF districts and an improved monitoring and evaluation system has been
institutionalized. MoEC monitors the program annually and the results are used to improving the
BOS program. The Safe Schools activity, which focused on school safety and rehabilitation of
damaged schools, has now been institutionalized by MoEC.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
There are no other unintended outcomes or impacts other than what has been reported.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

60.      The risk to development outcomes at project closing is rated modest given the GoI’s
commitment to the increased budgets for education. In addition, 40 out of the 50 districts have
developed post-project sustainability plans and allocated budget resources within their next
budget cycle to further improve the delivery of decentralized basic education services. The MoF,
in its support of all Indonesian schools through the nationwide BOS program, has now developed
an efficient funding flow mechanism which transmits funds from the center to the provinces and
then the district and schools. The decision at the MoF level to develop this improved funds flow
process was supported by BEC-TF-supported rapid response policy note. Audits at the district
levels report reduced levels of financial leakage between the 2008 to 2012 period. Human
resources at district levels have benefited from the capacity development training supported by
the BEC-TF, and the project outcome indicators already show that management, especially
financial management, has improved in the districts. Information collection tools such as TRIMS
and SupportMySchool have provided local schools and communities with increased capacity to
monitor and evaluate the quality and efficiency of school development programs. Such an
involvement, whether by parents or community leaders, is important in assuring transparency
and accountability at the school level. The risk for financial management at project preparation
was rated high given the complexity and size of the Indonesian education system and the
reported challenges with financial reporting and internal and external control systems. Many
local governments lacked the financial management technical capacity necessary to manage
increased fiscal resources and responsibilities. Through the BEC-TF, capacity development took
place and the project enhanced districts’ financial management and reporting skills. Bank and
government audits at the end of the project confirmed that such issues as leakage have decreased
substantially. The ICR team judges that the project has had a considerable positive impact on the
reporting and flow of funds, and rates the current risk as modest.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

61.     Bank performance at entry is judged to be moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank
preparation team worked effectively with MoNE and MoRA in the development of the project.
Extensive time was devoted to tailoring project activities around the five-year RENSTRA with a
strong focus on capacity building at the district and school level, priorities of both MoNE and
MoRA. The Bank team worked with the GoI preparation team in the development of the LGCA,
in order to identify the capacity needs to be addressed by different project components and sub-
components. The thorough preparation process made it possible for the government to
satisfactorily comply with the conditions of effectiveness within a short period and for the Bank
to declare the BEC-TF effective on June 5, 2008, the date of Grant Agreement signing between
the Bank and the Republic of Indonesia.

62.    One task team leader was responsible for the entire project preparation cycle and
continued her responsibility into the implementation process thus providing continuity to the
                                               19
timely implementation and completion of all the key project preparation activities that were
required. Considerable time was spent by the task team in discussions with both the donors and
the government in an effort to ensure agreement on the donors’ priorities and the strategic goals
of the GoI, the CAS and project development policies of the Bank. Despite these strengths, Bank
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory primarily because the PDO indicators selected
were national in scope and supported GoI's achievement of MDG and EFA goals rather than
project specific outcomes. On the other hand, the intermediate indictors selected by the
preparation team were highly relevant and strongly tied to the program’s interventions/scope.

(b) Quality of Supervision

63.     The continuity of the task team leader allowed for strong leadership for the project. This
was particularly helpful in discussions with MoEC, MoRA, the national planning agency
(BAPPENAS) and the MoF related to the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
for the on-granting mechanism. The Bank was instrumental in supporting the dialogue between
the government agencies so that they could find a solution and develop adequate procedures and
guidelines.

64.      There were six supervision missions which included a mid-term review. There was a total
of 54 months elapsing from project effectiveness to the closing which shows that the Bank team
carried out, on average, one supervision mission every 9 months, thus maintaining close
oversight of project implementation. Bank staff in Jakarta led the supervision efforts and
provided ongoing technical support throughout the life of the project. Even though delays
occurred, supervision still took place to support district training and capacity development
activities. As mentioned before, these activities were brought forward by the CPIU to maintain
district involvement and interest in the project following the significant momentum generated
during the extensive district selection process. The supervision teams included the appropriate
technical experts and appropriate skills mix to ensure compliance with procurement, financial
management, and monitoring and evaluation. Mission findings were communicated to the GoI
and Bank management in a timely manner, and the task team followed up on their
recommendations. The Bank’s supervision missions were instrumental in detecting and resolving
issues related to financial management by working with the CPIU and MoEC.

65.     In November 2011, the Bank restructured the project to accommodate the cancellation of
grant funds due to the Netherlands’ decision to reduce its development assistance to Indonesia.
Despite the cancellation, the GoI, with support from the Bank, continued to implement the
project with a significant number of capacity development activities that were provided to the 50
BEC-TF districts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Based on the analysis above the overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.




                                               20
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.     Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This is based largely on
the fact that project implementation was delayed for 18 months because of the lack of standard
operating procedures (SOPs) for the MoF’s on-granting mechanism. The delay forced a
readjustment in the implementation schedule and ultimately necessitated an extension of the
project closing date. The inability of the MoF to develop the necessary operating procedures for
the on-granting mechanism led to a downgrading of the project to moderately unsatisfactory in
June 2010. However, the GoI and Bank teams worked hard to get the SOPs established which,
once developed, allowed L-BEC grants to flow to districts and helped significantly improve
project performance for the 2011/12 period.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

67.     During project preparation, the CPIU’s role focused on coordination, facilitation,
mentoring and problem solving. During project execution, the CPIU was in charge of evaluation
and reporting as well as coordination between line ministries, the Bank, provinces and districts.
Facilitation included the development of guidelines, manuals and modules related to the
implementation of activities, action plan preparation, verification of documents, disbursement of
grants and preparation of reports. The CPIU also conducted monitoring and evaluation activities
of up to three times each year. MoEC, as the implementing agency, and more specifically the
CPIU, worked diligently to find a solution to the problem of the lack of SOPs. Furthermore,
discussions with the PSC led to bring training and capacity development activities with districts
forward. The CPIU carried off these tasks well and were able to maintain project implementation
momentum in the face of bureaucratic hurdles placed in front of them.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance.
Taking into consideration the reasons stated above, the recipient performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

68.     Lesson 1. Funds granted against capacity development plans, based on a structured
assessment process, are an effective way to meet the specific needs of individual districts.
Under the BEC-TF project, districts developed and implemented plans and activities focused on
strategic education governance and management improvement needs identified in the baseline
LGCA. The iterative L-BEC grant planning, submission and budget acquittal/settlement process
necessary for the release of each grant tranche, although time consuming, reinforced transparent
and accountable financial management practices.

69.    Lesson 2. The use of large scale longitudinal surveys such as the LGCA provides a
good capacity development needs assessment tool to a project. Envisioned from the start of
the project to be a diagnostic tool and a crucial element to assessing both district level capacity
development needs and project outcomes, the LGCA was used in a number of ways as it: (i)
                                                21
helped districts assess their capacity development needs; (ii) provided a supplementary and
robust source of data which could be used to check reports gathered by the districts and reported
to the CPIU and then to the Bank team, and (iii) provided the Bank and government with a data
set to systematically compare changes in local education governance within the 50 BEC-TF
districts between 2009 and 2012.

70.     Lesson 3. The efficient and timely implementation of project activities is contingent
upon establishing and maintaining a clear funds flow mechanism. Prior to the BEC-TF
project, funding was provided through the block grant system. However, the MoF decision to
move to an on-granting mechanism led to significant delays because of a lack of standard
operating procedures due to internal MoF issues. The task team proactively, along with the
CPIU, worked with the MoF in coming up with a solution to this impasse, and after an 18 month
delay, the project was then able to move forward.

  This column does not represent the cost at appraisal but rather the net project amounts in US dollars after the trust
fund account was reduced by €8.7 million at the request of the Dutch government and €1.1 million was returned
prior to project closing December 31, 2013 due to inability to utilize the remaining funds. This is judged to provide a
more accurate accounting of the allocations for each project disbursement category.

 The original amount of the trust funds was €25.6 million (US$40.83 million equivalent). The trust fund account
was reduced by €8.7 million and €1.1 million was returned prior to project closing December 31, 2013. The project
also has an undisbursed balance as of May 30, 2013 in the amount of €2.24 million (US$3.18 million equivalent).
Therefore, the percent of disbursements of the net project funds is 85 percent.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund (BEC-TF) was developed to support the
Government of Indonesia’s (GoI) Medium-Term Strategic Plan (Rencana Strategis—
RENSTRA) and to complement other bilateral and multilateral education programs. The overall
objective of the BEC-TF, as stated in the Grant Appraisal Document (GAD), was to contribute to
the GoI’s achievement of MDGs and EFA goals through good governance in Indonesia. The
purpose of the program was to support GoI in improving the delivery of decentralized basic
education services by local governments and schools in selected program areas, and by extension
in other locations. Within this context, the BEC-TF sought to strengthen the planning, budgeting,
financial management and accountability at the local level in order to reduce leakages, increase
the efficiency of fund usage, and improve the delivery of education services. The BEC-TF also
envisioned developing a sound monitoring and evaluation system capable of providing relevant
data to guide and shape the decision-making process across the entire education system.

2.     The following list of outputs reflects a combination of Bank-executed trust fund (BE-TF)
and recipient-executed trust fund (RE-TF) outputs. While the ICR analysis is based only on the
RE-TF, the team felt that it was important to show the outputs associated with the overall trust
fund. The team has identified what outputs are associated with the BE-TF and RE-TF.

3.     Component 1: Policy Analysis and Dialogue. Based on the completeness of the work
that was supported by the BEC-TF when compared to the prospective outline of activities in the
GAD, Component 1 is rated Satisfactory. This component was originally designed to support
the development of a Sector-wide Approach for the delivery of education services and to
coordinate the development partner’s support for the sector. Two elements required for laying
the foundation for SISWA included: (i) a forum that allowed key sector stakeholder to have a
dialogue which was the Thematic Education Dialogue (TED) and (ii) in-depth policy analysis
which assisted in identifying needs and would inform policy priorities and direction and this was
done through analytical studies.

4.       Sub-component 1.1: Thematic Education Dialogue (TED). The objectives of the TED
were: (i) to provide strategic and policy recommendations on education sector reform and
development issues, including resourcing and planning; (ii) to coordinate cooperation among GoI
institutions playing significant roles in the education sectors and between GoI and international
development partners in the education sector; (iii) to support preparation for a sector wide
approach and for external financing to be delivered through the GoI system; and (iv) to review
and evaluate progress on implementation of policies and sector performance.

5.      TED (BE-TF activity) was responsible for (i) convening education stakeholders to
identify the key education sector issues; and (ii) introducing stakeholders to best international
practice related to SISWA. This was done through: local and internal training workshops which
enabled senior government officials and development partners to discuss key education issues
and provide strategic and policy recommendations on education reform and development issues,
including resourcing and planning. The discussions at the TED meetings fed into the pipeline of
analytical work and collaboration for policy and regulatory change with GoI and other
development partners as well as informed the preparation of the 2010-2014 Medium-Term

                                               24
Development. The TED activities invigorated dialogue and debate with stakeholders from
Ministry of Finance (MoF), The Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), The Ministry of Education and
Culture (MoEC) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) which generated significant
momentum between education policy makers and stakeholders at all levels on key GoI identified
issues. The analytical work requested were on strategic issues such as: (i) education sector
financing that contributed to a change in the BOS fund disbursement and ways to increase
efficiency and equity in education budgeting; (ii) basic education provision; (iii) refocusing non-
formal education; (iv) higher education; (v) school based management (SBM); (vi)
supplementary district funding for schools (BOSDA); (vii) youth skills development, and (viii)
senior secondary strategy. The TED requested many activities within Component 1 of the BEC-
TF which are summarized below.

6.      Local and International Training Workshops. This sub-component under the TED
supported workshops on the following topics: (i) building annual assessment systems for
tracking sector performance over time; (ii) Performance Assessment System of Education
(PASE) to improve sector governance and management; (iii) improving the efficiency,
effectiveness and equity of education public spending; and (iv) facilitating access to knowledge
and adoption of good education practices.

7.     The Comprehensive Program for Skills Upgrading East Asia Conference: Skills
Development for Productivity provided the forum for policy makers from participating
governments, industry groups, education and training providers and international experts to
discuss issues about and approaches to skills development. Findings from the “Revitalizing
Public Training Centers in Indonesia: Challenges and the Way Forward? study report, developed
with BEC-TF technical analysis support, were presented by the Directorate-General, Training
and Productivity Development, MoMT. (BE-TF activity)

8.      SupportMySchool (Bantu Sekolahku): Soft-launched in December 2012. TA provided
to develop this innovative system which aims to solve service delivery challenges and the need
for transparency and accountability through the effective use of ICT and social networking.
Discussions underway to integrate TRIMS, complaint handling and Safe Schools into the web-
based platform to link complementarities. MoEC has institutionalized and provided financial and
human resources to manage the system; continuous improvement is on the basis of user and
public feedback. (BE-TF activity)

9.       Support to Education Development Program Coordination in Papua: This additional
activity followed the Bank decision to hire a locally based coordinator for Papua to facilitate
links between existing and planned support programs to the provincial and local RENSTRAs.
This activity played a valuable role in briefing ESWG, welcoming incoming missions,
facilitating meetings and promoting links between programs and advising on local priorities.
(BE-TF activity)

10.    World Bank Institute Transforming Tertiary Education for Innovation and
Competitiveness Course, Bali: This course was to move the policy dialogue forward on key
reform issues, primarily dealing with quality assurance and innovative financing mechanisms,



                                                25
supported by BEC-TF. Generated high levels of interest and follow up from the GoI while also
raising Indonesia’s profile in the region and globally. (BE-TF activity)

11.    BEC Dissemination Program, Indonesia: Improving Education Governance;
Strengthening EMIS for Data based Planning and Budgeting; ICT for Education; Clean Energy
Resources to Advance Schooling; Safe Schools and DRR; BOSDA; Public Participation to
Improve Service Delivery; Best Practices; Performance Based Budgeting; and SBM Talk show:
Developing and Synergizing Local Education Stakeholders to Promote Education Governance.
(BE-TF activity)

12.     National BOS School Management Team Training design and development, in
consultation with other Development Partners. Four modules were developed: School Self-
Evaluation, Planning and Budgeting, Financial Management and Character Building. BEC
funded the development and production of a DVD which contained all participant and trainer
materials as well as supplementary information from MoEC such as Buku Sekolah Elektronik e-
textbooks copyrighted to MoEC), HIV-AIDS, Narcotics Awareness and Use Prevention, Disaster
Risk Reduction for Safe Schools and Gender. During review, responses to questions about the
learning materials indicated that content and materials were highly relevant and a valuable
resource for future reference for School Management Teams. The actual training was an
intensive 3-day program to support over 650,000 participants from primary and junior secondary
schools and madrasahs in 339 Districts and 31 Provinces to maximize the use of BOS and other
school resources for improved SBM. However, there were delays in the roll-out of the training
program due to the lengthy process of signing the MoU between the GoI and AusAID. As a
result the training was conducted after most schools had prepared and submitted 2012 4-year
school development plans and annual school activity and budget plans to the district office. (BE-
TF activity)

13.     Study visits. Under Component 1 study visits were undertaken to learn lessons from
other governments in areas that the TED group had identified as important to the further
development of the education system. Six of the most relevant study tours were the following: (i)
New York, USA to learn about education effectiveness and performance appraisal; (ii) China-
Hangzhou for ICT and to attend an educational regional conference; (iii) India-to attend an
international seminar on teacher development and management in Udipur; (iv) Hong Kong SAR,
China-to attend the East Asian International Conference on Teacher Education Research at the
HK Institute of Education Research; (v) Philippines-a study tour to look at the government’s
Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA) program; and (vi) Thailand-Higher Education
Governance and Finance. (BE-TF activity)

14.     Development of a Sector-wide Approach Framework. Although the sector-wide
approach framework was canceled, the BEC-TF did supported the work of an education
specialist, prior to the cancelation, to evaluate existing programs, models and strategies being
used for education development at the district level, in order to give an overview of the kind of
support which MoEC and development partners should provide in the future. This was a joint
exercise with AusAID, the European Commission and the Netherlands as well as the Bank, and
was supported by MoEC. The report from this activity was circulated among colleagues in
MoEC, BAPPENAS, MoRA and among ESWG partners, and was revised based on discussions

                                               26
at various Education Sector Working Group meetings, a seminar and presentations for the BEC
and Bank teams. (BE-TF activity)

15.     Rapid Response. Support was provided for: (i) education policy advice; (ii) international
fora on school based management; (iii) the national BOS training design and materials
development and trailing process; (iv) formula based BOSDA and district performance based
grants; and (v) an Education Public Expenditure Review (EPER) which explored the impact on
sector performance and efficiency of the constitutional rule of allocating a minimum of 20
percent of the national budget to education. The analysis was done in the context of 10 years of
decentralization and the outcome of existing financial mechanisms on the efficiency and equity
of education spending at district and school levels. Other rapid response activities were:

    i. Basic education decentralization technical assistance and policy development support:
       Policy advice contributed to the change in policy for BOS fund disbursement in 2012 to
       reach a new solution following the failure of district disbursement in 2011. The ensuing
       change resulted in the fastest disbursement of the grant since its introduction in 2005. (BE-
       TF activity)
   ii. Education Financing: Successful meeting brought together representatives of several
       ministries and the office of the Vice President. Four presentations made by the Bank, the
       Asian Development Bank, USAID and the Aceh local government led to a rich discussion
       on ways to increase efficiency in education budgeting. (BE-TF activity)
 iii. At national level an Education Public Expenditure Review occurred in close consultation
       with the Vice President’s and the Minister’s office and, BAPPENAS. Key issues
       highlighted the importance of efficiency in teacher management, improving the quality of
       teachers generating ongoing discussions about strategies for the future. (BE-TF activity)
  iv. District capacity development training commenced with training in education public
       expenditure analysis using a highly consultative and participatory approach modeled on
       the successful Public Expenditure Analysis and Capacity Harmonization approach. Some
       districts have incorporated ongoing activities in four-year strategic plans. (BE-TF activity)
   v. School Management. Regional Ministerial Forum: Benchmarking Education Systems
       for Results, June 2011 built momentum for three SBM TED meetings, led by the Vice
       Minister and MoEC. A development partner workshop was conducted to inform a Seminar
       convened for national, provincial, district and school stakeholders on “Lessons learned
       from a decade of SBM Implementation in Indonesia?. (BE-TF activity)
  vi. A series of international conferences were held in 2011 which focused on benchmarking,
       analyzing PISA results, lessons learned in SBM practices in Indonesia, and the BOS
       Manual was updated on how BOS funds could be used to support SBM efforts. standards,
       competency based training and certification) was produced following analytical technical
       assistance which has contributed to GoI’s ’Skills for the Master Plan’. (BE-TF activity)
 vii. Teacher Reform: Full team of Director Generals from MoNE and MoRA, representatives
       from MoRA and BAPPENAS and the Vice President’s Office, as well as education leaders
       from Universities, the Teachers’ Union. Chaired by the Vice Minister with presentations by
       WB, AusAID and USAID. The development of this activity was to redeploy teachers to
       underserved parts of Indonesia. (BE-TF activity)
viii. Holistic, Integrated Early Childhood Education provided a platform to: (i) follow up on
       issues and make recommendations about ECD positioning and policy development in 2013

                                                27
        and the development of post-2015 MDGs: (ii) enable Indonesia to share its progress on
        ECD policy to an international audience and to bring international good practice to an
        Indonesian audience; and (iii) provide a forum for ‘Special Envoys for ECD Strategy’
        aimed at increasing advocacy for budgetary and policy support. MoEC was supported to
        convene the 15th UNESCO-APEID International Conference. (BE-TF activity)
 ix.    Inspiring Education: Creativity and Entrepreneurship. It provided the forum to focus
        on linkages between creativity and entrepreneurship in education, cultivating talents and
        skills and strengthening linkages between education and the workplace. (BE-TF activity)
  x.    Public Private Partnerships in Education: Consultations about education sector
        financing. The Chair of TED suggested revitalizing TED activities by conducting regular
        meetings to discuss various education issues and to sharpen government policies/programs
        in education. (BE-TF activity)
 xi.    MoEC was supported to convene the National Educators Conference: Reshaping
        Entrepreneurship Education in conjunction with the Sampoerna Foundation and the
        Mien R. Uno Foundation in December 2012. The forum reinforced the need for
        entrepreneurship education that will lead to better education quality for Indonesia to
        increase capacity in the global era. (BE-TF activity)
xii.    National Teachers Congress on Education for Sustainable Development: More than
        750 teachers from across Indonesia participated in this high profile event opened by the
        Minister. BEC provided two speakers to lead sessions on Education for Sustainable
        Development and supported the attendance of 100 teachers and education from BEC and
        BERMUTU districts. (BE-TF activity)
xiii.   BPKP Annual Training for L-BEC grant use: BPKP were requested to audit district
        grant fund use according to the L-BEC manual. BEC-TF provided training which was
        conducted annually to ensure that auditors were aware about manual stipulations for grant
        fund use. (RE-TF activity)
xiv.    Disaster Risk Reduction for Safe Schools activities, in consultation with the Global Fund
        for Disaster Risk Reduction. Outcome: Guidelines for Safe Schools have been produced
        and implemented during several pilot activities and introduced to all schools during the
        2011 BOS national training program. (BE-TF activity)
 xv.    Clean Energy Resources to Drive Advances in Schooling (CERDAS) which has piloted
        the installation of renewable energy in two remote schools without electricity. The
        momentum generated by this pilot has seen it extended by MoEC and the UNESCO
        supported Green Schools Program. (BE-TF activity)

16.      Sub-component 1.2: Analytical Studies. The overall objectives of sub-component 1.2
were to: (i) develop, synthesize and disseminate sector knowledge and information; and (ii)
facilitate consensus building on sector issues, priorities, and investment strategies.

17.     Education Sector Assessment (ESA): GoI requested assistance in the preparation of the
ESA as the main education theme under TED for 2008. This was to form the analytical base for a
new strategically pertinent and focused medium term education sector strategy or RENSTRA
(2009-2014) to be prepared jointly by MoEC and MoRA with support and guidance from
BAPPENAS through: (i) generating, synthesizing and disseminating sector knowledge and
information; and (ii) facilitating consensus building on sector issues, priorities, and investment
strategies. (BE-TF activity)

                                                28
18.    Within the ESA, the Bank supported a number of analytical studies and provided
technical assistance and policy development support for the GoI’s basic education
decentralization policy. Specifically the project supported policy discussions on the disbursement
in a decentralized environment of the BOS program. This policy discussion facility was
important because GoI’s decision to decentralize BOS in 2011 caused substantial delays in BOS
funds reaching schools. Policy advice contributed to the change in policy for BOS fund
disbursement in 2012 to reach a new solution following the failure of district disbursement in
2011. The change resulted in the fastest disbursement of the grants since its introduction in 2005.
The BEC team worked closely with the BOS team on the design of a supplementary/variable
BOS program to launch in 2011 which included performance requirements and measures to
reduce disparity at the local level.

19.     Another example of the technical assistance provided by the Bank was a response to the
Vice President’s office which asked the Bank to support preparation of a Youth Employment
Strategy to focus on skills development. Several presentations made on existing constraints for
an effective skills development system in Indonesia, including fragmentation of provision and
funding, lack of quality assurance systems and the need to better coordinate policies. As a result
of this TA, a comprehensive Skills Upgrading Program was developed in early 2012. This
intensified interest in further analytical work and TA linked to skills development agenda in
Indonesia.

20.     Similarly the Bank provided technical assistance for ICT in Education evidenced by the
following: (i) endorsement of Distance Education Ministerial Regulation No. 24 2012 which
emphasizes the importance of e-learning; (ii) specific contributions on Open Education
Resources incorporated into Higher Education Law; (iii) draft of the ICT Competency
Framework for Teachers Ministerial Regulation; (iv) draft of Ministerial Regulation on ICT
Governance to replace Ministerial Regulation No. 38 2008 on ICT Management; and (v) initiated
dialog focused on ICT based learning in remote areas.

21.    The Bank also provided technical assistance on policy development and TA on
scholarships for the poor. Proposals focused on maximizing impact and improving targeting
when children transition between levels presented to Minister and senior staff. In discussions
with GoI, the Bank suggested changes about expanding the program if fuel subsidies were
reduced. There is some agreement to use the Unified Poverty List 18 to improve targeting.
Progress stalled following rejection of the Fuel subsidy Reduction Scheme.

22.    A series of workshops were designed to inform the GoI’s RENSTRA. Nine key themes in
the education sector identified were: (i) Improving the match between skills demanded by the
labor market and produced by the education system; (ii) Non formal education: scoping and


18
   The United Poverty List is The unified database on poverty is a database that is being put together by TNP2K (Tim Nasional
Pengentasan dan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan (National Poverty Reduction Team, Vice President’s Office) to identify all poor
households in Indonesia. The purpose is to improve the targeting of all social assistance programs including scholarships.




                                                            29
refocusing; (iii) Compulsory Basic Education: provision, reaching the unreached and expanding
coverage; (iv) The National Examinations; (v) Teacher Management: Employment and
Deployment; (vi) Teacher Management: Quality and Certification; (vii) Education Sector
Financing: Fiscal Reform, Public-private Partnership; (viii) Building skills for increased
competitiveness; and (ix) Improving access and quality of basic education and enhancing
governance use. These workshops invigorated dialogue and debate and generated significant
momentum between education policy makers and stakeholders at all levels on key GoI identified
issues. They also informed the preparation of the 2009 - 2014 Medium Term Development Plan.
ESA activities used evidence-based approaches which contributed to consensus-building on key
development issues.

23.     Studies to support capacity development activities. The purpose of the studies was to
support the ESA with analytical work. Several national and international experts were recruited
to carry out studies and prepare analytical papers and policy notes based on international as well
as Indonesian research finding. Among the most relevant policy and analytical studies
undertaken by BEC-TF were: (i) Teacher Management; (ii) Quality of Education in Madrasah’s
Report Improving the match between skills demanded by the labor market and produced by the
education system; (iii) Education, Training and Labor Market Outcomes for Youth in Indonesia:
Report and Policy Brief; (iv) Skills Development for Productivity Conference: Policy Dialog, (v)
BOS: Making BOS Effective Under Decentralization; (vi) BOSDA: The BOSDA Improvement
Program: Enhancing Equity and Performance through Local School Grants Policy Brief; (vii)
BOSDA Guidelines; (viii) Higher Education Reform Seminars and Policy Brief; (ix) School
Based Management: Education Update Policy Brief; (x) School Financing/Unit Cost
calculations: Guidelines and Tools; (xi) Early Childhood Education: Policy Brief; (xii) Trends in
Learning Outcomes based on internationally standardized test: Policy Brief; (xiii) Education
Public Expenditure Review: Report and Policy Brief; (xiv) Free Basic Education for Poor
Households; (xv) Disaster Risk Reduction for Safe Schools: Guidelines and Manual; and (xvi)
Clean Energy Resources to Drive Advances in Schooling: Impact Study and Policy Brief. The
study reports generated ongoing discussions in a number of stakeholder panels and meetings
about strategies for the future and highlighted the importance of efficiency in teacher
management, improving the quality of teachers and learning outcomes, improving planning
budgeting and financial management with in the education system, strengthening monitoring and
assessment systems, and reforming higher education financing mechanisms.

24.     The Bank and the MoEC carried out a communication strategy to increase familiarity
with BEC-TF achievements so as to ensure the visibility of the program and disseminate its
outputs and publications to stakeholders (GoI key Ministries, Provincial, District Education
Offices, Schools, NGOs, Donors, Development Partner). The BEC-TF program communication
and outreach plan focused on: (i) program visibility: promote awareness of the BEC-TF program
and activities among government counterparts, national media and development partners; (ii)
issue visibility: promote awareness of BEC-TF supported core principles and strategic areas, and
programs and activities (i.e., transparency and accountability, education service provision
standards, management control systems, information management systems, efficient resource
use) among government counterparts, national and local media, and development partners; (iii)
donor visibility: Increase stakeholder awareness of ongoing donors’ efforts to support GoI’s
progress in improving education outcomes and governance in the sector; and (iv) capacity

                                               30
building of local and national journalists to cover education governance issues in the print,
television and radio media. (BE-TF activity)

25.     Component 2: Good Governance, Financial Management, Budgeting and
Accountability. (RE-TF activity)There was need to strengthen the education sector governance
and management capacity, particularly at the district level to use resources more effectively,
efficiently and equitably. Through this component the BEC sought to strengthen planning,
budgeting, procurement, financial management and assessment systems to strengthen
accountability practices at the district level. The expected outcome of Component 2 has been
improved governance and efficient resource use through increased transparency, accountability,
improved budget processes and performance base financing, improved financial management
and accounting, especially in local governments. The sub components are good governance and
financial management, planning and budgeting and school management.

26.     This component is rated moderately satisfactory. This rating is based on the fact that the
expected training was conducted but there were some reported weaknesses in the impact of the
training. Substantial efforts were made in the delivery of capacity development training and
technical advice. However, several of the component activities were delivered late in the project
lifetime because of the problems in obtaining final agreement related to the on-lending process.
These delays led to slower than expected implementation of the new management methods.
While there was a strong focus on capacity development in financial management other districts
still exhibit capacity constraints that will require on-going training to sustain the improvements.
However, it will take more time for districts to fully analyse and use data to inform decision
making at the local level. An additional challenge faced by the districts was the difficulty many
faced in preparing the necessary documents for withdrawal of the L-BEC grants. Training was
provided by MoEC to improve the management capacity of the districts but the problems seemed
to persist.

27.     Sub-Component 2.1: Good Governance and Financial Management. This sub-
component supported the following activities to facilitate the improvement of governance and
financial management. The project supported training on Improved Financial Audit Results
and Updated Assets Inventory. CDP activities included training for Education Asset
Management, as part of the District Finance Office’s district-wide inventory. Training was
followed up with practical assignments to register school education assets. As a result the
Districts had an updated asset inventory and improved national Audit results from qualified in
2009 to unqualified in 2010 and 2011. Complaint Handling: The BEC-TF supported a number
of complaint handling activities, detailed in Component 3 of this annex. However, under this
sub-component, this activity supporting the strengthening of complaint handling systems, in
particular those associated with the school operational grants (BOS) program to improve
transparency and participation for better education governance. This complaint handling
mechanism enables all levels of BOS management teams to record, report and respond to any
feedback provided by community.

28.      Sub-component 2.2: Planning and Budgeting. This sub-component was to support
districts as they began to plan for the performance-based budgeting that would be implemented
under the medium-term expenditure framework. The activities under this sub-component were

                                                31
expected to take place and the local government level to give the proper tools and skills to assess,
determine needs, plan and set targets and properly budget education activities. The activities are
described below.

29.     Three-year Capacity Development Plans: Districts developed and implemented plans
and activities focused on strategic education governance and management improvement needs
identified in the baseline LGCA. School management related activities were also included to
strengthen the link between the school and district to improve coordination and service delivery.
All CDP activities used L-BEC grants to address local needs and, not those determined centrally;
targets were monitored on an annual basis. The iterative L-BEC grant planning, submission and
budget acquittal/settlement process necessary for the release of each grant tranche, although time
consuming, reinforced transparent and accountable financial management practices. Analysis of
CDP outputs/outcomes shows overall improvement in education service provision.

30.     A series of modules were developed to support local governance capacity development
in the five strategic areas of the BEC program, namely, Transparency and Accountability;
Education Service Provision Standards; Management Control Systems; Information Management
Systems and EMIS; Efficient Resource Use. Each module was accompanied by a trainer’s guide
and slides, and is available in hard copy as well as digitally. The approach uses ICARE
(Introduction, Connection, Application, Reflection, and Extension) as developed under USAID’s
DBE1 program 19, and includes large and small group discussions and practical activities within a
cycle of continuous improvement. The modules can be delivered at central or provincial levels,
or through service providers in districts. (RE-TF activity and a BE-TF activity)

31.     Design of Capacity Development Program. The CPIU, working with the task team,
carried out needs assessments at the district level in the fields of capacity development, public
finance management, procurement, education, local governance, planning and information
management. They then developed a framework for the drafting of the CDPs based on the
strategic education needs identified by the districts. The BEC team prepared an operations
manual for districts and an L-BEC manual that were intended for the use of consultants who
were to work directly with local governments in a step by step process.

32.     All 50 BEC districts conducted kick-off meetings with related education stakeholders,
including local government departments, schools, local parliament, local education board and
NGOs to explain the BEC technical assistance program. Following the kick-off meetings, the
staff of the district program implementation units (DPIU) and the CDP consultants worked at the
district level to help develop CDPs, conduct stakeholder meetings to prioritize the CDP
programs, and prepare the L-BEC grant proposals. The BEC provincial program implementation
units (PPIU) conducted one coordination meeting for the BEC districts in their provinces.
Additional CDP activities included: (i) production of a CDP manual to reflect new changes in
education management which was published and distributed to participating BEC districts for
use in preparing their 3-year CDP plans; (ii) training the CDP consultants on the use of the
manual; (iii) conducting stakeholder meetings to review and prioritize elements within the plan;
(iv) development of training modules for the CDP; (v) preparation of materials for the training

                                                          32
modules; and (vi) stakeholder meetings to review and validate the training models before rolling
them out.

33.     L-BEC Grants and Manual: In order to provide the rules and regulations for the
implementation of the L-BEC grants to local districts, a detailed L-BEC manual was developed.
However, following the signature of MOUs by districts with MoEC, a new regulation was issued
by the Ministry of Finance (Decree 168 and 169) on a new on-granting and on-lending
mechanism, which significantly altered the approach to be taken with BEC, and meant that L-
BEC grants could not be transferred to districts in 2008 as planned, even though the local
governments had already included them in their own DIPA of budget lines. Under the new
regulations, which were discussed with MOF, the CPIU clarified the new approach which
required that grants are issued not by MoEC but by MOF. Since this approach has not yet been
used in other programs, the L-BEC grants were effectively a pilot program, and as such were
viewed as important by MOF.

34.      The L-BEC manual was developed, including proposal evaluation criteria, funding flow
mechanisms, and reporting requirements that comply to new MOF regulations. Workshops with
districts on L-BEC grants and use of manuals were conducted to explain the evaluation criteria,
how to prepare and submit proposals, and how to request funds and report on the use of funds,
using a simplified reporting format which combines reports needed based on the on-granting
system and the project reporting system.

35.     L-BEC grants proposal preparation, submission and evaluation. Districts prepared
and submitted L-BEC grant proposals which were submitted on time to the CPIU. Based on the
on-granting regulation, the proposals included an agreed Annual Plan and Comprehensive Plan
in the MOF format, which led to some adjustments of the CDP format. The CPIU reviewed and
evaluated 50 L-BEC grant proposals using the established criteria, and approved and endorsed all
50 L-BEC grants. All districts received equal grant amounts, since the delays in setting up the
on-granting system led to reduced scope for additional performance based grants, and GoI
preferred to select a simpler approach. The release of the L-BEC grants in October 2010 was a
major breakthrough and moved the project forward. The L-BEC manual was revised in 2011 and
distributed to 50 BEC districts and 9 provinces. The revisions included new guidance related to
taxation; management of bank account interest; efficiency savings fund use; eligibility
requirements for computer purchasing for schools; and, the required documentation needed to
receive L-BEC grants.

36.     An education public expenditure assessment capacity development module was
developed to guide districts in their planning and budgeting processes. These were prepared by
in close consultation with the Public Expenditure Analysis Capacity Enhancement (PEACH)
team. It provided guidelines to facilitate local government Education Public Expenditure
Analysis (LG-EPEA) technical teams to develop, disseminate, and act on recommendations for
improvement that emerge from the internally focused analysis of education expenditure. LG-
EPEA was identified as a good practice initiative to assist local governments to better understand
their planning and budgeting processes and expenditure structures so as to inform future plans.
The EPEA report provided stakeholders with information to better understand the forces that
affect budget allocation and spending, the correlation between inputs and outputs, identify

                                               33
existing and emerging financial problems, and develop actions to remedy the problems to
achieve maximum public benefit. Guidelines were prepared for local governments to conduct
their own public expenditure assessments.

37.      BOSDA. BOSDA (BOS Daerah) are local government grants based on a formula that
was used to address the disparities between the higher costs of school operations in peripheral
locations compared with those in the district capitals. Eighteen districts and one province are
now using BOSDA, the more equitable formula-based approach (customized according to local
criteria) to provide supplementary funding to schools based on access and performance rather
than student enrolment figures. The BOSDA team has established that more than 50 percent of
Indonesia’s provinces, districts/cities provide some kind of local BOS grant to schools, or
BOSDA. BOSDA allocations vary between 0.1 percent and 5.6 percent of APBD, and very often
local governments disburse them based on a per capita amount, mimicking the national BOS
program. The aim of this activity was to help local governments to explore ways to encourage
them to apply equity and performance based BOSDA allocations, to reward performance and
encourage pro-poor spending. Formula-based BOSDA can potentially narrow financing
inequalities and improve efficiency as well as effectiveness. (BE-TF activity)

38.      Costing School Operations Instrument. Piloting of an approach in three districts
resulted in the development of an Excel-based BOSDA costing instrument application to
facilitate districts in the calculation of school operational costs to inform BOSDA allocations.
Findings from the Bank BOSDA review show that schools receiving BOSDA had higher
learning achievement, increased access and, spent more on instruction related activities. Pilot
districts are establishing BOSDA taskforces and a communication forum to facilitate central
government discussions about the need to develop BOSDA policy and implementation
requirements. BOSDA relevant information and the Excel-based formula-based BOSDA
instrument application can be accessed through WAPIKweb. (BE-TF activity)

39.     Sub-Component 2.3: School Based Management. This sub-component was to focus on
the delivery of education services at the school level with the support of the local community.
This sub-component produced and distributed several activity briefs that provided best practices
and positive results from the SBM activities. A list of these publications, that were published in
English and Bahasa, are as follows: (BE-TF activity)

 i. Gender mainstreaming checklist and practical manual. This program started with a
    review of the program design and development of recommendations on how to mainstream
    gender, which was shared with project teams including local and national consultants and
    service providers and DPIUs. An education update on mainstreaming gender report was
    published and disseminated to all BEC districts. It incorporated findings from the survey
    conducted by the gender advisor. These findings also informed the development of the
    TRIMS tool, which provides districts with gender disaggregated data.
ii. Making BOS Effective under Decentralization. A policy brief which describes the
    coverage of the BOS program, annual allocations per student, the approval and
    implementation of the school budgets and the connection of BOS and the SBM Program,
    and BOS under decentralization.



                                               34
 iii. Making Schools Based Management Work. An education update describing the
      international evidence on School Based Management, decentralization and student learning
      outcomes.
  iv. Enhancing School-Based Management (SBM) in Indonesia. A policy brief outlining
      decentralization and school-based management, school committees, challenges and
      achievements of SBM in Indonesia, and recommendations for the further development of
      SBM.
   v. The Indonesia Early Childhood Education and Development (ECED) Project:
      Findings and Policy Recommendations. A policy brief providing an overview of and
      policies the ECED sector in Indonesia, describing the Bank-supported ECED project, and
      making a number of findings and recommendations on the project.
  vi. The Imperative for Connected schools in Indonesia. A policy brief outlining the needs of
      connected schools in Indonesia, what it will take to connect all school to the internet, the
      financial implications and necessary legal structure for such interconnectivity.
 vii. The BOSDA Improvement Program: Enhancing Equity and Performance through
      Local School Grants. A policy brief describing the move from BOS to BOSDA, the
      characteristics of provincial and district-based school grants, the BOSDA Improvement
      program and the results of a pilot program to implement BOSDA
viii. Bantu Sekolahku (Support My School/SuMS). The objective of the Support my School
      activity is to develop and deploy an online reporting system that allows members of the
      public and the school/university community, as well as local government and MoEC
      personnel, to report on critical needs within schools and universities, so that these needs can
      be systematically recorded and resolved by the education system (including MoEC,
      provinces, kabupaten, and schools/universities themselves).

 40.     Comprehensive study on school-based management: RAND was contracted to do the
 study. Completed in July 2011 for MoEC review it was published in March 2012. Key findings
 identify: (i) need to expand capacity of Principals, Teachers and SC members about SBM and
 clarify roles so as to realize SBM associated benefits; (ii) Increase school staff ability to make
 managerial and instructional changes through professional development to empower
 implementation of instructional and curriculum changes; (iii) Develop district capacity to support
 schools and SBM; and (iv) Expand the role of Supervisor to include monitoring SBM
 implementation, providing ongoing TA and mentoring to School Management Teams.

 41.    Strengthening of BOS teams at school level and school committees: An $8.5 million
 DESP grant was made to support training on revisions to the BOS manual and key SBM
 concepts (with financial management focus) related to BOS funds management. A national
 program of cascade training took place in 2009 -- School Management Team (1 day) and
 Community (1/2 day) socialization/awareness-raising: 200,000 schools (600,000 participants:
 head teachers, school treasurers, school committee members; parents and community). Lessons
 learned contributed to the design of the 2011 national 3-day training program for School
 Management Teams.

 42.    Component 3: Information Management. This component was designed to strengthen
 systems of information and to develop capacity of key stakeholders to allow for informed
 decisions on education policy and allocations of resources. The activities that were supported by

                                                 35
Component 3 were, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), complaint handling, and the development
of school-based reporting and support instruments, and the establishment of a process for
providing on best teach practices. All fit squarely within the project activities outlined in the
GAD. Some of the activities were developed at the request of the MoEC, others at the suggestion
of the Bank task team. Component 3 is rated moderately satisfactory. This rating is based on
that the fact that a substantial level of capacity development training and technical assistance for
monitoring and evaluation, complaint handling and school-based reporting was provided. While
the data is collected by the districts, they still need to improve their capability to analyze and use
the collected information to inform decision making at the local level.

43.    Sub-component 3.1: Management information systems and Information-Based
Decision Making. This sub-component was to focus on the implementation of management
information systems as well as the capacity to manage the data, analyse and make informed
decisions based on the results. The outputs in this sub-component are described below.

44.     Program monitoring and evaluation workshop and framework. BEC-TF supported
the development of a project M&E system to ensure that the input was systematically collected
based on the defined indicators contained within the Project Operations Manual and L-BEC-
grant manual. The CPIU also prepared a monitoring and evaluation instrument and module to be
used in monitoring visits to the LGs. (RE-TF activity)

45.     Monitoring and Evaluation. In 2009, at project inception, an approach to M&E was
developed by the CPIU and the director of junior secondary education that was supported by
BEC-TF technical assistance. In 2011, an approach designed to focus on district education
program monitoring and evaluation was developed that integrated BOS ME. The BEC-TF team,
in consultation with BOS and BEC CPIUs, used the vehicle for the socialization of the BOS
M&E to train BEC districts (based on district demand) in this integrated approach to education
program M&E. Training module content was aimed at providing step by step guidance on
designing and implementing M&E for education programs for District Education Office (DEO)
staff and School Supervisors. The 3-day training provided detailed information about how to
design and plan district approaches to M&E. This included development of questionnaires,
planning for field monitoring, data analysis, reporting and how to use monitoring results for
program improvement. (RE-TF activity)

46.      Implementation and Results of the Monitoring and Evaluation process. Following
the finalization of the education program specific M&E training module, demand driven training
was provided to those DEO’s requesting this training. Demand was not high and districts were
more focused on achievement in BEC strategic area training. To address this, the CPIU
facilitated a targeted session on the M&E system during the April 2011 CPIU hosted BEC
national coordination meeting in Jogjakarta. The aim of the session was to increase
understanding about the importance of M&E and district obligation with regard to the BOS
M&E approach (developed under DESP) as well as in education program service delivery.
While the M&E modules were socialized to all districts, utilization is uneven and data results
used to inform policy and budgetary decisions is also uneven. (RE-TF activity)




                                                 36
47.     Complaint Handling. The complaint handling system supports the Law 14/2008 on
Public Information and the implementation of Indonesia’s Open Government Action Plan 2012
within MoEC’s goals of promoting transparency, participation and accountability in the
implementation of the BOS program. Complaint handling relies on community participation to
provide feedback from beneficiaries in the field (community, schools, districts, and provinces,
central). It is also a mechanism to support transparency and participation in education service
delivery and effective/efficient governance. (BE-TF activity)

48.     The system was socialized to all districts and provinces, followed up by more in-depth
training at district level base on request. Advocacy for regulatory support to ensure sustainability
resulted in a ministerial regulation for BOS complaint handling. This regulation provides a guide
for district level teams about: (i) recording, reporting and resolving complaints received about
the BOS program and (ii) the ‘online’ and SMS system which ensures that any feedback to
questions, suggestions or complaints are handled efficiently, the issue addressed and
complainants receive timely feedback. The system regulates the flow of information so that
complaints are directed to the ‘right’ people; complaints are addressed/followed-up; action is
documented; and responses publicly accessible. This complaint handling mechanism enables all
levels of BOS management teams to record, report and respond to any feedback provided by
increased community involvement and communication, resolution of problems at district level
with results publicly accessible.

49.     Implementation of the complaint handling system. The complaint handling system
was nationally socialized to 497 districts and 33 provinces in the 5 regional coordination
workshops for BOS program hosted by MoEC and have been institutionalized by MoEC which
decided that regulatory functions should be added to 2013 BOS guidelines. This not only
simplified the process but ensured that complaint handling would be incorporated into BOS
procedures. The requirements provide a guide for district level teams about (i) recording,
reporting and resolving complaints received about the BOS program; and (ii) the ‘online’ and
‘SMS complaint handling system.

50.     All of key objectives for complaint handling were achieved: (i) informal coordination
discussions at central level have been held with MoEC’s Central BOS Management Team,
Directorate of Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Desa (PMD) of Ministry of Home Affair (MoHA) and
PNPM Generasi. A BEC-TF supported workshop in Surabaya focused on complementarities to
improve implementation and socialization of the system at all levels; (ii) a compliant handling
training module and ‘on-demand’ training; and (iii) discussions are underway to integrate a web-
based complaint handling system for the BOS program which links to SuMS – reinforcing
systems complementarities. Complaint handling is considered to be highly sustainable since it is
part of Law 14/2008 on Public Information and the implementation of Indonesia’s Open
Government Action Plan 2012. Moreover, it was developed in close consultation with GoI and
is integrated into web-based BOS transparency and accountability systems. Ten districts in five
provinces requested follow-on training following the introduction of Complaint Handling and
Resolution Standard Operating Procedures, based on those used for BOS during the January
Good Practice workshops. Four districts used L-BEC grants to fund the training; six were funded
by BEC-TF. 235 staff from the District Education Office, Sub-District Education Office and
school principals was trained.

51.    Sub-component. 3.2 Learning and Knowledge Sharing Systems. The objective of
Learning and Knowledge Sharing was to create ways to share the knowledge and learning about
good practices and make these accessible to all districts and schools. The activities are
summarized below.

52.      Tool for Reporting and Information Management by Schools (TRIMS). The TRIMS
is an evidence-based education policy instrument, introduced to all schools nationally in 2011 as
part of EMIS reforms to support reliable and timely data collection and reporting. The goal was
to: (i) strengthen information systems and develop the capacity of key stakeholders to collect,
analyze and use the resulting data for informed decisions on education policy and allocation of
resources; and (ii) improve governance (transparency and accountability) by increasing
availability and accessibility of education data and information. (BE-TF activity)

53.     TRIMS uses a standalone Excel-based application designed to link with national data
collection systems. 352 District trainers in 23 BEC districts and three non-BEC districts have
been trained and 4,993 schools have submitted valid data to districts using TRIMS. Piloting
occurred based on demand requests – several districts actively use the tool for information
management, others have also conducted training in schools to improve school data collection.
Papua Province has developed a five-year roadmap to implement TRIMS. They were supported
to modify the tool according to location (isolated, remote, sub-urban and urban zone) to address
the diversity of capacity and capability in the province.

54.     On demand, training was provided to schools and districts in the form of technical
assistance focused on improving organizational and institutional capacity in EMIS for improved
evidence based policy making, planning and budgeting. Districts financed training costs using
their own budget or L-BEC grant funds allocated specifically by them in their capacity
development plans for EMIS activities. This approach was aimed at creating districts awareness
about EMIS from the very beginning. The training materials were developed by the Bank team in
consultation with stakeholders and based on feedback from pilot activities.

55.      From the assessment to piloting TRIMS, the most challenging part has been convincing
district and MOEC partners in the District Provincial Implementation Units of the benefits of an
application such as TRIMS, designed to complement existing data collection mechanisms, not to
replace. TRIMS has reduced the time it takes to collect and report information from between 2 -
6 months to less than two months. This is a substantial achievement. Following pilots, the
Directorate SMP agreed to integrate TRIMS into the School Application Package (PAS). After
being socialized to all BEC districts on January 2012, various BEC districts requested additional
TRIMS training. There are now 23 BEC districts and 4 non-BEC districts that have allocated
budget for 2013 implementation, including its work plan, further, they have established an
accessible blog forum: forumstrims.blogspot.com, managed by the districts themselves, which
provides a way to access, share and discuss TRIMS related issues.

56.    WAPIK Program. To WAPIK was to create ways to share knowledge and learning
about good practices in teaching practice, education management and leadership and make these
accessible to all districts and schools (building on the work of UNICEF’s ‘Mainstreaming Good

                                               38
Practices Program which supported the collection and packaging of materials and information on
Good Practices and Good Practice Programs). WAPIK serves as a repository for educational
innovation at various levels of education service delivery. WAPIK evolved from the Good
Practices and Information Network – GPIN website which was initiated in 2010. The WAPIK is
used to enhance access to information to promote quality education by: (i) increasing access to
and building within the education community a platform/medium for sharing good practices; (ii)
strengthening the culture of good practice through identifying relevant examples,
developing/writing case studies for dissemination through the site; and (iii) establishing a
commitment to sharing good practices at the local as well as national level and sustaining the
website through GoI and Teacher Training Institute Regional Hubs. (BE-TF activity)

57.      The WAPIK team has provided ongoing technical assistance for the development of the
site and strategies to engage education practitioners to prepare publications for the site about
good practice innovations to which they have contributed or introduced: (i) 15 WAPIK training
workshops and dissemination activities for education practitioners and partners have been
conducted; (ii) 826 participants have been trained in how to access and use the site and to
prepare articles for uploading to the site; and (iii) a series of seminars to expose practitioners to
the site and its application/use was held for an additional 290 good practice practitioners.

58.    Social Marketing and Information Campaign (SMIC). BOS awareness-raising was
supported by the comprehensive SMIC survey funded under the DESP and included the
following activities: (i) national public service announcements; (ii) district events; and (iii)
school-level interventions. These activities were focused on increasing public knowledge of the
BOS national program. However, data from the SMIC survey revealed that that these
dissemination activities could be further strengthened. Recognizing the need to further increase
parent’s knowledge of the BOS program the government launched another socialization
campaign and provided districts with posters containing: (i) objectives of the BOS program (ii)
the amount of BOS received by all schools (iii) unit costs for students at the primary and junior
secondary levels of education; and (iv) description of the roles and responsibilities of school
committees and parents as they relate to the effective implementation of the BOS program.
(DESP supported activity)

59.    Bantu Sekolahku (Support My School, or SuMS). The objective of the Support My
School activity was to develop and deploy an online reporting system that allows members of the
public and the school/university community, as well as local government and MoEC personnel,
to report on critical needs within schools and universities, so that these needs can be
systematically recorded and resolved by the education system (including MoEC, provinces,
kabupaten, and schools/universities themselves). (BE-TF activity)

60.     This activity, a request from the MoEC, commenced when the Bank engaged in a process
of sharing with MoEC international best practices in using ICT and public participation to
increase transparency and accountability of the educational bureaucracy in responding to
schools’ infrastructural and human resource needs. In particular, the Bank team shared country
experiences of the ‘Check My School’ Initiative in the Philippines with a view to its possible
replication in Indonesia. Since its launch in December 11, 2012, Bantu Sekolahku has been
accessed by 4,293 users and over 1,000 unique needs have been reported. MoEC is slowly

                                                 39
beginning to use the SuMS. As of February 17, 2013, needs of schools related to reconstruction
and new buildings are those most reported (809), while needs related to students and funding
(e.g.: BOS and poor students funding) have been reported the least (45). Schools at SD level
have reported most needs (342), while SMKs are among the least to report needs. These statistics
indicate clearly that a major challenge remains to accelerate the rate of response by MoEC and
the wider education system in meeting reported needs. Thus, a critical focus for 2013 will be to
deepen awareness about and use of Bantu Sekolahku by education officials.

61.      Cancelled Activities. The Teacher Employment and Deployment activities under the
Dutch Education Support Program (DESP) were to be scaled up under SISWA so that BEC-TF
districts could pilot activities based on lessons learned. With the cancellation of SISWA this
activity was cancelled as it fell under another MoEC Directorate of Teacher and Education
Personnel. Likewise, the Student Assessment System – Indonesia National Assessment
Program (INAP) for Grades 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and pilot - were cancelled because INAP is not within
the Directorate of Primary and Junior Secondary Education’s mandate but it fell under the
responsibility of the National Education Assessment Centre (Pusat Penilaian Pendidikan –
PUSPENDIK). It was to be developed under BEC-TF within the context of a national SISWA
which was canceled.




                                              40
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic and financial analysis for the Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund (BEC-
TF) was not carried out at appraisal due to the fact the trust fund’s major investments did not
lend themselves to a standard value for money/efficiency analysis. Thus the economic and
financial analysis focuses not only on the efficiency of the funded interventions but more
importantly, on the potential impact that these activities have had on the changes in education
governance and management across the 50 BEC-TF districts between 2009 and 2012.

2.     The overall objective of the BEC-TF was to contribute to the GoI’s achievement of the
MDGs and EFA goals through good governance in education. The purpose of the program was
to support GoI in improving the delivery of decentralized basic education services by local
governments and schools in selected program areas, and by extension in other locations. Within
this context, the BEC-TF sought to strengthen the planning, budgeting, financial management
and accountability at the local level in order to reduce leakages, increase the efficiency of fund
usage, and improve the delivery of education services. The BEC-TF project also envisioned
developing a sound monitoring and evaluation system capable of providing relevant data to
guide and inform the decision-making process across the entire education system.

3.      As mentioned previously, the BEC-TF’s capacity building activities and technical
assistance supported national education programs such as the BOS-KITA. Since the BEC-TF
focused on building capacity at the district level while also supporting national programs which
aimed to impact higher order education outcomes, the ICR’s economic and financial analysis
provides an assessment of the following: (i) trends in key education indicators and internal
efficiency gains since the 2008 launch of the BEC-TF/BOS-KITA; (ii) unit cost analyses for the
BEC-TF’s main capacity building activities under components 2 and 3 for which comparable
data from other development partners are available; (iii) analysis of the changes in the quality of
education governance within the 50 districts targeted by the BEC-TF between 2007 and 2012;
and (iv) district sustainability plans following the completion of all BEC-TF supported
interventions. Changes in the quality of education governance and management are evaluated
based on the results from the Indonesian Local Education Governance Survey (ILEGS: 2009 and
2012) 20. The analysis focuses on five strategic areas covered by the BEC-TF project: Education
Service Provision Standards, Efficient Resource Use, Transparency and Accountability,
Management Control Systems, and Management Information Systems.

4.     Positive Trends in Key Education Indicators and Internal Efficiency Gains. The
BEC-TF was designed to support the GoI in achieving the MDG and EFA goals through (i) good
governance in education; and (ii) improving the delivery of decentralized basic education
services by local governments. The BOS 21 national program, which received direct financial

20
   Through the BEC-TF, a local government capacity assessment (LGCA) tool and an Indonesian Local Education Governance
Index (ILEGI) were designed to provide a coherent national monitoring and evaluation system of performance in education
governance and service provision within the 50 BEC-TF districts.
21
   In 2005, a school grants program, introduced in the wake of the financial crisis in 1997, was expanded and made available to
all primary and junior secondary schools. The program currently covers 228 thousand schools and 43 million students. The
national school grants program (Bantuan Operasional Sekolah - BOS) has been an important part of the government’s approach
to extending services to and providing protection to poor households. The key objectives of the BOS national program are to: (i)


                                                              41
support from the Bank’s BOS-KITA project and capacity building and technical assistance from
the BEC-TF program, has contributed to the positive gains observed within the education sector
between 2007 and 2012. As Table 1 illustrates, net and gross enrollment rates at the primary and
junior secondary levels of education increased between 2007 and 2012. The increases in net
enrollment rates at the junior secondary level are particularly large within the poorest income
quintile (rising from 53.03 percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012). Significant internal
efficiency gains have also been observed over the 2007 to 2012 period, evidenced by: (i)
increased completion rates at the primary and junior secondary levels; (ii) increased transition
rates from primary school to junior secondary school; (iii) reduced drop-out rates at the primary
and junior secondary levels; and (iv) reduced repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary
levels.

5.      Component 1—Policy Analysis and Dialogue aimed to: (i) develop, synthesize, and
disseminate sector knowledge and information; and (ii) facilitate consensus building on sector
issues, priorities, and investment strategies. Although it is not possible to quantify the direct

improve access to education by eliminating school fees for poor students and lowering fees for other students; (ii) enhance the
quality of education; and (iii) accelerate the achievement of nine years of mandatory schooling.

economic benefits generated by the outputs produced under this component, the analytical
studies carried out under the BEC-TF project informed the GoI’s RENSTRA and provided the
government with guidance on a number of strategic areas (education sector financing, teacher
management and upgrading, school-based management, skills development for increased
competitiveness, etc.). The studies commissioned under this component of the project have also
provided the GoI with a sound analytical basis to define and launch capacity building
interventions at the district level, while the Bank’s technical assistance supported the
development of financial management and data collection instruments currently being used by
local governments across the 50 BEC-TF supported districts. The BEC-TF project has supported
the development of monitoring and evaluations systems capable of providing relevant data to
guide and inform the decision-making process across the education system. Although it is not
possible to quantify the economic benefit generated by these studies, the BEC-TF has been
instrumental in providing the evidenced-based research needed to inform the government’s
efforts at increasing the efficiency and equity of education services.

6.       Unit Costs of Capacity Building Activities funded by BEC-TF 22. Component 2—Good
Governance, Financial Management, Budgeting and Accountability sought to improve
governance and efficient resource use by providing targeted training in financial management.
The BEC-TF project provided financial management, good governance and accountability
training to 50,105 local education staff at an average cost of US$62 per person 23. The unit costs
associated with this capacity building activity are comparable to those charged by USAID,
AusAID, and UNICEF for a similar intervention. The project also trained 13,274 local education
staff in performance-based budgeting and planning at an average cost of US$65 per
beneficiary 24. Again, the unit costs for this three-day activity are in line with the fees charged by
USAID, AusAID, and UNICEF for an equivalent training program 25. Under Component 3—
Information Management, 2,422 education staff received a three-day course on the use of
financial data to improve the efficiency of fund allocation/use at an average cost of US$82 per
person 26. Although no comparable financial data from other donor-funded activities are available
for this particular activity, feedback from the districts suggested the training provided was highly
relevant and comprehensive.

7.     Changes in the Quality of Education Governance. The Indonesian Local Education
Governance Survey (ILEGS) is the most comprehensive and robust data source to compare
changes in the quality of education governance within the 50 districts targeted by the BEC-TF.
The baseline and end-line surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Key findings
from each of the five strategic pillars (Education Service Provision Standards, Efficient Resource

22
   Based on the availability of financial data, the analysis covers the main capacity building activities under Component 2 (Good
Governance, Financial Management, Budgeting and Accountability) and Component 3 (Information Management) of the BEC-
TF project.

   The unit cost of capacity building activities tend to be relatively uniform across the various development agencies operating in
Indonesia because the government typically establishes a price ceiling (or “standard price?) which must be complied with by all
development agencies.

Use, Transparency and Accountability, Management Control Systems, and Management
Information Systems) included in the ILEGS are presented below. It is not possible to directly
attribute the changes in education governance and management to the BEC-TF program. This is
primarily because the system-wide changes observed within the education sector could also be
the result of other capacity building activities supported by the GoI and/or other development
partners during the same period. Nevertheless, the ILEGS represents the most systematic
assessment of the changes observed in education governance and management within the 50
BEC-TF districts.

8.      Education Service Provision Standards. Education service provision standards within
the 50 districts receiving BEC-TF support have improved from 2009 to 2012. This has been the
result of general improvements in access as well as the quality of key personnel in the education
system. For example, the proportion of supervisors, school principals and teachers with a four-
year university degree has increased over the three years. This is largely the result of the
continued implementation of the national teacher certification program. The program has
motivated teachers to obtain a university degree in order to be certified and obtain a professional
allowance equivalent to their basic pay.

9.      Efficient Resource Use. The BEC-TF capacity development support in the areas of good
governance, financial management, budgeting and accountability have contributed to
improvements in the efficiency of fund usage among the 50 targeted districts. Over the life of
the project, local governments have registered important gains in the processes which determine
how public resources are used. Results from the Indonesian Local Education Governance Survey
(ILEGI) indicate that the number of district education offices providing progress reports on their
activity plans have increased during the project. Improvements in the local planning and
budgeting processes are also been observed. More specifically, the proportion of districts that set
budget priorities and ceilings before sector offices (e.g. the education office) start their own
planning exercises increased from 44 to 74 percent between 2009 and 2012. The number of
BEC-TF supported districts with improved education budget execution rates have also increased
from 31 to 44 over the life of the project. While some of these efficiency gains may have been
the result of the central government efforts at introducing medium-term expenditure
frameworks 27, the BEC-TF program’s capacity building activities related to performance-based
budgeting, planning, and execution have also been important in this process.

10.     Reduced Financial Leakage. Prior to the launch of the BEC-TF and BOS-KITA
projects in 2008, the first Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS1) found that
approximately 70 percent of funds allocated by all levels of Government reached the school. By
2012, nearly 90 percent of the total funds disbursed by all levels of Government were received
by schools 28. These lower levels of financial leakage within the education system are in part a
result of the Government of Indonesia’ overall efforts at strengthening external and internal audit
systems, as well as the BOS-KITA/BEC-TF’s increased focus on improving financial
27
   Efforts to ensure better local resource management were embodied in the 2003 state finance law that started implementation in
2006. In particular, the law introduced medium term expenditure frameworks into local planning and budgeting. This represented
a shift from earlier annual input based budgeting to a medium term planning horizon with a focus on the expected outputs of
planning and budgeting decisions.

                                                              44
management, transparency and accountability at the local level. The BOS Operations Manual—
which was updated and revised throughout the life of the BOS-KITA project—played a key role
in minimizing the misuse of funds at the school level by: (i) clearly stipulating eligible and
ineligible expenditures categories; (ii) strengthening financial disclosure and reporting
requirements; and (iii) mandating community oversight of fund usage. It is also important to
highlight that all BEC-TF Audit Reports were Unqualified, providing further evidence that no
systemic financial issues were identified within the 50 BEC-TF districts.

11.     Transparency and Accountability. Improvements in transparency and accountability
across the 50 BEC-TF districts are also evident between 2009 and 2012. Improvements are seen
most clearly in efforts by local governments to encourage greater community participation in
decision making and oversight activities. Between 2009 and 2012 the proportion of districts that
allowed public participation in parliamentary accountability and audit reporting sessions
increased from 14 percent to 52 percent. Similar improvements in access were seen in the
number of districts allowing public access to budget sessions in local parliaments.
Improvements were also seen in the reporting procedures of local education offices. In 2012,
nearly all of the district education officers were producing and making available progress reports
on planned activities and budget disbursements.

12.      Management Control Systems. While service standards and measures of transparency
and accountability have been improving within the 50 districts receiving BEC-TF support, the
management control systems component of the ILEGI has declined. Efforts by local
governments to systematically document and catalogue good practice seem to have weakened
between 2009 and 2012. In 2009, two-thirds of districts made efforts to identify and document
good practice, whereas in 2012 less than half of all participating districts systematically carried
out this activity. This is of concern given the importance that local solutions play in improving
the quality of education and the potential benefit of disseminating best practices across the
districts supported by the BEC-TF project.

13.     Management Information Systems. Important gains have also been observed in the
process of collecting, managing, and analyzing data at the local level between 2009 and 2012.
The School Application Package (PAS) and the Tool for Reporting and Information
Management (TRIMS) 29 have provided schools and local education offices with a template to
collect and store relevant data which can subsequently be used to inform and guide the decision-
making process at the local level. While the data collection process has improved during the life
of the BEC-TF project, additional support must be provided to districts in order to ensure that the
gathered information is used to inform the strategic choice of interventions pursued at the local
level.




29
  The Tool for Reporting and Information Management by Schools (TRIMS)—an evidence-based instrument developed under
the BEC-TF program—was introduced to all schools nationally in 2011. TRIMS aims to: (i) strengthen information systems and
develop the capacity of key stakeholders to collect, analyze and use the resulting data for informed decisions on education policy
and allocation of resources; and (ii) improve governance (transparency and accountability) by increasing availability and
accessibility of education data and information.


                                                               45
14.     Financial Sustainability of BEC-TF supported Activities. By project closing, 40 out of
the 50 districts targeted by the BEC-TF project had developed post-project sustainability plans
focused on improving the delivery of decentralized basic education services and improving
student learning outcomes. The majority of districts have mobilized funds to continue and
strengthen the following interventions/activities: (i) EMIS, including the BEC-TF supported
TRIMS; (ii) Education Service Provision Standards, including teacher upgrading and
competency-based curriculum development; (iii) Financial Management Systems, including
performance-based budgeting and planning, asset management, efficient resource use and
procurement policies, procedures and controls; (iv) School-Based Management Training,
including school committee development and community involvement programs; and (v) Reform
to District Education Policies and Regulations, including strengthening the BOSDA
Improvement Program 30 and creating incentive schemes to encourage the deployment of qualified
teachers to underserved provinces/districts in Indonesia.




30
   The BOSDA Improvement Program was initially piloted in two provinces and 12 districts. The main objective of the pilot was
to support regional governments in their efforts to narrow financing inequalities and improve both the efficiency and
effectiveness of education spending. The pilot focused on BOSDA allocations and aimed to: (i) improve current BOSDA
allocation criteria to address financing inequalities between schools; and (ii) create incentives for better school performance and
encourage more effective, transparent, and participatory school-based management involving all education stakeholders.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


 I.         Operation’s Objective

1.     The main goal of the Basic Education Capacity Program (BEC-TF) is to support the
Government of Indonesia to improve the overall quality of education as set out in the National
Education Strategic Plan through three main priorities: improving access, quality and governance
of education.

2.      In particular the BEC-TF aims to support the government in improving major issues such
as: (a) the lack of transparency and accountability in the financial management system; (b) the
development of a medium-term framework based financial management; (c) education reform
that includes management, planning, and financial management education; (d) implementation of
quality basic education; and (e) review of the Regional Education Funding Allocation.

3.          The expected output of the program includes:
       i.   Strengthening the capacity of the thematic dialogue and education stakeholders and other
            institutions related to education in developing and analyzing policies related to the
            development and implementation of basic education.
      ii.   Strengthening the management efficiency and resource utilization through the
            implementation of transparency and accountability, improving the quality of the
            education budget allocation process based on performance, improved financial
            management and accounting, particularly at local government level.
  iii.      Strengthening the capacity of the management information systems and performance
            evaluation of existing systems to increase effectiveness in supporting the accuracy and
            precision of the data and information available to all stakeholders at all levels/tiers.

II.         Design

4.          There are three components of the BEC program:
            - Component 1: Policy Analysis and Dialogue (under the World Bank executed
               project)
             - Component 2: Good Governance, Financial Management, Budgeting and
               Accountability
            - Component 3: Management of Information.

5.     Components 2 and 3 are managed by the Government of Indonesia through the Ministry
of Education and Culture’s Directorate of Junior Secondary Education.

6.          The GoI-executed BEC program consists of four types of activities:
      i.    Capacity Building. The program included capacity strengthening activities for targeted
            grant recipients at district level in education governance and management. This capacity
            building has taken place through various training activities and workshops, regular
            coordination meetings and support activities, study visits to good practice districts,
            international seminars and training, and other related activities.

                                                   51
 ii.    Local Government (L-BEC) Grants. Grants provided to districts to fund the
        implementation of activities identified in district Capacity Development Plans (CDP).
 iii.   Facilitation of the Good Practices Pilot Program. The program was intended to facilitate
        the implementation of a pilot program focused on good practices in several districts and
        selected schools.
 iv.    Thematic Dialogue Education at the Central level. The program was linked to supporting
        Component 1 activities under the World Bank executed project focused on the
        implementation of thematic dialogue on education policy at central level.
  v.    L-BEC grants to districts were designed to be used in three ways as funding for (i)
        Capacity enhancement; (ii) Good practice piloting; and (iii) Knowledge sharing activities.

7.      Capacity Enhancement Grants. These grants were awarded to 50 targeted districts to
fund strategically identified local capacity building activities in each district listed in CDPs
which were developed based on strategic district plans (RENSTRA). In project design, the
amount of grant given to each district was Rp 2.5 billion rupiah over a three year period.

8.       Pilot Program for Good Practices Grants. Pilot program grants were awarded to
districts that successfully implemented the educational capacity building activities stated in
CDPs. These grants were awarded to districts and school selected as an incentive to recognize
the success achieved. The amount of grants awarded varied according to needs identified by each
district. The initial design was focused on good practices linked to BEC’s five strategic programs
which were closely related to the project’s Key Performance Indicators (KPI) which aimed to
strengthen the programs developed by the district. Some of the selected programs focused on
Performance Based Budgeting, Asset management and Complaint Handling. The program took
place in six districts and 30 schools. At Central level, the CPIU designed the approach used to
support these districts during several workshops convened to design and develop the good
practice programs.

9.      Knowledge Sharing Grants. These grants were awarded to five government institutions
at the central, provincial and district. Several workshops were conducted to develop the design
approach, implementation mechanisms and strategies. Knowledge sharing is an important
component in the implementation of the BEC program so that knowledge about educational
programs that have been successfully implemented by district is shared and districts encouraged
to network.

10.     BEC-TF District Targeting and Selection. The selection of the 50 participating districts
in the project was targeted. This occurred in two phases: Phase 1 involved statistical analysis of
434 districts using criteria related to: Transition Rates at Primary and Junior Secondary levels,
National Examination scores, Poverty Index, percent budget allocated by the District for the
Education Fund and Education Budget (excluding salaries). Districts were ranked based on this
analysis into three classifications -- Low capacity (red); Moderate capacity (yellow); and High
capacity (green). 77 districts were short-listed and identified as potential beneficiaries to
participate in the BEC project.
11.     Phase 2 involved the final selection of 50 districts from the short-list of 77. Criteria for
selection related to: District commitment to provide local education budget from the total district
budget (the percentage of the education budget, non-salary allocations, the allocation of:

                                                52
education funds, funds for school construction and rehabilitation, funds for the welfare of
teachers, fund for the professional development to improve teacher quality, local government
education regulations (number of existing regulations and the quality of regulations) and the
scope and quality of the education program. Using these criteria, districts were re-categorized as
red, yellow or green. 11 districts were categorized as red (low), 20 as yellow (moderate) and 19
as green (high).

  III.   Implementation

12.     Implementing Organization. The Implementing agency in the Ministry of Education
and Culture was the BEC-TF program was the Secondary Education Directorate under the
Director General of Basic Education. A Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) was
established to manage all aspects of project implementation. The CPIU was responsible for the
coordination and consultation with the Program Steering Committee whose members included
Echelon 1 and Program Coordination Management Unit members from Echelon 2 in the Central
Planning Agency (Bappenas), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Religious Affairs and the
Ministry of Education and Culture.

13.     Role of CPIU. CPIU’s role and function focused on coordination, facilitation, mentoring
and problem solving during project and district preparation, implementation, evaluation and
reporting, and, coordination between line ministries and the World Bank, provincial and district.
Facilitation included the development of guidelines, manuals and modules related to the
implementation of activities, facilitation action plan preparation, verification of documents,
disbursement of grants and preparation of reports. The CPIU also provided assistance and acted
as resource persons to districts during the delays associated with the new On-granting fund
mechanism and the implementation of the capacity building activities. The CPIU also conducted
monitoring and evaluation activities up to 1-3 times each year.

14.   At district level, the District Education Office established a District Program
Implementation Unit (DPIU).

15.    Role of DPIU. The DPIU was responsible for coordination, implementation and
consultation with the District Steering Committee whose members included the district planning
agency (Bappeda), Finance Office (DP2KAD), Ministry of Religious Affairs and the District
Education Office. It had a role in implementing and monitoring CDPs and ongoing coordination
with CPIU, MOF, District Steering Committee and coordination with related district units such
as Bappeda, DP2KAD, Ministry of Religious Affairs, etc.).

16.    Development of Modules and Guidelines. Education governance and modules and BEC
guidelines were developed in close consultation with the World Bank team. The materials were
developed through a comprehensive process of consultations with stakeholders through
workshops.
These included:
    - Capacity Development Planning Guidelines
    - Education Public Expenditure Analysis Training Module
    - L-BEC Manual Guidelines

                                               53
   -   Five strategic Area Training Modules: Transparency and Accountability, Management
       Control Systems, Efficient Resource Use, Management Information Systems, Education
       Service Provision Standards
   -   Asset Management Guidelines
   -   Performance Based Budgeting Guidelines
   -   Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines
   -   Gender Training Module.

17.    All BEC districts participated in training conducted by CPIU and World Bank BEC-TF
teams. Initial training in CDP planning, EPEA, the five strategic areas and other modules was
supported by Service Providers recruited during the 18 month delay to L-BEC funds being
released.

18.     L-BEC Grant. The total L-BEC grant to each district was for a total of Rp 2.5 billion.
These funds were earmarked to implement capacity building activities identified by districts over
the expected three years of implementation (stipulated CDPs). At the commencement of the
project, the 50 districts signed a Grant Agreement (NPPH) between the Director General of
Fiscal Balance, MOF with each district Mayor in November 2009. At the commencement of the
project, On-Granting Agreement (NPPH) was signed between the Minister of Finance c.q.
Director General of Fiscal Balance, MOF and each district Mayor in November 2009.

19.     Given the range of capacity identified during district selection, each district had differing
capability to implement activities which impacted on grant absorption capacity. The total L-BEC
grant for the 50 districts was Rp 125 billion. Over the three years (2010 – 2012) the total amount
in grants disbursed by MOF to district was Rp. 113,312,158,317 (90.65 percent of the total
allocated). The total amount absorbed by districts was Rp. 111,714,407,976 (89.37 percent of the
total disbursed by MOF).

20.    Grant Mechanism. At design, grant disbursement was to be under the Ministry of
National Education’s Block Grant mechanism. This mechanism was superseded by the Minister
of Finance’s Regulation No. 168/PMK.07/2008 on regional grants and PMK No.
169/PMK.07/2008 which specified new requirements administered through the MOF about
procedures for distributing grants to local governments. Based on districts’ proposal approved by
Minister of Education and Culture at first, MOF verified completeness and validity of attached
document submitted by districts before giving approval to disburse grant to districts. MOF
disbursed grant to districts in advance before implementation of activities conducted by districts.
However, during final stage of grant disbursement, grant transferred to districts through pre-
financing mechanism where districts financed their activities first before reimbursed by MOF.
The grant mechanism to districts is detailed in the flow chart below.




                                                 54
21.      Counterpart Funds. In the implementation of activities the CPIU and districts provided
matching funds sourced from national and regional budgets to aid the implementation of
operational activities at district level. The amount of matching funds provided by CPIU
amounted to Rp 24,461,404,000. These funds were used for coordination, facilitation, study
visits, mentoring, monitoring and evaluation. The amount of matching funds provided by each
district varied according to the budget capacity of each district – this ranged between 2 percent –
25 percent from the total L-BEC budget. The total value amounted to Rp 15,717,413,443 over
the three years of the project.

22.     Implementation Strategy to build Basic Education Capacity. The strategy designed to
build district capacity in education service delivery included CPIU support to empower districts
to conduct and sustain ongoing capacity building activities. Capacity was built through a series
of capacity building activities such as: CPIU convened training and workshops; training
conducted by other relevant, locally identified training institutions; comparative studies about
education programs successfully developed and implemented in other countries and districts. As
well, districts were supported to source resource persons to provide additional technical advisory
expert support to facilitate the implementation of CDP activities. The content of some of these
training and support activities were focused on education governance, management, and
improvement in education service delivery.

23.      Capacity Development Plans (CDPs). The implementation of capacity building
activities in districts commenced with the development of CDPs which were prepared by each
district during a consultative process which involved relevant stakeholders (District Secretary,
Mayor’s Office, BAPPEDA, Local Parliament, DINAS, Representatives of the Ministry of
Religious Affairs, Education Council, Board of Education, School representatives). The CDP
developed reflected the analysis undertaken to identify the specific problems faced by each
district and their priority needs. Each plan was approved by the District Mayor and supported
                                                55
district strategic plans (which consisted of the district 3 year comprehensive plan and annual
plans).

24.    Capacity Development Activities districts. The ten highest priority activities identified
by districts in their CDPs and implemented during the project were in the form of training,
workshops and technical guidance. These are listed below:

  (1) Education Public Expenditure Analysis
  (2) Asset Management
  (3) Developed School Planing and Budgeting
  (4) Financial Management
  (5) Education Data Collection on district and School level
  (6) School-Based Management
  (7) Stengthening on Curriculum Development
  (8)  Local Regulation/District regulation/Major Regulation on Education
  (9) Training for Teachers
 (10) Study Visits to good practice districts: Gorantalo, Jembrana, Sleman.

25.     Evaluation of the implementation of these activities, as linked to the five strategic areas
of education governance and management, showed that the highest percentage of activities
related to Education Management Control Systems (29.9 percent) with Transparency and
Accountability (28.9 percent) a close second. Education Service Provision Standards (17.2
percent), Management Information Systems (14.5 percent) and Efficient Resource Use (9.5
percent).

26.     District Achievements. Achievements are quite diverse and vary according to the
number and type of activities carried out by each district and district contextual considerations
(location, date of establishment, economy, etc.). Notable achievements include improved
understanding and expertise in financial management at DINAS as well as school levels;
Improved understanding and skills in planning and budget documents and reports at both levels;
Improved school asset management; Development of the School Planning and Budgeting plans
(RKS and RKAS); Development of Education Law and Decrees at district level; Improved
documentation and data collection at school level.

27.      Grant for Piloting. The Grant pilot program was planned to be given to the district as an
incentive for the achievement of the performance of the implementation of capacity building
activities. With the 18 month delay to the project, this was cancelled, as there remained only
limited time to fully implement district CDPs. Following Management Committee consultations,
it was agreed by the Donor, MOEC and the World Bank to cancel this activity.

28.     Grant knowledge Sharing. Knowledge sharing grants were planned to be given to
Districts that established a good practice learning resource center. This was also cancelled due to
the constraints mentioned in 10 above. The Good Practices Information Network developed
through a UNICEF initiative had also been expanded under the World Bank executed Trust
Fund. This provided a mechanism to collect and share good practices in education with
education stakeholders through the WAPIK website. The University of Surabaya was engaged to

                                                56
support the establishment of regional centers to sustain and continuously improve WAPIK
through teacher training institutes. As well, the Directorate of Junior Secondary Education has
plans to integrate relevant parts of WAPIK into planned good practice initiatives within MOEC.

29.     Grant Disbursement. From the total allocation grant provided by donor, CPIU was not
able to spend all budget allocated both in total also in each category due to the delay of L-BEC
Implementation and no procourement for service provider. The highest procentages of grant
disbursement was spent under category L-BEC Grant (12.452.210.84 USD) and the lowest was
under category Goods (103.347,40 USD). The disbursement by category is detailed in the Table
below.

30.     Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the
grant program L-BEC to the district occurred up to three times each year. M & E teams included
representatives from MOEC and MOF. MORA was also invited to participate. Review activities
highlighted successes and ongoing challenges and constraints for districts. Review teams
provided ongoing support to the district during and in follow-up to monitoring activities.

31.      Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Based on the evaluation and data collection from 50
districts done by CPIU and WB, most of the districts have been achieved the KPI both for
general indicator and specific indicator. The minimum achievement of the districts was 27
percent between the target and the actual and the maximum was achieved 100 percent.

32.     Constraints and Issues. The project faced a number of implementation problems which
resulted in significant implementation challenges through the life of the project. These include:

        -      Grant mechanism changes: Due to the delays associated with the new On-granting
               Regulation (No. PMK. No. 168 and PMK. 169) Districts did not receive grants until the
               project half-way point in October 2010. The new regulation meant that grant funds were
               transferred from the MOEC DIPA to the MOF DIPA. This involved the establishment of
               new standard operating procedures in MOF which were determined by three Directorates
               General: Budget, Fiscal Balance and Treasury.
        -      Districts especially district treasuries have lack of understanding on on-granting
               mechanism even though awareness activities already conducted by MOF many times. At
               that time, they only acknowledged and used to understand that grant transferred from
                                                                                             57
       central government to districts determined by Minister of Finance Decree (PMK) not
       through On-Granting Agreement. L-BEC grant was the first grant project using on-
       granting mechanism. Therefore, district treasuries were hard to include L-BEC grant into
       local budget. Moreover, even though some template of documents required applying for
       transfer of grant obviously attached in PMK 169 they still got confused. It made districts
       often failed to fulfill correctness and completeness of document needed. These
       circumstances made grant disbursement to districts took much longer time.
   -   Ministry of Finance requirements were not well known in the districts. For example, the
       mechanism to apply for the transfer of grant funds from the MOF budget to the District
       budget was not well socialized. This meant that the District Treasury may have not
       included the grant into district DIPAs and at central level the approval of the annual L-
       BEC grant budget (DIPA-HPD) was posponed/delayed. In real terms, activity
       implementation was severely limited to around 17 months: Year 2010: 3 months, Year
       2011: 6 months and Year 2012: 8 months.
   -   MOF documentation requirements for grant withdrawal and disbursement was generally
       perceived by districts as too complicated and difficult to complete. This was an iterative
       procedure which had to be completed at the end of each cycle of fund use before the next
       tranche of funds could be disbursed.
   -   The process of the submission, verification and disbursement of grants ranged from 1
       week up to 3 months depending on the completeness of the documents submitted by the
       district. This meant that significant, additional CPIU support was needed to facilitate the
       districts to meet MOF requirements.
   -   Districts reported that there was lack of coordination between the DPIU and the Treasury
       Office (DP2KAD). This resulted in incomplete documentation as both did not have a
       comprehensive understanding of the MOF requirements.
   -   Lack of direct assistance by the CPIU to support districts to implement CDPs. Service
       Providers were initially planned to support districts with the technical advisory help
       needed to fulfill CDPs. When grant funds were released Service Providers were not
       procured.
   -   High staff turnover within DPIUs (and districts) meant that during implementation
       capacity building activities had to be replicated up to 2-5 times.
   -   The lack of resource personnel with the necessary technical expertise in education
       management and governance at district level meant that districts did not have the level of
       technical support to fully implement CDPs.

33.    Sustainability Program. CPIU have allocated 2013 budget to support district
commitment described in Sustainability Plans. All BEC districts have developed sustainability
plans for relevant BEC activities and have allocated budget in draft budget planes in 2013 and
beyond.

IV.    Operational Experiences

34.   From design to completion, the BEC project was subjected to approximately 12 different
changes from 2008 - 2012. These include:




                                               58
35.    Changes in BEC-TF Program Design. The design of the BEC-TF, sponsored by the
European Commission and the Dutch government with the World Bank as Trustee was to initiate
an Education Sector Wide Approach through a Systems Improvement through a Sector Wide
Approach initiative called SISWA. During inception, the SISWA was cancelled and the GoI-
executed project changed to one focused on Good Governance, Financial Management,
Budgeting and Accountability and improved local government service delivery. This change
influenced district perception and loss of confidence in the program.

36.    Changed Program Implementation Approach from financial management to
education governance and management. The design approach was not explicitly linked to
education at district level which was reflected in the Key Performance Indicators in the program
document. To ensure a focus on education service delivery improvement within the scope of
responsibility of MOEC and the DINAS the KPIs were adjusted. This meant that the original
approach which was based on a 5 pillars of financial management was modified so that they
became 5 strategic areas of education governance and management. This resulted in significant
confusion at district level where DPIU program managers had been socialized into the 5 pillar
approach which influenced the activities identified in CDPs.

37.      Changes in District Categories Education Capacity into "Red-Yellow-Green".
Targeted district selection involved categorization by CPIU based on existing education
statistical data and used as the basis for BEC TF intervention activities -- preliminary results
based on statistical data were Red: 11 districts, Yellow: 20 districts and Green: 19 districts. As
part of project design, a Local Governance Capacity Assessment Survey was also planned to
provide district classifications according to the five strategic areas of education governance and
management. This survey (which was conducted after project implementation) provided a
different result as it was based on the 5 strategic areas -- Red: 20 districts, Yellow: 27 districts
and Green: 3 districts. This caused some confusion and disappointment by districts previously
categorized under a different mechanism and required additional relationship management
support as a result to manage expectations.

38.      Changes in GoI Fund Channeling Mechanisms. The initial design occurred at a time
when MONE were able to disburse grants to district governments under an ‘old’ block grant
mechanism. This was superseded by a new regulation which was administered by MOF (PMK
No. 168 on Regional Grants and PMK No.169 on Grant Distribution procedures). The change
resulted in an almost 18 month span of time before standard operating procedures were in place
which enabled the grants to be disbursed to districts through MOF procedural requirements.
BEC-TF became the very first project to be implemented with On-Granting mechanism and
lesson to be learned for the new on-granting procedure (which has since been modified based on
the lessons learned in the BEC-TF). This further exacerbated loss of confidence in the project by
districts and resulted in major input by CPIU and World Bank teams to support districts that had
used some of their own budget to implement activities on the basis of expected L-BEC funds.

39.     Changes in L-BEC Grant Agreement. At the outset, the legality of awarding grants
to local districts conducted by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU between
the Directorate General of Primary Education, Ministry of Education and Culture at Regent /
Mayor and Chairman of the Parliament as a witness). Due to changes in the use of regional

                                                59
grants mechanism, it was necessary to replace the legal document using a on-granting Agreement
(NPPH) between the Minister of Finance c.q. Director General of Fiscal Balance, MOF with the
Regent / Mayor.

40.     During implementation, MOF had to facilitate two addenda to the MOU (NPPH). One
related to the cancellation of grant penalties and one the second relating to Pre-financing during
the final stages of the project.

41.    Changes in L-BEC Grant Manual. In order to facilitate the implementation of the use
of grant funds at the district, the CPIU developed guidelines about grant use. This was approved
by the World Bank in a No Objection Letter (NOL). The L-BEC Manual became the operations
manual for districts for the project. Guidelines were adjusted four times during implementation
due to issues that arose and various policy changes. The changes related to the On-granting
mechanism; changes from 5 pillars to 5 strategic areas; taxation; re-payments/refunds associated
with audit findings through BPKP; and Bank Interest on L-BEC grant funds.

42.     Changes in District Technical Assistance. In order to achieve the performance of the
BEC program, the implementation of the annual plan and the comprehensive plan detailed in the
CDP, CPIU planned to provide guidance to the respective district by providing a
consultant/service provider over the 3 year project implementation period (2010, 2011 and
2012). However, this did only took place in 2010 when CPIU sent Consultants to the districts to
train them in the 5 strategic area modules over a three month period from October to December
2010. In 2011 and 2012 there was no assistance provided through Service Providers due the
lengthy mechanism for procurement of service providers. Districts were encouraged by CPIU
and World Bank teams to hire local experts as resource personnel.

43.     Staffing changes: central and DPIU staff rotations and promotions. During the life of
the project due to normal staff rotations and promotions there were several changes:
   (i) The CPIU Program Manager position was rotated during the second half of project
        implementation.
   (ii) DPIU staff rotations and promotions in most districts (up to 2 – 5 occurrences in each
        district) This resulted in increased workload for CPIU staff as new staff required
        induction into the BEC project and training and capacity building necessary to implement
        CDPs developed prior to their commencement.

44.     Change of CDP Activities. Three year CDP activities were designed well before grant
funds were available. Under the conditions of the grant there was only limited flexibility to
adjust the activities to meet current district priorities. However, any changes to the CDP could
not take place without prior approval from CPIU which reduced the flexibility of the BEC-TF
approach which was meant to be responsive to emerging needs.

45.     Changes in Project Budget Allocations by Category. Finance categories in the
Project’s Administrative Agreement between the donors and the World Bank (as Trustees)
designated the Finance Categories under which BEC-TF resources could be allocated. A budget
breakdown by cost category was specified. Any re-allocations across categories required the
Bank to consult with Donors when proposed reallocations exceeded, cumulatively: (a) 10 percent

                                               60
of the amount of the Grant Funds allocated to any of the categories of consultants’ services, L-
BEC grants; or (b) 20 percent of the amount of Grant Funds allocated to any of the categories of
studies, surveys, workshops and in-country training; overseas training and study tours.

46.     In practice, from the GoI perspective in the context of the challenges associated with the
18 month L-BEC grant delay this resulted in difficulties when project activities were advanced to
sustain district momentum while they were waiting for funds to flow. A high number of activities
were conducted by CPIU during this time which meant that funds within categories were
expended much earlier than anticipated. This meant that there were only limited funds available
for workshops and training when L-BEC grants were disbursed. The Government's proposed
changes to the re-allocation of grant categories was lengthy due to the limitations of the
Administrative Agreement even though the change required was considered small -- from EUR
775 000 to EUR 2.405 million.

47.    Changes in Closing date of program implementation – project extension to
December 2012. In accordance with the Grant Agreement (GA) signed between the Government
of Indonesia and the World Bank, the BEC program was scheduled to finish at the end of April
2012. However due to the extensive delays to the project the CPIU was supported by the Bank
and donors to apply for project extension to December 2012.

48.    Changes in Number of Total Grant. Because of the crisis in Europe in 2011, the Dutch
government cut their contribution to the BEC-TF grant by EUR 8.9 million. The cut was made
to the GoI-executed project which reduced the total grant from EUR 25,618,000 to EUR
16,918,000.

49.    GoI had proposed that the cut be proportionally divided between the GoI executed Trust
Fund and the World Bank executed Trust Fund. However, following Management Committee
meeting discussions with stakeholders it was agreed that the cut would come from a Category of
the GoI-executed Trust Fund allocated for Consultant services.

50.     Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives. In general,
the expected outcome of the program had been achieved by implementing activities training and
workshops related with componen 1, 2 and 3 of the BEC program both in central and district
level. To achieve of Componen 2, CPIU and 50 districts had been developed training and
workshops related with governance and efficient resource use, transparency, accountability,
budget processes and performance based financing, financial management and accounting. While
for achievement of componen 3, number of training and workshops had been developed related
with improving and strengthening of the existing information and performance system to provide
accurate data and information. The summary of achievement outcome of Component 1, 2 and 3
in the tabel below.

 V.    Evaluation of the Borrower Performance

51.    Section IV provides a detailed overview of borrower implementation activities,
challenges and performance.

52.     In implementing the program, the government was not required to deal directly with
donor agencies as the World Bank was the appointed Trustee. However, the government
participated in all Management Committee meetings and consulted openly with donors about
implementation progress, challenges/problems and opportunities. Technically and substantively,
the donors did not intervene but were available to fully support the project during all stages of
implementation.

53.    Project implemention challenges as a result of the 18 month delay in fund disbursement
demanded a flexible and responsive approach to the problems faced by districts and to maintain
their motivation and enthusiasm for the project generated through the targeting process.

54.      Examples of specific CPIU interventions include: (i) district consultation clinics to
mentor and coach districts to address implemention problems and challenges; and, (ii) the series
of discussions between MoF, MoRA, BPKP and the World Bank to discuss ways to support
districts to address various audit findings and act on/resolve recommendations. This resulted in
improved audit findings in the following year.

55.     At central and district operational levels, grants provided by donors that are allocated by
category limit the way these funds can be utilized to meet emerging needs. Often projects are
designed some years before implementation and the dynamics of the context of situation change
during that period. The limitations described by rigid budget classifications and reallocation
limitations across categories in Administrative Agreement may have been ameliorated by a
different approach to the way the budget was allocated across project components. The
government proposed a revised budget per category to the World Bank, but the Administrative
Agreement limited the amounts per category which could be re-allocated. It is suggested that
future projects of this nature should provide funds in the form of block grants which reflect ‘real
world/actual’ not perceived requirements.

56.     MoEC’s ability to engage effectively with key stakeholders was limited as project budget
allocations did not include a dedicated budget to support their involvement, particularly for other
necessary Basic Education Directorate staff, and key staff from MoF and MoRA.

 VI.    Evaluation of World Bank Performance

57.    The World Bank as Trustee for the implementation of the GoI-executed BEC program is
considered to be cooperative in carrying out activities in the form of co-ordination, facilitation

and problem solving the problems and constraints faced by the government. Overall cooperative
relationships between the Government and the World Bank went well and smoothly, each has a
strong commitment to the implementation and success of the BEC. In its capacity as Trustee, the
World Bank’s obligations to the donor were specified in legal agreements.

58.     However it was not clear to the Government how the World Bank executed Trust Fund
project related to the GoI executed Trust Fund although during the Management Committee
meetings detailed progress reports and work plans were provided for both GoI and World Bank
Trust Funds.

59.    It is suggested that future projects should be in the form of a single grant so that all
stakeholders are fully aware of the inter-relationship between projects.

 VII. Proposed arrangements for future operations of the project

60.    Future design should be the result of comprehensive discussions with education
stakeholders and relevant implementing agencies at central, provincial, district, school and
community levels and clearly mandated by MOEC.

61.     Budget allocations should consider the requirements to enable CPIU as the manager for
the project to facilitate wide consultation and involvement of relevant stakeholders. A dedicated
budget is required to support other stakeholders (e.g. MORA, MOHA) to be involved so as to
provide the necessary support to project activities.

62.  Overarching financial management and budget requirements stipulated by MOHA and
MOF must be factored into design.

63.    Future donor grants should be in the form of a Block Grant with a committed amount that
will not be subject to donor budget cuts. Detailed planning and design should occur with
education stakeholders and implementing agencies.

64.     It is suggested that in future projects of this nature, MOF should provide procedures and
mechanisms to simplify the way grants are disbursed and settled to facilitate district financial
reporting.

65.     The L-BEC and CDP processes served as a catalyst for districts when focusing on
education service delivery improvements. The model used should be reviewed and integrated
into future district project activities.
