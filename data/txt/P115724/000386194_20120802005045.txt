2 Introductory Statement
    1. This Project Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to
       make the following changes to the Republic of Indonesia’s Basic Education
       Capacity Trust Fund (BEC-TF), Grant Number TF091895 and accompanying
       amendments to the project’s legal documents. The proposed changes have
       occurred as a result of (i) repercussions to the overall program due to the MoF 18
       month delay with L-BEC grant release; (ii) the Netherlands Government decision
       to reduce their contribution to the grant by €8,700,000 due to a reduction in their
       development assistance to Indonesia; and, (iii) the extension of time necessary to
       enable the achievement of program results and disbursement according to LG
       planning and budgeting cycles.
    2. There are two major changes: Extension to December 31, 2012 and Cost- neutral
       Budget Re-allocations between Categories.
    3. Proposed amendments to be made in the Grant Agreement and expected outcomes
       are:
            a. Cancellation of €8,700,000 due to NL reduction in development aid. The
               total amount of the Dutch contribution is now €5,751,179. The
               cancellation does not change the PDO and intermediate outcome
               indicators.
            b. Deletion of Part 3 of Schedule 1 is required as the pilot activities
               programmed had been trialed through the technical assistance provided
               through TRIMS pilot activities (EMIS); the BOS-KITA project (MoNEV
               and Complaint Handling); and, USAID (Asset Management) project
               activities.
            c. Reallocation of Grant Proceeds within the parameter of the Administration
               Agreement with the BEC donors. The reallocation will accommodate
               exchange rate fluctuations; shortfalls in Categories 4 and 5 to support the
               necessary coordination of project management; and, targeted technical
               assistance to districts.
            d. Extension to the end December 2012. This extension will enable districts
               to complete planned 2012 Capacity Development Plans (CDPs)
               contributing to KPI’s within a more realistic timeframe, given the 18-
               month delay in L-BEC grant disbursement.

3 Background and Reasons for Restructuring
   4. Original Project Development Objective: The Grant Agreement for the project
      was signed and became effective on June 5, 2008. Due to the exhaustive process
      of selecting 50 districts from a field of 500, a six-month inception period from the
      signing of the Administration Agreement in November 2007 to the Grant
      Agreement in June 2008 was acknowledged retrospectively. Currently April 30,
      2012 is the closing date of the Grant Agreement. The overall project objective is
      “to contribute to the achievement by the Recipient of the Millennium
      Development Goals and Education for All goals through good governance in
      Indonesia.? The purpose of the project is “to support GoI in improving the
      delivery of decentralized basic education services by local governments and
      schools in selected programme areas, and by extension in other locations.? No
      changes are proposed to the project development objectives.

5. Project Design and Scope
   Part 1: Capacity Development: Strengthening the capacity of the Recipient at the
   national, provincial and district levels in providing basic education through the
   provision of capacity building services and training focused on financial
   management and information systems, for development of, and thereafter based
   on Capacity Development Plans (CDPs).

   Part 2: L-BEC Grants for Local Governments: Supporting the implementation of
   CDPs in participating LGs through the provision of L-BEC grants to participating
   LGs.

   Part 3: Local Government Budget Support Facility: Supporting the
   implementation of a pilot program of providing support to the education budget of
   selected participating LGs.

   Part 4: Support for Central-level Thematic Education Dialogue: Supporting the
   implementation of a central-level Thematic Education Dialogue forum on
   education.

6. Project performance related to project development objectives, outputs and
   implementation: Supervision activities during the first two years of project
   implementation confirmed that district selection followed an exhaustive
   transparent process resulting in high levels of ownership at national and district
   levels.
       a. The ISR conducted in May 2010 found: (i) PDO: The release of L-BEC
           grants galvanized the project at both national and district levels -- rating
           MS. (ii) Implementation Progress: Activities are now going ahead under
           the L-BEC grants and local level commitment to the project is strong with
           districts making up for lost time – rating MS. (iii) Financial Management:
           The FM team reviewed financial management in May 2011 and found
           some areas of cause for concern which have been addressed by the CPIU
           and IG – rating MU. (iv) Project Management: Now that the L-BEC
           grants have been released the CPIU are focusing more attention on the
           project – rating MS. (v) Counterpart Funding: District ownership of
           project activities has seen counterpart funding at local levels – rating HS.
           (vi) Procurement: Improvements noted -- Phase 1 Service Provider
           procurement awarded with Phase 2 in progress -- rating MS. (vi)
           Monitoring and Evaluation: The M & E system is finalized and training
           for all districts completed – rating MS.
       b. Following MoF’s release of the L-BEC grants, progress improved
           significantly and the previous status as a problem project in the WB
           system no longer applied. The GoI developed a plan to expedite BEC
           implementation through an intensified program of implementation and
           support activities. The Tool for Reporting and Information Management
           by Schools (TRIMS) moved forward and will be introduced to all schools
           as part of the nationwide 2011 BOS School Management Team training
           program. ISR Ratings appear below.

7. Reasons for project restructuring:
      a. Cancellation of €8,700,000 due to NL reduction in development aid which
         affects Category 1 and 2 planned expenditure. In Category1, the original
         allocation was €11,900,000 with the expectation that technical assistance
         would be provided by international consultants. This did not occur as
         national consultants were procured. The revised budget requirement for
         Category 1 is €2,666,000. In Category 2, the original allocation was
         €1,090,000 with the expectation that the CPIU would procure computers
         for the participating 50 districts. This did not occur as the process was
         delegated to the districts in order to build procurement capacity and enable
         districts to purchase needed computers for DEOs and selected schools.
         The revised budget allocation is €89,000.
      b. Deletion of Part 3 of Schedule 1 was required as the pilot activities
         programmed had been trialed through the technical assistance provided
         through TRIMS pilot activities (EMIS); the BOS-KITA project (MoNEV
         and Complaint Handling); and, under a separate USAID project covering
         Asset Management, which negated the need for the pilot programs. The
         CPIU directed the districts to customize the programs to reflect local
         requirements and upscale within 2011 and 2012 L-BEC grant CDPs.
         Before the NL reduction of its contribution to the TF, the CPIU had
         proposed to reallocate Category 1 and 2 funds to Category 3. This would
         serve to increase the amount allocated to pilot the 5 activities proposed.
      c. Reallocation of Grant Proceeds within the parameter of the Administration
         Agreement with the BEC donors (10% to any category of consultants’
         services, L-BEC grants; and, 20% allocated to categories of studies,
         surveys, workshops, in-country training, overseas training and study
         tours). The reallocation is required to accommodate exchange rate
         fluctuations; shortfalls in Categories 4 and 5 to support the necessary
         coordination of project management; and, targeted technical assistance to
         districts.
      d. Extension of Closing Date to December 31, 2012. This extension will
         enable districts to complete planned 2012 Capacity Development Plans
         (CDPs) contributing to KPI’s within a more realistic timeframe, given the
         18-month delay in L-BEC grant disbursement.


                                        6
7 Proposed Change to the Grant Agreement and Rationale
      No change is proposed to Project Development Objectives and Intermediate
      Outcome Indicators. The World Bank has recommended to MoNE to revise the
      September 2011 Work Plan to reflect the proposed restructuring and budget
      reallocations and provide monitoring information against project KPIs. The
      proposal for the extension and budget reallocation changes discussed above is
      “budget neutral?.

       a. Cost- neutral Budget Re-allocations between Categories
          Rationale for proposed change: The reallocation will accommodate
          exchange rate fluctuations; shortfalls in Categories 4 and 5 to support the
          necessary coordination of project management; and, targeted technical
          assistance to districts.

       b. Extension to December 31, 2012
          Rationale for proposed change: Given the 18 month delay, the proposed
          extension will allow districts (i) to complete CDPs funded through L-BEC
          Grants --in particular it will allow districts sufficient time to implement the
          revised CDPs with facilitation support by SPs; and, achieve KPIs; (ii) to
          upscale activities such as TRIMS; BOSDA; Asset Management; Good
          Practice Information and Networking; District MoNEV and Complaint
          Handling.

8 Analysis
      a. Proposed changes do not affect the original economic, financial, technical,
          institutional, or social aspects of the project as appraised; do not raise the
          environmental category of the project; do not trigger new safeguard policies;
          and do not involve any exceptions to Bank policies.
      b. Analyses and studies on project file in support of the proposed changes
          include: BEC-TF PMC Progress Reports; Aide Memoire (October 6, 2011);
          FM Reports (March – April 2010); ISRs (June 2009, May 2010, March 2011);
          GoI Request for Extension (July 5, 2011); Letter from Ministry of Foreign
          Affairs, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (August 22, 2011);
          Minutes of Meeting: BEC Amendment No. 1 (October 3, 2011); Draft
          amendment to the Grant Agreement (October 5, 2011).

6 Expected Outcomes
      a. The proposed changes focus on enabling the achievement of project
          development outcomes to address the serious delays in LG implementation of
          CDPs due to the 18 month delays in disbursement of L-BEC grants within the
          reduced budget.
      b. Project indicators and outcome will not change as a result of the proposed
          changes. The yearly achievement targets in the monitoring framework will be
          adjusted to reflect the delays and, extension requirements within the revised
          budget categories.



                                           7
7 Benefits and Risks
      a. Benefits as a result of the extension to the Recipient Executed Trust Fund and
           re-allocation of budget categories include (i) sufficient time for districts to
           implement and monitor their CDPs with the support of the SPs facilitating
           capacity development in education management and governance within a
           more realistic time frame (ii) outcome level evaluation of the L-BEC process
           and district performance in the achievement of their CDPs.
      b. No additional risks are introduced by the proposed extension/restructuring.
      c. The restructuring proposal itself is a risk management response to the serious
           delays to the program as a result of the late disbursement of L-BEC grants and
           the reduced budget.
