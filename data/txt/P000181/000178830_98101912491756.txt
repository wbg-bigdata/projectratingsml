I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The Republic of Burundi, a small country of only 27,000 km , is
situated astride the Zaire-Nile divide in the center of Africa. One of
the most densely populated countries in Africa with 4.1 million inhabitants
it is, at the same time, one of the poorest with a per capita GDP of only
about US$140 equivalent. The major economic activity is agriculture with
95% of the population dispersed throughout the rural areas as small farmers.
Coffee and, to a lesser extent, cotton and tea are the principle sources
of foreign exchange. Bujumbura, the capital and commercial center, is the
only town of significant size with a population of about 140,000; situated
on Lake Tanganyika, it provides the principal outlet, through the lake
shipping services and the railway through Tanzania, to the country's
trading markets.
1.02      Up to the end of 1979 telecommunications services in Burundi
were the responsibility of the Telecommunications Department of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T). In January 1980 the Govern-
ment established the National Office for Telecommunications (ONATEL), a
Government-owned parastatal entity, to operate and manage the telecommuni-
cations sector of Burundi. ONATEL (Chapter 4), has a board of directors
and its management is headed by a general manager.
1.03      Since existing public telecommunications facilities are highly
inadequate in both quality and quantity (paragraph 1.04), several private
companies also operate (Government licensed) relatively high cost point-
to-point radio links. The army operates at least one radio link with each
of the 20 counties in the country. There is no manufacturing of telecom-
munications equipment in the country, and nearly all the material require-
ments for the sector must be imported. Most of the installation works
are contracted to international companies, leaving ONATEL's staff with
operation and maintenance activities, and subscribers' lead in and tele-
phone instrument installation.
Accees to and Usage of Service
1.04      The number of telephones per 100 population in Burundi at about
0.1, is amongst the lowest in the world. This compares with the average
for sub-Saharan Africa of about 0.4; Asia excluding Japan about 0.6, Latin
America about 4.5; and North America about 70.0. Almost 90% of all tele-
phone subscribers are located in the capital city of Bujumbura. The seven
provinces outside of Bujumbura have minimal access to service; there are
only 378 subscribers outside the capital with the number of subscribers
in each province ranging from between 10 and 175.
1.05      Countrywide, 48% of all subscribers are government offices, outside
Bujumbura, 70% of all subscribers are government. Small telephone exchanges
and public call offices are available in 14 small towns outside of Bujumbura



- 2-
and are working part-time and, when open, are mainly used by government
officials and merchants. In most small towns and rural settlements in
the country, there is no access to rapid two-way communication facilities.
1.06      T},z telex network is automatic with about 60 subscribers; the
unsatisfied demand is not known precisely, but is estimated to be at
least this figure. Outside Bujumbura, there is only one telex for public
use in each of 14 small towns.
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.07      The quality of communication in and among most of those towns
with some access to telephone service is poor. Within Bujumbura and the
other 14 towns which have exchanges, telephone service is frequently
interrupted by faults on the lines, which are particularly common during
the rainy season, due to the types of cable used and the inadequate methods
of laying them. There is also a high failure rate on the intarurban
network.
1.08      The local telephone service is 100% automatic.  For 1979 the
capacity of switching equipment and numbers of subscribers is shown in
the following table:
Name                  Number of                 Number of

Bujumbura                   5,000                     3,007

6,010                     3,389
1.09      All these exchanges are step-by-step.  They are in reasonably
good condition, and ONATEL's staff has no particular problem in maintain-
ing them. Although fairly new (the oldest one was installed in 1972),
they are of an outdated technology. These exchanges do not have automatic



- 3 -
number identification, and it would be too expensive to provide them with
the additional equipment necessary for Centralized Automatic Message Account-
ing (CAMA). Therefore, they can provide international service only through
manual operation, and automatic switching with pulse metering in the case
of the Bujumbura exchange.
1.10      In Bujumbura the external plant is nearly all made of underground
cables and defaults are frequent during the rainy season. In provincial
areas, the lack of cable, for which financing up to now has not been avail-
able, has prevented a number of exchanges from connecting subscribers.
Due to cable related inadequacies, the network is presently saturated,
although the exchanges themselves operate at only slightly more than 50%
capacity.
1.11      All interurban telephone traffic is automatic and all of the 14
towns are equipped with at least a teleprinter which allows transmission
of telegrams. In Bujumbura, telex service is available; the telex exchange
is on old style 100 outlet, step-by-step.
1.12      All telephone and telex international links are operated manually.
International telephone and telex links are operated on UHF routes from
Bujumbura to Kigali (Rwanda) and Kampala (Uganda). The service is reported
as reasonable with Kigali; service with Kampala has been interrupted. A
new HF route has been cut over between Bujumbura and Bukami (Zaire), at
the end of 1979. Furthermore, an HF radio link will provide a direct link
to Dar-Es-Salaam (Tanzania), and through it to other East African countries,
in 1980. The international HF link to Kinshasa (Zaire), has been interrupted
as Kinshasa reportedly does not answer. The HF liaison with Brussels, (two-
voice channels, two telex, one telegram), gives an unreliable, saturated
access to the rest of the world.
Demand for Service
1.13      No comprehensive study of the existing and potential subscriber
demand has been undertaken to date. As of December 1979, there were only
4,888 telephones in Burundi. There was also a waiting list for telephones
which contained 379 names. Given the facts that the waiting list is some-
what erratically kept, new telephones were not being awarded, applications
were not being invited, and vast areas of the country had little hope of
receiving telephone access in the foreseeable future, the official waiting
list bears little relation to actual or potential demand for telephone
access and usage in Burundi. Since 1975 the annual growth in number of
subscribers has averaged only 5.5% per annum.
1.14      It is difficult to predict growth outside Bujumbura because of
the very limited telephone service to date. However, the existence of
more than 50 independent licensed HF systems for domestic communications
show a major need not met by the public system. These networks are owned
primarily by commercial, industrial and religious organizations, many of
which provide schools and health service in rural Burundi. As part of
planning for extension of communication systems to the interior, the
Ministry of Communications contacted the Governors of the 8 provinces.
Responses from 6 of them listed 64 sites of which most were business and



- 4 -
commercial centers. These were augmented to form a list of 200 potential
sites for service, of which the Ministry has initially selected 31. These
include locations of 11 communes, 14 commercial centers, 21 schools and
10 missions. In addition, they encompass a wide variety of economic develop-
ment activity including coffee and tea plantations, forestr- 'rojects,
hydroelectric projects, etc. It is estimated that approximately 80% of
the traffic from these rural telephones will be interurban and 20% local.
The amount of international traffic (telephone and telex), is expected to
increase with the installation of a new earth station (paragraph 2.01).
Sector Goals
1.15      Telecommunications sector goals are in line with those of the
National Development Plan, which gives priority to the need to overcome
Burundi's geographical isolation vis-a-vis other countries and also the
enclavement of areas within the country. Communications is seen as an
important means of achieving this goal.
1.16      The goals established for telecommunications in the current
five-year plan include:
-  improvement and extension of the telecommunications
system to the interior in order to promote rural,
industrial and commercial development;
-  integrate into the communication network the new
economic centers planned for agricultural and
industrial projects; and
-  increase external telecommunications capacity.
Sector Constraints
1.17      The primary constraints which have impeded the establishment of
more efficient development-oriented national telecommunications services
are a lack of continuous long term financing, inadequate sector organiza-
tion and management, and a lack of trained manpower. The Telecommunications
Department lacked adequate autonomy for efficient management and financial
and technical planning. No separate financial statement had ever been
established for telecommunications, and as a result the Department had no
clear yardstick to measure its efficiency nor an incentive to improve its
efficiency.  With the establishment of a separate financially autonomous
entity, ONATEL (paragraph 1.02), it is anticipated that sector management
will improve.
1.18      With regard to the lack of trained manpower, the recently opened
training school (paragraph 4.06), together with the assistance provided
within the proposed project for funding of management courses and seminars
should begin to improve the situation.

IDA's Role
1.19      IDA first became associated with the telecommunications sector
in Burundi through a sector mission carried out in March, 1979. IDA's
role in the telecommunications sector is focused on institution building,
providing independent technical and economic advice and providing a stable
base for long-term financing which will allow better planning and resource
utilization.

II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Plan and the Program
2.01      The telecommunications investment program covers the period 1980-
84. The program is designed to be in harmony with the telecommunications
objectives of the National Plan (see paragraph 1.16). Details of the pro-
gram are set out in Annex 3 and include the following:
(a) Ongoing works, which include:
(i) domestic network: some rehabilitation and expansion of
the Bujumbura network and some expansion of the pro-
vincial network; work is expected to be completed in
1982;
(ii) international network: a type B earth satellite station
(cutover end 1980); an international switching center
(cutover 1982);
(b) the proposed first project (see paragraph 2.03); and
(c)  preliminary works needed for expansion of facilities from
1985 onwards.
This program is estimated to cost FBu 1.1 billion (US$12.5 million) with a
foreign exchange component of about FBu 0.9 billion (US$11 million)(Annex 4).
The program is designed to meet the highest priority needs for improvement
and expansion of telecommunications services within the anticipated resources
and the physical and managerial capability of ONATEL.
Project Concept
2.02      The project is designed to help the sector program towards its
goals described in paragraph 1.16. In order to achieve sound development
of the total network while spreading the service equitably, the project is
designed to foster institutional and training improvements and to foster
expansion of the domestic telephone and telex network. The telex network
expansion is a necessity for the economic development of Burundi, as the
present telex facilities will be saturated during the program period. The
expansion of the domestic telephone network is also essential to the develop-
ment of Burundi and the expansion included in the project aims principally
at bringing service to areas which are not or are insufficiently served at
present.
The Project
2.03      The project provides for:
(a) the installation of junction cables in Bujumbura and the improve-
ment and expansion of the urban cable networks in Bujumbura and
in the provincial towns. A total of 1,050 new main lines will be
made available for connection of subscribers;



- 7 -
(b)  the installation of a new exchange at Ngagara in the
Bujumbura area, equipped for 1200 lines, and of three new
provincial exchanges, of together 150 lines initial capacity;
the rehabilitation of various provincial exchanges and the
increase of their capacity by a total of 300 lines;
(c)  the connection to the national telephone network of about
40 currently unserved villages and production centers, by
public call office installations;
(d)  the improvement and expansion of the long distance trans-
mission network by:
- installation of three new UHF links;
-  replacement of three UHF links with facilities of higher
capacity; and
- overhaul of all other UHF links.
A total of 70 new channels will be equipped.
(e)  the replacement of the telex exchange at Bujumbura and the
provision of teleprinters, for 50 additional telex sub-
scribers;
(f)  miscellaneous (bills processor, vehicles, tools, instruments,
etc.);
(g)  construction of a warehouse and of other buildings; and
(h)  technical assistance and training services.
Project Costs
2.04      The estimated cost of the project is about FBu 819 million (US$9.1
million), with a foreign exchange component of about FBu 693 million (US$7.7
million). The cost details are given in Annex 4 and summarized below:

2.05      The cost estimates are based on prices experienced in other
similar countries for similar types of equipment. Furthermore, previous
procurement shows that, Burundi being a small landlocked market, suppliers'
quotations tend to be on the high side. This has been taken into account
in the estimated costs. The local costs are based on prevalent costs of
civil works, or costs of small equipment and services avai±able in Burundi.
Technical assistance costs as shown above are based on 86 manmonths of
services estimated at US$10,000 per manmonth.  No customs duties or taxes
are charged on imported telecommunications equipment.
Contingencies
2.06      A physical contingency of 5% has been provided on the foreign
and local costs. Price contingencies have been applied for all equipment
based on an annual price escalation of 8% in foreign costs and 15% for
local costs.  They are considered adequate and reflect the declining cost in
real terms of telecoxamunications equipment. The resulting estimated overall
price escalation amounts to about 21% of the estimated base cost plus
physical contingency.
Project Financing
2.07      Project costs would be financed as follows:
US$ millions         %
tDA                          7.7             85
G.O.B.                       1.4             15
9.1           100
2.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$7.7 million would be to the Govern-
ment of Burundi on standard IDA terms and would finance about 85% of total
project costs. During negotiations assurances were obtained that, as a
condition of credit effectiveness, Government had signed with ONATEL a
subsidiary loan agreement under which IDA funds would be onlent by Government
to ONATEL at an interest rate of not less than 8.25% per annum, for a period
of 20 years including 5 years grace on capital repayments.
Procurement
2.09      All equipment to be financed by the proposed IDA credit will be
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), except for a
few items costing about US$0.5 million.  The items excluded from ICB and
proposed for negotiated purchase on grounds of standardization, savings on
spare parts, and ease of maintenance are:
(a) the additional interworking equipment and rehabilitation
in the existing Bujumbura exchange; and
(b) additional equipment to increase the capacity of the
telex exchange.



- 9 -
The prices paid for the negotiated purchase items would be subject to IDA
approval and would have to be reasonable in terms of ICB prices offered.
Contracts for vehicles and sundry equipment costing less than US$50,000
and not exceeding a total of US$500,000 would be awarded following Govern-
ment procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
2.10      Funds from the Credit Account would be disbursed on the following
basis:
US$000's
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures or, if
purchased locally, 80% of local
expenditures on equipment for local
telephone network, exchange equipment,
long distance network and telex;                    4,200
(b) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures or
80% of local expenditures (excluding duties
and taxes) on vehicles, training equipment
and civil works;                                      500
(c) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures or
90% of local expenditures on the cost of
technical assistance and seminars; and              1,000
(d) an unallocated amount transferable to
above categories as appropriate.                    2,000
7,700
2.11      Disbursements against (a), (b) and (c) would be fully documented.
An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 5.
Project Implementation
2.12      ONATEL (Chapter 4) will be responsible for the implementation of
the project and will employ consultants to: (a) prepare the specifications
and bidding documents for the telephone switching equipment cable networks,
microwave VHF/UHF radio equipment, open wire carrier systems and rural network
materials; and (b) provide expert assistance for the supervision of installa-
tion and acceptance testing of telephone switching and microwave systems.
A provision has been made in the project for technical services support
of 86 manmonths (see paragraph 4.04). ONATEL will lay and join the cables
and install the subscriber facilities by itself in the provincial towns;
in the metropolitan area, it will be assisted by the supplier. ONATEL
will assist the contractors who will supply and install the telephone
exchanges and microwave and VHF/UHF radio equipment. During the execution
of the project, supervision will ensure that equipment will only be procured



- 10 -
when the building to house this equipment is certain to be completed by
delivery time. Civil works for construction of buildings and access roads
will be carried out by ONATEL. An estimated project implementation schedule
is given in Annex 7.
Performance Indicators
2.13      Performance indicators to help monitor ONATEL's project imple-
mentation, operational and financial performance are given in Annex 8.
These will be discussed during negotiations and confirmed for inclusion in
ONATEL's project progress reports to be sent to IDA.



III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis relates to the 1980-84 program of which
the project forms an integral part. The program is designed towards
achieving the objectives of the telecommunications sector which are derived
from the National Development Plan (see paragraphs 1.15 and 1.16).
Telecommunications and Economic Development
3.02      Burundi is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa;
most of its people live on small, dispersed farmsteads; 95% of the popula-
tion lives in the rural areas. Bujumbura, the capital and only major town,
with a population of about 140,000, houses most of the Government and
commercial operations. The existing telecommunications systems in Burundi
is rudimentary and of a poor quality and does not provide an adequate
base for carrying out national development programs in other sectors (para-
graphs 1.03 and 1.04). Because of the poor transport system, internal
telecommunications links radiating from the capital are essential for
administrative and trading purposes as well as to support national health,
education and rural development programs.
3.03      The telecommunications investment program is strongly supportive
of the major goals embodied in Government's third five-year plan (1978-1982).
In particular the 1980-1984 telecommunications investment program will assist
in providing the communication base to support the Governmentts development
goals:
(a) to increase the rate of economic growth in order to provide
greater employment opportunities and more income to the
poorest segments of the population;
(b)  to give the Governnent a more active role in mobilizing
financial resources and in participating in mixed enterprises
in the commercial and productive sectors; and
(c) to foster decentralizations of economic and social activity
away from the capital city and promote balanced geographic
distribution through the creation of development poles,
the settlement of the present population in villages, and
migration from densely to less densely populated areas.
As part of its rural development strategy, the Government is creating
cooperatives for production and distribution, and Regional Development
Societies (SRD). These are also to become means of providing credit to
farmers. To stimulate rural commerce, the Government has designated
locations to become business and commercial centers, and is encouraging
businesses to open stores and provide service in these centers. Govern-
ment is aware that without effective communications these development
efforts would be highly inefficient.



- 12 -
3.04      With regard to international communication, Burundi's enclave
position in the center of Africa, combined with the fact that it is one
of the poorest countries in the world and has limited natural resources,
means that its Government and its people must place great reliance on
communications links with the outside world. These links ore necessary
for the efficient ordering and monitoring of imported consumption and
investment goods, as well as to ensure that earnings from Burundi's
exports, particularly coffee, tea and perishable fruits and vegetables,
are not reduced through poor distribution.
Distribution of Benefits
3.05      The benefits of the five-year telecommunications investment pro-
gram will either directly or indirectly be felt by all segments of Burundi
society.  The upgrading of health and education facilities, greater
efficiency in business, transportation, etc., will flow from improved
communications. The primary users of the rural telephones are likely to
be the development organizations and services identified above (paragraph
3.03). As the agricultural organizations tend to be cooperatives, the
benefits of telecommunications should accrue to their membership, the
farmers.  To the extent that decentralized business activities are assisted
by telephone service, rural people should benefit through increased accessi-
bility to shops, banks, agricultural credit, consumer goods.  Communication
will also be important in providing information necessary to standardize
prices and to determine when to move agricultural products to market.
3.06      Farmers will have access to the PCOtS either on communes or in
the commercial market centers. However, because of their very low dis-
posable income and their decentralization on homesteads, it is not likely
that they will be major users of the telephones. Rather, they should
benefit indirectly from institutional users.
Tariff Policies
3.07      Given the scarcity of resources available to the telecommunica-
tions sector in Burundi, tariffs are one means through which telecommuni-
cations services can be directed to high priority users. However, the
allocational aspects of tariff policy have not in the past been a prime
factor in determining tariff level or structure. Hence, telephone
installation and rental charges are relatively low and there are no
differential rates between daytime peak period calls and-off peak night-
time and weekend calls over the long distance network. Tariffs were,
however, increased in January 1980 after over ten years of no increases,
and partly as a result, local call charges are not low by international
standards. Overall, revenue received by ONATEL should be sufficient to
generate a projected 10% or better rate of return on revalued fixed assets
over the project period (paragraph 5.08).
3.08      To better rationalize tariff level and structure toward ascertain-
ing what telephone tariff charges, if any, might better promote the overall
national equity and efficiency goals of Government, ONATEL will undertake a



13 -
tariff review under terms of reference suitable to IDA, to be completed
by July 1, 1981. During negotiations assurances to this effect were
obtained, and also that ONATEL would discuss with IDA the implementation
implications of this review not later than December 31, 1981. A table of
existing tariffs is shown at Annex 9.  Draft terms of referer-- for this
review were discussed and agreed with ONATEL during negotiations (Annex 10).
Least Cost Solution
3.09      The future telephone network design has been based on standard
engineering economic techniques for minimizing capital and recurring costs.
Experienced engineers have carried out most of the planning and design for
the network expansion. The technologies to be adopted are acceptable.
Appropriate provisioning periods for the various types of plant have been
adopted.
3.10      The long distance and international networks will comprise a
mix of coaxial cable, microwave radio and satellite circuits which should
provide a reliable network. The extension of the local switching system
will be either crossbar or electronic switching, depending on the prices
obtained by an open international tender, so ensuring that the most cost-
effective technology is adopted. The new international switching center
will be an electronic system which will provide efficient manual assistance
positions with visual display units and keying of charging information.
Ail these individual elements of the program have been engineered to pro-
vide a sound telecommunications network capable of meeting most of the
demands of the country in a cost effective manner.
Return on Investment
3.11      The internal financial rate of return, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the present value of cost and revenue streams (at 1980 prices)
attributable to the 1980-84 program, is 11%. This rate of return significantly
understates the real benefits to be derived from the investment program partly
because the benefits stream used in the calculation does not include any of the
consumer surplus which telephone users receive. In recent years, inflation has
resulted in prices falling in real terms and it is projected that they will
continue to do so. Hence, a portion of the consumer surplus can be estimated
by (a) tabulating over the program period the prices in 1980 real terms, which
the existing subscribers and existing registered applicants have demonstrated
a willingness to pay; and (b) assuming that the new applicants will also be
willing to pay the same real amount as existing subscribers and waiting appli-
cants have demonstrated a willingness to pay. Given these assumptions, which
are considered reasonable, the quantifiable estimate of the economic rate of
return would be 20%.
Risk
3.12      The project offers limited risk.  The principal risk is the
possibility of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen circum-
stances. In telecommunications projects, which comprise a relatively
large number of independent activities, delay in the completion of a few
works does not generally prevent the use of other newly created assets.



- 14 -
Furthermore, costs and benefits are often delayed in roughly the same
degree, so the impact on the rate of return may not be significant. A
sensitivity analysis on the economic rate of return (Annex 11) shows
that a combination of 10% higher capital costs and 10% lower revenues
would result in an economic rate of return of 17%.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.13      Telecommunications projects have very little direct impact on
the environment. The plant is mostly unseen and it consumes little energy.
Through its use as an alternative to communications involving physical
movements, however, telecommunications has the potential to conserve energy,
reduce environmental pollution, and facilitate such items as health
delivery and emergency care.

IV   THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization and Management
4.01      In January 1980, the National Office for Telecommunications
(ONATEL) was established. It is a parastatal enterprise whose board is
appointed by the Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications
(TPT). The board consists of a chairman and five other members, these
board members represent the interests of Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Commerce, Ministry TPT, ONATEL staff and the Association of Traders and
Industrialists. ONATEL will be the implementing agency for the proposed
project. An organization chart is shown at Annex 12.
4.02      ONATEL, is headed by a general manager, appointed by the
Minister TPT, who has reporting to him the departmental heads of
Administration and Accounts, Technical and Planning, and Operations. All
departmental heads have been appointed.  An International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU) advisor is working with the technical and planning
division.
Management and Control
4.03      The management, budgeting and control systems operating in the
previous organization (Department of the Ministry TPT) needed considerable
strengthening. There was no internal budgeting system and the flow of
management control information was erratic and non-structured. There is
a need for a disciplined, yet simple, management information system to
provide condensed and relevant information to the General Manager and his
departmental heads.
4.04      To help ONATEL during this establishment phase, the proposed
project includes technical assistance of telecommunications experts.
About 72 manmonths would be required; 4 manyears of one expert to act
as assistant and advisor to the General Manager, and 24 manmonths of
engineering consultancy, to assist in the preparation and evaluation of
bids and to carry out acceptance tests. The project also provides for
about 14 manmonths of an accounting expert who, after a three-month
initial period to implement commercial procedures, would continue, at six
month intervals, to assist and advise on the preparation of ONATEL's
commercial accounts. Draft terms of reference for the technical assistance
is shown at Annex 6. During negotiations assurances were obtained that,
as a condition for credit effectiveness, a contract, satisfactory to the
Association, had been signed for management and engineering technical
assistance. A financial advisor is already at work in Burundi on the first
phase of the financial advisory assistance. The first three months of this
assistance was financed under Technical Assistance Credit BU-917. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that ONATEL would continue to employ
a financial advisor for the period mentioned above.



_ 16
Staff and Training
4.05      Staff distribution by category is given in the table below:
Staff Classification
Technical and administrative               38
Technicians and specialized workers        80
Operators                                  16
Linesmen, cable jointers and unskilled
workers                                 149
Total                              283
The staff ratio per 1,000 DELs is 83; this ratio is reasonable as small net-
works do tend to have a high staff density. Throughout the project period
this ratio should decrease such that by end 1984 staff density will have
reduced to about 60 per 1,000 DELs.
4.06      ONATEL will face, in the future, a problem of insufficient qualified
technicians and administrative personnel. Recognizing this, Ministry TPT
established, and in October 1979 opened, a telecommunications training school
in Bujumbura. The training program is designed primarily for operators,
linesmen, switching technicians and cable jointers. The curriculum incor-
porates both introductory and refresher courses. Personnel at levels higher
than these are not trained in Burundi but are sent to more advanced schools
in Africa (Senegal and Madagascar). The school can accommodate about 50
students and has a classroom capacity to train and retrain each year at
least 20% of the staff requiring training. The school is adequately staffed.
One constraint, however, is the lack of training equipment; the project will
provide funds for these. The school has no course for management or account-
ing training. It is proposed that, for accounting, a specific one-month course
will be held each year to be conducted by ONATEL's Finance Director, Chief
Accountant and the Accounting Advisor. Provision is also made for senior
staff members of ONATEL to attend overseas management courses and seminars.
Accounting and Budgeting System
4.07      ONATEL will begin preparing its accounts on a commercial basis,
Overall budgets will be prepared for submission to the Board, which will
approve such plans following discussions with the Ministry of Finance,
which is represented on ONATEL's Board. The framework of a commercial
accounting system has already been set down and this system will be imple-
mented with the assistance of the financial advisor (see paragraph 4.04).
4.08      During negotiations assurances were obtained that ONATEL
would continue to prepare commercial accounts and that these would be
forwarded to IDA within four months of the end of the financial year.
Billing and Collection
4.09      Fixed annual rentals are billed in advance and call charges are
billed after they have been made. The current billing cycle is every two



- 17 -
months, which is adequate for the expected level of activity. The billing
and preparation of statements is computerized. Subscribers can pay in any
post office where collections will be deposited to an ONATEL bank account.
Historically government department bills have been offset within the various
budget allocations. In the future ONATEL will bill Government directly.
Accounts receivable as at December 31, 1979, were estimated to be FBu 48.0
million, representing about 22% of annual revenues. Throughout the project
period this is expected to increase initially and then come down again as
management and accounting control procedures are implemented. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that Government would initiate
procedures which would ensure that Government telecommunications bills do
not remain outstanding for more than four months.
Audit
4.10      The Ministry of Finance appoints special investigators from within
the Ministry to examine the financial state of affairs of the various
parastatal bodies. Burundi has no private sector system of annual indepen-
dent audits and there is a shortage of qualified French speaking auditors
in the region. This has led to difficulties and delays in the auditing of
accounts of government corporations. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that ONATEL's accounts will be audited each year by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts be forwarded within
six months of the end of the financial year.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      The past financial performance of the telecommunications
operations, as estimated during preparation, has been reasonable. A
summary for the years 1976 through 1979 is shown below:
1976     1977      1978     1979
(FBu millions)
Operating Revenues           133       156       186     211
Operating Costs              104       120       129     139
Operating Surplus              29       36        57      72
The operating ratio over these years has fallen from 78% to 66% due to
econemies of scale as the system expands. The rate of return on revalued
assets has risen from about 7% in 1976 to about 9% in 1979.
Present Financial Position
5.02      A summary of ONATEL's estimated balance sheet as at 31st
December, 1979, is shown below:
FBu          US$
(millions)

Total Liabilities                       836          9.3
Governnent investment represents both its own direct investment as well
as bilateral grants.  Long term loans represent  bilateral loans.  The
financial position of ONATEL at December 31, 1979 is reasonable.



- 19 -
Valuation of Assets
5.03      ONATEL's records on fixed assets are incomplete and exact
historic c^st and year of acquisition for each item cannot be firmly
established. No plant accounts are maintained and book value of assets
has been calculated on the basis of Government development budget records
and bilateral aid. Present asset figures and future projections are
considered to be accurate to the extent that a major proportion (in value
termns) of the assets currently in service will be replaced during the
course of the Project.
5.04      The effect of inflation on the value of telecommunications
assets has never been established in Burundi. To reduce possible
distortion in future asset values by price inflation on the one hand
and declining unit costs from improved technologies and economies of
scale on the other, ONATEL's net fixed assets in operation have been
adjusted to reflect current values of the assets, and have been revalued
by 6% per annum for the forecast period.
5.05      During negotiations assurances were obtained that, not
later than 31st December, 1980, ONATEL would propose to IDA a niethod
for revaluation of its fixed assets in accordance with methods agreed
upon with IDA. Assurances were also obtained that ONATEL would review
the value of its fixed assets annually thereafter, in accordance with the
methods agreed upon with IDA for the purposes of calculating the rate
of return (see paragraph 5.10).
Financing Plan
5.06      The forecast of sources and application of funds is based upon
ONATEL's 1980-1984 capital expenditure program and is shown in Annex 14.
A summary of the financing plan is shown below:

The above financing plan assumes that IDA and bilateral loans would be onlent
to ONATEL by Government at 8.25% per annum with a grace period of five years.
5.07      Of the total investment requirements during the project period,
ONATEL's internal cash generation would be expected to be the equivalent of
a 61% contribution, which is good.
Future Financial Performance
5.08      Financial statements projected for the years 1980-1984 are given
in Annexes 13-15 and a summary of ONATEL's estimated future financial
performance, assuming inflation of operating costs consistent with those
rates used in estimating project costs, is given below:
Year Edding December 31:            1980    1981    1982    1983    1984

Debt Service Coverage (times)         il       9        8       7        5
5.09      ONATEL's projected financial performance over the project period
should be satisfactory.  The operating ratio is expected to remain at about
50% which reflects the high fixed cost element of the operations.  The
expected increasing current ratio reflects the build-up of cash which could
be used for early loan repayments or offsetting the need for future loans.
5.10      In respect of tariffs, it is assumed that there will be no increase
during the project period. The present forecasts show the rate of return
on revalued assets to be not less than 10% throughout the investment period.
A rate of return of 10% would be adequate to meet ONATEL's future financial
requirements. During negotiations assurances were obtained that ONATEL
would maintain tariffs at a sufficient level to achieve a rate of return on
revalued average net fixed assets of at least 10% each year.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that, as condition for credit effectiveness:
(a)  a contract for management and engineering technical assistance,
satisfactory to the Association, had been signed (paragraph
4.04).
(b)  Government had signed with ONATEL a subsidiary loan agreement
under which Governmnent would onlend the IDA credit to ONATEL
at an interest rate of not less than 8.25% per annum, for a
period of 20 years with a grace period of 5 years on capital
repayments (paragraph 2.08).
6.02      During negotiations, the following major assurances were also
obtained, that:
(a)  ONATEL would undertake a tariff review under terms of reference
suitable to ida to be completed by July 1, 1981, and that
ONATEL would discuss with IDA the implementation implications
of this review not later than December 31, 1981 (paragraph
2.08);
(b)  ONATEL would continue to prepare annual commercial accounts
which would be submitted to IDA within four months of the end
of the financial year (paragraph 4.08);
(c)  Govertment of Burundi would initiate procedures which would
ensure that Government telecommunications bills do not remain
outstanding for more than four months (paragraph 4.09);
(d)  ONATEL's accounts will be audited by independent auditors,
acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts would be forwarded
to IDA within six months of the end of the financial year
(paragraph 4.10);
(e)  that not later than December 31, 1980, ONATEL would propose
to IDA a method for revaluation of its fixed assets in
accordance with methods agreed upon with IDA and that
thereafter ONATEL would review the value of its fixed assets
in accordance with these methods for the purpose of calculating
the rate of return (paragraph 5.05); and
(f)  ONATEL would maintain tariffs at a sufficient level to achieve
a rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in operation
of at least 10% of each year (paragraph 5.10).



- 22 -
6.03      Proviided the above conditions are met, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit to the Government of
Burundi in the amount of US$7.7 million equivalent.

Description of Works in ONATEL's Program, 1980-1984
1.        ONATEL's 1980-1984 telecommunications development program has the
following components:
(a) ongoing works, which are part of the initial 1978-82 develop-
ment program;
(b) the new works proposed in the telecommunications project
forming part of the current program, 1980-84; and
(c)  preliminary works needed for essential expansion from 1985
onwards.
A brief description of the major works included in the program follows:
(a) ongoing works:
i. Rehabilitation and expansion of the cable network in
Bujumbura and installation of the cable network in five
provincial towns so as to provide about 1,000 new con-
nections. The necessary equipment has been received
towards the end of 1979 and the task is expected to be
completed by 1982;
ii. an earth satellite station; it is an INTELSAT Standard
B station, equipped initially for 24 channels. Its
scheduled cutover date is September 1980;
iii. an international switching center, of an electronic
type, will replace the existing manual center and will
allow semiautomatic operation. It will be equipped
initially with about 60 international junctors and 70
national junctors. ONATEL plans to cut it over by end
1982;
(b) new works under the proposed telecommunications project:
i. Local Telephone Exchanges. The project provides for:
- rehabilitating and expanding the provincial exchanges
by a total amount of 300 lines;

provides for some duct construction and for the instal-
lation of cable and associated network to connect the
exchange about 350 additional main lines in the provincial
towns and 700 in the Bujumbura area;
iii. long distance transmission facilities include:
- replacing 3 existing UHF links (between Bujumbura and
Ngozi, Gitega and Songa/Kisoz) with a capacity of 24-
channels each with new equipment with a capacity of
60 channels;
- rehabilitating and expanding by about 200 channels, the
existing SHF link, Bujumbura-Mugongo; and
-installing 3 SHF links to connect the 3 new exchanges to
the public network.
A total of about 300 new channels would be put in service.
iv. Rural Telecommunications Facilities. The project provides
for the installation of about 40 PCO connections, about
half of which would be aerial lines and half VHF/UHF radio-
telephone systems;
v. Telex and Telegraph Service. The project provides for
replacement of the telex exchange by one of 300 lines
capacity, equipped for 150 lines, and the installation of
teleprinters for about 50 new subscribers.
vi. Installation of Billing Processor. The project provides for
the installation of a billing processor to process the
magnetic tape output from the domestic and international
trunk exchanges;
vii. Civil Works, Vehicles and Tools. The project provides for
the construction of a warehouse, buildings to house the new
exchanges and repeater stations. It includes vehicles and
the tools and instruments necessary to carry out the
acceptance tests of the equipment and the external plant
in construction;

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Study of Tariff Structure
Draft Terms of Reference
1.        The purpose of the study is to develop the principles which should
guide formulation of an appropriate structure of tariffs for telecommunica-
tions services in Burundi, and to apply these principles in the form of a
recommended structure of tariffs for application for 1981 through 1984.
2.        The basic approach to establishing an appropriate tariff structure
will be that of marginal cost pricing, with the constraint that overall
revenue generation must be sufficient to ensure financial viability of the
telecommunications entity. Marginal cost, or the amount which would be
saved to the economy if marginal demand (e.g., an additional telephone
line, an additional call) were not met, may take either of two forms:
(a) cost to the telecommunications entity of supply, where
capacity exists to meet the demand; and
(b) cost to the other competing user of doing without the
service, where capacity is insufficient to meet the
demand.
Thus the study has to have both a cost accounting dimension and a demand
assessment dimension, as well as to include a financial analysis to assess
the adequacy of revenues generated from the point of view of financial
viability.
Cost Accounting
3.        The purpose of this part of the work is to identify the marginal
costs of the principal different telecommunications services offered,
distinguishing between Bujumbura, major regional towns and country areas:
(a) provision of telephone connection;
(b) local calls;
(c) long distance calls;
(d) international calls; and
(e) telex, and same subcategories.



- 37 -            ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 3 pages
Such costs will be specified in 1981 values.
4.        The bases of the calculations will be:
(a)  financial accounts of the enterprise;
(b) operating records of the enterprise;
(c)  spot-checks to establish on a sample basis the marginal
costs of particular services; and
(d)  relevant data available from other telecommunications
administrations.
Demand Assessment
5.        The purpose of this part of the work is to assess the strengths of
demand for each of the different services offered by the telecommunications
entity, and the sensitivity of that demand to the prices which might be
charged. This is needed for two purposes: (a) in order to estimate the
cost to users (or potential users) of doing without the service, for cases
where it is not possible to meet demand fully; and (b) in order to identify
those services which are in least elastic demand (i.e., demand will be
least affected by price changes), so that they should be made to bear the
major part of any mark-up necessary to cover overheads and enable the tele-
communications entity to attain overall financial viability.
6.        This work will require thorough review of existing records on
applications for service, calling rates, ineffective calls, etc., followed
by surveys of a sample of existing and potential users in order to deepen
knowledge of the strength of demand for the different services and of the
amounts that customers would be prepared to pay for the different services
(or that they would suffer as losses, or extra expenses, if the services
were not available).
Social Considerations
7.        Attention must be given, in connection with the Demand Assess-
ment, to the possible need to charge certain incipient users, e.g.,
services in distant rural areas, or public call offices, at rates below
those that would be indicated by marginal cost and financial viability
considerations, as a means to stimulate socially highly desirable use.
Certain limited cross-subsidization of this nature may be a worthwhile
means of bringing telecommunication facilities within the reach of poorer
people who would otherwise be excluded.
Financial Analysis
8.        The approximate tariffs for the different services (some of which
may well turn out to need to be cost-based while others may need to be
more demand-based) must then be multiplied by estimated levels of service



-38-              ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3 pages
requirements to assess total revenues for 1981 and the following five
years. These should be compared with updated projections of costs, to
assess the future financial status of the enterprise.
9.        Iterations may be required in order to produce a structure of
tariffs that is consistent with financial viability.
Final Results
10.       The results of the study should be a recommended set of prices for
the various services, with alternative possibilities where appropriate, and
projections of the effect of application of such prices on the enterprise's
revenues and financial performance.  Recommendations should also be made
as to how the tariffs should be adjusted over time in light of changes in
costs including inflation.
Resources Required
11.       The study will require approximately six weeks of effort on the
part of an economist, a financial analyst and an engineer, each with
experience in telecommunications, and supplemented by the necessary staff
to assist with the survey work.

Return on Investment
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1980-2000, when
on average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements
during the program period, excluding preinvestments for future programs.
Price contingencies are excluded and asset values have been adjusted to
reflect 1980 values.
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based
on the expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and the traffic
increase brought about by the program. Incremental costs excluding depre-
ciation and interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and staff
requirements expected from the program. All revenues and costs have been
deflated to bring them to the 1980 price level and make them comparable
with the capital expenditures.
4.        A summary of the programs incremental cost and benefit streams,
at 1980 price levels, is as follows:
Capital          Operating            Net
Year        Expenditure    Costs  Revenues       Benefits
1979            187            -         -          -187
1980            114            -         -          -114
1981              82           18        40          -60
1982             153           31        76         -108
1983             253           39       110         -182
1984            138            44       139          -43
1985-2000            -            39      168         +129
5.        The internal rate of return for the above net benefit stream is
11%.
6.        Estimating a portion of the future consumer surplus by tabulating
over the program period, the prices in real terms (1980 level), which existing
subscribers and applicants are demonstrating a willingness to pay, and assuming
that new subscribers and applicants are prepared to pay the same amount, the

Page 2 of 2 pages
economic rate of return is 20%. Labor has not been shadow priced as ONATEL
mostly employs skilled staff, of which there is no surplus in Burundi.
7.          A sensitivity analysis on the above rate of return shows that with
10% higher capital costs and 10% lower revenues the rate of return will be 17%.
