PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.          This report covers the First Telecommunications Project in Burundi
supported by Credit 1058-BU. The credit for US$7.7 million to the Republic of
Burundi was approved in July 1980, became effective in January l981. and was
closed in March 1987, 21 months after the original closing date.
2.          Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy
Operations Division of the Africa Technical Department, Africa Regional Office,
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the President's Report, the
Credit, Guarantee and Project Agreements; supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, information supplied by the Office National
des Telecommunications (ONATEL), and a short mission in February 1989.
3.          Part II and comments on Parts I and III were requested from the
Borrower but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.        US$7.7 Million Credit 1058-BU was the fi=st IDA
telecommunications credit in Burundi, following a sector mission carried
out at government's request in early 1979. The study led to the
preparation of a project for priority sector development and institution
building, and, in January 1980, the government established the "Office
National des Tdlecommunications, (ONATEL)", a parastatal entity, to
operate, manage and develop the telecommunications sector in Burundi.
2.        Telecommunications sector goals were: unlocking Burundi's
isolation, increasing the growth and efficiency of the economy, and
tightening the socio-economic fabric of a densely populated country. The
government also intended to strengthen sector management and operation as
part of the public enterprise reform. IDA's assistance was provided in
that framework.
Proiect Obiectives and Descriptior.
3.        The main objectives of the project were to: (i) help the newly
created ONATEL structure its organization and implement a commercially
oriented management, and make its operation more efficient; (ii) integrate
the new economic centers planned for agricultural and industrial projects
into the communications network; and (iii) modernize, expand and improve
network facilities and operations for domestic and international services.
4.        The project included: (i) the improvement and expansion of cable
systems in Bujumbura, installation of a new exchange at Ngagara in the
Bujumbura area, and expansion of switching capacities in several provincial
towns; (ii) the replacement and expansion of the telex exchange in
Bujumbura; (iii) the expansion of the long distance transmission network;
(iv) support facilities for maintenance, operation and construction of the
networks; and (v) technical assistance and training in management,
accounting, development planning and operation of the facilities.

Prolect Implementation
5.        Because of underestimatad demand and difficulty in adapting new
technology to the existing system, the original project scope was revised
in 1982-83. Capacity added from the project was about twice what was
originally planned for local telex and telephone, and four times for long
distance service.
6.        Seeking complementary financing, and planning and building the
enlarged systems under ONATEL's revised program, resulted in an overall
delay of about three years in project completion.
7.        The original estimated cost of the project was about
9.1 Million. The final cost was increased by 722, .o abou. US$ 15.6
Million. Foreign cost overruns were financed by bilateral contributors.
8.        The project went thus beyond its initial objectives, through
improved access to telecommunications services in the country and better
quality of services. It aleo introduced modern technology in switching and
transmission systems (para 6.04).
9.        In the managerial and financial areas, the results were
disappointing, because ONATEL's financial management and accounting did not
improve as much as had been envisaged at appraisal. The implementation of
the institutional component was generally mediocre (paras. 4.04, 5.03 and
6.02).
Conclusions, Findings and Lessons to be Learned
10.       The main findings and lessons to be learned are:
(a) during project preparation, telephone and telex demands were not
realistically assessed;
(b) during project revision, it took a long time to define the
revised project and to assess its cost;
(c) IDA should have insisted on borrower's compliance with: (i) the
settlement of government's arrears; (ii) the need for
implementing the tariff study;
(d) IDA should have supervised more closely the financial status and
overall management of ONATEL as a commercial, financially
autonomous operation; and
(e) Though assistance in technical matters was satisfactory,
assistance in institution building and organizational matters
was insufficiently coordinated and therefore inefficient.



- iv -
11.       At the time of project revision, the government requested IDA's
assistance for a second project, in association with reforms undertaken by
the government for public enterprides in Burundi. In this context, a
thorough diagnosis of ONATEL's overall organization and operational
situation is under way.

2.        Background
2.01      Up to the end of 1979 domestic and international public
telecommunications services in Burundi were the responsibility of the
Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transports, Post and
Telecommunications (MTPT). In January 1980, the Government established the
National Office for Telecommunications (ONATEL), a Government-owned
parastatal entity, to operate and manage the telecommunications sector of
Burundi. ONATEL has a board of directors and its management is headed by a
general manager. HTPT supervises sector policy and JNATEL's overall
operation. Tariff changes are authorized by government.
2.02      IDA Credit 1058-BU for $7.7 million was the first credit for
telecommunications in Burundi. IDA first became associated with the sector
through a sector mission carried out in March 1979. Government was then
considering to create an autonomous parastatal entity to resolve the
problems encountered in the sector's organization and operation as a
government department, and to better develop the services. The sector
study focussed on both the inadequacy under all aspects of existing
facilities and the need for institution building. The rationale for the
latter was to provide a stronger base for sector development, through
improved planr.ing, operation and resource utilization. The study leu to
preparation of a project for priority sector development and institutional
reform. Short-term experts to assist in project preparation were recruited
under the Second Technical Assistance Project financed by IDA Credit 917-
BU.
2.03      Telecommunications sector goals give priority to the need to
overcome Burundi's geographical isolation vis-a-vis other countries and
also the enclavement of areas within the country. Communications are seen
as important means of achieving this goal and considered as determinant
factors of the country's socio-economic progress. Government also intended



to restructure sector management and operation as part of its policy of
public enterprise reform. As a follow-up to the sector study, Government
requested IDA's assistance in achieving these goals.
3.        Project Objectives and Descriotion
3.01      Project Objectives:  The main objectives of the project were to:
(a)  help the newly created ONATEL to implement a commercially-
oriented management and make its operation more efficient;
(b)  improve and expand the telecommunications system to
the interior in order to promote rural, industrial and
commercial development;
(c)  integrate into the communication network the new
economic centers planned for agricultural and
industrial projects;
(d)  modernize and expand domestic networks facilities to
improve operation and provide better access to basic
telephone and telex services in and between major
urban and rural areas, and to the increased external
telecommunications capacity.
3.02      Project Description:  The project consisted of the most urgent
works for modernization and expansion of ONATEL's domestic systems under
its investment program for the period 1980-1984. The project provided for:
(a)  installation of junction cables in Bujumbura and the
improvement and expansion of urban cable networks in
Bujumbura and various provincial towns (a total of
1,050 new main lines would be provided);
(b)  installation of a new 1,200 lines exchange at Ngagara
in the Bujumbura area, and of three new provincial
exchanges, with a total initial capacity of about 150
lines; renabilitation of various provincial exchanges
and increase in their capacity by about 300 lines;
(c)  connection to the national telephone network of about
40 villages and production centers, previously
unserved, through public call office installations;
(d)  improvement and expansion of the long distance
transmission network through: (i) installation of
three new UHF links; (ii) replacement of three UHF
links with facilities of higher cdpacity; and (iii)
overhaul and increase in capacity of all other UHF
links;



(e)  replacement of the telex exchange at Bu'umbura and
provision of teleprinters for 50 additional
subscribers;
(f) purchase of a bills processor, vehicles, tools, and
other miscellaneous equipment;
(g) construction of a warehouse and of other project
related buildings; and
(h)  technical assistance and training.
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.01        The project followed a classical model in telecommunications.
Need for expanding the network and improving the services was clear to
everybody concerned, and all parties involved agreed on the implementation
of the physical part. The scope was modified during the implementation
(para. 5.01). On the institutional aspect, there were differences between
Bank's intentions in establishing a management system similar to those in
industrial countries and the degree of acceptance by the country for such a
model. The confl.oting attitudes during implementation of the project led
to mediocre implementation of the institutional component.
4.02      Expansion works for the international systems were already
underway at the time of project appraisal, and the project was designed to
foster expansion of the domestic telephone and telex networks and to
improve the quality of service. The expansion of the telephone network
brought service to areas which were not or were insufficiently served and
pr.jvided access to all expanded domestic and international service
facilities. The telex expansion had to increase the capacity of a network
about to reach saturation point. The project thus; (i) introduced semi
electronic and electronic sw-tching systems in the telephone and telex
exchanges; and (ii) enabled interworking between expanded and new automatic
exchanges for nationwide subscriber trunk dialing (STD). Existing
exchanges were equipped for STD service. The capacity of interurban
transmission links was increased and new links were established between
local systems. Project planning to enable future expansion, was made
possible with the help of consultants. Simultaneously, the project was
designed to foster institutional building and training improvement.
5.        Project Implementation
5.01      Implmentation  The original project scope was revised in
1982-Z3.  liemand had been underestimated under ONATEL's 1980-84 program, as
requests for new connections proved higher than expected at project
inception. In 1982, additional capacities from the project were increased
by about 35Z for telex, 66Z for local telephone and about four times for
long distance service. During the project period, actual yearly growth of
new connections averaged about 10.5Z for telephone aad 20Z for telex,



compared to appraisal estimates of 8Z and 102 respectively. The 1980
estimates had assumed that growth rates would average about 1.5 times the
rates observed during the five preceding years. Actual increase in growth
rate proved to be about twice that assumption. Furthermore, Government
requested, in compliance with regional policy decisions, to add capacities
to the planned systems for television transmission and long distance
interconnection with Burundi's neighboring countries, Rwanda, Tanzania and
Zaire. Consequently, distribution and capacities of telephone exchanges
were rearranged to take advantage, from the technical and cost viewpoints,
of the faster introduction of new electronic technology in ONATEL's
networks. At the same time, capacities of the main long distance links
were increased to meet the requirements of the redesigned local systems.
The need to seek complementary financing and the additional time required
to build the enlarged microwave links under ONATEL's revised program
resulted in an overall delay of about three years in project completion.
5.02      It now appears that, in the preparation of the project, the
decision not to use the latest technology in building the Ngagara exchange
was made on the basis on a poor quality demand forecast (para. 5.01). As a
result, the exchange could not be expanded in the second project, as
equipments of different technologies are not economically compatible, and
it had to be retired and partly reused in the provinces before it was fully
depreciated.
5.03      The implementation of the institutional component was mediocre
(para 4.04). On the part of the Bank, there was little follow-up to Bank's
supervision. Covenants providing for a satisfactory accounting system were
insufficiently fulfilled, particularly the covenant concerning Government's
receivables, which were supposed not to exceed 4 months of consumption and
were well above that level during the implementation of the project before
reaching 20 months in 1988. On the part of the Borrower,
telecommunications censtructors eager to supply equipment, and bilateral
lenders ready to finance it on easy terms, led to reduced financial
discipline, including insufficient attention to non-payment of utilities.
5.04      Procurement.  The procurement process went generally well,
though new to ONATEL. Tenders for cables, switching and terminal
subscribers were issued in 1981 and 1982 and deliveries took place in
1983-84. Tendering for transmission equipment had to be delayed by about
one year, due to the project revision needed to increase and redistribute
switching capacities (para 5.01). Final award for this equipment had to be
delayed by about another year to enable complementary financing
arrangements to be finalized. Most installations were then delivered on
contractual times, except for rural public call offices, that were
delivered about 18 months behind schedule. Performance of the suppliers
was satisfactory, as a whole, with only few minor problems which were
resolved.



- 5 -
5.05      Project Cost.  The estimated cost of the project during
appraisal was about US$9.1 million.  The final cost is about US$15.6
million representing an overall increase of about 722 as shown in Table
3.5.A of Part III. The reason for the increase was the revision to
increase capacities of the local and long distance systems (para. 5.01).
Though unit costs of some items, such as telex and telephone electronic
switching and rural telephone equipment, proved higher than estimated at
appraisal, procurement of larger quantities through ICB resulted in lesser
than prorated increases for the foreign costs of these items. Local costs
expressed in US$ increased in proportion to the number of additional lines
in the revised project. When expressed in BuF the basic local expenditures
per added line increased by about 37?, according to 'local inflation during
the 1980-1987 implementation period.
5.06      Allocation of Credit Proceeds.  The original and revised
allocation of funds and final disbursement for the credit are shown in
Table 3.5.B in Part III. The revised allocation was agreed in October 1986
to reflect changes in project scope. It was based on actual quantities and
costs of equipment, and it was agreed that the allocation for long distance
system woutld be limited to the down payment for the contract, representing
the available balance of the credit allocation for equipment. In 1984 and
1985, Government and ONATEL arranged for additional financing under
concessional terms from the suppliers' countries (Italy, Netherlands and
France) for the increased foreign costs of the local lines and trunk
systems.
6.        Project Results
6.01      Physical Results.  The physical targets of the project as
planned and achieved are shown in Tables 3.4.A and 3.6.A of Part III.
Additional facilities from the revised project were about twice the initial
number of local telephone lines and four times the number of long distance
circuits, and television transmission was added (Table 3.4.A).
Furthermore, the subscribers, in the 21 cities where automatic telephone
exchanges are operated, could communicate with each other through
nationwide STD service, and subscribers from Bujumbura and the three main
provincial capitals, representing about 87Z of all the working lines, had
access to automatic international service.
6.02      Financial Performance.  In the financial area, the results were
substantially different from what was planned.
(a) ONATEL established an accounting system as requested,
and accountants are now able to produce financial
statements for past years on demand, but those
statements are not fully reliable, because accounting
procedures are still weak, the procurement-inventory
and the billing-receivables cycles do not function
satisfactorily, there is no assets register, and end-
of-year entries are not reliable;



- 6 -
(b) Accounts were examined by independent verificators,
for five financial years during the project period,
but not according to international norms;
(c) Billing was slow because ONATEL is using the services
of a computer contractor. Also, collecting from
Government services and agencier was poor, as
receivables rose to close to two years compared to the
four month-covenant. Budget of Government agencies
are established in such a way that telecommunications
charges are far below actual expenses (para. 4.01);
(d) Tariff studies were carried out as requested, but
decisions were made without consultation with IDA;
(e) Fixed assets were not revalued as requested, so that
rates of return on assets were calculated on book
values. However, it can be inferred that although the
rate of return was well below 102 from 1985 to 1987,
it was above it ir. 1988, when the new equipment was
fully commissioned.
6.03      Rate of Return.  The internal economic rate of return of the
program/project is estimated at 18Z. A high internal rate of return, well
above the opportunity cost of capital estimated at 10?, gives a good
measure of the economic impact of the project within its sector, but it
fails to show the importance of the development of the sector for the
economy of the country. Ai telecommunications project has to be considered
within such a context. P.ecause the telecommunications density in Burundi
is about 1/200th of what it is in most advanced industrial countries and
because increase of such density is linked to increase in GNP, the positive
spill over effects of the project in the economy are probably much higher.
6.04      The project, within the revised program, went beyond its initial
objectives, by quantitatively increasing access to telecommunications
services throughout the country, by bringing to consumers a more complete
coverage of the communications network in the country and by improving the
quality and type of services for both telephone and telex. It also
introduced modern technology through electronic telex and semi electronic
telephone switching systems which are more efficient, expandable and
flexible than electromechanical systems. ONATEL, the entity created to
operate public telecommunications with greater financial and administrative
autonomy, acquired useful experience in the fields of technical planning,
development and operations of the new systems, but remained short of
reaching an acceptable standard of management proficiency.



7.        Project Sustainability
7.01      Telecommunications projects have a certain amount of built-in
sustainability because, under normal circumstances, telephone services are
bound to increase, or at worst to remain stable. This is du., to a variety
of reasons: the economic need for better communications, the social
attraction to improve them, the gap between industrial and developing
countries, the constantly evolving technology which brings equipment and
operating costs down, the high rate of return on assets of well managed
operating agencies and the eagerness of constructors to sell their
equipment, and of lenders to lend funds at concessionary terms. The
obvious risk to sustainability is poor management of the operating agency,
which can lead to reduction in the quality of services offered,
underutilization of equipment and loss of revenues.
7.02      Under this project, demand for services far exceeded forecast
and actual facilities made available during the project period. It is
foreseen that this situation will continue in the future. The newvly
established modern infrastructure for the sector will continue to provide
benefits throughout its economic life for both the installations already
made available and those to be added to expand and complete them.  Dur.ng
project implementation ONATEL prepared its next stage of development,
mainly doubling current existing capacities. The new program is now
underway with IDA's assistance under a second project (Credit 1805-BU).
Enlarged cofinancing from France, Netherlands, African Development Fund and
UNDP was arranged. Further strengthening of sector institutions and
ONATEL's management is also being addressed under a plan to reform and
improve public enterprises in Burundi, with the Bank taking an active role
through relevant structural adjustment and technical assistance operations.
8.        Bank Performance
8.01      Throughout the project, the Bank was able to make a positive
contribution to the development of the sector at a time when sector
responsibilities were handed over from a Government department to a newly
established autonomous entity. The Bank insisted on adequate usage of
consultants in project planning and implementation, and to help ONATEL
build up and improve its administration and financial operations. Table
3.8 gives details of the supervision missions which took place timely at
the pace of two visits each year, except in 1984 and 1985 following project
revision.
8.02      The review of projec.t implementation shows some areas in need of
improvement. This concerned: (i) the demand forecast (para. 5.01) at
project preparation stage; and (ii) follow-up during project implementation
to encourage ONATEL to address in earnest the financial and organizational
issues faced by its management (para 5.03). Steps are being taken to
remedy these weaknesses under the second project, in cooperation with the
other cofinanciers and within the framework of IDA's efforts to improve
public sector management and operations in Burundi.

9.        Borrower's Performance
9.01      Government was the Borrower and ONATEL was the implementing
agency. Table 3.7 in Part III contains a review of the performance of the
Government and ONATEL. in complying with the covenants of the development
credit and project agreements. Government's performance was satisfactory
except for: (i) the settlement of accounts receivable for services
rendered by ONATEL, which was practically disregarded; and (ii) the
decision on and implementation (in consultation with IDA) of changes in
tariff structure and ievel. ONATEL's performance was satisfactory except
for: (i) the setting up of financial management and commercial accounting
systems; (ii) the revaluation of assets and the application of a plan for
periodic revaluation and assets amortization; (iii) the settlement of
accounts receivable from Government; and (iv) the tariff study which was
completed after project closing. The support needed was provided to IDA by
Government and ONATEL during project preparation, appraisal, revision and
supervision.
10.       Project Relationship
10.01     IDA relationship with Government and ONATEL on the project has
been good. Adequate liaison and communication was established and
maintained under the project with the other donors or contributing agencies
(France, Italy, Netherlands, UNDP, etc.).
11.       Consulting Services
11.01     Technical:  The project provided for technical consultancy
services to assist ONATEL in overall project management, detailed planning
and supervision of execution of most of the works.    About 72 man/months
of technical expert services were financed from the proceeds of the credit.
Following project revision and the large increase in the facilities
provided, additional expertise was required in particular for the planning
and supervision of the enlarged external plant and transmission systems.
Experts for approximately 60 additional man/months were provided through
agreements with the bilateral cofinancing agencies (Italy, Netherlands and
France), through UNDP, or as part of the construction contracts. The
services were generally satisfactory.
11.02     Financial Management and Audit.  The performance of the
financial consultant was partially successful. He helped ONATEL set up an
accounting system, but could not complete it. In retrospect, it appears
that the Bank did not follow up his efforts with enough insistence.
Covenant providing for accounts and financial statement audited in
accordance with appropriate principles was insufficientl; fulfilled. The
independent verificators examined the accounts for five financial years
through 1985, but not according to international norms (para 6.02), and the
verificators refused to certify the last verified accounts, per 1985.

11.03     Studies.  The Project Agreement provided for a tariff structure
study to be completed by July 1981. Table 3.6.D gives details of the
purpose of the study as it wa3 defined at appraisal and completed in two
stages. An initial study made in mid-1982 was part of an ongoing UNDP/ITU
technical assistance project. It was considered insufficiently based on
marginal and real costs of the services and weak in its economic aspects.
Government authorized only insignificant changes in tariff levels at that
time (1983). IDA recommended a complementary study which was completed in
1986. Tariff structure was partly revised on the basis of recommendations
from the study, and tariff levels increased by about 40Z in August 1987.
Each time tariffs were changed during the project period, ONATEL and
Government failed to consult with IDA, as required in the Project
Agreement.
12.       Project Documentation and Reporting
12.01     The development credit and project agreements were adequate for
achieving project objectives in the key areas of institutional building and
sector development. As project revision became necessary in the course of
project implementation, it was discussed and agreed with IDA, to allow for
appropriate reallocation and usage of the available development funds. IDA
assisted in determining and arranging for the additional funding required.
ONATEL submitted the necessary information during project supervision and
through quarterly reports for review and updating of the execution of the
works. The reporting and exchange of information was, however, much less
adequate with regard to institution building and strengthening financial
management of ONATEL. This was noted during preparation of the second
project and efforts are being made to improve this aspect under the new
Credit 1805-BU.
12.02     ONATEL and Government have informed IDA that a draft project
completion report is being prepared to reflect the Borrower's perspective
on the project, its implementation, and its results and impact. The report
has not been received yet.
13.       Conclusion and Follow-up Action for Basic Sectoral Objectives
Shortly after the project revision, the Government requested
IDA's assistance for a second project. The complexity of the efforts and
tasks implied by the rapid sector development, both technical and
institutional, constituted a strong rationale for continued IDA involvement
in the sector. Substantial cofinancing was arranged for the physical
component of ONATEL's new program for 1988-92. The thrust of IDA's
continued intervention was put on the institutional and training aspects.
The experience gained through the first project should be fully used by IDA
and the Borrower when implementing the second project which is now
effective under Credit 1805-BU. Also IDA's efforts to support the sector's
institutional development will be associated with those underway by IDA and
Government for public enterprise reform in Burundi. In this context, a
thorough diagnosis of ONATEL's overall organization and operational



- 10 -
situation is already being undertaken by the service in charge of
Government's program for the reform of public enterprises (SCEP). The
diagnosis is expected to determine the measures and an action plan in order
to improve ONATEL's status as a sound and efficient operation. As a whole,
all these efforts and operations should enable to consolidate the
telecommunications sector set-up and managerial/operational capabilities in
Burundi, as required for the balanced and efficient socio-economic
development of the country.

Comments on Tables 3.4.A and B
Project Revision and Completion Dates
1.        Local Telephone:  In the course of project detailed planning,
tha expansion, reuse and adaptation to automatic trunk service of existing
electromechanical exchanges appeared more difficult and costly than
initially expected. Also demand had been underestimated under ONATEL's
1980-84 program. Exchange and external plant capacities were incxtsed to
take the best technical and cost advantage of the new electronic technology
being introduced. Costs obtained through IC9 for switching and
miscellaneous equipment remained within the range of the IDA credit
allocations. Additional cost of external plant were met through bilateral
credit from the supplier's country (Netherlands). Most installations,
including for telex were realized by the end of 1985, about one year beyond
initial schedule.
2.        Long Distance Service:  Capacities of the long distance links
were increased in accordance with the changes made in the local network
systems. Capabilities to interconnect Burundi's long distance system.
including television carrier channels. with those of neighboring countries
(Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire) were also added to the systems. Cost of the
enlarged long distance scheme of radio links was about twofold the ttimate
for the initial system. Down payment of $0.4 million onl" was financed
from Credit 1058-BU. Additional bilateral financing on concessional terms
for about $2.6 million from the supplier's country (Italy) had to be
arranged.. This took about a year through mid-1985. The links were
completed late in 1987, or about three years beyond project schedule as was
estimated during appraisal.

g The overall Increase in total cost of the revised project Is estimated
at about 721. This corresponds to construction of additional
capacities of about twice the initial number of local lines and four
time  the number of LD circuits, plus television transmission (ste
Table 3.4.A).
i/ Overall incr-ese In foreign costs was about 63X. Apparently, ICB and
the procurement of larger quantitios resulted in lesser incroase of
total foreign costs, though unit costs of snow Items (telex

Coments          . 
1. Crowth of Service: Appraisal estioates were based on expected yearly growth of demand
for service and connections of about Xt for telephone and 165 for telex, on averae*. Actual
growth proved to be about 10.65 for telophono and 20X for telox. Project revision attempted
to met part of the growing demand. ONATEL's program did not provide Service In now
locations but the 40 PCOe in isolated villages.
2. Capacity increase of the long distance system and In service faclittieu was prorated to
the additional telephone capacities Installed (see Table 8.4.A).

ApPrasal Estimate               Actual
Internal Economic Rate of Return:          20Z                        182
Underlying Assumptions
1.   Incremental revenues assigned to the program are based on the
traffic increase brought about by the program. with a
progressive reduction, up to 15Z, of traffic per direct exchange
line.
2.   Incremental costs excluding depreciation and interest are based
on the additional assets, traffic and staff requirements brought
about by the program.
3.   Costs have been deflated to bring them to the 1981 price level
and make them comparable with the capital expenditures.
4.   Revenues have been calculated by estimating a portion of the
consumer surplus, with prices expressed in real terms until the
whole program is commissioned, to show that existing and new
subscribers are willing to buy services at tariffs increasing
with inflation, taken at 62 per annum over the period.
5.   Labor has not been shadow priced, as ONATEL mostly employs
skilled staff of which there is no surplus in Burundi.
6.   A sensitivity analysis on the above rate of return shows that
with 10? higher capital and operating costs and 102 lower
revenues, the rate of return would be 12?.
7.   A summary of the program incremental cost and benefit streams,
at 1981 price level for cost and at current price level (until
end of the implementation period) for revenues, is as follows:
Capital                      Operating                        Net

Internal Financial Rate of Return:            liz                        12S
Underlying Assumptions
They are the same as for the internal economic rate of return,
except that incremental revenues have been deflated to bring them to the
1981 price level.
Fiscal Impact
The income taxes paid by ONATEL and assigned over the 20-year
life of the program would be FBu 1,381 million compared to revenues of FBu
6.000 both expressed in 1981 price levels.

aspects                                increased in
08/87
Comments
1/ The initial tariff study was made in mid-1982 with assistance from ITU.
It was mainly based on operational and financial costs and on
comparative data from other telecommunications administrations.
Government did not consider at this time required changes in tariff
structure. Tariff levels were only marginally modified in January 1983.
IDA recommended a complementary study.
2/ The study was made by Radio-Suibse SA (Switzerland) in 1986. It
enabled better determination of the marginal and real costs of the
services. ONATEL was provided with a basis on how to assess tariff
adjustments over time. Tariff structure was revised (in particular
re-introducing monthly rentals) and tariff levels were increased by
about 401 on 08/01/87.
