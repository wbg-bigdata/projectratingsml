PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1793-PO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second
Education Project in Portugal, for which Loan 1793-PO in the amount of
US$40.0 million was approved on April 16, 1980.   The Loan was closed on
December 31, 1987, three years behind schedule. US$5.0 million of the Loan
was cancelled on May 31, 1985, and 87 percent of the Loan (99.9 percent of
the revised Loan amount) was disbursed with the last disbursement on August
22, 1988.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division of Country Department II, EMENA Region (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's supervision
mission in May and October  1987 and May 1988.   The Government  firsc
prepared a draft PCR, which was discussed in October 1988.   An English
translation of their final report is available in the OED files.
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Government's Report; Staff
Appraisal Report and Loan Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1793-POI
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    OBJECTIVES
The objective of the project was to increase the training capacity
of the Ministries of Education (MCE) and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)
by: expanding post-secondary agricultural and industrial training; increasing
the supply of basic and secondary teachers; expanding vocational training at the
secondary level; upgrading university science, engineering and agricultural
instructior.; and by expanding and improving farmer training and rural extension
services (Paragraphs 3.1-3.3).
2.    IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
The most serious delays to project implementation were in the
construction program which was six years behind schedule for some components.
These delays were mainly caused by lack of availability of local counterpart
funds in the development budget  (PIDDAC).   There were also delays due to
managerial problems between executing and approving departments within the
various Ministries concerned (Paragraphs 5.1-5.2). The most important factor
which improved project implementation was the intervention of the coordinating
group of the MOE which removed some of the obstacles to successful implementation
(Paragraphs 4.1, 5.4 and 9.3). Disbursement was slow and by the original closing
date (December 31, 1984) only about 22% of the Loan amount US$40.0 million had
been disbursed.   From 1985 the disbursement pace improved, but the closing date
nevertheless had to be extended three times to Deceraer 31, 1987. Disbursements
continued until August 22, 1988 by which time 99.9% of the revised Loan amount
of US$35.0 million (or 87% of the original loan of US$40.0 million) had been
utilized (Paragraphs 5.5 and 6.7). Even though the Technical Assistance (TA)
was well prelpared and documented in the SAR, and the implementation plans were
agreed at negotiations, the GOP was unable to implement the TA as agreed due to
lack of funds at .ppropriate times. The total TA man-months used (2,150) was
greatly in excess of SAR estimates (991), but due to a larger proportion of both
expert  services and fellowships being provided by Portuguese sources,  the
expenditure on TA (US$1.69 million) was well below SAR estimates (US$2.3 million)
(Paragraphs 6.4, 8.4 and 9.4j.
3.    PROJECT RESULTS
The full impact of the project has yet to be achieved due to delays
in the building program. It is expected that most of the project objectives will
be achieved by about 1993. For some components the SAR estimates for student



- iv -
enrollments have already been exceeded, in others such as teacher training, it
is unlikely that the targets will be reached due to changing needs (Paragraphs
6.1-6.2).   Because other sources of funding for the MAPA components became
available and the MOE was unable to construct all of the proposed vocational
blocks there were several changes to the Loan Agreement. However, construction
of the Setubal Technology Institute was added as an additional component to the
Loan.  Mainly due to exchange rate savings, US$5 million was cancelled from the
Loan in May 1985, but this did not affect project objectives (Paragraphs 6.2-
6.4). The project was completed at a cost of US$55.8 million, compared with an
appraisal estimate of US$59 million and a revised estimate of US$53.6 million.
The project assisted development of the technician training infrastructure by:
(i) widening access to this type of training; (ii) improving the quality of
equipment, teaching aids and teaching; (iii) diversifying the secondary school
curriculum by the inclusion of scientific and vocational practical subjects; (iv)
providing  greater  student  access  to  technalogically  based  courses  in
universities; and {v) increasing the extent and quality of farmer training
(Paragraph 6.5)
4.    SUSTAINABILITY
Experience with the first education project has shown that Portugal
is we   able to sustain projects of this type after Loan closure.  Maintenance
of facilities and equipment has been good and institutions have greatly benefited
from the development project in terms of modern techniques and new approaches.
It is confidently expected that this project will be similarly sustained. A risk
associated with this is that, as the education and training system expands
particularly in technical areas, and the recurrent costs increase, the recurrent
budget increases will riot be adequate to maintain all the institutions at the
appropriate level.   To reduce this risk the GOP should consider measures of
income generation for the institutions to supplement the normal budget.
5.    FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
The major lessons of experience relevant to other projects are:
(i)   To enable physical implementation of projects to occur according to
schedule it is necessary for the Government to ensure that financial
resources are available not only in total but also on an annual basis
according to the planned implementation schedule.
(ii)  The exist .   of the MOE coordinating group was very beneficial to
project implementatior and it should be continued in future projects.
It could be made ever, more efficient by involving the individual
component managers more directly in its work, and thus increasing
its capacity to make executive decisions.



- v -
(iii) Training in educational planning, project management, financial
management and in Bank procedures needs to be given to PIU staff
early in the project cycle and repeated as necee ary for the ben_fit
of newly appointed staff. The PIU staff should be Ldentified prior
to Loan ne.gotiation.
(iv) TA should be well planned and coordinated with non-project TA, and
the implementation schedule followed to avoid ad hoc arrangements
and delays in availability of trained staff at crucial stages of
project development. The full commitment of the Government to the
TA plan is essential.
(v)   Measures to aid teacher recruitment and retention in the ESEs and
ESTs should be investigated, e.g., comparability of status and
remuneration between universities and these institutes (Paragraphs
8.4 and 9.5).

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1793-PO}
PART I
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    PROJECT IDENTITY
Project Name:      Education Project II
Loan Number:       1793-PO
RVP Unit:          Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
Country:           Portugal
Sector:            Education
2.    PROJECT BACKGROUND
2.1          The project was the second in a series designed to raise
educational and skill sta'dards particularly those related to the industrial
and agricultural sectors cf employment. It was prepared by the Portuguese
Government using the resultA of studies carried out in the planning of the
first educational project and of pre-investment studies. Identification and
Preparation missions in July and October 1978, and in January 1979, identified
the content of the project which was to support the Government in the
execution of prog.ams relevant to the educational development strategy. The
project was appraised in March 1979. Negotiations were completed in November
1979. The Loan Agreement for US$ 40 million was signed on April 16,1980 and
became effective on July 15,1980
2.2         Sector Development Obiectives.  At the time of Project appraisal
the Government had established priority goals to: (i) increase exports (and
Leduce imports); (ii) increase tourism; and (iii) increase the efficiency of
and restructure units in the manufacturing sectors. To assist in the
achievement of these goals the immediate objectives of the education sector
were to: (i) improve the quality of education and training; (ii) increase the
efficiency of the education system; (iii) selectively expand t'le system in
priority areas; (iii) improve recruitment processes for and training of
teachers; and (iv) restructure management and financing of education with
emphasis on decentralization and relating education development to economic
developmer.t plans and manpower needs.
2.3         Policy Context.  In order to meet the social and economic aims of
Portugal the Government's educational policy emphasized: (i) extension of
compulsory education from four to six years and later to nine years, with a
related broadening of access to education particularly for students living in



- 2 -
more remote areas; (ii) improvement in efficiency of schooling by reducing
high repetition rates; (iii) restructuring secondary education and training to
meet manpower needs, by integration of technical schools into a diversified
educdtion system and introduction of practical work for all students, with in
depth practice for 50% of the students; (iv) improving the training and
qualifications of the teaching force at all levels; (v) increasing enrollments
in non-university higher education particularly in agriculture, science and
engineering; and (vi) strengthening business and management training.
2.4         Linkages Between Proiect. Sector and Macro Policy Objectives.  The
project was designed to link sector and macro economic policy objectives, by
addressing manpower issues in the productive sectors, and was, in the main,
successfully in implemented. There was an awareness at the national level of
the importance of human resource development, particularly related to
technician support for industry and agriculture, for the achievement of the
macro economic objectives. The MOE was aware of the deficiencies in the
existing education and training system and recognized the need for well
trained industrial professionals and technicians to meet the demands of new
technologies. The Project improved the quality and selectively the quantity
of this type of training.
3.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.1         The aim of the project was to increase the training capacity of
the Ministries of Education (MOE) and Agriculture,Fisheries arid Food (MAPA)
with the following specific objectives:
(i) expansion of post-secondary agricultural and industrial
technician training;
(ii) increasing the supply of primary and secondary school
teachers, especially for science and vocational subjects;
(iii) upgrading science teaching;
(iv) expanding vocational and diversified training at the
secondary level;
(v)  expanding and improving farmer training and the capabilities
of the rural extension services; and
(vi) upgrading university science, engineering and agricultural
instruction.
3.2         The Ministry of Education components within the project comprised:
(i) construction, furniture and equipment for 2 Agricultural
Technician  Training Institutes, ESAs, (capacity 720, annual output 220) and
32 Vocational Blocks for Secondary schools (capacity 36,640, annual output
5,900); and
(ii) equipment and technical assistance for 3 Engineering



- 3 -
Technician Training Institutes, ESTs, (capacity 3,400, annual output 900); 11
Vocational Science Blocks fo; Secondary Schools (capacity 12,500, annual
output 2,100); 7 Primary Teacher Training Institutes, ESEs, (capacity 2,220,
annual output 600); 1 Faculty of Education (capacity 500, annual output 450);
1 Faculty of Agriculture (capacity 77O,annual output 120); 1 Faculty of
Veterinary Medicine (capacity 350, annual output 60); 1 Faculty of Engineering
(capacity 6,OOC, annual output 800) and 1 Faculty of Science (capacity 1,600,
annual output 280).
3.3         The Ministry of Ag,iculture and Fisheries component at Loan
signing comprised:
(i) construction, fuLniture, equipment and related technical
assistance for 7 Farmer Training Certers (capacity 240); 3 Demonstration
Centers (capacity 180); and 2 Mobile Training Units (capacity 30); and
(ii) equipment and technical assistance for the Nutriticnal
Education Program and Agricultural information Center
4.    PROJECT DESIGN AND CRGANIZATION
4.1         The Project was based on studies carrted out as part of the first
education project which identified key areas of education requiring further
development, namely: technician training; teacher training; aspects of higher
engineering and scienL. education; and agricultural technician education and
training. These areas coincided with the Government's own priorities, and led
to a project whose objectives were clearly understood by all parties. The
Project was well designed with a flexible approach which enabled the
GoveeLnment to meet the changing needs of the education service, for example,
the advanced courses in secondary school vocational subjects were not well
su.bscribed, so the equipment provided was also used to provide vocational
education for all of the students in the project secondary schools. The timing
of the project was very suitable as it matched the demands for better
qualified manpower relevant to the anticipated needs of Portugal's entry to
the EEC. Management of the project was vested in the Project Implementation
UJnit (PIU) of the MOE and the coordinating role of this body was clearly
defined and understood by all of the participating agencies. Towards the end
of the imple'..ntation period there was a lack of communication between the
Unit and th.. MAPA regarding the status of the Project, the latter being
unaware of the extension of closing date. Other than this there was good
coordination between PIU and MAPA and other involved institutions. Existence
of the PIU greatly assisted Project implementation, particularly with regard
to disbursements during the final year.
5.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.1         The most critical variances between planned and actual project
implementation was in the construction program which was delayed by six years
for some components.  The greatest delays occurred in construction of teacher
traininL institutes, wh.ch are currently scheduled for completion in 1989 and
vocational blocks for Fecondary schools. The delays were, in part, caused by
tardiness in the award of construction contracts which resulted from shortage



- 4 -
of funds, the share of eduicational expenditure as a proportion of total public
expenditure declining fron 14.2% in 1980 to 11.5% in 1984.  Due to these
constraints the construction of eight vocational blocks for secondary
education was indefinit2ly postponed and eventually slipped out of the project
altogether. Other problems of implementation were: delays in the approval and
execution of the designs for construction work; and the lack of coordination
of work programs between those responsible for curriculum development and
pedagogic matters in secondary education and the school design and
construction departments. Project execution was also affected by lack of
experience of staff in handling projects with external financing, especially
aspects of ICB and other regulations which were not part of the traditional
Portuguese administrative routine.
5.2         In the case of the MAPA there were additional implementation
problems cue to: lack of a coordinating ream within the Ministry; intervention
of different gioups of planners in project execution, with resultant
difficulties in reaching a consensus regarding the design of the preliminary
program; and delays caused by bureaucratic procedures for authorizing and
approving successive stages of project implementation. Another factor which
delayed construction of four training centers by about three years, was the
insolvency of contractors and the resultant re-tendering of the four
contracts.
5.3         The appraisal mission correctly identified budgetary procedures
and a fre ze on the hiring of new staff as major risks. In the event, the
most serious constraint to timely implementation of the project was the
shortage of adequate development funds at critical times in the implementation
cycle. This is a recurrent problem with projects in Portugal and one which is
not easily solved. It would be beneficial if, once a project has been given
Government priority, development and recurrent funds were allocated for
project implementation fcr the lifetime of the project.
5.4         The most significant decision which affected project
implementation was the creation of the Coordinating Group for Cooperative
Projects with IBRD (in effect a PIU) in May 1980. This unit took some time to
become established, but by the mid-1980s was functuoning effectively and had
overcome some of the bottlenecks which caused delays in implementation (e.g.,
in 1986 responsibility for educational construct5on work was transferred to
the MOE). From 1985 onwards the rate of financial execution of the project
improved. In addition, much better coordination between different departments
and Ministries was developed.
5.5         The shortage of local funds referred to in 5.1 above, resulted in
slow rate of disbursement. By December 1984, the original closing date, only
about 22% of the loan had been disbursed. Subject to appropriate performance
the Bank -reed to the GOP's request to exterd the closing date three times,
to December 1987. In order to accelerate the rate of disbursement the Loan
Agreement was amended on November 30,1984 to include a "Special Account" of
US$2,600,000.



6.    PROJECT RESULTS
6.1         The full impact of the Project has yet to be achieved, due to
delays in implementation of the building program. It is expected that the
Project will achieve most of the quantitative specific objectives set at
appraisal. For some components these have already been exceeded (e.g., total
enrollments in University Faculties, Engineering Training Institutes and
Secondary Schools). In other cases it is unlikely that the targets will be
reached, for example the recruitment for the advanced vocational courses in
secondary schools has shown no signs of improvement, the pupils preferring the
more traditional academic stream. The SAR estimated an annual enrollment of
about 21,000; to date the figure is only about 2,500. Similarly the
enrollment for Teacher Training Institutes is currently about 700 against an
estimated 2,200; it is possible that this will improve slightly when the new
buildings are completed. In view of the declining birth rate in Portugal
there is a need to review school teacher provision after which the role of the
Teacher Training Institutions may require redefinition. When the facilities
are completed the Agricultural Technician Training lnstitutes should have no
difficulty in reaching the SAR target enrollment figures, as the existing
first year intake is on target. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAPA) coiponent has increased the number of Farmei Training Centers by
seven, with another to be completed in 1989. Five of these centers are
functioning at abDut 80% capazity and have provided 115 long courses of 220
days duration as well as 236 shorter courses, with 1,870 and 3,576
participants respectively. These figures, which average about 750 p.a., and
will be higher when the additional three centers are completed, are well in
excess of appraisal estimates, due to better utilization of the available
accommodation by running overlapping courses.
6.2         Project scope was extended (November 1984) by the inclusion of
construction work for the Setubal Technology Institute, which had been a
component of the first education project, but had been removed due to problems
with the design architects and availability of local funds for construction
work. The objectives for this additional component were compatible with those
of the project, namely to increase the supply and quality of industrial
technicians. This Institute has been completed, a course in electrical
engineeriLg has commenced and it is planned to commence courses in production
engineering, control engineering, and electronics during the academic year
1989. This Institute is attempting to establish strong links with local
industry, by having representatives of small and medium sized private industry
as well as from public enterprises on it's Consultative Council. The
Institute has difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified teachers due to
(i) competition with private industry; (ii) the status of technical education
and (iii) competition from Universities. It is very important that methods be
developed for staff recruitment and retention so that the capital investment
in physical resources is not wasted.
6.3         The MAPA component was also changed.  In October 1982 the
Technical Assistance (TA) component war, cancelled, as the GOP had obtained
other sources of TA. At the same time equipment for the nutritional education
program and information center; and two mobile centers were dropped from the



project.   In October 1983 the number of regional farmers training centers was
increased from seven to eight, with a corresponding reduction from three to
two of the demonstration centers and changes of location for the latter, which
were incorporated into the Patacao Regional Center as outstations. The reason
for these changes was to provide a better training coverage of the active
farming population.
6.4         Technical assistance was effectively utilized in the MOE.  In
MAPA, as alternative non-project sources of TA had been identified, Loan funds
were not used for this purpose. The TA included fellowships for training
staff in the Faculties of Agriculture, Education, Engineering, Science and
Veterinary Medicine. Fellowship training was provided for the staff of
teacher training and agricultural technician training institutes. Visiting
experts in curriculum development, rural engineering, home economics and
animal production were also funded by the project. About 2,150 man-months
were used mainly for fellowship training more than double the SAR estimate
(991). These training activities benefited from bilateral agreements between
the GOP and the United Kingdom and France. As a result of these agreements
and due to the execution of a large proportion of the training through
Portuguese Institutions, including in particular the National Institute for
Scientific Research (INIC), only about 70% of the funds allocated to TA were
used even though the extent of training was much greater than envisaged at
appraisal.
6.5         The project assisted development of the technician training
infrastructure by increasing: (i) the number of training places available; and
(ii) the geographical distribution of institutions, thereby widening the
access to this type of training. It has improved the level and quality of
equipment, teaching aids, en-d teaching.  The enrollment of women on many of
these courses is increasing and has thus given better opportunities for
training to the female popul.ation. It has also provided more diverse
education to secondary schoo:l pupils by giving some basic vocational training
as part of the compulsory curriculum. In the area of farmer training it has
increased the number of cent;ers and localities with training facilities, and
has enhanced the quality of farmer training. The investment in the university
faculties has helped to provide for greater student access to technologically
based courses and to provide opportunities for experience with modern
equipment and techniques. It is too early to assess the impact that this
education and training will have on Portugal's economy but with full
integration into the EEC by 1992, this type of development is likely to have
long term benefits.
COSTS
6.6         As a result of the above changes US$1,600,000 was transferred to
the furniture and equipment category of the MOE, although this was not needed
as the MOE itself requested cancellation of US$5 million from this category in
May 1985. The cancèllation of this amount was the result of project savings
due to the devalua_ion of the escudo vis-a-vis the US dollar and lower than
estimated construction costs v i did not effect the achievement of project
objectives. Another change in financial provision was that the reimbursable
expenditure from IBRD on the civil works category was increased from 30% to



- 7 -
40%, due to the increase in the relative weighting of imported building items.
6.7         The project was completed at a cost of escudos 7,328 million which
was a factor of 2.6 above appraisal estimated costs (escudos 2,810 million),
although some components, with a total estimated cost of escudos 61 million,
were removed from the prcject, and the number of vocational blocks being
funded by the project was reduced from 43 to 35 with an estimated saving of
escudos 162 million. These high local currency costs can be attributed to two
factors; (i) the foreign exchange rate of escudo to US$ increased from 48 at
appraisal to 168 in 1985 and remained at an average value of about 145 to Loan
closing; and (ii) the price escalation factors were estimated with a project
closing date of December 1984 which was successively extended with the last
disbursement in August 1988. The total actual dollar cost of the project was
US$55.8 million, or about 6.5X% ,elow appraisal estimate (US$59 million). The
expenditure on individual categories is given in the project cost table in
Part III. In summary, civil works expenditures were 46%, and furniture and
equipment 26% above appraisal estimates, whereas TA was 26% below estimate.
6.8         The financing of the project was planned with the Bank
contributing 67.8% of the total finance and 100% of the foreign exchange
costs, with the balance being financed from GOP sources. Actual financing of
the total costs was 62.7% by the Bank (including 100% of foreign exchange
costs) and 37.3% by GOP sources. US$5.0 million of the Loan amount was
cancelled in May 1985 because of a favorable exchange rate for the US dollar
vis-a-vis the escudo and local cost savings. The balance was practically
fully disbursed when the account closed (August 22, 1988).
7.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILIIY
7.1         Experience with the first education project has shown that
Portugal is well able to sustain projects of this type after Loan closure.
Maintenance of facilities and equipment has been good and institutions have
greatly benefited from tha development project in terms of modern techniques
and new approaches. It is confidently expected that this project will be
similarly sustained. A risK associated with this is that, as the education
and training system expands particularly in technical areas, and the recurrent
costs increase, the recurrent budget increases will not be adequate to
maintain all the institutions at the appropriate level. To reduce this risk
the GOP should consiuer measures of income generation for the institutions to
supplement the normal budget.
8.    BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1         The main strength of the Bank's performance on this project was
the technical advice provided to the burrower throughout the project cycle,
which enabled many problems affecting project implementation to be resolved.
The Bank was partly responsible for initiating MOE training activities
focussed on education planning, project preparation, rroject monitoring, and
disbursements. This training assisted the MOE in better utilization of it's
staff concerned with these aspects of educational development.  The
supervision field missions were of a level and frequency appropriate to
project requirements.  This coupled wittl a flexible approach by the Bank to



problems identified by the GOP, led to development of extremely good
relationships between the Bank and the GOP's project executing agencies. This
contributed to achievement of the project's objectives and to a high Loan
utilization. The Bank may have been weak in accepting statements of intent
from the concerned agencies without timely follow-up to ensure that the
statements were implemented.
8.2         The project was well identified and continued the development of
technician and teacher education commenced in the first education project and
covered some of the areas excluded from it. It was well focussed and well
prepared and costed.  In the appraisal process more attention should have been
given to the problems arising in the first project eg. slow disbursement,
delays in civil works and lack of local funds. In light of the experience with
the previous project, which required nearly seven years for implemetitation,
the SAR was over optimistic in anticipating project completion in four years.
8.3         The lessons of experience relevant to other projects are
summarized below:
(i) Care should be taken to assess the Government's capacity to
provide local counterpart funds on an annual basis, and then use this to
estimate a realistic implementation period;
(ii) Training in educational planning, project management,
financial management and in Bank procedures needs to be given to PIU staff
early in the project cycle and repeated as necessary for the benefit of newly
appointed staff. The PIU staff should be identified prior to Loan
negotiation;
(iii) TA should be well planned and coordinated with non-project
TA, and the implementation schedule followed to avoid ad hoc arrangements and
delays in availability of trained staff at crucial stages of project
development. The full commitment of the Government to the TA plan is
essential.
9.    BORROWER PERFOPRANCE
9.1         The main strength of the borrowers performance was the commitment
to project objectives and determination to achieve them. The weakness was in
the lack of ability to provide local counterpart funds at appropriate times
for project implementation due to insufficient development budget funds in
PIDDAC.
9.2          During project preparation the GOP and MOE provided sufficient
background informazior, and statistics to support the project proposal, which
was well prepared and presented. The borrower was very cooperative with the
Bank in all s       oages of ..oarn signing and during implementation.
9.3          Tl.e ,IC, eme   of the project was vested in the MOE (for
educational com,:onents) and !.APA (for farmer training centers). For the MOE,
the project was t:xecutet- r, the Director Generals of: (i) School Equipment;
(ii) Educatir;&I :f ka.-z;aructure ( prior to 1985 school construction was the



9-
responsibility of D.G. of School Construction in the Ministry of Social
Infrastructure); and (iii) Higher Education and by the managers of the various
institutes benefiting from the Loan. Thus the coordination of project
management was involved and complex, and there were some problems in project
management due to: (i) delays in the approval and execution of the designs for
construction of the Vocational Blocks, ESEs and ESAs; (ii) the inadequate
amounts of funds allocated annually to the project; (iii) lack of definition
of teacher training programs; and (iv) lack of coordination of work programs
between the Directorate for secondary school programs and the construction
department. A special unit had been iormally established in 1979 to
coordinate project management for the education components (and projects) with
IBRD. Although it did not have responsibility for project execution, it
performed well and greatly assisted project implementation, by overcoming a
number of constraints which were related to administrative procedures and
interdepartmental linkages. It also played an important role in maintaining
project linkages with the Bank. There were also problems in the management of
the MAPA component due to: (i) lack of a coordinating team with the
appropriate composition and background to define objectives and operating
principles; (ii) the involvement of uncoordinated different groups of planners
in project execution, which made the identification and design of preliminary
programs difficult; (iii) delays by the Directorate of Buildings in
authorizing and approving contracts; (iii) bankruptcy of some contractors; and
(iv) restriction of expenditure and lack of local funds.
9.4          The MOE had difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequately
qualified teaching staff, particularly for technician institutes, teacher
training institutes and vocational subjects in secondary schools, which
affected the extent and quality of the training imparted. Methods for
increasing teacher recruitment and retention need to be developed. The TA
component lacked cohesion, although the number of TA man-months used was in
excess of SAR proposals. A TA implementation plan was prepared early in the
project cycle and well documented in the SAR, but due to budget constraints it
was poorly implemented.   The thrust of TA was lost, due to funds not being
available at appropriate times and in sufficient quantity, to enable a
comprehensive and integrated TA input to occur. The MOE attempted to provide
TA to the developing institutions by utilizing existing programs where funding
already existed (eg. from INIC). These programs were not always appropriate
for the development needs. However, overall the MOE did well to provide this
extent of TA under difficult circumstances.
9.5         The main lessons of experience for the borrower which may be
relevant to preparation and implementation of future projects are summarized
below:
(i) To enable physical implementation of projects to occur in a timely
and coordinated manner, it is necessary for the GOP to ensure that financial
resources are available not only in total but also on an an .al basis
according to the planned implementation schedule;
(ii) The existence of the MOE coordinating group was very beneficial to
project implementation and it should be continued in future projects. It could
be made even more efficient by involving the individual compon    managers



- 10
more directly in its work, and thus increasing its capacity to make executive
decisions;
(iii) In view of a changing demographic situation and variations in
teacher supply, an evaluation needs to be made of the future requirements for
teachers and of the role of the ESEs. Recommendations should be made for the
evolution of the ESEs;
(iv) Close collaboration should be established between the universities
and technical institutes to increase the utilization of qualified teachers and
to promote the development of joint post-graduate programs to serve the staff
training needs of the technical institutes;
(v) Measures to aid teacher recruitment and retention in the ESEs and
ESTs should be investigated. eg. comparability of status and remuneration
between universities and these institutes.
10.   PROJECT RELATIONSHIPS
10.1        Relationships between the Bank and GOP were very good, each
partner assizting the other in every possible way. The GOP was always
prepared to seriously consider advice offered by the Bank and to often
incorporate it in the project. The Bank was sympathetic to requests of the
GOP and usually met them, as is illustrated by the number of amendments to the
Loan Agreement and by three extensions to the closing date.
11.   PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
11.1        The Staff Appraisal Report and major working papers were well
prepared and adequate in content. Data on the project was obtained from files
in the EMENA information office, which were well maintained and adequate in
content. Project implementation reports by the GOP provided useful information
on project progress, which taken together with the GOP's project completion
acted as prime sources of data for this report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN(1A793-PO)
PART II
PROJECT REVIEW nROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
13.   COMMENT ON ANALYSIS IN PART I
13.1        The Bank's description in Part I follows very closely the
Completion Report prepared by the Portuguese authoritles. It should be
stressed that:
(i)   The project played a significant role in the decentralization of
education institutions and the creation of new ones, expanding training
capacity in basic areas of development. This training was supported and
subsequently expanded through cofinancing from European Community Structural
Funds, given its importance in terms of Portugal's development priorities from
the standpoint of full integration into the Community; the development of
Portugal's human resources is a priority aspect of this process.
(ii)   From the perspective of the Ministry of Education, students
benefiting from project activities in 1987/88 represented 131 of the students
enrolled in public higher education at universities and polytechnics, as well
as all the students in the Higher Schools of Engineering. It should also be
noted that the implementation of the project in these institutes also helped
to make the education system more consistent in that it contributed to their
integration into Higher Polytechnic Education, which occurred in 1988.
(iii)   Vocational training in secondary schools, which in 1987/88 was
being given to 2368 students, facilitated better links between secondary and
polytechnic education, and also helped to diversify the regional supply and
demand for education.
13.2        As section 6.1, Project Results, makes clear, it is important that
the role of the Higher Schools of Education be reconsidered in light of the
falling birth rate in Portugal. Arrangements must also be made to stabilize
and train teachers in Higher Polytechnic Education and to establish links
between this segment of higher education and the universities; equivalency
benchmarks must be established between the two kinds of institution,
especially as regards their status. Further information is provided in the
attached summary of project results in which the institutions' capacity is
expressed in terms of numbers of students.
