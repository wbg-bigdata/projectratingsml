MAROC-PHOSPHORE PHOSPHATE FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Maroc-Phosphore
Guarantor:          Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:             US$50 million in various currencies
Terms:               14 years, including 4 years of grace with interest at
7.35 percent per annum. 1/ In addition, a fee of 2.65
percent would be charged by the Guarantor.
Project
Description:         The project consists of the expansion of the Borrower's
production facilities at Safi, for which a Bank Loan of
US$50 million was made in 1974 (Loan 1017-MOR), through:
(a) the erection, on the site of the existing Maroc-
Phosphore plant, of an additional unit to produce
for export 165,000 tons per year of phosphoric
acid, complete with ancillary facilities and
related civil works;
(b) the construction of sulfur melting units and sul-
fur storage facilities; and the construction of
new phosphoric acid concentration and storage
facilities.
Once in full production, the net export value of the
entire plant output will be about US$200 million per year
in 1978 terms; the expansion project with an estimated
financial rate of return (after taxes) of 15 percent and
an economic rate of return of 19 percent, and the entire
project with an estimated financial rate of return (after
taxes) of 14 percent and an economic rate of return of
19 percent. No special implementation and market risks
are expected.
1/   These terms are appropriate on project grounds.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MAROC PHOSPHORE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A PHOSPHATE FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Maroc-Phosphore, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Morocco, for
the equivalent of US$50 million to help finance a phosphate fertilizer
expansion project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, including 4
years of grace, with interest at 7.35 percent per annum. The Government of
Morocco would charge a guarantee fee of 2.65 percent per annum on the out-
standing amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to Maroc-
Phosphore to 10 percent per annum. It is expected that the Polish Government
will contribute US$13.7 million equivalent towards the cost of the project
with a term of 14 years including 4 years of grace with interest at 7.25
percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Country Economic Memorandum on Morocco" (1473-MOR)
was distributed to the Executive Directors in June 1977. An economic mission
visited Morocco in February/March 1978 in preparation of a basic economic
mission scheduled for November 1978. The findings and conclusions of this
mission are reflected in the following paragraphs. Country Data Sheets are
attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        Over the past year, Morocco completed the return towards a parlia-
mentary regime. Following the national consensus that had resulted from
the Western Sahara issue, King Hassan II called municipal, provincial and
national elections between November 1976 and April 1977. Opposition parties
with platforms stressing social reform scored strongly in municipal elections
in the larger cities, while at the provincial level, the rural constituencies
supported Government candidates, who obtained a majority of 141 seats out of
264 in the National Assembly. The post-election Government formed in October
1977, brought back into political responsibility the Istiqlal party which
had been in the opposition since 1963, and the Mouvement Populaire whose main
support is in the Berber areas of the country. The new Cabinet was appointed
with the explicit mandate to prepare and implement economic austerity measures,
the first of which were included in the 1978 Budget Law, and to pursue the
social development objectives introduced with the 1973-77 Development Plan.
4.        Morocco's economic and financial situation has been less balanced
in 1977 than in previous years. The rapid growth of investments and imports,
carried over from 1974-75 when phosphate export receipts reached an all-time
high, did not slow down despite Government restrictions, while the world



-2 -
demand for Morocco's main exports, especially phosphate, recovered only
moderately. At the same time, efforts to increase budgetary savings were
insufficient to meet the continued increase in expenditures on investment and
security. As a result, in 1977 Morocco registered a large resource gap (15
percent of GDP) and overall budget deficit (15 percent of GDP), not including
special military import payments and offsetting external grants. To cover
these deficits, Morocco sharply increased external borrowings to $1.7 billion
(commitments), from $878 million in 1976 and $710 million in 1975; most were
from commercial sources. Despite these borrowings, the country's net foreign
assets stayed at a rather low level (1.2 months of 1977 imports by year's
end). On the domestic side, external borrowings have fueled monetary expan-
sion which remained rapid in 1977; consumer prices rose nearly 13 percent over
1976 compared to about 8 percent in the previous two years.
5.        The Government intends to reverse these unfavorable trends.     A first
policy package was introduced with the 1978 Budget Law, which cut Government
capital expenditure by DH 2 billion (4 percent of 1977 GDP), introduced tax
measures which should yield an estimated DH 550 million (1 percent of 1977
GDP) and contained current expenditure in sectors other than education, health
and defense. Private credit expansion was limited to 3 percent for the first
six months of 1978 and a number of imports were subjected to quantitative
restrictions or higher tariffs. Furthermore, following the deterioration in
the balance of payments which occurred during the first six months of 1978,
the Government introduced a second policy package in June 1978. It includes
a number of exchange and trade measures which aim at further tightening of
import controls, encouraging workers' remittances from abroad, and raising
interest rates for several types of deposits. Moreover, the Government intends
to further reduce its capital expenditure to DH 7 billion (DH 10 billion in
1977). These measures may cause total investment to decline by 25 percent in
1978 and result in a substantial reduction in demand for imported capital and
intermediate goods. Simultaneously, favorable weather conditions during the
past winter should result in record crops enabling Morocco to reduce imports,
particularly of cereals, and to maintain GDP growth at around 6 percent.
External demand for phosphate rock is also expected to pick up and phosphate
exports may reach their 1974 peak level without a recovery of prices. As a
result, Morocco's resource gap may narrow to about 9 percent of GDP in 1978,
and external borrowing needs may be reduced to around $1 billion in commitment
terms.
6.        The Government also announced that instead of a five-year plan (1978-
82), a three-year interim plan (1978-80) will be introduced in Parliament
before the end of 1978. This plan will call for a reorientation emphasizing
socially-oriented and directly productive and export-oriented projects. Imple-
mentation of many major public projects has been postponed including that of
a steel plant at Nador. In the meantime, ministries and other Government
agencies are operating under the 1978 budget law which includes projects
carried over from the 1973-77 plan and a few new projects.
7.        The policy measures described above should be effective in re-
balancing the economy. They essentially mean retrenchment and will affect
adversely GDP growth and employment creation. Furthermore, the Government



- 3 -
is aware that continued prudence in financial management and project selection
will probably be needed in the next two years, in order to achieve the objective
of putting the economy back on a financially sound growth path for the medium
term. The Government is, however, likely to adopt a policy mix which will put
less emphasis on retrenchment, and give more weight to export promotion, addi-
tional tax measures, and an increase in domestic savings.
Economic Development Issues and Prospects
8.         Bank projections summarized in Annex I testify to the Government's
keen concern of avoiding a liquidity crisis in the next two to three years.
They assume sharp policy adjustments in order to keep the economy on a finan-
cially viable growth path over the long run, but also reflect the Government's
desire to maintain adequate GDP and employment growth during the adjustment
period, and to achieve further progress towards the country's social objectives.
The projections show that investment and GDP growth will indeed have to be
curtailed for the next three to four years, given the short-term constraints
on savings and exports. In this period, Morocco will need substantial capital
transfers from abroad to sustain the projected investment and GDP growth
levels; these transfers should be on terms as favorable as possible in view
of the debt service limits. Beyond 1982, Morocco's export prospects should
enable it to resume rapid growth of investments, output and employment while
progressively reducing the relative burden of debt and debt service.
9.        In the original 1973-77 Plan, annual GDP growth was to average 7.5
percent, sustained by rapid export expansion (10 percent p.a.) and a doubling
of investments between 1972 and 1977. Following the large windfalls in foreign
exchange and domestic savings caused by high phosphate prices in 1974-75, the
investment target was raised to meet cost increases and some real expansion
of original investment programs, and especially to undertake large capital-
intensive projects geared to import substitution (in particular sugar, chemi-
cals, shipping and steel).
10.       The GDP growth target for 1973-77 was nearly met.     Investment rose
to nearly 32 percent of GDP in 1977 from less than 14 percent in 1972. In
the process, Morocco built up its capacity to prepare, implement and absorb
projects, not only in traditional sectors such as irrigation, import-
substitution industries and physical infrastructure, but also in new and
more difficult sectors such as rainfed and small-scale agriculture, export
industries, and socially-oriented programs. There is little doubt that
Morocco can achieve the investment levels assumed in the Bank projections.
11.       The major shortcoming in the past, and the main problem for the
years ahead, concerns domestic savings, which returned in 1977 to about the
same level (14 percent) as in 1972 after a brief increase to 16 percent dur-
ing the phosphate windfall years. The reasons lie mainly with the low Govern-
ment savings of only 4.5 percent of GDP in 1977. Successful efforts to raise
current Government revenues to 23 percent of GDP in 1977 were offset by
increases in current spending, partly for education and health, but particu-
larly for price subsidies and military expenses. To increase public savings



- 4 -
in future will require tax reform measures, which were called for in the 1973-
77 Plan but were not implemented, and unpopular price policy decisions, such
as reducing subsidies to urban consumers, farmers and industrial investors.
In particular, improving domestic resource mobilization would require adjust-
ing interest rates to reflect changes in the rate of domestic price inflation.
12.       During the 1973-77 Plan period, exports rose by less than 2 percent
p.a. in real terms (the Plan target was 10 percent). This lackluster per-
formance was largely due to weak external demand for Morocco's main export
products since 1974, especially phosphate, other minerals and agricultural
products. Moreover, with some exceptions, such as textiles, export production
and marketing were not sufficiently improved, and new markets were not aggres-
sively sought; the dependence on EEC (especially French) demand continued.
Yet, Morocco has considerable export potential which can be realized if pro-
duct and market diversification is pursued aggressively. Export programs
are under preparation especially in phosphate, its derivatives, fresh and
processed foodstuffs, and tourism. For example, with regard to phosphate,
Morocco and the USSR signed agreements in March 1978, under which Morocco will
be able to export phosphate rock and phosphoric acid for the next thirty years
in amounts possibly rising to 10 million tons per year by 1985-86; in return,
the USSR will lend Morocco up to $2 billion on favorable terms to develop its
phosphate export capacity and will export various commodities and goods to
Morocco, including crude oil. These agreements substantially improve Morocco's
long-term prospects for phosphate exports.
13.       While the Government's stress on completion of high-return projects
will have to be continued, a qualitative shift in investment, away from the
recent emphasis on highly capital intensive, import substitution investments,
as well as from some of its ambitious programs for physical infrastructure,
will also be needed. A major study on industrial investment strategy which
consultants are currently completing for the Government, should facilitate a
better investment selection. A changed investment pattern should help both
to reduce the external resource gap, and to contribute to growth and employ-
ment at lower investment and import costs than in recent years.
Social Development Strategy
14.       Comparatively slow economic growth and employment creation up to
the early 1970's were accompanied by widening income disparities and per-
ceptible declines in real consumption for the weaker sections of Morocco's
population. The 1973-77 Plan set out, as a national objective, to reverse
these unfavorable trends. The Government's strategy since 1973 has empha-
sized: (i) acceleration of employment creation; (ii) general measures aimed
at reducing income disparities, and (iii) specific investment programs tar-
getted on the least favored population groups.
15.       Progress has been made towards attaining these objectives, as wit-
nessed for example by the increased expenditures for social sectors (from
DH 1.3 billion in 1972 to DH 3.7 billion in 1977). The institutions, how-
ever, often newly established to meet social sector objectives, are in many
instances still fragile. Understaffing and weak policy analysis and program



formulation are still common. Public programs to improve productivity, col-
lective amenities and social services are, as a result, reaching relatively
small proportions of the large groups, especially in rural areas. To add to
this, in the period of financial stringency ahead, Morocco will not be able to
sustain the current level of expenditures on socially oriented sectors, and
cuts have been made as part of the measures to re-balance the economy.
16.       With the population growth rate now at about 3 percent, the pres-
sure to provide adequate social services will increase and it will become
increasingly incumbent on the Government, despite its short-term financial
constraints, to intensify its effort to limit such growth. Consequently
both health and family planning services will have to be quantitatively and
qualitatively strengthened to meet the Government's social objectives.
External Debt And Debt Service
17.       Morocco has sharply increased external borrowings since 1973
(para. 4). Nearly all of the increase came from Arab and commercial sources.
With a hardening of terms on new commitments, average maturity shortened
from 19 to 10 years and average interest rose from 5 to 7.5 percent between
1974 and 1977. Morocco also drew on the IMF automatic credit facilities in
early 1976, and obtained about US$70 million in IMF compensatory financing in
August 1978. From the low levels registered in 1974-75, Morocco's external
debt has risen rapidly to an estimated $3.8 billion (disbursed only) at the
end of 1977, and in that year debt service amounted to nearly $250 million
(13 percent of exports and 10 percent of exports and workers' remittances).
As a result of recent and projected borrowings, debt and debt service may be
expected to increase further, and the debt service ratio may reach a peak of
about 25 percent of exports and workers' remittances by 1980-82, and decline
progressively thereafter. The country's net foreign assets may be expected
to remain at a relatively low level. Because of the expected upswing in debt
service, external debt management has become more restrictive and selective
in 1978. If debt service is to stay manageable, Morocco will have to con-
tinue this policy over the next few years. Additional commercial borrowing
should be limited, and increased efforts should be made to seek loans on
softer terms. External borrowing requirements are nonetheless likely to be
sizeable. Assuming debt service should not in any year exceed 25 percent of
exports and workers' remittances, Bank projections foresee average annual
borrowing needs of $1.3 billion in 1978-82 and $1.5 billion in 1983-87 in
terms of commitments. Beyond 1980, however, the situation should progressively
improve with the Government exercising firm control over domestic demand, and
good long-term prospects for exports--in particular, of assured sales of phos-
phate rock and phosphate derivatives. Morocco should therefore be considered
creditworthy for further Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
18.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 37 projects, financ-
ing a total of $918.9 million (net of cancellations), of which $705 million



- 6 -
has been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling $50 mil-
lion, have been made available for five projects. A Third Window loan for
$25 million for the third education project was approved in March 1976. IFC
investments have amounted to $12.6 million ($10.5 million after cancellations,
terminations, repayments and sales). Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of August 31, 1978, and
notes on the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases, delays
in project implementation have been caused by management or procurement
difficulties, and in 1974 cost overruns increased due to the upsurge in
investment activity in Morocco and the acceleration of inflation. Overall
performance in project execution however, has considerably improved during
the last three years. Total disbursements as of December 31, 1977, amounted
to 81 percent of original appraisal forecasts and to 85 percent of revised
forecasts.
19.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the agricultural
and industrial sectors, which have accounted for 32 and 31 percent, respec-
tively, of total net commitments; the balance is represented by utilities (18
percent), tourism (8 percent), roads (5 percent), education (4 percent) and
urban development (2 percent). Apart from the transfer of resources to
Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted to 5.5 percent of total fixed
investment in 1970-74), the main objectives of lending were to foster and
strengthen development institutions, provide technical assistance especially
for project preparation, and increase productive capacity, particularly in
order to improve the balance of payments.
20.       While these objectives remain, greater emphasis is being given to
prepare projects that support the Government's policy of fostering social
development and improving income distribution. An increasing share of Bank
Group lending will be devoted to projects directly or indirectly developing
the productive capacity of the lowest urban and rural income groups and
meeting their basic needs, including, possibly, Bank participation in the
Government's program for promoting integrated regional development, which is
under discussion.
21.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development,
credit and, through a first operation in FY75, improvement in the produc-
tivity of rainfed farming. Continued selective lending for irrigation is
envisaged but emphasis will be increasingly given to support small farmers
and the development of rainfed areas. The Fez-Karia-Tissa Agriculture Proj-
ect, approved in June 1978 was the second, after the Meknes Project (Credit
555-MOR) to directly address these objectives with the added advantage of
being located in the favorable cereal producing zone. An integrated rural
development project, including livestock/forestry development, is under
preparation in a rainfed zone in northern Morocco, as are projects aimed at
extending agricultural credit to farmers and at developing production, mar-
keting and processing of vegetables on small holdings. A Government program
for promoting integrated regional development is also under discussion.
22.       Projects in industry and tourism have had as key objectives increased
foreign exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies,



which have taken on increased importance in view of the country's short-term
resource constraints. The recently approved eighth loan to BNDE included a
pilot small-scale industry component. A follow-up project to promote labor
intensive investments is under preparation. The proposed loan would finance
the addition of a fourth production line of phosphoric acid for the Maroc
Phosphore Plant financed under Loan 1017-MOR. Continued lending for industry
through the Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) is con-
templated as well as further lending to Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH)
for tourism development. A port project is also under consideration to assist
the Government's efforts to develop year-round importing facilities for
Morocco's growing oil needs.
23.       Previous lending for utilities has consisted of one loan for water
supply, two loans for power and one engineering loan for the preparation
of a sewerage project for Casablanca. A follow up project for water supply
and distribution in urban centers, including distribution to low income urban
consumers, is under preparation, as are a sewerage project in Agadir and a
village electrification project.
24.       Education continues to need attention in ensuring Morocco's develop-
ment. Two credits and a loan have been made to develop secondary education
and teacher training, to improve technical and vocational training, and to
expand facilities in rural areas. A fourth project with emphasis on technical
education has been recently negotiated.
25.       The recently approved Rabat project was the first Bank-financed
project in the urban sector. Follow up projects are under consideration to
support the Government's program for slum upgrading and urban development
through the provision of basic infrastructure, housing and social. services
and the creation of employment opportunities.
26.       Loan commitments from multilateral and bilateral official sources
to Morocco rose from $221 million in 1975 to $294 million in 1976 and $634
million in 1977. The major sources of aid were France, Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group. At the end of 1977, the Bank Group's
share in Morocco's outstanding and disbursed external public debt was 10
percent. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was 24 percent in 1976
and declined to 14 percent in 1977. By 1983 the Bank Group's shares in debt
outstanding and in debt service are expected to be about 25 percent and 12
percent respectively.
PART III - PHOSPHATE FERTILIZER AND PHOSPHORIC ACID MARKET 1/
27.       Background on the phosphate fertilizer and phosphoric acid market
was provided in Part III of my Report dated May 17, 1974 (P-1449) to the
1/   Phosphoric acid, P205, an intermediate product in the manufacture of
concentrate phosphatic fertilizers, is generally produced by reacting
phosphate rock and sulfuric acid.



- 8 -
Executive Directors, and is attached hereto under Annex IV. The predictions
made with regard to an expected decline in phosphate prices have in fact
occurred and prices (about $33 per ton FAS for high grade Moroccan rock)
are presently about 50 percent below the peak prices that were obtained
in 1974. These high prices which remained in force throughout most of 1975
had, however, a more adverse effect on consumption growth than had been
predicted so that the world phosphate consumption in 1976/77 reached only
about 26.3 million nutrient tons as compared to the 31.3 million tons fore-
cast for that year in 1974. The consumption pattern of phosphatic fertilizer
has remained as predicted and presently about two thirds of such consumption
occurs in North America, Western and Eastern Eurcpe including the USSR.
Worldwide supply capability of phosphate fertilizers in the same year (1976/
77) had reached about 29.3 million nutrient tons, indicating a potential
supply excess of 3.0 million tons, mostly in North America and Western Europe.
After the dip in the 1974/75 period, world phosphate fertilizer consumption is
again expected to continue to grow at a rate of 5 percent per year through the
1980's (i.e. slightly below the 5.5 percent rate that had occurred in the
1969-73 period), with most of the growth taking place in Eastern Europe and
the USSR and in the developing countries. It is expected that the surplus
supply situation will disappear by the early 1980's and bring about a stabili-
zation in prices of phospate rock, intermediate products, such as phosphoric
acid, and finished phosphate fertilizers at above their current levels.
28.       The major structural change in the trading pattern of phosphates
mentioned in my 1974 Report is in fact now taking place and will accelerate.
Several rock-producing countries favorably located for export--Morocco being
prominent among them--will continue or commence to vertically integrate pro-
duction and exports of processed phosphates. For example, during the period
1971/72 to 1976/77, international trade of phosphoric acid (P205) increased
by an average of 34 percent per year from 0.3 to 1.3 million tons. Therefore,
demand for exportable phosphoric acid has not experienced the temporary
decline in demand that phosphate rock exports did in the mid-1970's and acid
prices are now at about the level predicted in 1974 ($230-250 per ton de-
livered). The additions in phosphoric acid capacity over the next five years
will be only marginal in North America (0.2 million tons) and Western Europe
(0.1 million tons), but more substantial in Africa (1.7 million tons), Latin
America and the Near East (about 1.3 million tons each), and Eastern Europe
including the USSR (2.3 million tons).
29.       Morocco has more than half of the world's known phosphate reserves,
and in 1977 accounted for about a third of world trade in phosphate rock.
It has decisively opted for the strategy of participating in the rapidly
developing trade of phosphate intermediate products used in the manufacturing
of high grade phosphate fertilizers. In so doing, it has sought to become
a leader in bridging the gap between producing and consuming countries, while
at the same time equipping itself with the necessary infrastructure such
as terminals and a shipping company (see Annex IV, para. 9) to ensure ready
access to markets for its intermediate products. The existing production
units, located near Safi, presently have a total annual capacity of 858,000
tons of phosphoric acid, and are also equipped to produce small quantities



- 9 -
of other phosphate intermediate or final products. The Office Cherifien des
Phosphates (OCP), a state-owned company, which has the responsibility for the
development of Morocco's phosphate industries, plans to expand annual produc-
tion capacity at Safi to 1,518,000 tons of P205 by the mid-80's, first through
this expansion project by adding a fourth line (with a capacity of 165,000 tons
of P205 annually) to the existing Maroc-Phosphore plant, and then by building
a second Maroc-Phosphore plant (with a capacity of 495,000 tons of P205
annually). In the long term, the OCP has plans to build additional units
near the port of Jorf Lasfar to produce phosphoric acid, mono and di-ammonium
phosphates and triple superphosphate. In view of Morocco's comparative
advantage in this sector, the level of development it has achieved, and the
positive market prospects, such a strategy is appropriate. The proposed
project constitutes the next step in implementing this strategy while at the
same time helping Morocco meet its foreign exchange needs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The Original Project
30.       The proposed project would be an expansion of the original Maroc-
Phosphore project approved by the Executive Directors on June 30, 1974. It
consisted of the construction of a phosphatic fertilizer plant at Safi, to
produce in three units annually 495,000 tons of phosphoric acid (P205), of
which 371,250 tons were to be exported and the balance converted into 225,780
tons per year of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) for the domestic and export
markets. Total project financing, including interest during construction and
initial working capital was estimated at $155.5 million, of which about $100
million was in foreign exchange. The Bank provided a loan of $50 million to
Maroc-Phosphore, an OCP subsidiary, to meet a portion of the foreign exchange
cost, the balance of which was to be provided by loans from the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (Germany) and the Banque Nationale de Developpement Econo-
mique (Morocco), and by OCP's equity contribution. The entire local cost was
to be covered by equity subscribed by OCP. The detailed description of the
original project, as well as the organizational, financial and procurement
arrangements, were summarized in Part IV of my 1974 Report (attached hereto
under Annex IV). The loan was signed on June 27, 1974, and became effective
February 27, 1975.
31.       A particular aspect of the original project was that it was to be
executed under a turnkey contract. After international competitive bidding,
Maroc-Phosphore selected the lowest evaluated bid submitted by a consortium,
headed by Friedrich Uhde GmbH (Germany), and which included Polimex-Cekop
(Polimex, Poland); Lurgi Gesellschaft fur Chemie (Germany); Siemens A.G.
(Germany); Nissan (Japan); and Fisons (U.K.). The contract was based on a
lump sum price with an escalation clause for price increases of some of the



- 10 -
components, such as civil works, with payments in Dirhams for local cost, in
Dollars for the Polimex part as per a sub-contract between Uhde and Polimex,
and in Deutsche Mark for the foreign exchange balance.
Project Execution
32.       Implementation of the original project has largely proceeded as
planned. Originally, the first two sulfuric and phosphoric acid units
were scheduled for mechanical completion by November 1975, with the third
unit to be completed by August 1976. Partly because of delays in the start
of the civil works and of the difficult equipment delivery situation expe-
rienced internationally in the aftermath of the oil price increases in 1973
and 1974, and partly because it was subsequently considered more convenient
to implement all three units simultaneously, the three units were completed
practically at the same time. Physical completion of the whole plant was
achieved in October 1976, i.e. two months behind schedule. Several mechanical
problems occurred during the start-up and testing period, which forced the
plant to be shut down, inspected, and repaired for extended periods of time.
Therefore, the final acceptance of the three sulfuric/phosphoric acid units,
based on the strict performance tests defined in the turnkey contract, took
place only in December 1977 after all problems had been solved. Maroc-
Phosphore has, however, been able to produce and sell phosphoric acid since
1976 (69,000 tons); in 1977, Maroc-Phosphore operated at about 53 percent of
capacity and produced 251,000 tons.
33.       The MAP unit was mechanically completed on time, but serious
mechanical and process problems developed during the start-up and testing
period; they are practically overcome now and in May of this year the MAP unit
began production of a satisfactory product. The investment cost of the MAP
unit represents about 10 percent of total plant investment cost; the lack of
MAP production handicapped Maroc-Phosphore's production and export sales pro-
gram, yet the phosphoric acid not used by the MAP unit easily found customers
on the world market.
34.       The cost of the original project, excluding working capital and
interest during construction, has increased from $132.1 million to $143.7
million, i.e., by 8.7 percent. The increase in foreign exchange ($6.1 mil-
lion) stems for the most part from currency realignments which have taken
place, particularly the change of parity of the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis the
US Dollar since 1973 when the contract between Maroc-Phosphore and Uhde was
signed. The increase in local currency ($5.4 million) is mostly attributable
to higher than expected costs of civil works and labor. Total financing
requirements increased by 9.3 percent from $155.5 million to $169.9 million,
as interest during construction also went up with the project cost, and
start-up of the first two lines was delayed by almost a year.
35.       Soon after the start-up of the plant, at the end of 1976, it became
apparent that the storage in the open of large quantities of powdered sulfur
(after phosphate rock the second most important raw material in the production
of phosphoric acid) was causing serious environmental problems. Because of



- 11 -
the proximity of the sea, spindrift produces corroding sulfuric and chloridric
acids, and high winds spread the sulfur far outside its storage area causing
substantial waste of sulfur and safety hazard to personnel and installations.
Maroc-Phosphore, already considering the construction of a fourth line, and
at a later stage that of a second plant adjacent to the existing facilities,
decided to overcome this pollution problem as part of the investment needed to
add the fourth line. In future, the sulfur will be melted immediately upon
arrival at the site in a battery of four melting units and the liquid sulfur
stored in a tank with enough capacity to feed the existing as well as the
future units. Also as part of the fourth line expansion, storage for the
phosphoric acid will be reorganized and improved.
The Proposed Expansion Project
36.       Project appraisal took place in late March/early April 1978 and
negotiations were held in Washington in mid-May. The Moroccan delegation
was headed by Mr. Sellam M'Hamedi, Director, Maroc-Phosphore. The expansion
project consists of: (i) a fourth production line of sulfuric acid, with a
capacity of 1,500 tons per day (tpd), and of phosphoric acid, with a capacity
of 500 tpd, and related ancillary facilities; the fourth Maroc-Phosphore line
will be identical in capacity to any of the first three, thereby increasing
overall production capacity from 1,500 tpd to 2,000 tpd of phosphoric acid;
and (ii) the construction of a sulfur melting facility and storage tanks for
liquid sulfur, and the rearrangement of phosphoric acid concentration and
storage to handle the increased output. Immediate construction of the fourth
line is of a high priority for Maroc-Phosphore given the positive market
prospects in derivative products in the medium and long term, and the fact
that the addition of the fourth line will constitute a necessary incremental
step in satisfying Maroc-Phosphore's market until the planned second Maroc-
Phosphore plant, and hence the entire Safi complex, is in full production. In
addition, the reorganization of the concentration and storage of phosphoric
acid, and the implementation of the sulfur melting facility, will facilitate
the second Maroc-Phosphore plant. The fourth line will be located next to the
existing three lines, while the sulfur melting and storage facilities will be
installed at the southern end of the entire complex. A second jetty now under
construction at the port of Safi will handle the shipment of the increased
production of the plant.
37.       The expansion project is to be implemented by the same capable and
competent management team of Maroc-Phosphore which executed the original proj-
ect and which will also coordinate all expansion activities with that of the
existing units. The project is to be implemented in 30 months, and the fourth
line is expected to start commercial operations by July 1981.
Cost Estimates and Proposed Financing Plan
38.       Total investment costs for the expansion project, including addi-
tional working capital and exclusive of interest during construction (see Loan
and Project Summary), are estimated to be $117.0 million. Total financing,
including interest during construction, is $124.4 million, of which US$81.3
million, or 65 percent, is in foreign exchange. Cost estimates include the



- 12 -
lump sum price of $89.1 million for the turnkey contracts, of which $44 mil-
lion would be subjected to the same price escalation clause as in the original
contract. The foreign exchange costs include about $16.1 million for goods
and services being contracted in Poland.
39.       The proposed Bank loan of $50 million would cover 40 percent of
the project's estimated total financing requirement and 62 percent of foreign
exchange expenditures. It would be for 14 years with 4 years of grace.
Maroc-Phosphore would pay to the Government a guarantee fee at the rate of 2.35
percent, bringing the total cost of Bank funds to Maroc-Phosphore to 10 per-
cent. The foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan would be carried by Maroc-
Phosphore. It is anticipated that debt financing for the project will be
completed by a $13.7 million loan from the Polish Government with interest
at 7.25 percent for 14 years including 4 years of grace. The Polish loan will
cover 85 percent of the cost of Polish goods and services and is expected to
be finalized by early October. Should there be a cost overrun in the project,
OCP would ensure the provision of additional funds towards the cost of the proj-
ect, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Shareholders' Guarantee
Agreement, Section 2.02). Effectiveness of the Polish loan or any alternative
loan, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (Loan
Agreement, Section 8.01). The execution and delivery of the Shareholders'
Guarantee Agreement on behalf of Maroc-Phosphore and OCP would be special
conditions of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Loan Agreement, Section 8.01).
$60.7 million of equity financing would be provided by OCP and Maroc-Phosphore
cash generation. The equity would finance the local costs and the foreign
exchange portion not covered by the Polish loan or the Bank loan ($17.6 mil-
lion). The project would thus be financed with 51 percent debt and 49 percent
equity, and Maroc-Phosphore has agreed to maintain its overall debt to equity
ratio at 55:45, as was stipulated under the original project (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.08).
Procurement and Disbursements
40.        The entire Bank loan amount will be used for foreign expenditures.
As was the case for the first loan, disbursement of the portion of the Bank
loan ($41.0 million) financing the turnkey contracts will be made against lump
sum invoices submitted by Maroc-Phosphore and in agreement with the contracts'
payment schedules. To save time and standardize equipment and spare parts, as
well as to make operating conditions in the expanded plant compatible with
those of the existing facilities, Maroc-Phosphore is contracting directly
with the same firms that built the existing facilities at the Safi complex.
Maroc-Phosphore intends by early October to have entered into a turnkey
contract with Polimex for the sulfur melting and storage facilities and for
the sulfuric acid unit, and has already signed a lump sum contract with
Siemens for the electrical installations. As for the phosphoric acid unit
and the reorganization of the phosphoric acid storage facilities, contract
negotiations with the original contractor Uhde did not result in an offer
satisfactory to Maroc-Phosphore, due in part to the strengthening of the
Deutsche Mark which served to weaken Uhde's competitive position. As a
result, Maroc-Phosphore has recently concluded a favorable contract with



- 13 -
Spie-Batignolles (France), which has extensive experience in the Safi complex,
having built the adjacent phosphoric acid plant for Maroc Chimie, another OCP
subsidiary, while also having been the second lowest bidder for the phosphoric
acid unit in the original Maroc-Phosphore project. Because of its past expe-
rience in the Safi complex, Spie-Batignolles will assure optimal standardiza-
tion thereby reducing the investment and operating costs of the expansion
project. All three contracts would essentially duplicate the original turnkey
contract which the Bank approved in 1974 and the terms of which were quite
favorable to Maroc-Phosphore. The Bank has reviewed the Siemens and Spie-
Batignolles contracts which are satisfactory and the signing of the Polimex
sulfuric acid unit contract would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
loan (Loan Agreement, Section 8.01(c)). In order to ensure an expeditious and
effective execution of the project, civil works under the lump-sum contracts
with Siemens and Spie-Batignolles has begun. Both contracts contain fixed
payment schedules, and would hence explain the need for retroactive Bank
financing for expenditures made after June 1, 1978, amounting to about $5.0
million. This constitutes about 10 percent of the Bank's loan. As a result
of the protracted nature of these contract negotiations however, presentation
of this loan for your approval had been postponed from June 1978, pending
Maroc-Phosphore's selection of a contractor for the phosphoric acid plant.
The Bank will not finance goods and services procured in Poland. For the
portion not covered by the turnkey contracts which includes other equipment
and spare parts ($9.0 million) also to be financed by the Bank, procurement
will be through international competitive bidding except for (i) items costing
less than $100,000 each, up to an aggregate amount of $2 million, and (ii)
items whose availability is limited by the need for standardization of the
four production units, and for which limited bidding using international
shopping procedures will be followed. It is estimated that these items will
not total more than $2 million.
Financial Covenants
41.       All financial covenants will be identical to those under the origi-
nal project. Maroc-Phosphore is to maintain a debt service coverage of at
least 1.4 and not to incur any debt that would increase its debt to equity
ratio beyond 55:45 throughout the project life of 12 years, as envisaged
for the original project. OCP (Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Section
2.03) and the Government (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02) will continue
to guarantee Maroc-Phosphore's sound liquidity and financial position through
the same financial covenants as for the first loan (see key financial pro-
jections below). Furthermore, Maroc-Phosphore will inform the Bank prior to
undertaking any new major capital investment in manufacturing of intermediate
and finished phosphate fertilizers (Loan Agreement, Section 5.06). Finally,
Maroc-Phosphore will have its accounts audited by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 5.02). The project's key financial
indicators are given below:

Marketing Arrangements
42.        In the past years, Maroc-Phosphore has successfully established
itself as a reliable supplier of phosphoric acid from both its own production
unit and by sub-contracting phosphoric acid production, and has prepared a
dependable market for the time when the new production capacities of the
Safi complex will be in full operation. Sales contracts have been signed
with companies in Western and Eastern Europe, Brazil and India, and others
are being finalized to increase sales to those countries and to open new
markets in the East Asian, Pacific and South American regions. Sales com-
mitments for the next few years exceed the production capacity of the Safi
complex, and, as at present, any excess additional requirements will be sub-
contracted with producers in Europe and in the US. Most of the phosphoric
acid is being transported in four ships owned by Marphocean, a Moroccan
shipping company in which OCP has a large participation. Two additional ships
are under construction and will carry Maroc-Phosphore's increased production.
The average 1977 prices for Maroc-Phosphore's sales, $225 per ton of phosphoric
acid FOB Safi, is expected to increase in real terms as the present surplus
supply situation disappears in the early 80s; and it is expected that the
equilibrium price in world markets will reach about $300 per ton in 1978 terms
in the mid 1980s.
Economic and Financial Rates of Return
43.       The economic and financial returns of the expansion project are
satisfactory, even when conservative estimates are used for revenues and



- 15 -
operating costs. The financial rate of return (after taxes) is estimated
at 15 percent and the economic return at 19 percent. Despite the increase
in the cost of the original project, the returns of the entire project are
also high, with the financial rate of return (after taxes) estimated at
14 percent and the economic return at 19 percent (see Annex IV, paras 18
and 19 of my 1974 report). Once in full production the net export value of
the entire plant will be about $200 million per year in 1978 terms.
44.        In addition to its directly quantifiable economic benefits, the
project will increase the external benefits already apparent during the
implementation and operation of the original project. It will help increase
employment levels in a region where employment alternatives are low and
develop manufacturing activities particularly in the Safi region where the
fishing activities are declining. With the expansion project providing
employment for an additional 200 people, the entire project will provide
training and job opportunities for some 1,200 people, and already the Safi
complex is becoming a training center for future fertilizer or petrochemical
projects in Morocco. Maroc-Phosphore will also use its experience from the
original project to coordinate the implementation activities of the expansion
project. Its expanding expertise in project preparation, implementation and
operation, will find direct application in other OCP planned fertilizer
projects in Morocco.
Risks
45.        No special implementation and market risks are expected.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Maroc-Phosphore, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, the
draft Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement among the Bank, the OCP and Maroc-
Phosphore, and the Report of the committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
47.        Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Special conditions of effectiveness include (a) the execution
and delivery of the Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement on behalf of Maroc-
Phosphore and OCP (Loan Agreement, Section 8.01(a)); (b) the effectiveness
of any agreement providing for loan(s) included in the financing plan agreed
to between the Borrower and the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 8.01(b)); and
(c) the signing of the contract for the sulfuric acid unit (Loan Agreement,
Section 8.01(c)).
48.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No. 643 Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November
13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project was delayed by problems ini-
tially experienced with management and procurement of canalettes and severe
flooding in February 1977 which caused damage to crops and irrigation works.
The major project structure, Idriss 1     Dam, is completed and 29,400 ha out
of a total of 35,200 ha are already equipped.    Project completion is now
scheduled for the end of 1978 which would require a postponement of the
closing date by six months. Additional infrastructure for the project area,
including a sugar cane processing factory and flood protection works, are
being provided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Ln. No. 848 Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 1, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Commitments and disbursements initially lagged behind expectations,
due to sluggish investment activity in 1973, but the loan is now fully com-
mitted. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed before end December 1978.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: May 2, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.                      1
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are completed except for the training
school, which is under construction and expected to be completed by Fall 1978.
The financial position of the Borrower, Office National de l'Eau Potable
(ONEP), is improving following implementation of tariff increases in October
1977 and other measures the Government has under consideration.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 936 Power Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: January 23, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
Physical implementation of the project is complete. Savings amount-
ing to about US$3.5 million are being applied to consultant services for feas-
ibility studies, preliminary design and preparation of bid documents for 5
hydro stations required to alleviate Morocco's dependency on imported oil.
A one year postponement of the Closing Date was granted to allow payments
under these contracts. Electricity rates were increased on average by 14%
on February 1, 1978, but further action is required to meet the 1978 cash
contribution covenant.
Ln. No. 955 Second Highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: May 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Construction of the Rabat-Casablanca expressway which began in early
1975 - about 8 months behind schedule - is now almost complete and the mainte-
nance equipment and highway improvement programs are complete. Work on the
contract for technical assistance for the establishment of a Transport Plan-
ning Office in the Ministry of Public Works is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1017 Phosphoric Acid Project; US$50.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
The project was mechanically completed in October 1976 and the plant
is now in commercial operation.
Ln. No. 1018 Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The sugar cane processing factory was essentially completed on
schedule in 1975. Construction of the project area roads is on schedule
but work on the flood protection dykes is about 29 months behind schedule,
mainly on account of uncertainties regarding the next Three-Year (1978-1980)
Plan contents, and particularly the M'Jara Dam which would make questionable
the construction of the dykes. Decision from Government in this respect is
expected by October 1978. The study on pollution control is now proceeding sat-
isfactorily; however the study on the incidence of bilharzia on the Rharb
plain has yet to be started.
Ln. No. 1061   Seventh BNDE Project; US$30 million of December 30, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
The loan is fully committed. Disbursements are roughly in line
with appraisal estimates.

Ln. No. 1123 Souss Groundwater Project; US$18.5 million of June 11, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The 59 wells required for new irrigated area (6,300 ha) were com-
pleted and tested one year ahead of appraisal schedule. Land clearing has
been completed. Land distribution to Agrarian Reform beneficiaries has been
completed in about 50 percent of the project area. Works related to the
social components of the project are suffering a substantial delay. A recent
issue derives from the budgetary constraints facing Morocco which have
resulted in cutbacks in the operating budget and assignment of additional
personnel. The impact of these changes in the Project and the determination
of appropriate measures would be studied by the next supervision missions.
Cr. No. 555 Meknes Agricultural Development Project; US$14.0 million of
June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 14, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
The Project initially faced substantial delays in project imple-
mentation. The studies are now underway, and commitments of funds under the
project have been initiated. However project management and the coordination
of project activities between the project authority and the central offices of
the Ministry of Agriculture continue to require close monitoring. A revised
land reform and redistribution program which meets the project's objectives is
currently under discussion.
Ln. No. 1201 Doukkala Irrigation Project; US$30.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness:   July 20, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981.
The project includes sprinkler irrigation for 15,400 ha and infra-
structure and equipment. Progress of construction is satisfactory after
initial delays. The first 4,500 ha have been completed and put in service.
Completion of the remainder of sectors are underway and expected to be on
schedule.
Ln. No. 1202 Bay of Agadir Tourism Project; US$21.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: October 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project is intended to develop Agadir into a major tourism area
and consists of infrastructure works and public facilities for the development
of a new tourism section on 260 ha on which 7,000 hotel beds and 2,600 hous-
ing units are expected to be constructed. The project includes also regional
infrastructure and facilities for the development of Agadir's tourism assets.
The major project component, UAT-Forestry land development, has entered its
construction phase and is expected to be completed by the end of 1979. The
implementation of other components experienced some delay but could still be
completed on schedule.

EXCERPT FROM ORIGINAL PRESIDENT'S REPORT
DATED MAY 17, 1974, NO. P-1449
(Loan 1017-MOR - $50 million)
PART III: MINING AND MINERAL PROCESSING IN MOROCCO
General
1.        Morocco is endowed with varied mineral resources.    It possesses the
world's largest reserves of phoshate rock (an estimated 40 billion tons) of
good quality that can be easily extracted and are close to the Atlantic coast.
In 1973, it was the world's third main producer of phosphate rock after the
USA and the USSR, and the largest exporter with more than one third of world
trade. Morocco also has sizeable reserves of coal, iron ore and pyrrhotite,
as well as several other minerals, such as lead, zinc, manganese and copper.
Due to obsolescent mining equipment or depletion of known deposits, their
exploitation is often not competitive.
2.        Minerals are state property and the Government plays a dominant role
in mining and processing. The Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP), a state-
owned company, mines and sells phosphate rock, and exercises control over
phosphate processing through affiliates (Maroc Chimie and Maroc Phosphore).
The Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (BRPM) is responsible
for prospecting, mining and processing other minerals either alone, or in
partnership with private firms. The Government grants various fiscal and
other incentives to encourage private investment in the mining and processing
of minerals other than phosphate.
3.        Morocco continued to export most of its minerals in unprocessed
form during the Second Five-Year Plan (1968-72), despite a Plan objective of
increasing export value through processing. The growth of mineral exports
averaged only 3 percent a year in current prices during the Plan period, and
came entirely from phosphate. OCP invested $125 million and underwent an
internal reorganization which enabled it to increase phosphate rock exports
from 9.3 million tons in 1967 to 13.6 million tons in 1972. However, because
of a 10 percent decline in the price of phosphate, its share in total export
earnings fell from 25.4 percent in 1967 to 22.8 percent in 1972. Exports of
other minerals, stagnated in volume and value mainly because of weak external
demand. The Plan's processing objective was implemented in the case of
phosphate-based fertilizer production and pelletisation of iron ore. Maroc
Chimie, which was set up to produce fertilizer, increased its intake of phos-
phate to 600,000 tons in 1972 and raised its fertilizer exports from $10 mil-
lion in 1967 to $14 million in 1972, despite serious technical difficulties.
Production of high-grade iron ore pellets began in 1972. In 1972, mineral
processing was still a small sub-sector contributing less than 7 percent of
value added in the manufacturing sector. While mining and mineral processing
continued to be of great importance for the balance of payments (32.2 percent
of merchandise exports in 1972), their contribution to GDP (about 5 percent)
and employment (about 2 percent) remained small.



ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 7
Phosphate and Fertilizer Market
4.        World production of phosphate rock rose from 40 to 90 million tons
between 1960 and 1972, with the US (42 percent), the USSR (22 percent), and
Morocco (16 percent) as leading producers. World export trade increased
from 29.2 to 43.5 million tons between 1965 and 1972, with about two thirds
of the trade going to Western and Eastern Europe; the main exporters were
Morocco (31 percent of world exports), the US (29 percent), and the USSR
(14 percent). The world rock supply/demand situation moved from a world wide
oversupply in the late 1960s and early 1970s to a tight balance in early 1973
and a serious shortage by late 1973 as a result of increased world wide demand;
the same trend applied to phosphoric acid based high grade fertilizers. Prices
reflected this development; export prices for 1974 are 2.5 times to more than
3 times higher (US$45 for the highest commercial grade) than those prevailing
in early 1973. The sharp increase in prices is also explained by a necessary
price recovery following a depressed price situation over most of the last
decade. World rock prices are expected to remain at their present (early
1974) high levels through late 1975 because coverage is, however, likely to
improve from 1976 onwards; long term FOB equilibrium prices are, therefore,
forecast to stabilize -- by 1976/77 -- at about 20 percent below the 1974
price levels.
5.        Major structural changes have also occurred in production and trade
of phosphate fertilizers in the past 10 vears. Increased demand for high
grade fertilizers has induced a rapid growth in the production and trade of
intermediate products, such as phosphoric acid, in which developing countries
are more and more participating. The emerging trade pattern will combine in-
creasing quantities of intermediate and finished products with raw materials,
rock phosphate, and sulfur. This new trade pattern favors large units which,
as it is the case in Morocco, are close to sources of raw materials and favor-
ably located for exporting. The shortage of phosphoric acid based high grade
fertilizers in recent years, combined with the increase in rock prices, re-
sulted in a sizeable upward adjustment in prices of finished products, about
50 percent for phosphoric acid between mid-1973 and early 1974. However,
the supply/demand situation is likely to improve from 1976 on, bringing a
stabilization in long term prices at a level somewhat below the current
level.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
1.        A report entitled:    "Appraisal of the Maroc Phosphore Phosphoric
Acid and Mono-ammonium Project" (No. 351 MOR of April 19, 1974) is being
distributed separately. A loan and project summary is attached as ANNEX
III. The Project was presented to the Bank in June 1971, and a formal



ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 7
request to help finance the Project made in December 1972. The proposed
project was appraised in February and October 1973; a follow-up mission took
place in March 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington beginning
January 28, 1974. The Borrower was represented by Mr. Guessous (Financial
Director, Office Cherifien des Phosphates) and the Guarantor by Mr. Belghiti
of the Directorate of Economic Affairs, Prime Minister's Office.
2.        The Project consists in the erection of a plant near the port of
Safi on the Atlantic coast, about 200 km south of Casablanca, to produce for
export 371,250 tons per year of phosphoric acid (P 20 ) and 225,780 tons per
year of mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) at full capaMiky. These products are
key intermediates in the manufacturing of high grade phosphate fertilizers
which are in great and increasing demand in world markets. The project is
sponsored by the OCP and will be implemented by Maroc Phosphore. The pro-
posed project is a key link in the Government's and OCP's strategy to par-
ticipate in the rapidly emerging world trade in intermediate products used
in manufacturing high grade fertilizers.
3.         In 1971, the Government of Morocco and OCP requested, and the Bank
agreed, that the Project be executed as a lump sum turnkey contract. The
early conclusion of a turnkey contract was necessary to: (i) increase poten-
tial buyers' confidence in the Project; and (ii) obtain firm project costs
essential for determining a sales strategy and starting sales negotiations;
other reasons were the advantages of single responsibility in project execu-
tion and the acquisition of technical expertise in phosphoric acid produc-
tion which was lacking in OCP. OCP signed a first plant construction con-
tract in June 1973 for about two-thirds of the Project capacity, and Project
execution has commenced. This first contract included provisions for project
expansion. Following favorable market developments and to take advantage of
an unchanged price offer, OCP, in April 1974, completed negotiations with
the same supplier for a supplementary contract based on identical terms to
cover, together with the first contract, the overall construction of the
Project's main facilities and related infrastructure.
4.         International competitive bidding was used to select the consor-
tium which is to execute the Project at a fixed lump sum price, including
an adequate escalation formula. OCP invited bids from several consortia of
specialized firms, each under the leadership of one firm (the contractor)
who was to have responsibility for the entire project. The Bank agreed to
a three-phase selection procedure: (i) prequalification of consortia after
international advertising; (ii) invitation to prequalified consortia to
submit unpriced technical offers conforming to detailed tender documents;
and (iii) after clarification and technical adjustments of offers; call for
a lump sum price for most of the project work which, together with the tech-
nical offer, was to serve as the basis for bid evaluation. Out of thirteen
responsive bids, five consortia were prequalified and asked to present price
proposals. The five contractors were from the US, Belgium, France, Germany,
and Japan. The lowest evaluated bid was submitted by a consortium headed
by Friedrich Uhde GmbH (Uhde) of Germany. Uhde and the other members of the



ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 7
consortium are well known and qualified firms: Polimex-Cekop (Polimex) of
Poland; Lurgi Gesellschaft fuer Chemie and Huettenwesen GmbH (Lurgi); Siemens
A.G. (Siemens), Nissan of Japan, and Fisons of the UK. The contract is based
on a lump sum price with payments in Dirham for local cost, in clearing dollars
for the Polimex part as per a sub-contract between Uhde and Polimex, and in
Deutsche Mark for the remaining foreign exchange balance. A payment sched-
ule in the three currencies was agreed and payments are specified at intervals
and in amounts proportional to the contractor's expected cash outlays and work
progress.
Progress Execution
5.        "Maroc Phosphore" was formed to build and operate the Project.      The
company functions as a "Societe Anonyme" under Moroccan commercial laws. Its
initial authorized share capital is DH 1 million and will be increased to
provide for additional equity subscriptions as execution of the Project pro-
ceeds. OCP will own all of MP's shares. MP sales, finance, and accounting
functions will be managed by OCP. Plant and production management will be
autonomous. OCP's General Manager is also Chairman of the MP Board.
6.        Engineering, construction, erection, and start-up of the plant are
the responsibility of the turnkey contractor. Following completion of the
first part of the Project scheduled for October 1, 1975, commercial opera-
tions are expected to begin in January 1976, after a 3 months testing period.
Facilities corresponding to the second construction contract are expected to
start operations in August 1976. OCP and MP are assisted by an experienced
technical advisor, Haldor Topsoe A/S of Denmark. A satisfactory organization
for project execution has been developed and includes: the MP project team,
the nucleus of the new company; the various OCP departments involved; the
technical advisor Topsoe; the Contractor's team; and an OCP group of engi-
neers. These arrangements are expected to ensure efficient project execution.
Furthermore, given the expected difficulties in recruiting Moroccan chemical
engineers, Topsoe and the Contractor, as part of their contracts with OCP,
will assist in the recruitment and training -- in Morocco and abroad -- of
key personnel, including expatriates if needed.
7.        Since the plant will be adjacent to an existing chemical plant
(Maroc Chimie), the company will benefit from existing infrastructure, with
resulting cost savings. Certain additional infrastructure facilities needed
for, but not part of, the Project and estimated to cost about DH 36 million
(US$8 million), will be built by the appropriate Government agencies closely
supervised by OCP and MP; the necessary budget allocations have been made.
These facilities include: the supply of fresh water through modification
of a canal, heightening of a small dam and installation of a conduit or
pumping facilities; installations for handling of sulfur at the port; and
railroad equipment and siding. Service tariffs, to be paid by MP, have been
agreed upon with the agencies involved. Workers' housing will be provided
by the regional authorities. A schedule for construction of these facili-
ties to meet the requirements of the Project has been agreed upon with the
Government (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.04 and the Schedule thereto).



ANNEX IV

8.        Of the principal raw materials:    (i) phosphate rock will be supplied
by train from OCP's Youssoufia mine under a long term supply contract with OCP
the draft of which was found satisfactory by the Bank and the signature of
which is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (Loan Agreement,
Section 9.01 (e)); (ii) sulfur will be imported in dry lump form under long
term contracts; and (iii) small quantities of ammonia will be bought from
various sources on a spot basis. Catalysts and chemicals will all be imported.
Known rock reserves at Youssoufia are adequate to supply the Project with the
same grade over more than its expected economic life of 12.5 years.
9.        Phosphoric acid will be shipped from Safi to delivery points in
Europe, India, and Brazil in three specialized self-unloading, ocean-going
ships, equipped with rubber lined or stainless steel tanks. A shipping com-
pany, Marphocean, has been formed -- with an initial share capital of DH 4
million -- to purchase and operate the ships under Moroccan flag; Marphocean
is jointly owned by the Moroccan National Shipping Company - COMANAV - (45
percent), which already owns 11 ships and has a leading role in ship char-
tering and sea transport of Moroccan goods, and by OCP (25 percent). The
balance (30 percent) will be owned by the French ship engineering firm,
GAZOCEAN, one of the world's leading firms in the shipping of liquified or
pressurized gases and chemicals. The Bank is not financing the shipping
facilities, but a condition of effectiveness of the loan is OCP will enter
into a long term charter agreement with a carrier acceptable to the Bank
(Loan Agreement, Section 9.01 (d)).
Cost Estimates
10.       Total investment costs for the Project, summarized in Annex III,
are estimated to be DH 657 million (US$148.6 million). Total financing,
including interest during construction, is DH 687 million (US$155.5 million).
Cost estimates include the lump sum price of DH 405 million (US$91.6 million)
for the turnkey contract. Cost estimates for all major items outside the
turnkey contract have been prepared by OCP and MP were reviewed by the Bank
and have been found acceptable. A price escalation clause based on a formula
with reasonable estimates for increases of component prices is included in
the contract. In addition, an overall contingency (18 percent of Project
cost, excluding working capital and interest during construction) is in-
cluded to cover unforeseeable expenditures. This is considered adequate
in view of the short construction time. The foreign exchange costs include
DH 55 million (US$12.6 million) for goods and services subcontracted and to
be paid for in clearing dollars for Polish deliveries. Local costs include
DH 18 million for taxes and registration fee.
Financing Plan
11.       External financing for the Project is to come jointly from the Bank
and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). While the proposed Bank loan would
be made directly to MP, the KfW loan equivalent to US$26.8 million will be
made to the Government following KfW's usual practice and on-lent to MP. The
Bank and the KfW loans are linked by cross-effectiveness provision (Section
9.01 (b), Loan Agreement) and cross default provisions (Sections 8.02 (a) and
8.03 (a), Loan Agreement). Debt financing for the Project would be completed



ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 7
by an US$8 million loan from BNDE. The three loans totalling US$84.8 mil-
lion would finance 55 percent of the Project costs. US$70.7 of equity fi-
nancing would be provided by OCP. The equity would finance the local costs,
the costs of Polish supplies (US$12.6 million) which will be paid for in
clearing dollars, and also US$2.7 million equivalent convertible foreign
exchange costs. MP has agreed to maintain a 55:45 debt/equity ratio (Loan
Agreement, Section 5.08).
12.       The proposed Bank loan would cover 32 percent of project costs and
57 percent of convertible foreign exchange expenditures. It would be for
14 years with 4 years of grace. MP would pay to the Government a guarantee
fee at the rate of 1-3/4 percent (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.05), bringing
the total cost of Bank funds for MP to 9 percent. The KfW loan would be made
to the Government at 2 percent for 30 years, including ten years of grace,
and would be on-lent to MP for the same maturity and grace period and at the
same effective interest rate as the Bank loan. The BNDE loan will also be
made at the same effective interest rate and conditions as the Bank loan.
OCP has agreed to subscribe for, and pay in, the increased share capital of
MP according to an agreed schedule (Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Sec-
tion 2.01). In the event of a cost overrun, OCP and the Government guarantee
to provide additional funds, both foreign and local, necessary to complete
the Project on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Guarantee Agree-
ment, Section 2.03; Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
Disbursements
13.        Disbursement of the Bank and KfW portions of the loan financing
the turnkey contract will be made pro-rata against lump sum invoices sub-
mitted by MP and in agreement with the contracts payment schedule. The Bank
will not finance goods and services procured in Poland.
14.       OCP has so far made US$12.8 million advance payments to the con-
tract or in convertible foreign exchange. These payments are proposed to
be retroactively financed by the lenders, the BNDE loan being fully dis-
bursed first. The proportionate Bank share will be US$3.1 million, repre-
senting about 6 percent of the Bank loan.
Financial Position
15.       The company is to maintain a debt service coverage of at least
1.4 and not to incur any debt that would increase its debt/equity ratio
beyond 55:45 throughout the forecast period of 12 years. The Project's
financial rate of return would be 16.9 percent after corporate income tax
under conservative estimates regarding capital and operating cost and reve-
nue. Technical risks of plant design and operations and risks of substan-
tial delays or major cost overruns are considered low, owing to the con-
tracting procedure followed and the employment of a qualified technical
advisor (Topsoe).
16.        OCP (Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03) and the
Government (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03) will guarantee MP's sound
liquidity and financial position through financial covenants. Furthermore,



ANNEX IV

MP has agreed to inform the Bank prior to undertaking any major new capital
investment in manufacturing of intermediate and finished phosphate fertil-
izers (Loan Agreement, Section 5.06). Finally, MP has agreed to have its
accounts audited independently (Loan Agreement, Section 5.02).
Marketing Arrangements
17.       MP's sales strategy, covering the first five years of the Project's
operation, is to establish itself in key and expanding consumption areas.
Sales would concentrate in four major zones: Eastern and Northwestern Europe,
India, and Brazil. Sales contracts are being finalized which cover virtually
the entire plant output during the first two years of operation and about 85
percent thereafter. Sales arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and covering
at least 50 percent (in 1976) and 60 percent (in 1977 through 1979) of the
estimated annual plant capacity would be made as a condition of loan effec-
tiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 9.01 (c)). The expected average 1976 prices
for MP's sales, US$210 per ton of acid and US$150 per ton of MAP FOB Safi, is
in line with the forecast long term equilibrium price in world markets.
Economic Rate of Return
18.       The economic rate of return of the Project is expected to be 21.2
percent. It is highly sensitive to output prices (a 5 percent rise in revenues
adds nearly 3 percentage points) and to phosphate rock prices (a 10 percent
drop in rock prices adds 2 percentage points); it, however, remains satisfac-
tory (19.2 percent) if the market price rather than the opportunity cost
for rock phosphate is used and if the price of sulfur is increased by more
than 5 percent.
19.       In addition to its directly quantifiable economic benefits, the
Project will generate substantial external benefits. It will help increase
employment levels in the Youssoufia mines which are using labor-intensive
techniques in a region where employment alternatives are low, develop manu-
facturing activities in line with the Moroccan policy for industrial decen-
tralization and compensate for the decline in fishing activities of the Safi
region, help OCP participate in world trade in intermediate fertilizers,
provide education opportunities through training of personnel, and consti-
tute a training center for future similar projects in Morocco.
Ecology
20.       Appropriate measures to control effluents are provided for in the
Project. Waste from the sulfuric acid unit will be delivered to the neigh-
boring Maroc Chimie plant to be reprocessed; gypsum will be repulped in sea
water and disposed of into the ocean. This method, used since 1965, has not
created any pollution problems. Storage and handling installations for solids
will receive dedusting equipment.
