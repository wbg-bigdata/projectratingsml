LOAN 1230-SC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the project completion report (PCR) for the Technical
Assistance Project (Loan 1230-EC). A loan of US$4.0 million was approved
by the Board March 30, 1976 and the Loan Agreement was signed May 24, 1976.
The estimated project co8t was US$5.6 million of which the Bank would
finance 71X. The final project cost was about US$3.7 willion of which the
Bank financed about 75%. Total disbursements as of June 30, 1984 were
US$2.83 million and US$1.7 million was cancelled September 20, 1984.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Region
Agricultural Division C following a desk review of preparation documents,
staff appraisal report, presidents report, supervision reports, the
correspondence files and consultants reports prepared under the project.
A PCR summary was prepared by the Borrower.
Following a review of the PCR by OED staff, it was decided not to
audit the project and the PCR was sent to the Borrower for comment on
April 30, 1986. Comments are attached as Attacbments I-V.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Loan 1230-EC)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.        The project arose from the Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) for
Rural Development ATN/SF 1196-VA, financed by the Bank, which provided
consultant assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture (NAG) for identification
and preparation of integrated rural development VIRD) projects. Following
the TCP, Government requested Bank support to provide technical assistance to
establish a special unit to strengthen MAG capacity to identify and prepare
rural deveiopment projects.  Loan 12'10-EC was prepared and appraised in
October 1975 in the process of preparing a series of rural development
projezts that later formed the basis of the Tungurahua Project (Ln. 1644-BC),
Puerto Ila Chone Project (Ln. 1991-EC), and the Esmeraldas Project (Ln.
2033-XC) (PCR, paras. 2.01, 2.02).
2.        The project comprised four principal activities:
-    establisbment and operation of a Rural Development Planning Unit
(UNDER) within the National Planning Board (UNNAPLA);
-    studies to improve flood control and drainage in the Lower Guayas
Basis (including feasibility studies in 2 areas of about 100,000 ha
each);
-    completion of the Tungurahua Rural Development Project feasibility
studies and project preparation report; and
-    completion of the Esmeraldas Rural Development Project feasibility
studies and project preparation report. A fifth component, the
Sanborondon pilot rice scheme, was added in March 1979. (PCR,
paras. 2.08, 3.15).
3.        The project was to be completed by June 30, 1980 but in fact ran
through June 30, 1984. Total project cost was estimated at appraisal at
US$5.6 million of which the Bank agreed to finance US$4.0 million. In the
event, there were significant cost underruns and some US$1.69 million was
cancelled at closing.
Project Objectives
4.        The project aimed to strengthen the institutional framework for
rural development policy formulation, planning, project preparation and
project execution. Two specific projects were to be prepared for possible
Bank finance, and prefeasibility studies were to be conducted in the Lower
Guayas Basin that could lead to investments in Infrastructure for flood
control and dral-sge. (PCR, paras. 2.06-2.09).



- iv -
Project Implementation
5.        The project provided for 294 man-months of consultant assistance
including an international specialist in Rural Development as the team leader
to assist with the establishment and operetion of UNDER. UNDER was
established and the Rural Development Specialist was recruited as a condltion
of effectiveness (Sept. 1976)--but the consultant subsequently resigned
August 1977. A second specialist was later hired and served for about 18
months.
6.        Bank financing was limited to foreign exchange to fund foreign
consultant costs. The project encountered problems and delays from the
beginning over issues regarding their recruitment. Hiring was a bottleneck
until the Loan Agreement was amended in September 1980 to provide
disbursements for both local and foreign constultants. Because of the various
independent executing agencies, the National Pre-Investment Fund (FONAPRE),
which was the channel for project funds, encountered difficulties in
coordinating operations under the project as it did not have adequate
authority or control over the executing agencies and its own administrative
procedures contributed to project implementation delays. (PCRs Par&. 3.06).
In fact, Government never really accorded the project, and the consultant
issue in particular, sufficient prioritys4/
Prnject Results
7.        Of the four original components of the project
a) establishment and operation of UNDER was a failureP!although some of
the operations envisaged for UNDER are now the responsibility of
the Secretariat of Integrated Rural Development (SEDRI, established
1981);
b)   the studies of the Lower Guayas were completed (in 7 years rather
than 4) and include prefeasibility studies for two areas (150,000
ha and 200,000 ha);
c)   the Tungurahua Project (now Loan 1644-EC) final preparation was
financed under the Loan; also, studies and designs for the Ambato
(the principal city in the Tungurahua project area) municipal
market were financed and completed as an adjunct to this component;
d)   the Esmeraldas Project (now Loan 2044-EC) preparation was financed
from GOE and OAS sources; and
e)   the Sanborondon Pilot Rice krrigation Ptoject (added during
implementation) was successfully completed. (PCR, paras.
3.05-3.07, 3.13-3.15).
8.        The major problem in execution of the Lower Guayas Basis studies
related to aerial photography, restitution and topography mapping. It was
envisaged that a private firm would do this but in fact IGM was the only
agency authorized to undertake aerial photography in Ecuador. Folloving an
amendment of the Loan Agreement to permit Bank finance of local expenditure,
1/ Government has questioned the accuracy of this assessment and has explained

a one-year contract was signed with IGM in May 1980 to complete the work by
May 1981. Less than five percent was completed by that date and the contract
was extended to complete the work in 1983. The aerial photography and
mapping slipped because the work was assigned a low priority and the weather
in the Lower Guayas Basin was frequently unsatisfactory. (PCR, paras.
3.08-3.10).
Sustainability
9.        In spite of the problems and delays with the Lower Guayas studies,
it ultimately was the most successful activity under the project. The works
can form the basis for final feasibility studies and possible future
investment. Government has recently requested the Bank to consider a flood
control and drainage project in the area. (paras. 5.03, 7.01). These
combined activities if successfully developed will provide a significant
element of sustainability to some important project objectives.
Lessons Learned (PCR, Section VII)
10.       The following lessons were learned:
-    where foreign expartise is required, a strong commitment
must be obtained from the borrower and projects must have a
high national priority;
-    the Bank should not limit finance of consultants to foreign
exchange and should finance qualified internationally
recruited consultants whether foreign or local;
-    more emphasis should be placed on recruiting qualified
local consultants and less on long-term foreign
consultants; and
-    poor implementation performance and delays were adequate
justification for early cancellation, as suggested by
supervision missions on several occasions -- these
recommendations should have been given more consideration
if nothing more than to serve notice on the Borrower that
the Bank would refuse to extend the Closing Date and cancel
the balance of the Loan unless progress was satisfactory.

Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      During the period of the early 1970. agriculture was the most
important sector in the economy in terms of output and emrloyment, and second
to petroleum as a source of foreign exchange earnings. Although the country
had a good agricultural potential, production and productivity were low. An
estimated 1.5 million of the rural population had a per capita income less
than that requi*md for basic needs. Food production per capita was declining
in the early 1970. while growth in other sectors was 3trong. There were and
still are l ..ge uncultivated areas suitable for crops and livestock
production, particularly in the coastal plain where some of the best soils
suffer from flooding and poor drainage.
1.02      In the early 70s, the Government announced that it would provide
additional resources for agriculture and rural development, This combined
with agrarian reform in 1973 began to show promising results by the time this
project was appraised in 1976.
1.03      In an attempt to expand these initiatives, the Government requested
Bank assistance to apply its worldwide experience in rural development and
proposed to concentrate its agricultural lending on rural development. The
Bank made recommendations for basic organizational changes to improve the
Government's planning and control of the rural development activities. These
recommendations were incorporated in the Technical Assistance Project.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      During the mid-seventies and since, Ecuador's agricultural
development program has emphasized irrigation and rural development, the
latter as a means of alleviating poverty. The Bank lent its support to the
rural development program and projects that were being prepared for possible
Bank financing in the Province of Tungurahua in the Sierra and the Esmeraldas
Basin on the coastal plain. This technical assistance project was identified
in the process of preparing rural development projects when it became evident
that neither the institutional framework or policy were adsquate for rural
development.



-2-
2.02      The project was prepared and appraised by the Bank during the
process of preparing Rural Development Projects I, II, and I11--now Bank-
financed Integrated Rural Development Project, Loans 1644, 1991 and 2044-EC.
A Bank mission appraised the project in October 1975. A tentative agreement
was reached with the Government that foreign consultants would be placed
within JUNAPLA (now Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo - CONADE). The proposals
for drainage and flood control studies in the Lower Guayas Basin were
discussed with JUNAPLA, CEDEGE and INERHI. It was also agreed that a team of
international specialists would prepare terms of reference for these studies.
2.03      The mission considered that there vere no major issues as there
was substantial agreement with the Government on the direction of rural
development activities in Ecuador and the role of the Bank. The mission
cautioned that the Bank's capacity for rural development assistance was
limited. The only issue was the mission's recommendation to iacrease the
Bank finance from US$3 million to US$4 million (the estimated foreign
exchange cost) out of a total project cost of US$5.2 million.
Negotiations and Board Approval
2.04      Negotiations took place in February 1976 focusing on selection and
provision of consultants by the Bank and possibly by UNDP, and the terms of
reference for the Lower Guayas Basin Studies, It was decided not to indicate
the type of expertise of the three consultants to be engaged by JUNAPLA for
the planning unit. It was also agreed not to specify the agencies which
would execute the Lower Guayas Studies, thus leaving the Government with some
flexibility. An understanding was reached cn all assurances and conditions.
2.05      The Board approved the loan of US$4 million on March 30, 1976.  It
was indicated that such projects were vitally important, particularly to the
extent that it would help to prepare rural development projects and improve
the quality of life of the poorest segment of the Ecuadorian population.
Questions were raised regarding the feasibility of recruiting expatriates
with the necessary experiente and whether it would be possible to train local
expertise in the time envisaged.
Project Objectives and Descriptions
2.06      The objective of the project was to strengthen the institutional
framework for rural development policy formulation, planning, and project
preparation and implementation. The project would also complete the
preparation of two rural development projects for Bank finance and conduct
prefeasibility studies for flood control and drainage investments in the
Lower Guayas Basin.



-3-
2.07      The project was to provide a three-year program of technical
assistance to the Government in rural development planning and project
preparation to benefit the rural poor and lAcrease agricultural production.
It was also to assist the Government in defining a clearer rural development
policy and strengthen Government planning agencies. Furthermore, the studies
were to assist in the formulation of a long-term water control plan in the
Guayas Basin and thus help to eliminate a fundamental constraint for
agricultural production.
2.08      The project was to include:
(a) establishment and training of a planning and project
preparation unit (UNDER) within the planning board (JUNAPLA),
designed to provide national leadersh'p in rilicy
analysis and direction of all Government at .vity
related to rural development;
(b) studies contributing to the long range flood control, drainage
and agricultural development of the Lower Guayas Basin--
including feasibility studies in two areas of about 100,000 ha
eacn;
(c) preparation of two rural developmentl/ projects in the
highlands in the Province of Tungurahua; and
(d) preinvestment studies of rural development in the Esmer-ldas
river basin and preparation of a rural development Investment
project.
2.09      The project was to form the basis of a larger Bank role in rural
development in Ecuador.
III. PROJECT DMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The loan was approved March 30, 1976 and became effective
October 20, 1976. There was some delay in meeting the condition of
effectiveness regarding hiring of a rural development team leader
(consultant) and designating his counterpart. The consultant's contract was
finalized in September 1976. The appraisal assumed a three-year
implementation period for the principal activities requiring consultants
(UNDER), and the completion date was June 30, 1980. Actual implementation
took more than 7 years and the closing date was December 31, 1983.
1/ The areas of Huachi-Pelilea and Quero-Ladrillos-Ruambalo, that now
constitute the Tungurahua Project Loan 1644-EC, were originally envisaged
as separate projects.



-4-
A. Achievement by Component
3.02      The project was originally designed to provide foreign technical
assistance for: (a) establishment and operation of a Rural Development
Planning Unit (UNDER); (b) conduct of studies in the Lower Guayas Basin; (C)
preparation of projects in the Province of Tungurahua; (d) preparation of
project3 in the Esmeraldas Basin. The appraisal estimated that about 294
man-months of consultants would be required; however, after long delays, and
amendment of the loan agreement in September 1980 (para. 3.08), the Bank
agreed to reimburse for both local and foreign consultant services. The
total man-months of consultants used is not available as provision of
consultants were part of comprehensive contracts with the executing
agencies-INERHI, CEDEGE and IGM (para. 3.08).  Seventy-one man-months were
utilized as follows: (a) 12 man-months foreign consultants services were
provided for UNDER (para. 3.03 and 3.22); (b) 24 man-months for the
Sanborondon Pilot Rice Irrigation Project (para. 3.15); and (c) about 31
man-iaonths of short-term foreign consultant services were financed as part of
the INEREI, CEDEGE and FONAPRE contracts to assist in the conduct of
studies. Expenditures by component are shown in table 3.1 below and the
related activities are discussed in subsequent paragraphs.

-5-
3.03      After the loan became effective in October 1976, and the consultant
required as a condition of effectiveness was hired (para 3.01), there was a
long and Intensive exchange of communications between the Bank and the
Government regarding further recruitment of consultants. Initial supervision
missions focused on this issue. At one time it was indicated that a
Presidential Decree would be necessary to enable JUNAPLA to engage
international consultants for the rural development planning unit (UNDER);
however there is no evidence that a decree was ever enacted or even
required. Following furtlher delays an attempt was made to use the UNDP as a
vehicle for engaging consultants. After arrangements were finally made with
UNDP the proposal was rejected by the coordinating agency leaving the issue
unresolved once again.
3.04      In the meantime some short-term specialists had been engaged to
assist with preparing the terms of reference (first phase) for the Lower
Guayas Studies.
3.05      By the original completion date of June 30, 1980 only 10% of the
loan had been disbursed; however, preparation of the Tungurahua, Puerto Ila
Chone and Esmeraldas Projects (para 2.02) had been completed, for the most
part using other sources of finance, I.e., OAS and GOE for Esmeraldas, and
the Fourth Highways Project Loan 1231-EC for Puerto Ila Chone.
3.06      The Loan Agreement was amended In September 1980, the end of
project year 4, to provide for Bank disbursements from the loan account for
both local and foreign consultants. By this time supervision missions had
already given up on UNDER and had previously recommended that funds allocated
to that component (Part A of the project) be cancelled because it had become
apparent that the Government no longer considered it important enough to see
that consultants would be engaged to provide adequate staff for the unit.
Thus one of the principal objectives of the project, to establish an
effective rural development planning unit to formulate national policy,
control resources, and guide project identification and preparation was not
achieved. Following events unrelated to the project some of the functions
originally intended for UNDER were absorbed by the new Secretariat for
Integrated Rural Development (SEDRI) establiahed in 1981.4/
3.07      The first phase Lower Guayas Basin Studies, carried out by INERHI
and CEDEGE with the assistance of consultants, made satisfactory progress and
the report and T.O.R. for the second phase detailed studies were completed in
March 1979. However, execution of the second phase encountered numerous
problems and delays, the most serious of which was the arrangements for and
carrying out of the aerial photography and related topographic mapping.
3.08      It had been envisaged that aerial photography and mapping would be
undertaken by contract with a commercial firm to be selected in accordance
with normal procedures of the Bank and the Government of Ecuador. However,
the Bank was advised that IGM was the only agency in Ecuador authorized to
take aerial photography. In September 1980, following amendment of the Loan
Agreement to permit Bank finance of local expenditure,5/ the primary
4/ Government has provided further explanation of this situation in
Attachment V.
5/ This amendment provided for reimbursement of services provided by firms
and agencies locally contracted and local expenditures.



4
executing agencies (INERHI and C)DE3E) for the second phase Lower Guayas
Studies signed a one-year contract with IGM for the aerial photography and
mapping. The contraet ended in May 1981 with less than 5% of the aerial
photography having been completed.
3.09      Based on IGW's failure to perform, the Bank suggested that all or
part of the work be contracted to a commercial firm. However, I&M's contract
was modified and extended to January 30, 1982 after the Bank verified that
ION had the capability and capacity to do the work.  By January 1982 about
600,000 ha (80% of the aerial photography) had been completed and 400,000 ha
(67%) had been certified as adequate for restitution. The IGN contract was
once again extended to September 1983 at which time the works were 95%
complete. The aerial photography and topographical mapping was
satisfactorily completed in 1984.
3.10      There were some factors beyond the control of IOM which contributed
to delays--long periods of heavy cloud cover in the Basin, poor conditions
during the dry season caused by burning of rice straw, unavailability of
aircraft at the proper time, etc. However, given the small number of flying
hours required to photograph the area, it is reasonable to assume that the
photography could have been completed much sooner had the project been given
sufficiently high priority.
X.11      In addition to the aerial photography and topographic mapping,
hydrological, soil and land tenure studies were carried out, which can form
the basis for a long term plan to develop the Lower Guayas Basin.
Prefeasibility studies were completed for two areas of about 200,000 ha and
150,000 ha. The Government of Ecuador has recently requested the Bank to
consider the possibility of financing a project for flood control and
drainage in these areas.
3.12      The performance of INERHI and CEDEGE, the two agencies responsible
for executioa of the Lower Guayas Basin Studies, although delayed, was
satisfactory. The reports provide detailed analysis of various aspects,
focusing on irrigation and drainage, required for future development of the
Basin. The studies indicate that there is a good potential for agricultural
production in the area; however, final feasibility studies would be required
before investment can be made.
3.13      Preparation of a project in the Province of Tungurahua (Part C) was
already at an advanced stage when the Technical Assistance Project became
effective; however, the project contributed to the final stages of
preparation. The Tungurahua Rural Development Project was appraised by the
Bank in November 1977 and February 1978 and became effective in September
1979. At the request of the Government, part of the funds earmarked for
preparation of the Tungurahua Rural Development Project were used to carry
out a marketing study for the Ambato municipality. A study of the market
requirements and the design of a municipal market facility was completed in
1983. The Ambato Municipal Market construction is expected to be financed by
the Ecuadorian Development Bank (BEDE).



-7-
3.14      Part D of the project was to carry out feasibility studies in the
Nsmeraldas Basin and prepare projects for possible Bank finance. Two
projects were prepared: (i) Pterto Ila Chone Rural Development (now Bank
Loan 1991-EC); and (iiW smeraldas Rural Development (nov Bank Loan 2044-BC).
This project made no contribution to preparation of either of these projects
because their preparation was financed from other sources, pdinoipally OAS
and GOE.
3.15      A fifth activity (Part E), the Sanborondon Pilot Rice Irrigation
Scheme was added at the Government's request in Narch 1979. The objective of
the scheme was to demonstrate that rice could be produced in the area by
constructing a system of dikes and pumps for flood and water control. A
consultant was engaged for two years and the demonstrations were successful.
Private farmers, with the assistance of INNRHI, have subsequently adopted the
system and completed development of about 2,000 ha (para 3.08).
3.1'      As the result of the Government's emphasis on rural development
beginning in the mid-1970s and the Bank's support of that policy and program,
the Bank has subsequently financed three rural development projects (para
2.02). All three projects have experienced serious delays in
implementation.
B. Disbursements
3.17      Total disbursements under the project were US$2,831,531.00--70% of
the loan amount. The balance of US$1,168,469.00 was cancelled September 22,
1984 (Annexes 1 and 2). ProJect execution and disbursements were exceedingly
slow reaching only about 10% of the loan amount in the first 4 years. After
amending the Loan Agreement in September 1980, to provide for finance of
local as well as foreign expenditures, and later improvement in the
performance of 1M, 60% of the loan funds were disbursed in the final 3 years
of the project.
C. Procurement
3.18      Procurement was a problem to the extent that there was a reluctance
on the part of the executing agencies to engage foreign consultants. The
appraisal report and consequently the Loan Agreement were too rigid in
allowing disbursements only for 100% of foreign expenditures, thus precluding
any Bank finance of local consultants. Following amendment of the loan
agreement, loal firma and agencies were contracted according to procedures
satisfactory to the Bank (para. j.02 and 3.08). Bquipment and materials were
purchased following local procedures acceptable to the Bank. Expenditures
for equipment (purchased by LCB) was much higher than originally estimated,
however, this was money well spent as it provided for the establishment of
rainfall and hydrological metering stations that will provide essential data
in the Lower Guayas Basin for many years to come.



D. Reports and Auditing
3.19      Periodic reports were not submitted on a regular basis.  Records
and accounts consistent with sound acc"'nting practices were not regularly
made available to the Bank. In 1982, an unaudited financial report was
submitted to, and reviewed by the Bank. The 1983 audited financial statement
for FONAPRE was received in January 1985.
E. Compliance with Covenants
3.20      The Borrower failed to employ a team of consultants to assist in
the establishment and operation of a rural development planning and project
preparation unit. Independent of the project, the Government established a
Secretariat for Rural Development (SEDRI) within the President's Office with
the main purpose of coordinating the implementation of rural development
projects. The Borrower did not prepare adequate periodic reports or
financial statements.
3.21      FONAPRE was required to make the proceeds of the loan available to
the various executing agencies. However, complex administrative procedures
for hiring of consultants and processing contracts contributed to delays in
implementation.
F. Performance of Consultants
3.22      A team leader for the rural development unit was hired in September
1976 as a condition of effectiveness; however, he resigned at the end of the
first year because he was unable to carry out his duties. A consultant was
hired for two years to carry out the Sanborondon Pilot Rice Project. Several
short-term consultants were engaged to assist in the preparation of the
T.O.R. for the Lower Guayas Studies and their performance was satisfactory.
Consultants (local and foreign) were hired by INERHI and CEDEGE to assist in
carrying out the Lower Guayas Studies and consultants (local and foreign)
were hired by FONAPRE to carry out the Ambato Market Studies (para. 3.13).
Performance of consultants was considered satisfactory.
IV. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
4.01      The project was not designed to have a direct agricultural or
economic impact and no analyses were carried out at appraisal or for this
PCR.



- 9 -
V.  BANK PERFORMANCE
5.01      The Bank was overly optimistic about its ability to assist the
Government of Ecuador in the planning, preparation and implementation of
rural development projects. In hindsight it is questionable whether the
establishment of a rural development planning and preparation unit was a
viable proposition. The Bank over-emphasized the role of foreign consultants
and apparently did not have a firm commitment on the part of the Borrower to
hire foreign consultants. Early supervision missions focused on the problem
of hiring foreign cousultants but failed to achieve a satisfactory solution
to the problem. Also it would appear that the appraisal mission was not
aware of the restriction regarding the taking of aerial photography by
foreign firms.
5.02      Frequency of supervision missions was adequate and they recognized
as early as 1978 that the principal objective of the project, to establish a
rural development planning and preparation unit, was not going to succeed and
recommended that finance allocated for that component be cancelled. On
several subsequent occasions it was suggested that the loan be cancelled
and/or that the closing date not be extended.
5.03      With the prospect for follow-up investment in the Lower Guayas
Basin for flood control, drainage and increased agricultural production
(para 10), extension of the closing date to complete the Lower Guayas Studies
may have been justified. Initial review indicates tnat the basic studies
completed under the project are adequate for preparation of investment
projects.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      Funds for execution of the project were channeled through FONAPRE,
the Governments agency for financing and coordinating preinvestment studies.
The principal responsibility for execution of the project was assigned to
JUNAPLA (now CONADE). It has not been possiule to determine what role, if
any, CONADE played under the project. It was JUNAPLA's responsibility to
establish a rural development planning unit (UNDER) and make suitable
arrangements for carrying out studies and 'implement projects arising from the
studies. INERHI, CEDEGE, IGM and NAG were the technical agencies designated
to execute the Lower Guayas Basin studies and the Sanborondon Pilot
Irrigation Project and performed satisfactorily after considerable initial
delay. The institutional framework for planning and implementation of rural
development activities was not strengthened by the project. INERHI and
CEDEGE have established a network of rainfall and hydrological metering
stations throughout the Lower Guayas Basin that will serve to provide
essential data for development of the area.



- 10 -
6.02      JUNAPLA never succeeded in establishing UNDER; therefore FONAPRE,
the specialized government preinvestment agency, was assigned the
responsibility for arranging for coordinating the studies. FONAPRE's complex
procedures for engaglng consultants became a constraint to execution of the
project. Although FONAPRE had the responsibility to make arrangements for
execution of the project It did not have the authority or control to assure
timely and proper implementation of the project activities.
6.03      The inability to engage consultants in a timely manner and
institutional ehanges made it necessary to reprogram the project three times
during the seven-year implementation period. Esmeraldas Basin Rural
Development project's preparation was carried out successfully using other
resources. Part of the funds ($70,000). originally earmarked for the
Tungurahua Project preparation were used to carry out the Ambato Municipal
'Market study and design. It is estimated that expenditures under the
Tungurahua component were about $178,000 and the Bank disbursed about
$140,000. The Sanborondon pilot rice scheme (costing about $208,000-
$157,000 disbursed by the Bank) was financed from funds originally allocated
to other components that were not completed under the project.
6.04      FONAPRE prepared a PCR but details about man-months of consultants
and performance of consultants were not provided.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENATIONS
7.01      The project did not achieve its principal objective of
strengthening the institutional framework for rural development planning,
preparation and project execution. After considerable delay, the Lower
Guayas Basin Studies (including the Sanborondon Pilot Rice Project) were
satisfactorily completed. These studies can provide the basis for
preparation of a master development program and investment projects for the
Lower Guayas Basin.
7.02      The major lesson of the project regarding limiting Bank
disbursements to foreign exchange (thus foreign consultants) has been
rectified in subsequent Bank policy and procedure changes. In projects of
this nature, where it is considered necessary to engage foreign consultants,
such as staff for the rural development planning unit (UNDER), and carry out
aerial photograpy and mapping, a firm commitment must be obtained from the
borrower during appraisal and loan negotiations. For future projects, when
aerial photograpy and mapping consultants are required, the Bank should
require that a number of local and foreign firms (acceptable to the Bank and
the Borrower) be invited to submit offers, and be evaluated and selected
according to agreed criteria. Experience under this project has tndicated
that simply having the technical capability to undertake the work (as in the
case of IGM) is not sufficient justification for accepting that the works be
done by force account. In this case, neither the contracting agencies
(INERHI or CEDEGE) had sufficient control or any recourse over the
performance of the contractor.6/
6/  Government has countered that INERHI discharged its responsibilities
satisfactorily in setting up a supervision and monitoring unit which
submitted quarterly reports to FONAPRE (Attacbment III).



- 11 -
7.03      Tho experience of this project indicates that som. of the
activities did not have a sufficiently high priority to obtain Government
interest to resolve problem of hiring consultants and delays in contract
performance.7/ Furthermore, the. Bak did not have adequate experience in
dealing with rural development to play the guiding role envisaged (para.
1.03).
7/ Government has questioned the accuracy of this evaluation and bas
explained the basis of its counterview in Attachment IV.

Dear Sir:
Thank you for your letter of April 25 and the Project Completion
Report for the Technical Assistance Project, L?qn 1230-EC, prepared by the
World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department.&'
We feel that this is a useful document which accurately reflects the
objectives of the project, its effectiveness, the causes of delays and the
most significant achievements.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has already carried out
reviews of progress in certain Integrated Rural Development projects,
particularly that of Puerto Ila-Chone, Quininde - Malimpis - Nueva Jerusalen,
Tungurahua; the findings as regards delays in execution coincide with those in
the ex-post evaluation of project 1230-EC, viz.:
-    Delays in feasibility studies
-    Delays in effecting disbursements
-    Sluggish bureaucratic procedures
-    Problems with bidding competitions for contracting physical works
-    Delays in contracting consultants
-    Others.

May I also suggest that in future ex-post evaluations the World Bank
should include the following aspects, which are vitally important for purposes
of analysis:
-    When amendments and additions are made to the loan agreement, it is
essential to update the loan and subloan conditions.
-    For purposes of comparison, measurement and analysis, an examination
of accounting and auditing performance is necessary.
-    It is also important to detail the programming and reprogramming of
project activities.
-    As this was a Technical Assistance Project it would be appropriate
to mention the number of beneficiaries that received formal or
in-service training, identifying the specialization, location and
duration.
Thank you for sending us this important report, on which we
congratulate you.
Yours, etc.,

From: Jos6 Guerra, Director of Planning
Subj:  Comments Requested by World Bank
Date: May 26, 1986
With reference to the request for comments from this Directorate on
the Project Completion Report for the Technical Assistance Project
(Loan 1230-EC), I hereby submit the following comments under three headings:
-    Aspects of Project Organization
-    Partic..pation of CEDEGE
-    Observations and Suggestions.
Aspects of Project Organization
In diagram form the structure of the project was as follows:
IDB

COORDINATION

PROJECT        CEDEGE    MAG    INERE                   PROJECT

*               X
*E~iTCONTCTED                j
Although there were formal links between IDB and JUNAPLA and
FONAPRE, project supervision and monitoring were not among the specific tasks
of any of these organizations; this caused difficulties for the coordination
of the various projects assigned to the agencies executing the studies, such
as MAG, INERHI and CEDEGE.
It should be noted that FONAPRE, in its capacity as the organization
through which project funds were channeled, had neither the legal machinery
nor the supervision systems to enable it to function as project coordinator,
which prejudiced project activities.



-18-               Attachm9at II
Pa8e 3 ofr
This leads to a first conclusion: responsibilities must be definec
and delimited before a start on the project is authorized, given the joint
intervention of various executing agencies.
Participation of CEDEGE
The World Bank comments positively on the execution of the studies
and the technical level achieved, although we should consider the kind of
contracting to be used in future work with the IGM in view of the impact on
project duration and costs.
In order to speed up aerial photography we believe that it is
necessary to:
-    Carry out the aerial photography restitution work with the
institution or with private companies; or
-    Contract the aerial photography and restitution work with private
companies and pave the way for changes in the Cartography Law, which
should not be affected in its basic purpose of protecting national
security; through a process of proper zoning, including the
definition of security limits, the work could be carried out in a
timely and efficient manner.
Suggestions for Future Proiects
1.        We need to devise an organization structure in conjunction with
institutions with similar functions and objectives (CEDEGE-INERHI), and
comparable activity levels (MAG-SEDRI).
2.        The administrative procedures of the lending agency should be
reviewed insofar as the present structure of that institution is not perhaps
entirely appropriate to meet the ever-growing needs of the developing
countries. Its multi-layer procedures and regulations, etc., may initially
provide a framework for situations and help define courses of action, but
subsequently they become stumbling blocks for the institution's own activity.
The Bank is then prevented from responding rapidly to requests for technical
and financial assistance from its member countries.
A review of operating policies would contribute significantly to
swift reactions and timely measures by the Bank in its relatione with
institutions in the borrowing countries.
3.        Systematic evaluation of the activities in a project would probably
lead to substantial improvements in both project design and execution.

Re: Comments on Loan 1230-EC
Dear Mr. Maiss:
In reply to your letter of April 25, 1986, requesting comments on
the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 1230-IC), I write to inform you that
INERHI participated in the following studies:
Lower Guayas Basin Prolect
In 1976, to promote studies designed to boost rural development in
Ecuador, the National Government signed a loan agreement with the World Bank
for the partial financing of the Program to Prepare Rural Development Projects
in the Lower Guayas Basin. In September 1976, INERI and CEDEGE signed an
agreement to carry out the program with the assistance of the National
Planning Board (JUNAPLA). The study was planned in three phases:
Phase I: 1976-1978: Project identification, resulting in the selection
of two major projects for flood control in rural areas and villages, and
irrigation and drainage works. These two projects were known as
Yaguachi-Taura and Vincababa.
Phase IT: Prefeasibility studies of the selected projects. These vere
partially financed by FONAPRE, and in May 1981 a loan contract was signed
under World Bank loan 1230-EC. In September of that year INERHI startel
on the studies for Yaguachi-Taura (now called Lower Guayas Basin), which
were completed in 1984.
In this connection, we approve the Bank's technical report, except
as regards Chapter VII, Conclusions and Recommendations, which statee that   Commented'
neither INERHI nor CEDEGE provided adequate supervision of the contractors'   upon in
performance, or had any type of recourse in that connection.                     Footnote 6
para. 7.02.



- 20 -                     Attachment III
Page 2 of 2
We wish to affirm that INERHI discharged its responsibility, having
set up the Supervision and Monitoring Unit (Unidad de Supervisi6n y
Fiscalizaci6n), which submitted quarterly reports to FONAPRE as a basis for
its payments.
DRI-Tun&urahua Project
With respect to the Tungurahua Integrated Rural Development Project,
all its objectives were accomplished in 1977-78. Within the Tung"srahua
Project, in the Irrigation and Drainage Subproject, there is the
Ambato-Ruachi-Pelileo project and the Mocha-Quero-Ladrillos project, under
which all of the distribution system is presently being constructed, financed
by World Bank Loan 1644-EC and the respective local counterpart.
With respect to the financial statement on Loan 1230-EC, it would be
advisable to obtain verification of e&isting data from the agencies
responsible for handling the loan funds, since INERHI was directly in charge
of the technical side.
Yours very truly,
Is/ Pedro Alava Gonzalez M.Sc.
Executive Director of INERHI

Subject: Project Completion Report on Ecuador Technical
Assistance (Loan 1230-EC)
Dear Sir:
I refer to your letter of April 25, 1986 with which you sent us a
copy of the Project Completion Report on Ecuador Technical Assistance,
Loan 1230-EC, administered by the National Pre-Investment Fund (FONAPRE).
I would appreciate it if you would revise the following statements
in the report, so that it will contain balanced conclusions regarding the
experience obtain from execution of the project:
-    Highlights.,/Page iii, para. 7 of Spanish (page iv, para. 6 of
English)
We do not consider the value judgment expressed as follows at the
end of this paragraph to be accurate: "Because of the various
independent executing agencies, the National Pre-Investment Fund
Commented            (FONAPRE), which was the channel for project funds, encountered
upon in              difficulties in coordinating operations under the project as it did
Footnote 1,          not have adequate authority or control over the executing agencies
Evaluation           and its own administrative procedures contributed to project
Summry.              implementation delays."
On this point, and in order to offset such judgments, we would
mention the following:
1.   The different supervicion missions found that once the problem
connected with the establishment of the Rural Development Planning
Unit (UNDER) had been overcome, FONAPRE's coordination was
fundamental for the implementation of the projects referred to in
the report, so that even internal administrative problems connected
with various national institutions having institutional jurisdiction
over the Lower Guayas Basin were successfully overcome. Once it was
1/ Evaluation Summary.



22 -                    Attachment IV
Page 2 of 2
agreed that INERHI and CEDEGE would be solely responsible for the
projects, the objective of the Technical Assistance Agreement was
achieved in that the basic studies for the country's most important
river basin were carried out.
To give due recognition to the problems overcome by FONAPRE, we
would also point out the following:
2.   Regarding the statement that "its own administrative procedures
contributed to project implementation delays," we feel it necessary
to observe that the selection of the individual consultants for
UNDER, which did take an excessively long time, would not have been
stalled by disagreements between JUNAPLA and the World Bank, if it
had not been for the intervention of FONAPRE's administrative
procedures.
3.   An important point to add to the conclusions from this Technical
Assistance Project is that its contractual terms were extrenely
rigid, with the result that decisions to be taken by the World Bank
regarding proposals by FONAPRE took a very considerable time, which
was a factor that contributed significantly to the delays in project
implementation.
With the exception of the above points, we are in agreement with the
report as received.
Sincerely,

Mr. Otto Maiss
Acting Director, Operations
Evaluation Department
World Bank, Washington, D.C.
Dear Sir:
I refer to your letter of April 25, 1986, with which you sent CONADE
the Project Completion Report on Ecuador Technical Assistance (Loan 1230-EC).
I would like to make the following comments.
These comments relate exclusively to the establishment and operation
of a Rural Development Planning Unit (UNDER) within the Junta Nacional de
Planificaci6n y Coordinacion Econ6mica (JUNAPLA), which in its turn
constituted the chief objective of the project under reference.
1/
Paragraph 8-of the part of the report referring to project
implementation states that the creation and functioning of UNDER proved a
failure, which is not an accurate reflection of reality. The Rural
Development Unit in the National Planning Board (JUNAPLA), as it was then
mmented known, was in fact established with the support of the Bank technical
on in    assistance project; however, the national personnel forming the Unit were
otnote 29funded out of the budget of JUNAPLA, with whose participation the Secretaria
aluation de Desarollo Rural Integral (SEDRI) was established, including subsequently on
.mary    the basis of UNDER, within CONADE's functional organization, the Rural
d Foot-  Development Division, currently the Rural Development Program with functions
te 4,    and responsibilities that are clearly defined in the Integral Rural
ras 3#069Development Subsystem (Decree 637).
The project viewed as an end in itself evidently did not produce the
results expected from it, since the role of UNDER was canceled, one of whose
functions - that of coordinating and organizing the formulation and execution
of integrated rural development projects -- was assigned to the Secretaria de
Desarrollo Rural (SEDRI).
It is true that the formulation of national rural development policy
and the identification and prioritization of integrated rural development
projects were not defined by UNDER (Loan 1230-EC). However, they were clearly
defined by CONADE and approved by the Government through the 1980-84 and
1985-88 Development Plans.

To sum up, the establishment of UNDER served the country as the
start and the means for, with the participation of the 'State agencies,
achieving a larger goal, that of the creation and implementation of the Rural
Development Subsystem and the defining of rural development policy at national
level.
Sincerely,
/8/ Oswaldo D&vila Andrade
