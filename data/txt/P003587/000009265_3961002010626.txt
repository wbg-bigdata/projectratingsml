MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THR EIECUTIn. DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FORJ A =    VATE=  SUPPLY AND SANITfATION1 PROJECT
1.          I submit fox your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a prc. ,!sad Development Credit to the People's Republic of
China for SDR 78.9 million (US$110.0 million equivalent) to help finance a
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project. The proposed Credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds of the
Development Credit would be onlent to the six project provinces of Guangxi,
Yunnan, Hunan, Gansu, Neimong and Xinjiang for 20 years, including five years
of grace, at fixed annual interest of two percent for the foreign exchange
portion and four percent for the local currency portion. The Ministry of
Finance would be responsible for IDA commitment and service charges. The
participating provinces would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.          Back=round.  The lives of China's 900 million rural inhabitants
have improved markedly since 1949. There have been major gains in health,
housing, agricultural productivity and economic conditions. Health
improvements have resulted largely from better primary health care including
health educition campaigns, improved nutrition, better maternal and child
care, immunization, and improvements in drinking water and sanitation
facilities. Nevertheless, at the end of 1990, about 70 percent of the total
rural population was still inadequately served with water supply. More than
90 percent did not have means of proper sanitation, and unhygienic practices
in the use of nightsoil in agriculture are widespread. Health and hygiene
education is also limited. As a result, rural areas are still plLgued by
dysentery, hepatitis, typhoid and cholera epidemics, and above all, common
diarrheal diseases and helminth infections, all of which are clearly linked to
poor water supply, sanitation and health/hygiene education. The conditions
tend to be worse in the poorer and more remote areas of the country where
development of the sector has lagged behind.
3.          At the highest level, the Government recognizes the need to
improve the water supply, sanitation and health/hygiene education sub-sectors
in parallel in order to reduce incidence of water-borne and sanitation related
diseases. However, this integrated approach is not yet well understood and
accepted by most local government officials, civic leaders and rural families.
They generally still regard improvements in water supply as by far the most
important among the sub-sectors. This can be demonstrated by reviewing
development records and the willingness of local government and users to
contribute to water supply construction. On the other hand, recognition of
the health consequences of poor sanitation is not widespread and it must be
anticipated that demand for improvements will take time to develop and will
need to be stimulated.
1     In the context of the proposed project, sanitation refers to physical
facilities as well as the promotion of hygiene and prevention of disease by
achieving and maintaining sanitary conditions.

4.          The fundamental problem of the sector is the lack of cocrdinated
planning and Ii-estment programs at the national as well as local levels.  The
service coverage targets reflected in national plans in most cases have never
been translated into concrete and realistic investment strategies and plans at
the provincial, county and township levels, which are the prime movers for
development, both in terms of initiative and financing. Other issues and
constraints include lack of funding and financing mechanism, weak
institutional framework, and limited knowledge and experience with the latest
technological developments.
5.          Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operation.  The Bank Group's
involvement in the sector started in 1982. The first Rural Water Supply
Project (RWS) (Cr. 1578-CHA for SDR 82.1 million), approved in 1985, was
designed to provide safe drinking water to some six million rural inhabitants
in the four relatively well-off provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Liaoning and
Shaanxi and the Municipality of Beijing. Technical assistance, institutional
development and training were included as components. The physical
implementation is now complete. Design, construction and operation and
maintenance manuals primarily for piped water supply systems have been
published and disseminated in an effort to provide guidance and standards.
Experience with and benefits of competitive procurement have also been gained.
'Where sub-projects are operational, statistics on improved livelihood have
been very encouraging. However, it was observed that health improvements
would onlr be maximized if complementary improvements in sanitation services
and health/hygiene education were provided as integral parts of the
undertaking. The key difference between RWS and the proposed project is the
inclusion of the two complementary components.
6.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project would support the Bank
Group's objective of increasing its focus on poverty and the environment in
lending to China. The continuation of IDA's participation in the rural water
supply sub-sector is essential to sustain the momentum generated under RWS.
The integrated approach of the proposed project would provide an opportunity
to develop and demonstrate appropriate models for national replication.
Experience and lessons learned from the earlier project are being shared in
workshops. Various manuals developed and published under RWS are being
disseminated to new project areas to facilitate sub-project planning and
design. During project preparation, existing water supply manuals were
reviewed and gaps were identified. A supplemental manual on non-piped
technologies is being prepared. Water quality guidelines appropriate for the
rural setting were developed. In addition, a first sanitation planning and
design manual is also under preparation.
7.          Progject Objectives.  The overall project objective is to improve
health and productivity of the poorest and most needy inhabitants of rural
China by increasing coverage of water supply, supported by sanitation
services, health/hygiene education, technical assistance and training.
Through project preparation and implementation, immediate objectives set for
the project are to: (a) develop long-term strategies to prioritize investments
at the county level; (b) develop affordable and sustainable programs to
maximize project impact; (c) establish and maintain properly staffed
institutions and provide technical assistance and training to support
adoption, implementation and operation of such programs; (d) increase coverage



-3-
in water supply, sanitation and health/hygiene education; and (e) enhance
replicability of project activities through development of models, standards
and manuals as well as dissemination of experience and lessons learned.
8.          Project Description.  The proposed project would serve about nine
million rural inhabitants of 75 counties in the six under-developed inland
provinces of Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan, Gansu, Neimong and Xinjiang. The project
would comprise five components: (a) Water, Suply - construction of facilities;
provision of equipment and utility vehicles; continuation of development,
introduction and dissemination of new technologies; (b) Sanitation -
construction of facilities in selected demonstration and pilot villages in
each project county; provision of the foundation for replicable programs
through demonstration; (c) Health/Hygiene Education (HHE) - provision of HHE
to all project counties; construction of training facilities; development and
dissemination of training and HHE materials; provision of supplies, equipment
and utility vehicles; (d) Technical Assistance and Training (TAT) - provision
of TAT in management, finance, procurem rnt, training of trainers, and
technical aspects of the first three project components at all levels; and (e)
Institution Establishment and Project Nanagement - construction of project
offices; provision of office supplies and equipment; and financing of project
management and supervision activities.
9.          Project Imnlementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by project offices at the national, provincial and county levels. The project
cost is estimated at US$189 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$85 million equivalent (45 percent). The IDA Credit woulb
finance US$110 million equivalent (100 percent of foreign exchange and 24
percent of local costs). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps
are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No. 10028-CHA, dated
January 9, 1992 is being distributed suparately.
10.         Project Sustainability.  In line with the national sector policies
of self-reliance and cost recovery, water charges would cover full operating
cost and some capital cost. Physical facilities to be built under the project
are expected to be adequately operated and maintained by the beneficiaries.
Public and communal systems would be operated and maintained by water
companies and caretakers under the township governments. Private facilities
serving single families would be maintained by the households.
11.         Actions Agreed.  Assurances were obtained from China that: (a) the
project offices would be maintained with qualified staff in adequate numbers;
(b) comprehensive project implementation plans for the following year would be
prepared and submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than October 15
of each year; (c) project cost accounts would be audited annually and audit
reports would be submitted to IDA within six months after the end of each
financial year; and (d) water charges for all sub-projects would cover
operations and maintenance costs plus debt repayment not covered by government
subsidies, and operations and maintenance costs and depreciation after the
debts have been amortized. Satisfactory completion and distribution of design



- 4 -
manuals for low-cost rural water supply technologies and rural sanitation
facilities would be a condition of Credit disbursement for civil works.
12.         Pr2ject Benefits.  The project would benefit about nine million
persons in 75 rural count.es. It is expected to alleviate human suffering
associated with poverty and ill healhh. It is also expected to bring about
better quality of life throcgh improved physical living conditions and
institutional environment.
13.         Poverty Impact.  Thrcmig;A improved access to basic levels of water
supply, time and energy saved on water collection would be spent on child and
elderly care and productive activities. By bringing about improved sanitation
services and hygienic practices, the project is expected to have substanttal
health benefits in disease reduction. It would reduce morbidity which is
costly both in terms of product_re time loss and medical expenses. During
construction and operation phases, the project would provide training and
income-earning opportunities for women and men. Experience gained would also
enhance the ability of participant communities to compete for jobs of similar
nature in their neighboring localities, thub putting the poor's most abundant
asset, their labor, into most effective use.
14.         Environmental Impact.  The project would have a positive impact on
the environment through improved practices for the disposal of human wastes,
construction of enclosures for animals, collection and compost of manure,
drainage improvements, protection of groundwater and other water sources from
contamination, and monitoring of water quality. The provision of a safe and
reliable water supply, improved environmental sanitation facilities, and
intensive health and hygiene education programs is expected to result in a
substantial improvement in awareness of environmental quality.
15.         Risks.  Shortage of qualified personnel in project management and
implementation might hamper progress. The country's policies on self-reliance
and cost recovery concerns might block poor communities from participating and
limit investment in the smnitation and health education components. The
project addresses these risks by: (a) strengthening management and provision
of technical assistance and training for all implementing agencies; (b)
production and dissemination of "user-friendly" manuals; (c) establishment of
review criteria for sub-project selection; (d) promoting community
participation and commitment from the start and through every stage of sub-
project planning and implementation; and (e) development of long-term
strategies and sustainable investment programs for sanitation and
health/hygiene education.
16.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Development
Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
