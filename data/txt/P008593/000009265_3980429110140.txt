EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.    Introduction and Scope:
The improvement of roads and highways is an important component of the overall
investment plan of Poland. The proposed project is considered to be very important for
the economic development. It will involve in improving and rehabilitating of roads and
highways due to heavy traffic activities. This project consists of several subprojects on
selected sections of the roads. The subprojects consist of rehabilitation of roads, bridges
for river crossings, construction of bypasses around towns etc. The proposed subprojects
have been selected on those sections that would improve traffic flow and minimize
"bottlenecks" of these roads.
Poland lies in temperate climatic zone. An important feature of the climate of Poland is
in transitional character between the maritime and continental climates. As a result there
are significant variances in seasonal temperatures during the summer and winter. The
rainfall varies from 450 to 600 mm through out the country.
The scope of the projects is provided below.
1.    Overall length of the road sections related to the projects  -  60Km
2.    River Crossings                                   -      3
3.    Improvements of major intersections               -      2
4.    Percentage of two lane roads in the project       -     20
5.    Percentage of routes passing the forest /total length of roads -  15
All roads will be designed to accommodate maximum allowable speed under worst load
conditions.
2.    Policy and Legal Issues
The Polish Government wishes to proceed with its proposed road project which will
require a full environmental assessment. In Poland, EA procedures are enforced by Law
and the Government requires that the EA must be approved at the State level. The
requirement to carry out EA for roads is based upon the 1995 decree by the Minister of
Environment Protection, and Nature Resources and Forestry Regional Planning Act of
1994. The EA must be conducted after finalizing the routes for each road and bridges,
which requires formal administrative decision to accept the land use and road
construction. The Administrative Decisions are issued by the Local (gmina)Authorities
after consultation with all major entities including regional authorities. The scope of EA
governed by the decree in 1995 stipulates that it meets the requirements set forth by the
European Union Regulations and their codes of practice. Additionally, it is



recommended that the EA for roads should follow comprehensive guidelines that was
published recently by the Agency for Construction and Operation of Motorways.
According to the Bank's environmental screening criteria on transportation projects,
especially those involving land clearing and leveling, new land development, bridges and
bypasses are considered to be environmental category "A". Therefore, a full
environmental assessment is required. This level of screening is in consistent with the
requirements of the Polish Government. The objective of both the polish government and
the Bank EA guidelines is to ensure that projects undergo comprehensive examination in
which environmental and socioeconomic issues are identified early in the project cycle,
so that the project can then be designed to optimize environmental and social benefits and
minimizing negative impacts by mitigating and compensating for adverse impacts.
There are many polish laws, regulations, decrees and guidelines that govern
environmental requirements and interagency responsibilities and coordination. A list is
provided below.
1.    Act of Protection and Management of Environment of 1980
2.    Regional planning Act of 1994
3.    Ministry of Environmental Protection (decree of the Minister of Environmental
Protection issued in 1995.)
4.    Water Law Act of 1974
5.    Nature Protection Act of 1991
6.    The Forest Act of 1991
7.    Act on Protection of Agriculture and Forest area of 1995
8.    Construction Law Act of 1994
9.    1980 Decree Issued by the Council of Ministers on Environmental Protection
Against Noise and Vibrations
10.   Decree of 1990 Issued by the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources and
Forestry on Air Protection against Pollution
11.   Decree issued in 1991 by the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources and
Forestry on the water quality and wastewater discharges
12.   Act of State Environment Protection Inspectorate in 1991
13.   Act of Toll Motorways of 1997
14.   Decree Issued by the Minister of Environment and Nature Resources and Forestry
on the impact of motorways on environment, arable land, forest and cultural
heritage
The prime focus of the requirements of regional administration is to make sure that the
planned roads are in conformity with the local land use management plan. A through
review was conducted before granting the construction permits. The detailed design must
be approved by the relevant Regional Authorities. Regional Environment Inspectorate
provides the general environmental supervision to make sure that all relevant
environmental regulations have been followed in accordance with regulatory
requirements.

3.    Collection of Baseline Data
The baseline data was collected by using a combination of existing available published
information and documentation, interviews with key individuals, and reconnaissance
level site visits to obtain environmental baseline data on each road segments and bridges.
Collected information including feed back from public meetings, which were organized
for citizens by Mayors of towns or head of communes. Data collection was focused on
obtaining sufficient information to postulate the nature of impacts that can accrue from a
given road segment or bridges identified in this project and recommend possible
mitigation strategies. In most cases, the study areas are limited to the immediate road
alignment. However, in other cases where mobile resources like river water, fauna and
wildlife, it was extended for some distant away from the right of way. The baseline
environmental data includes climatic conditions, surface geology, water resources
(surface water, acquit biota, groundwater); terrestrial biota (terrestrial flora, fauna,
wildlife etc.). Socioeconomic data includes commercial activities in the area,
demographics, recreational areas, heritage, cultural and archeological resources and
existing infrastructure. Based on the data collected, a list of negative environmental
impacts have been considered in the environmental assessment.
4.    Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures:
The environment cannot be comprehended by merely juxtaposing separate assessment for
each environmental components. Environment is made up of natural ecosystems, human
development activities and enviromnental factors that often affect one another
profoundly. During the environmental assessment of roads and bridges, many negative
environmental impacts have been evaluated. These environmental impacts cover: 1.
physical and natural environment that includes soil and erosion, water, air quality and
natural environment (flora and fauna). 2. Human and social environment cover
community life and economic activities, Land acquisition and resettlement, indigenous
and traditional people; cultural heritage, aesthetic and landscapes, noise, and road safety
3. management of road works and traffic operations include construction and roadside
activities, rehabilitation and maintenance practices and risks associated with roads works
and traffic operations. Negative enviromnental impacts, mitigation measures and actions
are presented in Table 1, 2, 3. The costs for mitigating the negative environmental
impacts are estimated to be in the range of 3 to 5% of the total costs of the project.
Environmental considerations used in the conventional design practices such as road
safety, storm drainage etc. are not included in the costs of mitigation measures.
5.    Reduction of Noise
Noise mainly affects urban areas and villages near roads with heavy traffic. It is one of
the most obvious impacts of daily road use. However, noise may also have added impact
during the construction. The use of standardized methods for assessing noise levels is
3



helpful. It should be noted that measurement methods very considerably in each country.
Cost of measures for protecting the environment from noise may vary but they may be
combined with landscape measures to minimize costs. The discomfort caused by noise is
difficult to assess; it includes auditory fatigue and temporary lessening of hearing ability.
Traffic flow, speed, acceleration and braking patterns, and vehicular composition play an
important role in developing the intensity of noise. Noise barriers such as wall, trees,
bushes and other protection have been commonly used in the urban areas where the
distance of buffer zone is small. Poland road authorities are aware of noise protection
measures and will consider on a case by case basis.
6.    Impacts on Flora and fauna:
In addition to the road itself, borrow sites and material stockpiling areas near quarries can
disturb the natural environment. In this project, fifteen percent of the road (about 9 Km)
will be passing through the forest areas and it will consume about 60 hectors of forests. It
will have a minor impact on the forest. Indirect effects of the roads can be minimized by
enforcing the laws which provide penalty for forest destruction, pouching, and minimize
impacts on the environment. Precautions will be also be taken to minimize the damage to
wild and marine life.
7.    Cultural Heritage:
Road construction and associated works such as quarrying and backflilling are not close to
any cultural and archeological sites except of Wolin bypass project #15.. Therefore, the
question of aesthetic impacts of road construction for that bypass is being reviewed
thoroughly by the Government.
8.    Indigenous or Traditional People
Indigenous or traditional people require special attention in road projects because they
possess a unique cultural heritage and have limited ability to defend their interests and
rights in land and other productive resources. In this project, there are no indigenous
living in the vicinity of road construction or nearby towns and villages. Therefore, this
issue has not been raised in this project.
9.    Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Road projects sometimes requires additional land, which must be acquired by the
govermnent from current users. While it is sometimes possible to negotiate the price for
a voluntary sale of the property, governments often have to use their rights of acquisition
of properties for public projects. In Poland, the laws are reasonable and a fair
compensation is being provided to the people whose land or property being affected.
There are less than twenty people who will be relocated. The government has provided a
reasonable compensation package so that it will not create hardship for them during
4



relocation. Legal compensation procedures have been used for the property owners who
are being affected by the construction of road bypasses.
10.   Positive Environmental Impacts:
It is recognized that the road projects will have some significant positive impacts on
environment particularly it improves the amenity of local and regional communities in
comparison with overall impact of the road improvement and development. For example
it improves local accessibility, parklands, shopping areas, commercial and industrial
development and other facilities which will help in improving education and quality of
life for the people. The road project also contributes to better traffic flow, reduction of
noise, and imnprovement in traffic safety. Positive environmental impacts are stated in
Table 4.
11.   Environmental Impacts During The Construction:
The regional and local environmental considerations were studied in the light of
demography, dynamism of landscape formation, biotic (soil, fauna and flora), human
response to environment and heritage. There are 15 subprojects as a part of this project.
Environmental impacts on these segments are studied for the following three stages of
road construction:
(a)   Construction of Camp sites
(b)   During Construction
(c)   After construction and during operation
Likely negative environmental impacts and mitigation measures are sununarized in
Tables 1, 2, 3
(a)   Construction of Camp Sites
In every case of road and bridges construction, the least negative impact sites have been
selected along with measures to maximize the positive environmental impacts and its
enhancements. Potentially significant environmental impacts are:
(1)   air pollution from asphalt plant
(2)   dust and noise pollution from crusher
(3)   sanitation and waste disposal.
Mitigation measures have been recommended and are expected to be monitored during
construction.
(b)   During Construction
During the construction of the roads, the potential significant impacts are provided below:
5



(1)   collection and disposal of construction materials;
(2)   collection and of oil and other spills
(3)   Ground water pollution
(c)   After Construction and During Operation:
Potential significant environmental impacts are as follows:
(1)   induced and uncontrolled development of commercial, residential, and industrial
units;
(2)   unplanned land clearing and alienation;
(3)   air and noise pollution from increased vehicular traffic.
(4)   Ground water and surface water pollution
12.   Alternatives of Alignment
The Road agency has conducted a study on several alternate routes for selection of
bypasses and bridges with respect to their cost effectiveness along with minimum
environmental damage. Several altematives were considered for alignment and
bypasses. In case of bypasses, the alternative proposals include considerations of
different routes requiring varying travel distances. However, most optimal routes have
been selected from the environmental and human health point of view.
13.   Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
The identified mitigating measures required to deal with the negative impacts directly
arising out of road construction activities and they would be carried out through
comprehensive design reviews based on considerations for environmental mitigation
measures. These mitigation measures could be implemented during road construction and
monitored by the Regional Environmental Administration and the State Directorate of
Public Roads (SDPR) by adhering to the standard design, specifications and construction
methods. However, involvement of an EA specialist would be an advantage, particularly
from the point of view of dealing with modifications and mitigation measures. It is
recommended that the mitigation measures should be monitored and guided through the
development of a Mitigation Management Plan (MMP) by using experts from key
agencies. A flow diagram for the Environmental Management and Monitoring plan with
respect to mitigation measures arising out of construction is provided in Figure 5. With
respect to other measures, it is suggested that ACOM and REA should form a committee
to serve as a forum for broad-based flow of information and decision making and to
provide a basis for identification and prioritization of handling the environmental
problems and development of mitigation measures.
14.   Risks Assessment:
6



Road accidents result in deaths, injuries, and damage to the property. They are major
public heath problems and can add to a significant cost to the economy. Although in
Poland road accidents are slowly increasing because of poor road conditions, lack of
bypasses through major towns, high travel speeds and lack of modernization of the roads.
Pedestrians and nonrotorized road users are especially vulnerable and accidents are
generally higher where these road users mix with motorized traffic, unless special
measures are adopted. In Poland, there is a national traffic accident reporting system for
more in-depth understanding of where accidents occur and what are the main contributing
factors. In this project, site-specific measures are proposed. These road measures include
improve in pavement and shoulder conditions, signs, markings, intersection layout and
control, roadside access, parking, bus stop arrangements, provisions for pedestrians,
cyclists and nonmotorized road users, road design standards, traffic management plans,
design audits, speed limiting measures, improvement of visibility by providing lighting,
improvement of crossings and so on. By developing proper mitigation measures, risk of
accidents can be minimized. A special attention should be given to the risk analysis and
assessment associated with transport of hazardous substances. Besides this, additional
measures will be required to protect ground and surface waters from contamination of
toxic substances resulting from the accidents. Therefore, there would be a need to
consider restrictions on speed limits and other measures on transport of hazardous
substances.
15.   Institutional Development and Training Programs
Road management and construction involved various agencies and the private sector.
Environmental specialists within the road agency are required to undertake studies,
develop mitigation plans and coordinate environmental activities with other government
agencies, institutions, and the private sector. Training in environmental skills is required
both for environmental specialists working on studies, mitigation plans, and supervision
of project implementation, and also for the road staff or road agencies, contractors, and
consultants responsible for planning, designing, constructing and managing roads.
Ultimately, success of sound implementation depends on the awareness of environmental
factors at all levels and stages of the project cycle, and on the motivation to deal with
problems whenever they arise. The training will be used to create or reinforce
environmental diagnosis, planning and management capabilities of the road agency and
its enviromnent team. Training should require a through understanding of environmental
regulations, laws, decrees and guidelines issued by each local, regional and federal
agencies and ministries. There would also be a need to provide training to the Ministry of
Environment and other regulatory agencies, who are responsible for issuing permits and
providing enforcement.
16.   Improvement in Community Life and Economic Activities:
Roads are provided to bring benefits to community life and economic activities through
improved access, lower transport costs and better markets for local products and services.
Road improvement will have a wider effects on community life and business,
7



considerably beyond the direct impacts of road construction. The road improvement will
have significant benefits to the surrounding community through better access to markets,
jobs, goods, and services. In general, road construction and rehabilitation are expected to
lead to modifications in the community and social environment around the road,
influencing various aspects of life styles, travel patterns, and social and economic
activities.
17.   Public Participation:
In each road segment and bridges, public meetings were conducted to gather opinion
regarding rehabilitation and improvements of the roads. To get the feed back from the
local people, public meetings were organized for citizens input by the mayors of towns
and head of communes. In each subproject, at least one public meeting was held. There
were twenty two public meetings in which at least 350 people participated. Large
majority of public is entirely in favor of these projects because it will not only improve
the economic and social development of the people but it could also minimize accidents
by providing bypasses across three major towns and villages.
18.  Conclusions and Recommendations
There are many enviromnental concerns associated with fifteen subprojects, Several
negative environmental impacts associated with road project have been identified and a
number of them could be mitigated without much difficulty. A mitigation plan has been
developed and actions have been recommended to address these concerns. The project
should set aside about 3 to 5% of the fund for environmental mitigation program
considered for the roads.
A number of direct and indirect enviromnental impacts of the proposed road construction
are considered during the design and can be monitored during the road construction.
These mitigation measures should be monitored by the State and Regional Environment
Protection Inspectorate. Regional Inspectorate are expected to provide general
environmental supervision and adherence to general environmental regulations of all
activities including the road construction.
Mitigating measures like combating desertification, control of induced development,
preventing contamination of ground water, development of storm water drainage program
should also be monitored during the construction phase. Minimization of noise in
populated areas are being considered by planting trees and bushes or constructing the
walls in the buffer zone.
