  Description                           The proposed series has been designed to support the Government of
                                        Bulgaria (GOB) to meet some of the challenges associated with EU
                                         accession -in the case of DPL I-and post-accession -DPL I1and 111.
                                        The DPL series i s supporting the adoption and implementation of policies
                                         to (i)increase employment and lay the foundations                 for long-term
                                        productivity growth by providmg incentives for job creation and improving
                                        quality of education and; (ii)     promote fiscal sustainabibty through efficiency
                                        gains in social sectors. Many of the policies are well placed to improve
                                        access to and quality of social services in the medium term, a secondary
                                        objective of the program.          The actions supported by the DPL series are
                                        expected to contribute in the medium term to increased speed of
                                        convergence with EU policies and standards, enhanced competitiveness
                                        through increased skills of the labor force and better investment clunate,
                                        more efficient health, education, and social assistance systems, and a more
                                        equitable access to basic social services.        The focus of th.ts DPL series
                                        reflects the Government's social sectors and productivity agenda and its
                                        strategic use of multilateral organizations support to implement reforms and
                                        improve outcomes in sectors that remain outside the sphere of intervention
                                        ofthe European Union.
Benefits                                It is expected that at the end of the DPL series (i) employment rate of
                                                                                                   the
                                        younger workers will have increased to at least 25 percent and older workers

                             spending will be under control; and more resources will be allocated to
                             outpatient care, therefore reaching a larger percentage of the underserved
                             population, (iii) a basic package of drugs wdl become more affordable and
                             introduction of new pharmaceutical products will be faster; and (iv) school
                             financing wdl be more efficient, and schools will have more incentives to

Risks                        Four types of risks could affect implementationof policies supported by
                             DPL 11:

                             Political risks
                             1. Recent European Parliamentary and municipal election results and loss
                                 of momentum after EU accession have created tension among and
                                 within the coalition member parties (which have wide differences and
                                 views on certain reforms). This may increase the dlfficulty of reaching
                                 an agreement on some reforms. Upcoming parliamentary elections in
                                 2009 may s h f t focus from important reforms and contribute to loss of
                                 momentum duringpreparation of DPL I11
                             2. The benchmark against which Bulgaria's performance is measured has
                                 shifted, not only with regards to productivity and social indlcators but
                                 also regarding wages and living standards; after many years of relatively
                                 flat wages and following accession to the EU trade unions are
                                 demanding salary increases, adding pressures to the economy and
                                 threatening to oppose reforms.
                             Macroeconomicrisks
                             1. There are risks that the ongoing turmoil in international financial
                                 markets and the projected weakening of economic activity in the
                                 eurozone may result in a slowdown in capital flows and real GDP
                                 growth in Bulgaria. Risks reflect Bulgaria's large current account deficit,
                                 highgross external debt and elevated inflation. These risksare mitigated
                                 by the government's commitment to continued tight fiscal policy,
                                 following an increase inthe fiscal surplus to 3.4 percent of GDP in2007
                                 and the decrease in external public and publicly guaranteed debt to 14
                                 percent of GDP.
                             Institutionalnsks
                             1. As an EUMember State, the Government's attitude to DPL supported
                                 measures may change relative to pre-accession-DPL I supported
                                 measures, and leverage capacity of Bank to guide policy changes could
                                 become more limited
                             Technicalrisks
                             1. Implementation capacity in some line ministries is limited

                             Mitigation mechanisms include maintaining a close dialogue with officials
                             from all political parties in the coalition, supporting policies that should
                             contribute to ease pressures on the economy -contributing        to increases in
                             labor productivity and flexibility of labor market, efficiency improvements in
                             social sectors; close cooperation with various departments in the European
                             Zommission, and substantial technical assistance to support institutional

                                      TO THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA




                                             I. INTRODUCTION

 1.        T h i s Program Document describes the second phase of three planned Social Sectors
 Institutional Reform - Development Policy Loans (SIR DPL I1 or simply DPL 11). The
 proposed series has been designed to support the Government of Bulgaria (GOB)to meet some
 of the challenges associated with EUaccession -in the case of DPL I-and post-accession -
 DPL I1and 111. The DPL series would support the adoption and implementation of policies to
 (i)increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term productivity growth by providing
 incentives for job creation and improving quality of education and; (ii)promote fiscal
 sustainability through efficiency gains in the social sectors. The actions supported by the DPL
 series are expected to contribute to increased speed of convergence with EU policies and
 standards, enhanced competitiveness through increased skills of the labor force and better
 investment climate, and more efficient health, education, and social assistance systems. Many of
 the policies are well placed to also improve access to and quality of social services over the
 medium term, a secondary objective of the program. The focus of this DPL series reflects the
 Government's social sectors and productivity agenda - as stated in the Bulgaria Convergence
Program and the National Reform Program submitted to the EU - and its strategic use of
 International Financial Institutions support to implement reforms and improve outcomes in
 sectors that are not fully covered by the Acquis Communautaire, i.e. the explicit request of the
 Government of Bulgaria to assist inreforming the social sectors.

2.         The issues tackled by the DPL I1have been highlighted by the EU both before and after
accession. In the European Union health, social protection and education policies are treated as
national affairs and therefore dlffer widely among countries.                    However, they are increasingly
subject to a process of policy exchanges and mutual learning among Member States called the
Open Method of Coordination, first introduced for the purpose of social policy at the 2000
Lisbon European Council.2 There are at least four arguments supporting interventions in the
social sectors ina European context: (i)          there i s a link between well functioning social sectors and
economic competitiveness, which i s among the parameters set by the Lisbon agenda; (ii)                              as
indlcated by the experience of other new EU member states, social sector spending may have a
large impact on the fiscal outlook of Bulgaria, whose improvement i s sought in preparation for
the adoption of the Euro in accordance with the Maastricht Criteria; (iii)harmonizing and



  Duringthe meeting of the European Council inLisbon (March 2000), the Heads of State launched a "Lisbon
Strategy" aimed at making the European Union (EU)a more competitive economy and achieving full employment by
2010. f i s strategy rests on three pillars: (i) economic pillar preparing the ground for the transition to a
                                              an
competitive, knowledge-based economy. Emphasis i s placed on the need to adapt constantly to changes in the
information society and to boost research and development; (ii)  a social pillar designed to modernize the European
social model by investing inhuman resources and combating social exclusion -investing      ineducation and training,
and conducting an active policy for employment; (iii) an environmental pillar, which draws attention to the fact that
economic growth must be decoupled from the use of natural resources. Given that the policies in question fall
almost exclusively within the sphere o f competence of the Member States, an open method of coordmation (OMC)
entailing the development o f national action plans has been introduced. Besides the broad economic policy
guidehes, the LisbonStrategy provides for the adaptation and strengthening of existing coordmation mechanisms.

                                                           7

converging to EU standards has now become an important goal of Government; and (iv)
improving the functioning of social sectors is part of an effective participation in the Open
Method of Coordmation.

3.      The Government remains committed to the goal of convergence to EU standards and
has made significant progress in implementing the policies agreed in the DPL program. The
government i s convinced that one of the pillars to achieve convergence while maintaining fiscal
discipline i s a well functioning labor market and more efficient delivery of social services to the
entire population. The objectives of the reform strategy supported by the DPL program are to
be achieved through the implementation of policies and actions oriented towards
    Creating incentives for individuals to join the labor market and to move to higher
    productivity jobs, and improving the institutional and regulatory framework -so        that it i s
    easier for companies to start new businesses and to hire workers, and for labor to be mobile

 *  Improving capacity of education authorities to assess quality of education and use
    information critically to improve the education system
    Changing the financing mechanisms of health (hospitals) and basic education services to
    make the systems financially sustainable and lay the ground for improvingtheir quality

 *  Prepare and initiate implementation of a plan for restructuring the health facilities network,
    and make purchasing and reimbursement policies for pharmaceuticals more rational; and

 *  Promotingmonitoringand evaluation of policies
4.      The DPL program emphasizes the need for evidence based policy making, and has
succeeded in developing a cross-cutting agenda in this area with the Government.               It is
supporting the government's efforts to invest in information gathering and developing
monitoring and evaluation capabilities. To this end the program is: (i)    supporting the ex-ante
assessment, and subsequent impact evaluation, of changes in one of the main social assistance
programs; (ii)  promotingthe collection and the critical use of information on education quality
through student assessments; and (iii) the capacity to evaluate the impact of policy
                                         building
changes and implement household surveys through accompanying technical assistance associated
to the DPL. Some of the policies supported by the DPL program are goingto show results only
inthemediumterm, i.e. notuntilafter the three-year DPLprogram. Theseinclude anincreasein
quality of education and access to underserved populations, a decrease in long term
unemployment, and an improvement in health outcomes through a more responsive supply of
services and improved access to drugs. While it will not be possible to capture and report on
these changes during the life time of the DPL program, the focus on evidence-based policy-
malung and establishment of an evidence base for the supported reforms are an essential
contribution to monitoringmedium-long-term effects of the reform program (includmg specific
DPL actions and complementary policies).
5.      The main strategic choices adopted inDPL Iare maintained inDPL 11. First, the Bank i s
providing high level policy advice and TA in addtion to financial assistance associated with the
DPL program. Second, h s situation requires a very streamlined approach, focusing on a few
very significant policies and concentrating the TA on those policies. Third, the DPL i s also
aiming at strengthening the implementation capacity of the government to support its strategies
and policies. Finally, the program has to remain flexible in order to respond to emerging needs
and requests from the Government. For example, in the context of the preparation of DPL I1
the Government has requested assistance in higher education, life-long learning, improving the
investment climate, and evaluating the impact of policy changes, issues that were not originally
part of the program. Making use of the flexibility of the DPL instrument some of these areas
may be included inthe next phase of the program. For example the Program Document sets the

                                                8

stage to include new actions to enhance labor productivity by adopting a broader view of job
creation, along the lines of the "MILES" approach.3 Finally, due to Bulgaria's continued fiscal
surplus and to the enhancements of the Bank lending instruments recently approved by the Bank
Board, the Loan supporting the second phase of the program includes the deferred drawdown
option @DO)at the Government's request, further adding flexibillty to the operation.


                                       11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSINBULGARIA

6.         InJanuary 2007 Bulgariabecame a European Unionmember, nine years after the
Accession Partnership was decided by the European Council. Over these nine years, a
broad reform agenda was implemented, macroeconomic stability was maintained and the
economy grew at a robust rate of 5.1 percent per year on average. Most of the non-infrastructure
enterprises and banks were privatized or liquidated, trade and prices were liberalized, energy
reforms made important progress, institutional reforms were implemented in a number of areas
and have improved the effectiveness of public institutions, and the first steps were taken in
regulatory reform to improve the investment climate. Fiscal consolidation reduced the overall
fiscal deficit from 15.2percent of GDP in 1996 to a balanced budget in 2003 and increasing fiscal
surpluses since then. Prudent fiscal policy has supported a substantial reduction in total public
debt -from over 100 percent of GDP in 1997 to below 25 percent in 2006. The markets have
responded well to Bulgaria's sustained, solid track record, and its credit risk rating was upgraded
to investment grade in mid-2004. Since then, FDI flows have exceeded 15 percent of GDP per
year, contributing to improved productive capacity of Bulgaria's economy.                        Sovereign bond
spreads declined significantly and borrowing costs for domestic investors were reduced
substantially thus boostinginvestment and credit growth.

7.         As a result of sound macroeconomic policies and deep structural reforms, average
growth exceeded 6 percent per year in 2004-07. Until2003 economic growth was dnven by
strong private consumption but the importance of investment has increased substantially since
then with investment accounting for 32 percent of GDP in 2006 compared to 23 percent in
2004. Manufacturing, finance, and trade contributed most to GDP growth with the contribution
of manufacturing increasing substantially over the last two years.                      These sectors were the
recipients of the largest amounts of FDI inflows. Strong economic growth was associated with
substantial improvements inlabor market performance. Number of employed increased by more
than 300,000 between 2004 and 2007 with most of the new jobs generated in the private sector
mainly in construction and service sectors, w l d e employment in public sector further declined.
The unemployment rate declined from 12 percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent of the labor force in
44-2007. However, Bulgaria's participation rate remains one of the lowest among the EUlO
countries, while shortages of labor are increasingly visible ina number of dynamic sectors.

8.         Risks to growth prospects are mounting inview of the increasing volatility in the
external environment and the projected slowdown in economic expansion in the
eurozone, although the investment boom may pay off in terms of higher productivity
growth. Real GDP growth remained little changed in2007 at about 6.2 percent relative to 2006,



3 T h i s approach maintains that a multi-sector strategy i s necessary in order to increase productivity and foster
employment growth, involving at least five areas: (i) macroeconomic stabkty; (ii) improvingthe investment climate;
(iii)labor market reforms; (iv) improvingeducation and skills; and (v) reforming the social safety net. The new
policies incorporated in DPL I1 and I11 are related to improving the investment climate and fostering skills
acquisition through higher rate of innovation and adoption of new technologies.

 despite a slowdown to 4.9 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2007 that reflected a sharp
 decline in agricultural production and decelerated growth of investment. Agricultural production
 declined by close to 44 percent inthe third quarter of 2007 reflecting adverse weather conditions
which affected severely major crops in the country.                                  Outside of agriculture, however, output
expansion remained very strong throughout 2007.                                     Increased investment in agriculture and
expected inflows of EU funds for agriculture producers would help reverse this downward trend
inagriculture this year. EUfunds andplanned largeinvestment projects by the Government are
also expected to keep high investment activity in the near term. Moreover, the recent upgrade of
capital stock and accelerated acquisition of machines and equipment i s expected to translate into
increased growth inproductivity, as also observed inother new EU member states4.
9.           Inflation has been on the rise in line with global developments and increasing
demand pressures. Inflation5averaged 6.5 percent between 2004 and 2006 and rose further to
7.6 percent on average in 2007 because of stronger domestic demand, higher prices for food and
imported oil, increase in administrative prices, and harmonization of excises with EU levels.
Inflation has continued to rise in early 2008, with year-on-year inflation at 13.2 percent in March
2008, up from 11.6 percent in December 2007.                                     Demand pressures have reflected strong
increases in real wages in the private sector growing at double-digits rates in 2007 following a
longperiod of moderate growth. "he recent acceleration of wage growthwas underpinned by a
tighter labor market with shortages of labor more pronounced in construction, tourism, and
manufacturing. Higher than expected inflation has put on hold plans to join the Exchange Rate
Mechanism I1(ERM                   10inpreparation         for subsequent entry to the Euro zone.

10.         External imbalances are increasing with widening current account deficits and
rising external debt. The external current account deficit is estimated at 21.5 percent of GDP
in 2007 (prelirmnary data), more than triple the level in 2004. Growing foreign savings have
financed a boom in private investment over the last several years following a long period of
underinvestment.                 Despite reasonably strong export growth, imports continued to finance
growinginvestment needs, while imports of consumer goods saw only a modest increase inline

with moderate consumption growth. High oil prices added further to the pressure on the current
account deficit as Bulgaria relies almost exclusively on imported oil and gas. In contrast to the
Baltic countries, strong FDIinflows to Bulgaria have more than fully covered the external current
account deficits, while the reliance on portfolio investment and short-term flows has been
limited. The stock of FDIi s expected to exceed 80 percent of GDP in 2007, one of the highest
shares compared to the other NMS. FDI in manufacturing doubled in absolute terms between
2004 and 2006 and now represents 25 percent of the total FDI stock, supportingrapid growth of
manufacturing output. FDI doubled also in financial intermedation and trade, and surged to 16
percent of total stock in real estate and business services.                  To finance larger stock of domestic
and foreign investments, private sector external indebtedness has grown rapidly and between
2004 and 2006 increased by 32 percentage points of GDP. Inter-company debt to FDI parent
companies accounted for more than half of this increase, with the other half attributable mainly
to corporate borrowingfrom abroad taking advantage of favorable interest differentials. Short-
term corporate borrowing more than doubled during this period, raising concerns for rollover
risk. Banking sector contribution to the rising external debt remained moderate. A substantial
increase in private sector indebtedness led to an increase in the gross external debt to GDP ratio
to 80.7 percent of GDP in 2006 despite substantial reduction in public debt. External public
debt was squeezed to half of i t s 2004 level as a result of several active debt management
operations-retirement     of all Brady bonds, early repayments of all outstanding debt to the IMF
and a portion of debt to the IBRD.

11.     Significant increase in gross official reserves provided a cushion to heightened
external vulnerabilities. Gross official reserves, at 41 percent of GDP in 2007, almost doubled
in absolute terms compared to 2004 and provide coverage of close to 6 months of imports of
goods and services. In addition, indicators of reserve coverage of short term debt and foreign
exchange deposits of population remained relatively stable.                      Despite rapid increase in gross
external debt, its ratio to exports of goods and services increased to only 127 percent in 2006
from 112percent in2004 owingto steadily growingexports.
12.    In 2007, the external current account reached 21.5 percent of projected annual
GDP, an increase of 3.7 percentage points year-on-year, owing mainly to the widening

                                                              11

 trade gap. While exports growth rebounded to double digits levels by the third quarter of 2007,
 the demand for investment goods and raw materials has remained strong supportingmuch faster
 growth of imports. Services balance improved slightly but could not offset the deterioration of
 current transfers and income balances. The former was affected negatively by the payment of
 Bulgaria's contribution to the EU budget while the latter reflects higher dividend and interest
payments to FDI parent companies. N e t FDI flows increased to 21 percent of GDP in 2007
 financing almost fully the current account gap and reflecting improved investors' sentiment and
 expectations of high returns on investment. Nearly 30 percent of the FDIs inflows in 2007 are in
real estate pushing up prices of real estate further.                       In addition, increasing inter-company
borrowingcontributed to the growth in external debt to 97.3 percent of GDP in end-2007. The
 substantial increase in inter-company debt relative to 2006 values reflects the one-off effect of
borrowing for acquisition of a large telecommunication company. Short-term debt of private
 sector continued to grow but remained more than fully covered by international reserves.

 13.       Indicators of external competitiveness of Bulgaria do not point to a significant
loss of external competitiveness6 suggesting that the currency board arrangement could
remain viable untilthe eventual Euro adoption. According to IMF estimates the equilibrium
current account deficit i s around 8 percent of GDP (or about 10 percent including EU capital
grants)',    well below the actual current account level.                   This estimate, however, is subject to
substantial margin of uncertainty in light of the major restructuring that the economy i s going
through. Inaddition, estimates of real exchange rates indicate that the actual real exchange rate
has appreciated largely in line with the estimated equilibrium rate, and inline with experiences in
Bulgaria's peers.          Both the Government and the Bulgarian National Bank are committed to
maintaining the currency board untilthe eventual Euro adoptions.

 14.       Policy responses to the growing external vulnerabilities have been adequate.
Sizable fiscal surpluses have been recorded since 2003 while the Government's incomes
policy has remained generally prudent. The fiscal surplus exceeded 3.5 percent of GDP in
2006 and remained almost unchanged in 2007. Public debt further declined to 20 percent of
GDP in December 2007 compared to 40 percent at end-2004. Sustaining relatively high fiscal
surplus in 2007 was aided by strong revenue over-performance as a result of booming economic
activity and improved tax compliance. Buoyant revenue collection allowed for further cut in
social contribution rates by 3 percentage points and spending the buffer of 10 percent9 but
mostly for capital investments and co-financing of EU-financed projects. Nevertheless, most of
the sizable revenue overperformance was saved and the fiscal surplus exceeded the budget target
for 2007 of 2 percent. Income policy has been geared to ensure that wages in the public sector
rise inline with productivity growth. At the same time, optimization of public administration has
taken place and a further 12percent downsizingi s envisaged in 2008.
15.        Credit to private sector continued to expand to finance increased investment and
strong private consumption.                    Between 2004 and 2006 domestic credit increased by 11
percentage points of GDP inresponse to strong economic growth, increased competition among
banks, and low borrowingcosts for banks, especially foreign-owned. To contain credit growth,
which was fuelling further the expansion of the current account gap, the Bulgarian National Bank
(BNB) introduced administrative credt cehgs. These administrative measures dld slow down
credit growth in some banks but led to the rapid expansion of the non-bank financial sector,

which was initially less subject to strong regulation. In addition, some banks sold a portion of
their loans abroad to comply with the creQt ceilings.          Thus, when the credit c e h g s were
removed as of January 1, 2007, most of the sold credits were transferred back increasing the
credit growth to approximately 59 percent year-on-year by December 2007. Most of the growth
was concentrated in the corporate sector, reflecting reclassification effects of credits transferred
back from foreign banks to their local subsidiaries but also continuing strong investment activity
mainly in trade, manufacturing and construction. Consumer loans growth was less pronounced
which was reflected also in the slowdown of private consumption in2007.

16.     Despite rapid credit growth, banks which are mainly foreign owned remain well
capitalized, liquid, and profitable; banking supervision and regulation is strong and
prudent. Most of the banks inBulgaria are subsidiaries or branches of large foreign banks with
access to capital at comparatively low cost, while deposits of private sector have rapidly increased
reflecting strong economic performance.        In h e with robust economic growth and steady
increase in incomes, the share of non-performing loans remained below 2 percent of total loans
while other prudential indicators do not signal for the time being worsening of banks' balance
sheets. To respond to accelerated credit growth and weather banks from possible slowdown in
economic activity and related worsening of balance sheets of corporations and banks, the BNB
raised the minimum reserve requirements to 12 percent from 8 percent before September 1,
2007. This move, as well as worsening of global credit conditions has forced banks to raise the
cost of lending with no immediate effect on credit growth as yet. Nevertheless, the banking
supervision remains strong, regulation on loan provisioningi s more stringent than in other EU
countries, while supervision of non-bank financial institutions i s improving.


MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOKAND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
17.     The medium term macroeconomic framework centered on the CBA is expected to
maintain macroeconomic stability and high rates of growth in the first years of EU
accession and prepare Bulgaria for monetary integration soon thereafter. The meQum
term outlook envisages a robust growth of 6 percent per annum, a gradual narrowing of the large
external current account deficit, and persistently hgh debt to GDP ratios. Fiscal and income
polices would remain prudent. Growth would be driven by a continuous rise in investment,
strong domestic consumption and improved export performance in line with the increased
competitiveness of Bulgarian goods on international markets.          Consistent with the planned
upgrades in the infrastructure sectors, investment i s likely to grow at a high speed but slow down
to 32 percent of GDP by 2010. Inflation is projected to deche to about 4 percent in2009-2010.
The projections for the inflation decline reflect the following assumptions: (i) adverse effects
                                                                                  the
of bad weather conditions on Bulgaria's agriculture output in2007 would subside and would not
affect negatively food prices, (ii) excise harmonization with EU levels would be more or less
                                  the
completed as most of the excise hikes have been front-loaded already; (iv) moderate wage
growth. External current account deficit is projected to remain hgh reflecting catch-up effects
but would gradually decline from 20 percent in 2007 to 13 percent in 2010 as a result of
moderate FDI inflows. FDI inflows are expected to continue to be the primary source of
balance of payments financing although declining to about 5 percent of GDP by 2010, while
gross external debt is projected to remain at close to 100percent of GDP in the medium term. A
deterioration of the external environment and increased prospects of a European growth
slowdownmay affect adversely the projections showninTable 2.

18.       The current course of fiscal policy is                         basically appropriate to ensure
macroeconomic stability, growth and poverty reduction in the medium term.                               The
Government medium-term budgetary strategy laid out in the Convergence Programme of
Bulgaria10 envisages a continuation of overall fiscal surpluses of 3 percent per year in 2008-2010
to counteract the growing external imbalances and rising demand-side inflationary pressures.
Taking into account the already hgh level of public spending and the need to contain domestic
demand the Government decided to cap the level of public expenditures as a share of GDP at 40
percent (excluding the contribution to the EU budget) and substitute existing expenditures with
EUfunds to the extent possible.
19.       The main fiscal challenge in the medium term will be to improve the efficiency
and efficacy of public spending, especially in health, education and social protection.
Structural reforms in these sectors are expected to ensure that public sector resources are spent
more effectively. To improve the efficiency of public administration and help reduce shortages
of labor in private sector, the Government decided to decrease the number of public sector
employees by 12 percent in 2008. In addition, the Government i s introducing a 10 percent flat

personal income tax in line with the corporate income tax of 10 percent already in effect since
2007.
20.     Heightened medium-term risks of widening external imbalances and worsening
of external environment with a possible negative effect on growth weigh heavily on the
fiscal stance and advancement of productivity-enhancing structural reforms.                   In the
context of the domestic environment there are risks of loss of momentum inthe implementation
of structural reforms and weakening of macroeconomic discipline. Pressures to raise wages in
the public sector are building up while restricting current spending in the context of sizable
surpluses has proven to be a difficult political economy issue. Relaxation of fiscal policy would
further increase domestic demand pressures and their impact on external imbalances and
inflation. Vulnerabilities to external shocks are also increasing in light of the already large
external imbalances and worsening global environment. The economy i s vulnerable to external
shocks, includmg further increases inoil prices and interest rate increases, and greater capital flow
volaality or the falling short of FDI flows from the levels needed to finance the large external
current account deficit. Furthermore, the gradual progress towards monetary integration raises
additional macroeconomic challenges. Greater monetary integration has potential benefits, but it
i s not without risks given the large structural differences between Bulgaria and countries in the
Euro zone. The preparation for, and eventual adoption of, the Euro will increase the need for
deeper economic restructuring, in addition to enhanced macro-financial discipline, to ensure
adherence to the conditions for participation in the currency area. Provided that downside risks
to the baseline scenario materialize, growth would accelerate above its potential, inflation would
further increase, while external current account deficit and external debt would remain at
unsustainable levels.

21.     Policies supported by the DPL series would contribute in the medium term to
sustaining macroeconomic stability and accelerating convergence to EU income levels.
These policies focus on increasing labor force participation and employment especially among
the long term unemployed, improvingproductivity through narrowing the skills gap of the labor
force, and improving the efficiency of public spending in education, health, and social assistance
systems. Improved mobility and skills of labor would provide incentives to firms and employees
to reallocate resources to most productive use, which would support enhanced export
competitiveness and growth. Increased labor force participation would dampen the effects of
labor shortages on wages, while improved efficiency in social sector spending would strengthen
the sustainability of fiscal accounts.  Inthe longterm, improvedquality of education would also
result inhigher productivity levels.

22.     Policies supported by the DPL program are fully consistent with the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), the Government's Convergence Program, and
the National Reform Program. As in the past, the MTEF allocates significant portion of
public resources to the social sectors. For 2008, the planning spending for these sectors i s close
to 53 percent (including pensions) of overall government spending.           The MTEF calls for
spendmg on health as percentage of GDP to remain at between 4 and 4.5 percent of GDP until
2010. Table 3 shows the expected evolution of spending in health and education over the
medium term. Iti s worth notingthat in spite of a relatively constant percentage of GDP devoted
to the social sectors, the strong GDP growth projected inthe macroeconomic framework would
result in significant increases in education and health budgets over the 2007-2009 period. This i s
exemplified inthe planned budget increases for 2008-16      percent in health spending, 22 percent
ineducation, and 13 percent insocialprotectioninspite of almost constant percentageof GDP.
23.     Bulgaria's spending on the social sectors is consistent with its current level of
development, but the increasing needs in light of the objective of convergence to EU

                                                 15

standards has put additional pressure on improving the efficiency of spending. As the
Bulgaria Convergence Program agreed with the EU states, ``The main priority of the government
i s to maintain macroeconomic stability and high rates of economic growth in the medium term.
The most important factors to accelerate economic growth will be the structural reforms, the
improvement of the business climate and the increase inthe efficiency of institutions."

24.      The concerns about efficiency of institutions are pervasive inthe social sectors. A
few examples illustrate these concerns:

25.      Example 1: Inefficiencies in the health sector.                                  Bulgaria shares the problem of
excessive hospital infrastructure with many countries in Europe. Many countries are emphasizing
outpatient care, day surgery procedures, and moving away from hospital care and extended stays
ininpatient facilities. Thishasalsobeenusedas atoolto controlspendingas inpatient caretends
to be more expensive. Bulgaria has reduced the number of beds but evidence suggests that more
could be done. Pilot studies in the Gabrovo, Lovech, Stara Zagora, and Razgrad regions to
evaluate the functioning of hospitals and assess the extent by which there could be excess
capacity inthe sector found that (i)            there i s excess capacity inall the regions analyzed; (ii) some             in
cases there i s excessive utilization of hospitals due to the lack of alternative faclltties that could
address some of the more simple conditions at a lower price; (iii) some hospitals perform social
functions, like taking care of terminal patients, and long term medcal care; (iv) distortions in
hospital practices are frequent, hke dischargmg and re-admitting patients inorder to be paid twice
and code-creeping inorder to match more expensive payment codes."

26.      Example 2: Inefficiencies in the education sector. While Bulgaria i s experiencing a
demographic transition, with the school-age population shrinkmg substantially, a generous
education infrastructure remains since before the transition. As Figure 1shows, student numbers
declined by more than 25 percent in the period 1992 to 2005. Municipalities have been closing
down schools inrecent years inresponse to this decline, but there has not been a systematic plan
to adapt to t h ~ sdemographic transition, leading to declining student-teacher ratios and growing
per student costs. There are a large number of schools that operate with very low student-
teacher ratios, e.g. about 31 percent of municipal schools operate with ratios below 11-both                                     in
rural and urban areas. In addition, (i) stock of non-teachmg personnel reflects recruitment
                                                      the



11 Inthe case of Stara Zagora for example, the pilot study estimated that the number of reported discharges was
about 76 percent higher than the theoretical estimate based on population needs. In addition it estimated that the
theoretical number of discharges could be handledwith 910 beds instead of the current 1,973.

                                                                16

 practices that did not necessarily follow cost-effectiveness considerations -in Bulgaria's schools
 there are currently 43 non-teaching staff for every 100 teachers;12 and (ii)                                    the financing
 mechanism in place until the end of 2006 w h e r e local authorities' freedom to adjust human
 and capital resources i s limited and resource allocation to schools i s determined exclusively at the
 central level-         failed to create incentives for an efficient management of resources.

 27.         Example 3: Inefficiencies in the labor market.                                   Bulgaria i s facing a severe
 demographc decline which risks hampering long-term growth because of reductions in the
workingage population. According to UNpopulation statistics, Bulgaria's population is expected
to shrink by 18 percent (about 1Y2 d o n people) between 2000 and 2025. Bulgaria's expected
share of population over 65 will be 21 percent in 2025, the fourth-highest in the region (up from
 16 percent in2000). Moreover, its working age population i s projected to shrink by 9 percent, or
750,000 people, in the next 15 years (by 2020)13. This creates additional pressures to increase
labor force participation rates. For example, were Bulgaria to achieve the EU 25 average labor
force participation rate, the decline would be limited to just 100,000.14                                   Bulgaria has seen
impressive falls in unemployment and increases in employment relative to the EU15 in recent
years, but its employment and labor force participation rates remain low overall. While its labor
market outcomes among those aged 25-54 i s on par with that of the EU 15 (e.g. a labor force
participation of 82.3 vs. 84.6 percent in 2006), Bulgaria continues to face high unemployment and
low employment as well as labor force participation among younger and older workers as well as
those with low educational attainment. As for younger workers, the share of the 15-24 year old
Bulgarians who are in part time employment i s the lowest in the EU. Moreover, the share of



l2The data quoted here on "non-teaching                      staff' are data from the Annual Census of School from the National
Statistical Institute. However, school visits across the country suggest that these numbers do not always include all
the non-teaching staff which i s associated with the schools. Often, school principals who fill out the surveys have
excluded security staff or cafeteria personnel if these staff members are paid by the municipality and/or outsourced
to a private firm. In some instances, schools visited by the World Bank team in the outskirts of Sofia had 4 security
guards, guarding tiny school buildings on a 24-hour basis. In one instance, in the Village of Marchevo the
expenditure on the security guards exceeded the expenditures on teachers' wages.

institutions to utilize existing resources more efficiently, reinvesting the savings in the
same sectors. The next section explains the Government strategy in each sector, medium term

 29.       The policies implemented by the coalitiongovernment that took office inlate 2005
were initially dominated by the objective of securing a timely and orderly accession to the
 European Union. Post-accession policies on the other hand are organized around the
 overarching goal of converging in both outcomes and standards with the rest of the
Union. The Government is also interested indesigning policies that can make use of European
 structural funds.         The policies under implementation are summarized in various strategic
documents produced in line with EU requirements (summarized in Box l), well as sector                      as
 strategies -in health, education, and labor and social protection-                        prepared to reach consensus
inpolicies among the coalition members.

Box 1: Recent Strategic and Investment Planning Documents

 1.        The National Reform Program (2007-2009) (NRP) is a major strategic document of the government of Bulgaria. Its
objective is to systematizethe efforts of state administration,the non-governmentalsector, and the social partnersto implementreforms
to achieve sustainable economic growth and increase the employmentin the country. It was developed based on the EuropeanCouncil
guidelines for Growth andJobs aimed at achievingthe objectivesof the re-launchedLisbonstrategy.
2.         The Convergence Program of the Republic of Bulgaria (2006-2009) is elaborated in compliancewith the requirementsof
the Stability and Growth Pact of the EU. Its elaboration is related to the fulfdment of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
membershipcriteria, and its main goal is the achievement of convergence of the economic indicators of the country to those of the most
advanced Member States. The Convergence Program is updated annually. It contains information concerning the previous and the
current year, as well as forecasts for at least the following three years. When and if the EURO is adopted by the member state, the
ConvergenceProgrambecomes a StabilityProgram. It briefly describes the government's reformplans in the social sectors
3.         The Bulgarian National Development Plan (2007-2013) (NDP) is a national strategic document presentingthe long-term
public investment program of the country, consistingof investmentsin both physicaland human capital. The role of the NDP is to
structure and present the strategic choices made by the nationalinvestment policyin order to ensure adequate coordination, justification
and provisionof financingof the interventions,co-financedby the EUresources.
4.         The National Strategic Reference Framework (2007-2013) (NSRF) is the strategic document for the absorption of the
EU Structural funds that was formally adopted by the European Commission inJune 2007. It is elaborated on the basis of the NDP
2007-2013 and consists of the strategic platformfor justificationand coordinationof the EUStructuralfunds' financialassistance.
5.         The Operational Programs 2007-2013 (OPs) express in concrete form the NSRF strategy in their relevantthematic areas at
operationallevel.

The following national strategic documents are not required by the EU:

1.         The Pact on Economic and Social Development (2007-2009) is a tripartiteagreement reachedin September 2006 between
the Government of Bulgaria, the two major trade union confederations,and six nationally representativeemployer organizations. It
provides a framework for economic and social development that is independentof the politicalcycle and the particular government in
office. The document identifies the main challenges for Bulgaria's social and economic development, while outltning the country's
future policy andprioritiesuntil 2009. The pact covers measuresin the followingkey policy areas:

*     improvementof economic competitiveness;
      implementationof fiscal policy conduciveto economicgrowth, includingamendments to tax and social securitylegislation;
*     active labor marketpoliciesand developmentof humanresources,including:
                -
                -    creatingat least240,000 new jobs, thereby reducingthe unemploymentrate to less than 9%
                     preparinga national strategy on lifelongleariliiigand increasingthe proportion of people involvedin such learning

                -    to 7%8%     of the economicallyactivepopulation

.                    modernizingthe educationsystem;
      modernization and streamlining of public administration, including further development of e-government, public-private

.    partnerships,decreasingregulatory regimes;
     increaseof incomes and living standards of citizens based on a policyagreedby the tripartitegroup, correspondingto the country's
     economic potentialand aimed at reachingEU25 levels. This would be combined with the promotion of a sustainable policy on
     social security and socialinclusionto increasethe qualityof life and reducepovertylevels; and
2.         The National Employment Strategy (2004-2010) was adopted by the Bulgarian government in November 2003. The
strategy was drawn up by a working group of representatives of the government and social partners,and seeks to dealwith labor market
problems such as low employment, high unemployment and negative demographic trends.The strategy is regarded as consistent with
the EU's European employment strategy (EES). An update of this strategy, following EU accessionand the adoption of other related
strategies andinvestmentplans, was also adoptedfor the period2008 - 2015.




                                                                 19

 30.     The main objectives and policies in the health sector as highlighted in the Government's
 strategy are:
 (a)     Delivering high-quality       and guaranteed healthcare       services,by improving the
         accreditation system for healthcare establishments and increasing access to healthcare
         services through the reduction of financial and geographc inequities;
 @)      Emphasizing the role of primary outpatient care, by refining the payment mechanisms
         and clearly defining the division of the responsibilities between the primary and the
         outpatient specializedmedical services;

 (c)     Optimizing the network of the health care providers, by improving the links between
         outpatient and inpatient care, devising a masterplan and implementation strategy for
         achieving a more efficient hospital network; strengthening hospital management, and
         revising the prospect payment system for hospitals;
 (d)     Implementing a transparent and fair pharmaceutical policy, by increasing the awareness
         of patients, controlling prices and rationalizing the drug prescription practices and drug
         therapies used by healthcare professionals;

 (e)     Securing the financial stabihty and sustainability of the system in the long-term, by
         promotingthe rational use of pharmaceutical products, creating an efficient and effective
         drug reimbursement policy, refining the models of primary and specialized outpatient
         healthcare and the restructuring of inpatient care, improving compliance for health
         insurance contributions, improving the negotiation process for the National Framework
         Contract, increasing the monitoring and enforcement capacity of the NHIF, improving
         the prospective payment system,           developing a voluntary health insurance, and

DPL support is focused on (c), (d), and (e).
31.      The Government's strategy in primary and secondary education approved by
Parliament in June 2006 states that the main challenges in primary and secondary
education systems are the decrease in the quality and relevance of skills taught and a
decline in participation rates, particularly in upper secondary.15               Together with an
ineffective use of existing resources these problems will affect adversely the competitiveness of
Bulgarian school children in the EU labor market. In order to reverse these negative trends, the
Government appreciates that it needs to increase access to education for all children and
strengthen the quality of the education process. To achieve these two goals, the program has
identified six broad objectives:

(a)      Orienting school education towards the stimulation of thinking and independence,
         towards the formation of practical skills and towards personality building;
@)       Establishing an efficient internal assessment system through the wide-scale use of tests
         and introduction of a system for national standardzed external assessment;

(c)      Decreasing the number of drop-outs and increase enrollment rates for chddren in the
         compulsory schooling age;
(d)      Strengthen the authority and improvingthe social status of the teacher;
(e)      Decentralizing the school network through the gradual introduction of delegated budgets
         for all schools and providingmore flexibility to municipalities to appoint school directors;

32.      As laid out inthe National Employment Strategy 2004-2010                     -i   s now extended to
2015-      the Government is going to implement measures to increase labor force
participation, improve skills, and remove barriers to inter-sectoral mobility in labor
legislation. The recent National Reform Program 2007-2009 also reflects those challenges
prominently.lb In a context of rapidly decreasing unemployment -in 4 3 of 2007 regstered
unemployment fell to 6.6 percent-             the strategy of the Government centers in increasing the
employment and labor force participation rates and reducing distortions to labor mobility. The
reforms through which the government wants to address the activation and skdls agenda are:
          Implementation of policies to improve the quality of human capital over the medium
          term, including the reduction in the number of school drop-outs, integration of early
          school leavers into the educational system, the development of a modern system for
          standardized external evaluation in secondary education, the reform of the system of
         vocational education and training in compliance with labor market needs, the
          development of lifelong learning and the improvement in the quality and efficiency of
         hgher education;
         Implementation of policies to activate labor supply in the short term, in particular for
         those hardest to activate in light of the rapidly falling unemployment, through
         consolidating and better targeting the National Program "From Social Assistance to
         Employment", increasing the role of the private sector inthe provisionof ALMPs and in
         cost sharing, as well as increasing the provisionof long-term sustainable jobs inthe social
         services sector. The NRP also highlights the need to improve the employment
         opportunities for specific categories &e youth, older workers, female workers, persons
         with permanent disabilities and Roma.
         Implementation of policies to reduce the cost of labor, the transaction costs associated
         with hiringworkers and additional barriers to labor mobility.
DPL supportis focused on @) and (c).
33.      In June of 2007 the European Commission proposed the establishment of the
common principle of "flexicurity" in the EU, combining flexibility and security
principles. EC and Member States have agreed on the following components of flexicurity
policies: "(i)  Flexible and reliable contractual arrangements (from the perspective of the employer and
the employee, of ``insiders" and "outsiders") through modern labor laws, collective agreements
and work organization; (ii)        Comprehensive h9long learning (Ti!&)   strategies to ensure the continuous
adaptability and employability of workers, particularly the most vulnerable; (iii)Efective active labor
marketpolicies ( U P ) that help people cope with rapid change, reduce unemployment spells and
ease transitions to new jobs; (iv) Modern soaalsecubg ystems that provide adequate income support,
encourage employment and fachtate labor market mobility. This includes broad coverage of
social protection provisions (unemployment benefits, pensions and healthcare) that help people
combine work with private and family responsibilities such as childcare". 17

           IV.     BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

LINKTO CPS

34.    The DPL series i s consistent with the three priority areas laid out in the CPS:

a. Raising productivity and employment in support of private sector-led growth along
   the lines of the EU'sLisbonAgenda. The DPL series would support the productivity and
   employment agenda by focusing on: (i)        the reform of the labor framework and social
   protection system to increase employment by lowering payroll taxes, reducing social
   assistance dependency, and increasing formal employment through more flexible work
   arrangements and better incentives to participate in the formal economy; (ii)the reforms in
   the education sector to strengthen the institutional capacity to monitor and improve quality
   and increase accountability, laying the foundation for long-term productivity growth; and (ii)
   improving the investment climate through better quality of regulations governing firms as a
   way to increase productivity of labor.
b. Fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds. The DPL
   series would focus on improvingthe efficiency of the health, education, and social protection
   systems to support their financial sustainability and effectiveness. Inhealth, the focus will be
   on improving financial sustainabibty of the NHIF, restructuring of the hospital sector, and
   improved efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector.        In education, the DPLs will support
   finance and governance reforms that would help improve both the quality of education, and
   the efficient utilization of resources available for education.        In social protection, the
   restructuring of active labor market policies would help increase the employment prospects
   of long term unemployed.         The reforms in these sectors will also open windows of
   opportunity to ualize EU funds as new programs are being created or old programs
   reformed.

c. Poverty reduction and social inclusion. Even though social inclusion and poverty
   reduction are not explicit themes of the DPL, the policies supported by the program are well
   placed to have a positive impact on the poor. For example the policy measures targeting the
   labor market inclusion of people with disabilities are expected to have a distinct positive
   impact on incomes. The same applies to the increased focus on active labor market policies
   and emphasis on capturing the long term unemployed and other vulnerable groups, w h c h
   should help address skill gaps and enhance employment prospects for individuals in low
   quality subsidized jobs. The actions supported in the health sector are expected to increase
   access to basic care, as the reimbursement policies for basic drugs that are now preventing
   some groups from obtaining them at affordable prices will be thoroughly revised. The
   restructuring of hospital networks envisioned for the medium term shouldredraft the current
   mapping of health care facilities and promote access by (i)  shifting the focus from inpatient to
   outpatient care, and (ii) the resources saved from the hospital restructuring to improve
                            using
   quality in lagging areas. The DPL i s also increasing awareness of the Bulgarian Government
   about the impact of policies on vulnerable groups. It i s a success of the policy dialogue under
   the DPL program to have supported a "mitigating fund" so that municipalities consolidating
   schools could provide additional services to at-risk groups, something that the Government
   had not originally planned. The same applies to the evaluation of the impact of changes in
   social welfare policies, which i s included in the policy matrix.          The DPL would be
   complemented by the Social Inclusion Project (FY08) to address the needs of the most
   vulnerable groups.

 There is general agreement that governanceand transparencyhave improvedinBulgariaduringthe last few years. According to the CPS, "There
 has been a positive trend as far as administrativecorruptionis concerned, although recent surveys show a slight deteriorationbetween 2004-05."
 Transparency International's 2007 corruption perception index ranks Bulgariain 64* place among 179 countries, ahead of other EU member
 states like Romania. T h e EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise PerformanceSurvey (BEEPS) shows a decline in corruption
 as a problem of doing business in Bulgaria from 2002-05. As main areas for unofficialpayments by f m s , BEEPS shows obtaininggovernment
 contracts,obtainingbusiness licenses andpermits, dealingwith customs,and dealingwith the courts.

 Bulgariajoined the EuropeanUnion on 1January 2007. To address a number of areas where further work will be necessary, the EuropeanUnion
 adopted a package of accompanyingmeasures, includinga special mechanism to help Bulgaria to continue the reforms of the ludiciary and the
 fight against corruption. A progress report preparedinJune 2007 stated that "The BulgarianGovernment is committed to judicial reform and
 cleansing the system of corruption and organizedcrime. In all areas, the Bulgarian authorities demonstrategood will and determination.They
 have prepared the necessary draft laws, action plans and programs." Bulgaria has stepped up efforts at the highest levels in the fight against
 corruptionand organized crime. While recognizingthese efforts, much remains to be done.Progress in the short time since the Cooperation and
 Verification Mechanism was set up is still insufficient. Progress has been made in all six benchmarks in this area (Independence and
 accountability of the judicial system, Reform of the judicial system, Reformand transparency of the judiciary, Fight high-levelcorruption, Fight
 corruption within local government, and Fight organized crime) but the Commission has assessed the progress in benchmarks 2 and 6 as
 insufficient (thelatest report, availableat the beginningof February,will containupdatedinformation on achievingthe benchmarks).

 Even though the DPL program does not address governanceand corruptionexplicitly, many of the policy actions agreed with the Government
 will improve governanceand increase transparency in the social sectors. Specifically (i) the unification of payments to hospitals will increase the
 transparency in financing of health care as it will prevent hospitals from double billing for a given procedure; (i) changes in pharmaceutical
                                                                                                                     the
 procurement and reimbursement policies will increase the transparency in the decision makmg process for approval of new drugs as well as
 pricing and reimbursementpolicies; it will also promote a better use of resources by the NHIF; (ii)the introduction of changes in the financing
 of school with a unified standard will improve governance in the educationsector as it will become clear how much each school should receive
 according to the number of students it has; (iv) finally the introductionof testing and quality assessmentinstruments should reduce the practice
 of private tutoringby public school teachers and improve transparency in admission to universities(an outcome at the end of the programrather




 COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
 35.         The IMF has completed the fourth and final review of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
 in March 2007, and an Article IV consultation in October 2007. A precautionary 25-months
 SBA with access of SDRlOO d o n was approved by the IMF Board on August 6, 2004. The
 SBA-supported program sought to reduce Bulgaria's increased external vulnerability and to
 achieve sustainable high growth through: (i)                                  continued tight fiscal policy and measures to reduce
 bank liquidity in order to reduce excess demand in the short run; and (ii)                                         structural reforms to
 boost output and export capacity and export capacity in the medmm-term. While recognizing
 the mitigating factors, includmg the prudent fiscal and income policies in support of the currency
 board, Article IV discussions focused on mountingexternalvulnerabilities as a result of Bulgaria's
 catching-up process associated with large capital inflows and current account deficits. Since
 Bulgaria joined the EU, its participation in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP),I8 with
 related multilateral surveillance, i s expected to help sustain Bulgaria's prudent macroeconomic
 policies.

 36.         Inaddition to the IMF, the World BankDPL team has been coordinating closely
 with the European Commission on Bulgaria's the macro situation and the reform agendas in
 education, health and social protection and labor, through DG Economic and Financial Affairs
 (DG ECFIN) and DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (DG EMPL).The
 DPL program is fully consistent with Bulgaria's commitments to the European Commission in

   The main objective of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is to enforce disciphe in the Euro-zone as a means to
 support price stabihty and sustainable growth. Budgetary dscipline is gauged with respect to two criteria: a general
 government deficit-to-GDP ratio below three percent, and a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent. Functioning of
 the SGP rests o n two pillars: multilateral surveillance and corrective mechanisms. As regards surveillance, EU
 member states are required to prepare a Convergence Program and update it annually. The European Commission
 (EC) prepares an assessment of such convergence programs o n the basis o f w h c h the Council of the EU issues an
 opinion. As regards corrective mechanisms, the Excessive Deficit Procedure identifies and forces corrections of
 excessive deficits, defrned under non-exceptional circumstances as a deficit over three percent of GDP.

                                                                                23

the framework of the National Reform Program, the National Strategic Reference Program and
related Operational Programs and other strategic documents (see Annex 6). With Bulgaria having
joined the EU, the Bank-EC relationship related to Bulgaria has evolved over the lifetime of the
DPL program from a formal cooperation of donors to an informal dialogue about structural
policy reforms and information-sharing.


RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

37.     The DPL series i s complementary to existing and planned operations inthe social sectors,
and i s intended to become the pillar around which future investments and policy dalogue in
these sectors will be structured. The current health sector reform project includes a component
on hospital restructuring in selected municipalities and technical assistance to develop the
hospital master-plan.     In addition one of its main activities is the strengthening of the
management and administrative capacity of the NHIF, an essential condition to improve
financial sustainability and efficiency inhealth care provision.
38.     The proposed social inclusion project (9'08) will help to address the needs of Bulgaria's
most vulnerable groups (national minorities-in         particular Roma-people      with disabilities,
chlldren in institutionalized care and others), in support of meeting the goals of the JIM signed
with the EU. This operation will complement the DPL series in its objective to improve
targeting of social welfare programs to reduce distortions in the labor market, develop and
agenda to improve the delivery of social welfare services and promote access to quality education.
An Institutional Development Fund Grant i s supporting the capacity buildmgin the Ministry of
Education and Science through the strengthening of CKOKO, the planned Institute of Directors
and the MES department in charge of developing programs aimed at absorbing European Social
Funds.The proposed regional development project (FY09) would address regonalimbalances by
strengthening capacity to manage the programming and strategic allocation of EU structural
funds, integrate them into public expenditure management and the intergovernmental fiscal
system, and capacity building at regional and local levels for project preparation and absorption
of EU funds. Itis expected that the increased capacity of Bulgaria to absorb structural funds will
feed into some of the policies supported by the DPL series, like the hospital restructuring.


LESSONSLEARNED

39.     The preparation and implementation of the PAL series and the DPL Ihave provided
some useful lessons that have been taken into account inthe preparation of DPL 11. Namely:
    Focusing on fewer actions: The PAL ICR (April 20, 2006) discusses the large number of
    benchmarks and triggers throughout the series. Even though that PAL program was highly
    successful, a more streamlined approach focusing on fewer actions facilitates coordination
   within the Government, and focus the attention of authorities on fewer issues.
    Maintain a flexible approach to adjust to changing environment and demands. The DPL
   program defines triggers in broad terms in order to accommodate changes in government's
   requests for assistance in specific areas or to allow for time to define specific actions. For
    example the triggers in education call for introduction of per capita financing or delegated
   budgets but the specific details of the policies have been fine-tuned during preparation,
   through technical assistance.
   Accompany reform program with technical assistance.           This has proven essential to the
   success of the program, as it has been used to both define details of policy changes and also
   to strengthen the capabilities of counterparts to implement policy reforms.


                                                 24

-   Sustainable reform takes time. The programmatic approach has also been extremely useful as
    the reforms in many areas have built upon changes in previous years.        For example the
    change inpharmaceutical policy consisted of approving an overall framework during the first
    year and defrning details during the second year through by-laws. The third year it will be
    consolidated throughimplementation of the policy changes and evaluation of its impact.



ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

40.      The operation i s well integrated with the World Bank's analytic and advisory work. As
part of the preparation activities for the DPL Ithe Bank team produced (in December 2005)
policy notes in health, education, and social protection providing a comprehensive overview of
the three sectors, hghlighting the main problems, and identifying key areas where Bank
intervention would be needed.       In addition the DPL team prepared brief technical notes on
hospital restructuring, the pharmaceutical sector, education financing, assessment of quality of
education, labor market and unemployment, Qsability cost containment, social assistance and
social services delivery. More recently the Bank completed two short reports on health sector
policies, one regarding the National Framework Contract and another assessing the Clrnical Care
Pathways mechanism to set prices of hospital services.

41.      In the education sector, and as part of the preparation of the DPL I,the World Bank
education team has worked closely with the MES and MOF in compiling a school level
expenditure data base, and investigating the drivers of costs in education. The ongoing dialogue
on poverty and living standards through the poverty assessment programmatic work is provide
information to set some baseline indicators and measuring the impact of various reforms
supported by the DPL program.         The programmatic work on poverty includes a household
survey with education and health modules.        The Bank team and the MLSP have agreed to
conduct some joint work on various issues related to labor market policies and social assistance
usingthe data gathered for the Multi-Topic Household Survey.
42.      The DPL I1 i s complemented by a PHRD grant supporting a number of pieces of
analytical work to inform the DPL-supported reform agenda. Table 4 summarizes the main
activities financed by the PHRD.

consistent with the DPL supported policies.lg The starting challenge i s an expected decrease
inBulgaria's populationby 18percent between 2000 and 2025. Some specific recommendations
consistent with the DPL program are: (i)                       improvinglabor force participation rates; (ii)                continue
investment in education to increase productivity of labor; (iii)                          enhance labor mobilitythrough

DPL program maintains its focus on the social sectors, and emphasizes actions to contribute to
improvingproductivity and skds of the labor force as well as complementing the main areas of
intervention of other multilateral agencies20 As in the first phase of the DPL series, the second
DPL is assisting the government in transforming the education and labor strategies, and the
policies contained in the NRP and CP strategic documents into concrete action plans with
measurable indicators of progress. The DPL program performs many functions: (i)                    it anchors
 the Bank's work in the social sectors, which includes various investment operations, AAA
 activities, and technical assistance; (ii) provides a framework for implementation of the
                                                it
government's strategies and for targeting the work of other donors; (iii)           it commits the hghest
levels of Government, and particularly the Ministry of Finance, to work together with the social
 sector ministries, an issue that cannot be underestimated when important reforms-like                     the
consolidation of the financing reform in education that began in 2006/2007--are               contemplated;
and (iv) it provides a timeframe for reforms and outside monitoring to measure success and
determine corrective actions. The design of the DPL program has also helped to shape some of
the reforms under implementation. For example the Bank provided significant input into the
design of health and education policies highlighted in the Convergence Program.

46.        The flexibility of a programmatic approach is proving useful during preparation of
DPL11. As post-accession creates additional demands on the Government andits programs itis
evident that a programmatic, flexible approach i s the right instrument to support policy changes
inBulgaria. The increasingpressure fromtrade unions and the realization that catching up to EU
standards will require a multi-prong approach with emphasis on productivity growth -wMe
providing special consideration to vulnerable groups-             are but two examples of the need to
maintain a flexible approach to make changes in the policy matrix as new needs materialize or
previously agreed policies become unnecessary. Experience in new member states has shown
that rapid changes inthe Bank's work program were required in order to maintain relevance and
add value to government's plans. The flexibility has been incorporated in the design of the
program in the form of: (i)       very few actions in the policy matrix, all of them triggers; (ii)broad
defintion of triggers in phase three in order to accommodate to changes in the client's demands
duringthe first years of EUmembership.
47.        Inlight of Bulgaria's strong fiscal position the Government has decided to opt for
a deferred drawdown option (DDO) for the second phase Loan of the program. Taking
account of the recent enhancements for the deferred drawdown option for DPLs, the
Government has decided to add the DDO feature to the second phase Loan. As Bulgaria i s
experiencing a sizeable fiscal surplus, there are no immediate liquidty needs; therefore, the
flexibility of the DDO provides access to funds within the next three years as needed, subject to
continued satisfactory implementation of the program and macro framework. The Government
remains fully committed to advance the policy reform in education, health, and social affairs,
including the reform actions included in DPL 111, as envisaged in the CPS. Annex 9 provides a
more detailed explanation of the choice of instrument.


POLICYAREAS

48.       The DPL series continues to support some of the overarching objectives stated in
the CPS. These are: (i) employment and lay the foundations for long-term productivity
                              Increase
growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of education and; (ii)

Promote fiscal sustainab5ty through efficiency gains in social sectors. All prior actions have
been completed, and a full detail i s provided inAnnex 1. The prior actions for DPL I1are:

1. Government Maintains a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework
2. The Government has removed the automatic portability of the seniority bonus,
      transforming it into a bonus for relevant professional experience
3. T h e M L S P has restructured active labor market programs as per the Employment
     Action Plans 2007 and 2008 to strengthen on the job qualification and professional
      training programs and service delivery linked to private sector skill needs
4. T h e Government has prepared an ex ante assessment of the impact of measures to
      strengthen work incentives in the social assistance system, and based on its
      conclusions has developed an employment activation program including individual
      action plans for social assistance beneficiaries
5. Bulgaria has taken part in international assessment tests, like PISA 2006, PIRLS 2006,
      and TIMSS 2007. In addition, M E S has administered sample testing of Matura in
      Bulgarian language and Literature, M a t h and Foreign languages, a new national
     placement test for 7thgraders and a new census-based test of qthgraders
6. T h e Ministry of Education and Science (MES) has trained at least 50 percent of
     school directors throughthe Institute of School Directors
7. T h e role of the NHIF as a primary payer o f hospitals is maintained and payment
     system has been improved to promote an efficient use of resources and financial
     sustainability of the national health insurance system
8. T h e Government has taken the first steps towards implementation o f the
     masterplanning exercise by endorsing: (i)                the guidelines and recommendations on
     health service planning; and (ii)           framework for prioritizing investment needs. It is
     also using accreditation of facilities as a tool for rationalizing services
9. T h e Government further adopts and implements measures that would improve
     pharmaceutical approval, pricing, and reimbursement policies to increase the
     efficiency of public spending on pharmaceuticals and access to essential drugs (e.g.
     Unify drug lists into one single list based on INN name and ATC/DDD
     classification)
10. The Government has maintained the unified standard and per student financing, and
     introduced delegated school budgets as a national policy
11. Government has maintained the package of measures and incentives to support the
     implementation of the unified standard and school consolidation

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS21

49.       Following Operational Policy (OP 8.60) for Development Policy Lending the team
assessed whether specific country policies supported by the DPL I1were likely to have significant

poverty and social consequences. It concluded that the policies do not result in direct negative
poverty or other social consequences, while many of the policies could actually contribute to
improving the situation of vulnerable groups. A detailed PSIA can be found in Annex 5. In
 summary:

    The new pharmaceutical policies, to be effective starting in April 2008, would reduce the
    price of existing drugs and allow for the state to increase the cost-benefit of its spending,
    contributing to increasing access to basic drugs.            These actions would need to be
    supplemented with measures aimed at changing the behavior of the patients @.e. trusting
    generics) and of prescribing physicians (i.e. being motivated to follow the best prescribing
    guidelines) in order to have the most positive impact on access.
    The main poverty and social impact risk in the Government's education reform program i s
    that drop outs of disadvantaged students could increase as a result of school closures.
    Historical data suggests that municipalities with a higher rate of school closures have not
    experienced a large increase indropouts. Inaddition the Government has put inplace a
    series of policies to prevent an increase indropouts inmunicipalities where school closings
    are taking place (described inAnnex 5).

    The main poverty and social impact risk in the Government's social protection reform
    program stems from the tightening of eligibility for Guaranteed MinimumIncome (GMI),
    with a cancellation of eligibility for able bodied working age indmiduals after 18 months of
    benefit receipt, associated with ineligibility for the following 12 months. The DPL program
    is not supporting the policy change, but an assessment of i t s impact, as a prior action in
    DPL2. A preliminary analysis of this policy suggests that (i) majority of GMI
                                                                     the
    beneficiaries are poor and highly vulnerable, (ii) loss of the GMIbenefit i s substantially
                                                        the
    deepening the already deep poverty among beneficiaries, but adds relatively little to the
    poverty headcount; (iii)  the activation measures, if effective, could get indmiduals out of
    poverty by raising their chances inthe labor market and thus increasing their potential
    earnings in excess of the benefit; and (iv) the EA needs to focus on developing effective
    activation mechanisms with close monitoringof beneficiaries and enhanced cooperation with
    the social assistance offices and community based organizations and specialized service
    providers. Such activation policies are supported by the DPL program.


IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

50.      The responsibility for implementation of the Program lies with the Council for Economic
Policy (CEP) under the Council of Ministers, chaired by the Minister of Economy. The CEP
undertakes the overall management and coordination of the Government program and assures
representation of all the Sectoral Ministries involved in the reform (i.e. Health, Education, and
Labor and Social Policy) and the involvement of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Economy in the discussion of the reform program. The program's coordmation i s officially
managed by the Directorate for Coordination of EU Affairs and International Financial
Institutions (IFIs) of the Council of Ministers, w h c h also manages the PHRD grant supporting
preparation of DPL 11. A report monitorine the status of the actions included in the Policy
Matrix, indicating progress achieved and highlighting any particular dtfficulties in their
implementation, i s regularly (i.e. usually every 2-3 months) prepared and reviewed jointly by the
Bank and the Government.

51.     As the Government has chosen to add a Deferred Draw-down Option (DDO) to DPL
11, additional monitoring requirements have been discussed. Specifically, the Bank will monitor


                                                   30

the Government's macroeconomic and overall policy framework during the next three years, to
ensure that they remain adequate until such time as the Government exercises the option to
withdraw the available funds. The continuous monitoring will be conducted in the form of
frequent supervision missions. If during supervision it i s found that the macroeconomic policy
framework i s no longer sustainable or the reform program i s not being implemented in a manner
consistent with the program, the Bank will inform the government in writing and agree on the
remedial measures to be undertaken to continue maktng the DPL available.
52.      The outcome indicators for monitorinp of the outcomes of the Dropram rely mainly @ut
not exclusively) on administrative data that are already being collected by the information systems
of the respective Government agencies. Inorder to prevent false attribution of outcomes to the
policies included in the DPL, the Program Document explains where needed that some
complementary actions and an enabling environment have to accompany the DPL supported
policies in order for certain outcomes to be achieved. In addition, some outcomes will only be
achieved after the implementation of the DPL program, due to their long term nature. However,
the contribution of the DPL to achieving such outcomes i s notedwhere appropriate.
53.      With regards to evaluation of mecific   D O ~ ~ Cinterventions, the
                                                           V                DPL program emphasizes
the need for evidence based policy making, and has succeeded in developing a cross-cutting
agenda in this area with the Government. It i s supportingthe Government's efforts to invest in
information gathering and developing monitoring and evaluation capabilities. To this end the
program is: (i) supportingthe ex ante assessment, and subsequent impact evaluation, of changes
inone of the main socialassistance programs; (ii)     promotingthe collection and the critical use of
information on education quality through student assessments, and (iii)      buddmg the capacity to
evaluate the impact of policy changes and implement household surveys through accompanying
technical assistance associated with the DPL. The Bank has organized three workshops, shared
international experience in the area of impact evaluation, and i s preparing a menu of options to
move this agenda further. There are many actions inthe policy matrix that would benefit from a
careful evaluation.  The institutional and implementation context of the proposed reforms in
education governance and financing does not allow for a rigorous impact evaluation, because
there i s no comparison group, as i s usually the case with reforms implemented at the macro level.
However, it i s possible to monitor the development of the desired outcomes before, during and
after the reform. This requires the collection of a baseline of the indicators in the policy matrix,
an agreement on their target level and the mechanisms for data collection together with the MES
units responsible for their collection. A steering group with the MES, MOF, the NMA and
experts has been set up to monitor the development of the financing reform and school
consolidation. The Bank has encouraged t h i s development and pointed out that in addition, it
would be desirable to combine the routine financial reporting of municipalities to the central
Ministries with the feeding back of results indicators such as number of students transported to
                                                                  '
consolidated schools'.

54.      The Bank team agreed with MoLSP, OS1and a representative of N S I to conduct jointly
with OS1 an independent multi-topic household survey. The survey is representative for
consumption, incomes and non-monetary aspects of poverty at national and regional (28) level
and wlll include boosters to allow assessing the income, educational, health and labor market
status of the Roma and Turkish ethnic minority groups and comparing them with the country
averages. The multi-topic household survey i s part of the programmatic work on poverty and
living standards currently being conducted by the Bank, and the data became available in
December 2007. The survey i s already providing baselines for many social indicators and basic
data to assess the impact of some of the reforms supported under the DPL program. Finally, the
DPL program incorporates as a trigger the implementation of an ex-ante assessment and impact
evaluation of the reform of one of the main social assistance programs.

                                                  31

 55.     The participation of stakeholders in the program design has been assured through the
 support of the Government's strategies. The health and education actions in the policy matrix
 are based on the strategies prepared by the MOH and MES respectively. The preparation of the
 strategies was done ina hghly participatory manner. InadQtion the DPL program was discussed
 with the main stakeholders: the line Ministries, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy;
 members of Parliament and Parliamentary commissions for health and education; associations of
 employers, teacher unions, general trade unions, and Bulgarian Medical Association and
 Bulgarian Nurses Association; health consumer groups and NGOs. In both education and
 health, field visits were organized during preparation and main components of the program
 benefited from discussions in the field. Finally, the education reform was also discussed with the
 National Association of Municipalities which has endorsed it publicly.


 FIDUCIARYASPECTS
 PublicFinancial Management
 56.     The Bank has extensive knowledge of the country's Public Financial Management (PFM)
 system. A Country Financial Management Assessment (CFAA) was prepared in 2003. The CFAA
 highlighted strong features of or sigmficant achievements in Public Finance Management (PFM),
including: (i)well developed PFM system relying heavily on IT, (ii) legslation and well
                 a                                                          sound
 functioning external oversight institutions (namely the National Audit Office and the Parliament);
 (iii)comprehensive budget process covering also a number of previous extra-budgetary funds,
 (iv) well-developed Treasury Single Account (TSA) to service all budgetary institutions; (v)
adequate realism of budget estimates, (vi) closely monitored cash management system, (vii) and
an adequate internal control framework.

57.      While the overall financial management risk to Bank funds was deemed low, the CFAA
made recommendations that the Government implemented, including under PAL2 and PAL-3,
and with continued technical assistance from other development partners.22 An update of recent
reform activities and their impact has been carried out in the first half of 2007 as part of the
continuous dialogue with Bulgaria. Progress and challenges since the 2003 CFAA are detailed
below:

58.      Steady progress has been made in the development of systems and institutions of public
financial management. The Government has made considerable progress in the development of
the medium-term budget framework and program budgeting has been progressively rolled out in
line ministries. Budgetary control has improved and all major budget institutions and agencies are
now incorporated within the treasury system. After an overly ambitious plan to implement an
advanced integrated financial management information system (FMIS) across Government
progress on the development of a web based system i s now progressing well and FMIS works in
the whole system of the Ministry of Finance and those line ministries, which have relation to the
accounting information, related to the management of EU financial instrumentsThe elements of
a modern public sector audit function (both internal and external audit) have continued to
develop in accordance with best EU and international practice and coordination between
inspection and audit agencies has improved. As a result of these efforts, the quality of financial
control and oversight inthe country has improved substantially.
59.      Some public financial management challenges remain. Program budgeting still has to be
rolled out across all first line spendmg units (excluding at thls stage the municipalities). When thls
work is completed and fully embedded inthe budgeting system the fullimpact on policy planning

                                                   32

and prioritization across Government will be acheved. The Government also needs to budd a
more comprehensive picture of fiscal risks into budget documents. Finally, while the main
buildingblocks of an internalcontrol and internal audit function are inplace considerable work is
needed to ensure managers understand the basic concepts and a sufficient number of certified
internal auditors are in place to implement these reforms.    Additional details on the fiduciary
aspects associated with DPL I1are presented inAnnex 7.


DisbursementandAuditing
60.      The proposed SIR DPL I1 amounts to US$l50 million (equivalent in Euro). The
borrower i s the GOB, represented by the MOF. The proposed DPL I1i s the second of the three
planned development policy loans totaling up to US$450million equivalent as provided for inthe
CPS, which was presented to the Board onJune 13th, 2006. The proposed DPL I1follows the
implementation of the SIR DPL Iloan which was fully disbursed inJune 2007. Disbursement of
funds will be triggered by implementation of agreed policies as described in the Policy Matrix
(Annex 2). As the Government has chosen a DDO for DPL I1 the funds can be withdrawn
within three years from the time the loan is signed, with an option to renew the option for an
addtional three year period.

61.      If the Government chooses to withdraw the funds, the proposed loan will follow the
Bank`s disbursement procedures for development policy lendmg. Disbursements will not be
linked to specific purchases, thus evidence will not be needed to support disbursements, nor will
procurement requirements be necessary. The government will submit a withdrawal application to
the IBRD. At the request of the MOF, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a
foreign exchange deposit account (deposit account) designated by the government that form part
of the general reserves of the country and acceptable to the Bank, such account to be held at the
Bulgarian National Bank (BNB). The deposit account i s available for budget financing and will
be managed by and subject to the control of the MOF. The government shall ensure that upon
deposit of the net proceeds of the loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited
inthe Borrower's budget management system, ina manner acceptable to the IBRD.
62.      If after the loan proceeds are deposited inthe BNB account, the proceeds are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD will require the borrower to refund
the amount directly to IBRD.
63.     The administration and accounting of the loan proceeds will be responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance. The standard country rules will be followed by treasury for administration
and accounting. The government will maintain accounts and records, or ensure that such items
are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in accordance with provisions of the Loan
Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. The
proceeds of Loan deposited at the treasury account with BNB will be used to cover budget
expenditures. The MOF will be responsible for the Operation's administration and for preparing
the withdrawal application, maintaining the deposit account as required. The MOF, with the
assistance of the BNB, wdl maintain records of all transactions under the Operation in
accordance with sound accounting practices. The government will report to the IBRD on the
amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget management
system w i h 30 days of receiving such fund.


ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
64.     No significant environmental impacts are associated with DPL 11. The reforms
supported by the program are related to the adoption of policies and only a few could have a

                                               33

future environmental impact. Specifically, reforms in the education sector are expected to result
in consolidation of schools, and this wiU in turn require changes insome schools infrastructure
(e.g. school rehabatation).  Similarly, the reforms in the health sector are expected to lead to
changes in the hospital sector, including consolidation, conversion of some facilities, and
therefore require investments in hospital infrastructure.       These actions which may have
environmental impact are expected to occur only during the last phase of the DPL program. The
rehabilitation of education and health infrastructure would require compliance with the national
environmental and construction codes which are now inline with EU standards.

Box 3 Good Practice Principleson Conditionality

Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

The DPL program supports the implementation of the Government's strategies in health, education, and labor and
social protection.   It fully reflects the Government's social sectors and productivity agenda as stated in the
Convergence Programme, one of the strategic documents required by the EU. The Bank and the Government
worked together indefining concrete actions consistent with the various strategies.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other fmancial partners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework

The Bank and the Government have agreed on a set of policy actions included in a streamlined policy matrix to
measure progress in implementing the program. The development partners' community in Bulgaria i s small and
therefore n o coordination i s required. The Bank shares and exchanges information on various policy matters related
to the DPLprogram with the European Commission

Principle 3: Customize the accountabdiv framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

The policies supported by the DPL I1have been discussed and agreed among various stakeholders (he Ministries,
MoF, party coalition members, trade unions). The reform program has benefited from substantial technical analysis
that the Government has undertaken jointly with the Bank. The DPL I1i s being supported by a PHRD grant in
addition to regular preparation and technical assistance activities.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement

The policy matrix i s very streamlined. It contains only nine triggers and no benchmarks. The DPL program entails
three phase single tranche operations. The policy matrix focuses on critical actions for achieving the objectives of
the program, for example changes in financing mechanisms for schools and hospitals, and restructuring of labor
market programs, many o f which have been approved by the National Assembly.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

The DPL program emphasizes the need for evidence based policy making, and has succeeded in developing a cross-
cutting agenda in this area with the Government. Some policy actions included in the matrix directly point towards
evaluating the impact of policy reforms while others require collecting information and using it critically.    The
Government and the Bank are also working together in the context o f the DPL program to measure a number of
outcome indicators through administrative and survey data.         The support i s aligned with the budget cycle and
reflected inthe budget.

ANNEX 1: POLICYAREAS

         Following i s a description of the main areas supported by the DPL series. For each
         main area a set of triggers has been proposed during preparation of DPL I.A
         description of progress in implementing the triggers i s presented together with a
         p r e h n a r y description of triggers for DPL I11and outcomes for the program



66.     The DPL series continues to support some of the overarching objectives stated in
the CPS. These are: (i)      Increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term productivity
growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of education and; (ii)
Promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains insocial sectors. As explained inparagraph
34 many of the policies also contribute to poverty reduction but this i s omitted as an overarchmg
objective in the Policy Matrix to prevent repetition in the presentation. A description of the
actions being supported by the DPL under each objective and the expected outcomes follows.
I Increaseemploymentandlaythe foundations forlong-termproductivitygrowth
by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of education
As the Convergence Programme 2007-2010 states, ``*,.The successful development of the labour
market i s an important issue on w h c h depends the long-term success of economic policies. In
the area of labour markets, the priority of economic policies i s to improve their flexibility, to
develop human resources, and to increase the labour force p a r t i c i p a t i ~ n . " ~The DPL program
                                                                                          ~

the necessary steps to improve quality of education.

IS.     Problem: Low employment, highpercentage oflong term unemployed and high
rates ofinformality in thelabor market
67.     The Government has started to implement policies under the flexicurity
framework inthe context of rapidly falling unemployment and emerging labor shortages.
On the flexibjhty side, the most recent Government policies have been focused on makinglabor
regulations more flexible and reducing the cost of labor (e.g. reducing social insurance
contributions by 6 percentage points in 2006 -a            policy supported by DPL I- and scheduled
decrease of the share of the employer in the social insurance payments) to encourage new job
creation in the private sector. On the security side, the Government has been pursuing a mixed
agenda combining (i)      expanded protection through more generous maternity leave compensation
policy for working/insured parents and the expansion of the bilateral recognition of pension
rights between Bulgaria and EU Member States as well as an extraordinary pension increase by
10 percent in October 2007; and (ii)            providing incentives to unemployed individual to find
employment, tightening the access to social assistance for able-boded individuals and more
active labor programs targeted at the long-term unemployed and hard to place.

68.     After amending the Labor Code in 2006 to increase flexibility in working
conditions (working time and futed and part-time contracts) and align it with the EU
working time directive the Government has implemented additional policies to reduce
distortions and increase flexibility in the labor market. The Government reduced by a

further 3 percentage point decrease in the social insurance contributions as of October 1, 2007
(Gazette 77/2007) conditional on increased compliance and collection of contributions. And, as
of January 1, 2008 the Government reduced the share of the employer in the public pension
contribution to 60 percent and increased the share of the employee to 40 percent.

69.       In order to reduce distortions to labor mobility over the medium term the
Government has removed the portability of the seniority bonus by transforming it into a
bonus which recognizes professional experience ina certain area. This action was included
in the "Pact on Economic and Social Development of the Republic of Bulgaria until 2009"
agreement, and a tri-partite working group developed a new regulation on wage structure which
has been adopted by the COM and enforced as of July 1, 2007. The regulation restricts the
portability of the seniority bonus while it continues to exist as a separate element in the wage
structure. The bonus i s now due only when the employee has relevant professional experience in
case of moving to a sirmlar job. I t s size i s subject to negotiation between the employer and
employee, while the state determines the minimum size of the bonus per year of service. This
measure i s expected to reduce distortions to labor mobfity as new employers are not mandated
to pay a bonus for experienced new employees based only on their seniority. The Government
has not yet eliminated the bonus inits entirety -folding         itinto the base wage. However the new
regulations reduce government intervention in the labor markets and could lead to the de-facto
elimination of the seniority bonus; for example it i s plausible to envision a scenario in which the
negotiation between employer and employee could result in a higher base wage instead of a
seniority bonus. It i s proposed to change the wordmg of this prior action to reflect this policy
change.

 70.       Following the results of an impact evaluation of ALMPs, MLSP started
restructuring the active labor market programs (ALMPs) mix inthe 2006 and 2007 annual
employment action plans to strengthen their focus on on-the-job qualification and on
linkingtraining to private sector skill needs.                    25  The National Action Plan for Employment
 (NAPE) for 2007, adoptedby the Council of Ministers on February 1,2007, continues the 2006
trend inrestructuring of Active Labor Market Policies. In the 2007 NAPE, the Government is
making ALMPs more demand-drivenand is shifting them towards training, at the expense of
low-quality-subsidized employment provided mainly through the program "From Social
Assistance to Employment".                    In the 2007 Plan ALMPs have become more open to life-long
learning, creation of sustainable jobs and wider participation of the private sector (instead of
municipalities) as providers and financiers, and less prone to locking able-bodied people, who
 could find employment inthe open labor market, inlow-quality subsidized jobs.

25 The reform      builds on the impact assessment of the main active labor market program for long-term unemployed
receiving monthly social assistance, "From Social Assistance to Employment" (FSAE). The program was introduced
in 2002, with 55,300 participants and scaled up in 2003 and 2004 to over 80,000 participants per year. Initially the
program was heavily focused on public works -a 45 percent share. The impact evaluation o f the program in 2005
revealed a mixed outcome: (i) the gross and the net program impacts on employment were negative -the             program
reduced the participants' net probabhty o f ever fmding a regular job by 12.7 percent; (ii)        the negative impact on
employment was most pronounced in the case of disadvantaged and hard-to-reach and hard-to-place groups o n the
labor market; and (iii)       the training provided under the program was very limited and not sufficient to improve the
participants' employabhty. Inaddition participation in the program reduced the time for job search compared to the
control group. On the other hand (i)          the program had a positive impact o n unemployment duration, reducing it by
50 percent on average for participants; and (ii) program had positive social effects, as the control group reported
                                                      the
deterioration in self confidence, motivation for job search, social contacts, health status, job opportunities and
income, and unchanged status of qualification and skills, while the treatment group reported improvement, except
for income where they saw no change; and (iii) program had positive long-term impact on employabhty interms
                                                      the
of improved labor habits, increased motivation for independent job search, and improved qualification and skdls. A
parallel survey among employers indicated that 68 percent o f the employers reported lower productivity of the
employees h r e d under the program. They also reported making additional investments in mentoring and firm-level
supervision to bring the work habits and discipline at the workplace up to the level of `regular' workers.

 @ost-EUaccession) phase of the National Employment Strategy 2004-2010, followed by its
extension to 2015. The update made it more relevant to the objectives of the European
Employment Strategy, increase the weight of activation policies, and improve its results focus.
For 2008 the Government plans to further trim subsidized job programs and reallocateresources
to occupational training and career counseling in particular for the long-term unemployed. As
Table 5 shows vocational and on the job training in companies now represent almost 50 percent
of the programs. The following measures have been adopted:

*    The FSAE program was downsixed to 33,000 partinipants in 2007, especially in its public works
     component -as       shown in Figure 4. In 2007, less than 15,000 program participants were
     engaged with public works -beneficiaries      who are not employable outside the program. The
    remaining program prioritizes new entrants, members of families with children where both

-   parents are long-term unemployed and receiving social assistance, and single parents.
     The ALMPs have been diversgeed and the role ofprivate entrepreneurs in providing subsidiyedjobs is
    gradual'  increasing, while the role of the municipal administrations in the organization and
    provision of the program is declining. Private employers' involvement increased in opening
    subsidized jobs in agriculture, maintenance of road and railway infrastructure (in some cases
    jointly financed with Government).

*    Thefocus ofALMPs has shifted to those withgreater dficulties injndingjobs. These include youth,
    young mothers re-entering the labor market after maternity leave; elderly workers who are
    missing up to 5 points in order to be able to retire; people with disabihties; people living in
    economically depressed regions with limited job opportunities on the primary market.
    Separate ALMPs are designed to serve the needs of these vulnerable groups, for example the
    "Assistants to People with Disabilities" national program, "Assistance to Retirement"
    program, "Support to Motherhood' project, `Vocational Training for Employment of
    Persons under 29 Years Old", "Career Start" program and different internship and
    apprenticeship programs. In addition program participants which have been in the program
    for over 18 months and who are receiving social assistance will not be enrolled in the
    program as ofJanuary 1,2008.

*   Training and skills upgrading activities have been expanded within the ALMPs and separate training
   programs have been mated. These include one big national vocational training program with
    21,000 trainees representing 48.8 percent of all beneficiaries of training and a number of
    smaller national and regional literacy programs, programs for development of vocational
    skills and motivation to enter the labor market. The share of those benefiting from training
    increased to 49.5 percent of all employment program beneficiaries in2007 (43,022 people);

 72.        Medium term actions (DPL 111) and new areas of dialogue.26 In addtion to further
 restructuring ALMPs the World Bank and the Government are currently discussing how to move
 the labor and productivity agenda further. Some of the activities under discussion are:

 i. Introducingsecondchancepoliciesforlowskillsindividualstofacilitatetheirentry
      into the formal labor market. T h i s applies to individuals who dropped out early from the
      education system and do not comply with the entry requirements (accomplished minimum
      s i x grades of education) for receiving formal `complete, or full' vocational qualification for a
      certain profession. Policies in this area would entail opening flexible opportunities for the
      acquisition of primary and initial secondary education and introducing more flexible ways of
      confirmation/legalization of literacy, qualifications and skills acquired outside the formal
      education system, and for r e c o p t i o n of `partial' vocational qualification. Accordmg to the
      last census there are 200,000 illiterate people in the country while the Employment Agency
      has been providingliteracy courses for not more than 1,500 people per year. It i s important
      to introduce policy measures which will allow individuals to complete at least grade 4 to
      guarantee some formal access to employment opportunities; and to de-link the educational
      programs for adults (for grades from 1 to 6) from the curriculum and the delivery methods
      applied for children.        As a first step, a state educational standard for grade 4 has been
      developed by MLSP with the assistance from specialists and has already been applied when
      training adult Roma. In the future MES would need to consider introducing mechanisms to
      (i)recogmze this as formal education (proving and verifying)                        and (ii) legalize general
      education knowledge attained by adults outside the formal education system -whch                      would
     require changes in the Public Education Act, the VET Act, and development of new syllabi

      for literacy and primary education for early drop outs. The reform agenda for those with low
      skills and low level of education remains underdeveloped and needs a deepening of inter-
     agency coordination between MES and MLSP.
 ii. Expandinglifelonglearning.The share ofworkingageBulgarians enrolledintraining-
     approximately 2 percent in 2006-            remains much below that in the EU 15 (11.1percent) or
     the advanced EU Member States, such as Denmark (29.2 percent). The Bank team has
     initiated discussions with GOB and the associations of employers on measures to expand
     effective life-long learning opportunities, including through greater involvement of private
     sector provision of adult training, so as to take full advantage in this area from financing
     under the OP HRD. The MES has created a multi-agency working group tasked with the
     development of a new National Strategy on Lifelong Learning, and a PHARE-financed
     consultant team has been developing a draft document w h c h will be subject to elaboration
     over the coming months. The life-long learning agenda i s also tackled with support of the
     planned Social Inclusion Project which focuses on promoting access to kindergarten and
     preschool of children from poor and marginalized background as well as chlldren with a
     disability to enhance thek school readiness.

 iii.The Bank is discussing the inclusion of actions to improve the regulatory
     environment of firms to contribute to job creation and increased productivity.
     Stimulating productivity growth and further reductions in unemployment require a
     multisectoral approach that includes efforts to improve the quality of regulations. It has been
     acknowledged that an unpredictable investment clunate i s a significant barrier to job
     creation.27 Promotingthe right environment for firms to operate i s conducive to lower cost
     of doing business, which in turns create incentives for firms to enter the market and add
     formal jobs to the economy. In order to improve the investment climate the Government
     passed the A c t on Restricting Administrative, Regulation and Control on Business Activities
     in 2003. This Act defined the legal framework for Regulatory Impact Assessment
     which lie at the core of the EU strategy to improve the quality of regulation -one                    aspect of
     the investment climate ina country. However, the A c t was inconsistently implemented inthe
     following years. In2006, the Council of Ministers took as a priority improvingthe regulatory
     framework in Bulgaria, and mandated the Ministry of Economy (MoE) and the Ministry of
     State Administration (MSA) to take initiatives for regulatory reform. As a result, the MoE i s
     now chairing an Inter-Ministerial Working Group on Better Regulation that aims to create a
     coordinated position on regulatory reform issues. The MoE has also initiated several efforts
     to implement RIAs, including the adoption of a basic short-term plan on regulatory reform, a
     survey of firms aimed at identifying firms' perceptions of the main constraints imposed by
     current regulations, and three pilot RIAs. In the context of a multi-sector approach to job
     creation the DPL series would support the preparation and implementation of a
     comprehensive national policy to institutionahze Regulatory Impact Assessments and
     implementation of h s policy, including: (1) building a central unit responsible for promoting
     and overseeing regulatory reform, (2) completing the electronic registry of consolidated

28 Regulatory Impact Assessment    (RM)is a framework for analysis o f the likely impacts o f a policy change and the
range of options for implementing it. It assesses the full range o f potential impacts - economic, social and
environmental- from existing and new regulations. RIA i s a key tool in delivering better regulation because it helps
governments only regulate when necessary and, when it is, to do so in a way that i s proportionate to the risk being
addressed. It leads to deregulating and simplifyingwherever possible. As part of the 2005 renewed Lisbon Strategy,
the European Commission requires Member States "to demonstrate their clear commitment to better regulation
principles through their National Lisbon [Action] Programmes", the core o f which consists of systematic
implementation o f RIAs.

     T h e Government has prepared a n ex ante assessment of the impact of measures to
            strengthen work incentives inthe social assistance system, and based on its
    conclusions has developed an employment activation program including individual
                                      action plans for social assistance beneficiaries
 Status: completed
73.         Aiming to promote employment activation in times of rising labor demand at all
levels of the skills distribution, the MLSP has introduced measures to tighten eligibility of
social assistance for working age individuals who are capable to work. As of 1July, 2006,
the maximum duration of eligibility for Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) for able bodied
working age beneficiaries is 18 months. Affected beneficiaries cannot re-apply for the program
until after 12 months of break in benefit receipt. The policy measure has been enforced from
January 1, 2008. Ths measure i s linked to plans to review and adjust the targeting of the GMI


                                                                        43

and force those receiving GMI support while working in the informal sector to enter into formal
employment.

74.      The Bank is supporting the analysis of the profile of the affected GMI
beneficiaries and the reasons for staying unemployed in the long term, as well as an ex-
ante assessment of the impact of this policy, so that the Government can make informed
policy changes to the program incase of negative welfare effect. This analysis will b d d on
administrative data from the Social Assistance Agency (SAA) and Employment Agency (EA) as
well as on a survey of beneficiaries to be conducted by the National Statistical Institute P S I ) in
February 2008. While the DPL program does not support the tightening of the eligibihty criteria
for GMI itself, the DPL policy dialogue has focused on preparatory and analytical efforts to
minimize any adverse social impact and maximize the likelihood of activating affected GMI
beneficiaries. As a result of this dialogue, the' S A A and EA have examined administrative data
and develop profiles of affected beneficiaries by education, age and prior labor market
experience. On the basis of this, the EA scheduled interviews with each beneficiary and
developed individual activation action plans, specifying the training needs. In addition the agency
monitored the beneficiary numbers monthly from July 2007. As of December 2007 there were
17,642 unemployed on monthly social assistance (GMI) for whom the "18-month rule" was to
start to apply on January 1, 2008, down from 24,605 on November 20, 2007 and 29,954 in the
end of July 2007. The majority of the difference i s explained by GMI beneficiaries already
enrolling on training and employment programs, such as subsidized employment by the EA
under ALMPs and measures, literacy courses or professional qualification.                    In addition, the
regional offices and affiliates of the EA helped 206 people to find jobs on the primary labor
market; while 1,222 refused to participate in ALMPs and their registration as unemployed has
been terminated for the following 12 months. As Figure 5 shows, the majority of remaining
affected beneficiaries have low levels of education, resulting in likely low employability: 33
percent have no formal education and only 7.5 percent have secondary of higher than secondary
education.

75.      Based on the review of administrative data, the Employment Offices have held
interviews with every affected beneficiary and have developed individual action plans.
Some beneficiaries have already been placed on programs, as evident in the reduction of
remaining affected beneficiaries between October and November 2007 (see Figure 5). As
expected, those beneficiaries with better education have been easier to place: between October
and November 2007, while the number of affected beneficiaries with secondary education and
above fell by 36 percent, the number of beneficiaries with no education and with primary
education fell by only 25 percent in the same period.                  Accordmg to EA data, very few
beneficiaries have terminated their unemployment registration without participating in any EA
program so far. The employment offices are not tracking these former beneficiaries and the
reasons for such termination and it i s not clear to what extent this i s due to finding jobs on the
primary market, `formalizing' informal jobs or for other reasons. Action plans for the remaining
17,642 persons wdl be includedinthe 2008 EmploymentAction plan and budget.29




29Owing to low levels o f education and limited previous formal employment experience, the majority of the
remaining clients are unlikely to find work on their own and will continue to rely on training and measures for
subsidized employment envisaged in the Employment Promotion Act, or o n national or regional programs for
subsidized employment, and mostly o n the "From Social Assistance to Employment" program.

76.       The review of administrative data is being complemented with survey work
initiated inApril 2008, to provide a baseline for this policy change and conduct an impact
assessment. The MLSP and the World Bank have set up a joint team to analyze data from the
Multi-Topic Household Survey (MTHS) 2007, including social benefit incidence analysis which
will provide a basis for changes intargeting and benefit eligibility. The DPL I1is supportingthe
impact evaluation of thls policy including (i)     a simulation of how the welfare status of the
household would change if the GMI support was stopped for the individual beneficiary or the
whole household for 12 months; (ii) assessment of the expected coping strategies with respect
                                       an
to the policy measure - for example activation (joiningthe labor market), goinginto the informal
economy, opting for disabihty pension, continuing to rely on social assistance, reliance on intra-
household or extended family transfers, etc.; and (iii)    a study of the reasons why the affected
GMI recipients do not enter the labor market - like a hgh reservation wage, dsincentives to
work related to the level of the benefit, the level of wage, taxation, the lack of adequate skills and
qualification, the lost working habits, and other reasons which make the person unemployable.


77.       Medium term actions (DPL 111) and new areas of dialogue. The DPL policy
Qalogue insocial protection has seen a deepening since DPL Ibut remains uneven across various
hectorates in MLSP. The DPL Isocial protection dialogue had been focused on employment
policy in recognition of reform pressures in this area, and the collaboration with the employment
policy directorate has since deepened. For example, the directorate has requested Bank's
technical assistance on the revised National Employment Strategy. On the other hand, dialogue
with the social assistance hectorate is still limited as the more recent developments in OECD
and EU's social policy have not been fully absorbed yet. In general social protection remains an
area of uncertain reform commitment, in particular inthe second half of the Government's term
inoffice. An increasedinterest inBulgaria to introduce the concept of flexicurity couldprovide a
window of opportunity for further engagement in this area, and close collaboration with DG
Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities as well as DG E c f m in the European
Commission would help foster the reform process. The prospects for continuing dialogue inthis
sector relate to two main topics:

       demand for analytical support from the employment policy directorate, the social analyses
       and forecasting directorate and the deputy ministers, the Bank proposes a sustained
       engagement strategy through select and jointly undertaken pieces of analytical work,
       includmg (i) of the profde of GMI beneficiaries PHRDassignment), (ii) benefit

       supply. The MLSP has recently nominated a working group for joint pieces of analytical
       work based on the MTHS, with the focus of analytical work on a poverty update, social
       benefit incidence analysis and labor market analysis. This i s reflected in the second trigger for

       became conditional to school attendance for school-age eligible children in March 2003.
       W         e this measure has been credited with boosting enrollment and attendance, the
       verification of attendance twice a year was perceived by MLSP and MES as insufficient to
       guarantee sustained attendance.                     MLSP introduced a change in the enforcement of the
       conditionality in September 2006, monitoring school attendance on a monthly basis and
       disrupting the benefit for a month in case of 5 or more unexcused absences. MLSP has
       requested the Bank's support in the design and implementation of an assessment of the
       possible impact of the tightened monitoringand subsequent sanctions on behaviors related to
       school attendance which, according to MLSP affect between 7,000 and 9,000 families per
       month. Analytical work funded by the DPL2 PHRD grant will review the current system and
       the various associated conditionality elements, advise on how the conditionality elements can be
       strengthened to maximize their effect, and share international experience with examples of dfferent
       approaches to CCTs. This i s reflected in the first of the triggers for DPL I11in the table below.

79.    The strategy to improve quality of education in Bulgaria consists of increasing
training of educators, introducing modem technologies inthe curriculum, gathering data
on performance, and building capacity at the MES to assess quality and performance.
The Government expects that improving education will also contribute in the medium term to
the goal of increasing productivity and skills of workers. One important aspect of quality i s to
have the capacity to analyze and disseminate student performance data for the purposes of
informing policy and teaching practices at the school level. At the outset of the DPL series,
Bulgaria did not have the capacity to supervise and monitor education quality systematically,
rewardmg high performing schools and identifying f a h g schools, or targeting measures and
concrete areas to improve the quality of teaching as needed. In this regard, it i s not enough to


                                                47

have the national capacity to measure learning outcomes, w h c h Bulgaria i s developing now.
What really makes the difference i s the capacz'p to use learning outcomes information for quality
improvement and equity enhancing purposes. This includes the capan9 to commtlnicate the
information to the wider public, the capacz'pofpractitioners to learn from the results, and the capacz'p
to make evidence-basedpolig choices. After the creation of a national agency for the evaluation of
education quality (CKOKO) inBulgaria, the availability of student achievement data at key stages
of the schooling process together with international comparisons and benchmarking opens the
possibility for policy makers and practitioners to focus on quality. The Government has made
significant progress in this area:              (i)the census-based 4th grade national assessment was
administered in all primary schools in Bulgaria in May 2007, marking a historical rmlestone as it i s
the first national assessment of student achievement carried out in Bulgaria; (ii) June 07 the        in
new 7th Grade examination, piloted the previous year, was administered; and (iii)                   inDecember of
2007 the results of PISA 2006 and PIRLS 2006 were made public and ina few months data from
TIMSS 2007 will also be available.            30  In 2008, in addition to the 4th grade test, there will be
another census-based national test of 5th grade students, meaning that the same cohort of
students who were tested in the fourth grade wiU be assessed again. In fact, the MES plans to
continue the assessment of this same generation of students unal they reach the 8th grade four
years from now. T h i s i s the first generation of students to study the new curriculum, including
foreign languages and IT from the 2nd grade.                     In addition the Government is planning to
develop a coordinated implementation plan for the effective use of national and international
assessment data for school improvement purposes, and to identify training needs for teachers,
school h e c t o r s and local education administrators.                  Since the Government has actually
performed above the agreed commitment in the original trigger as it implemented adltional
testing the trigger has been re-stated accordmgly.

80.      The pilot Matura examination -a                 standardized test to be used by universities as
one of the criteria for admission-              was carried out inApril of 2007 with a sample of 3,700
students from 45 secondary schools. Taking into account that the introduction of the Matura
has been highly controversial for over a decade and, as a result, continuously delayed, the fact
that all stakeholders are now supporting the new examination bodes well for the successful
implementation of the Matura in Bulgaria by 2009. Introducing the Matura examination i s the
key reform measure suggested by the recent World Bank Public Expenditure Review as the
means to overhaul current policies on access to tertiary education in B~lgaria.3~In addition, a
compulsory Matura, administered centrally, i s seen by many as one of the main tools to reduce
the gray market of private tutoring before entrance into higher education. Universities also
recognize that the complexity and expense of organizing their own entrance exams limits their
ability to diversify their course and program offers and places an unnecessary burden on their
administration and academic staff (affecting, among others, research productivity).3*

81.      As a preparation for the expansion of delegated budgets and school based
management, the MES launched the Institute for the Training of School Principals on
November 1,2006. The Institute is playing a crucial role in the implementation of both quality
assessment reforms - by training inspectors and principals in the effective use of assessment data
for school improvement purposes - and the finance and governance reforms - training principals
on delegated budgets. I t has created 11 dfferent programs and trained 2,915 school principals,
including 305 in delegated budget management. In addtion to principals and deputy principals,

32 Despite all the progress made, issues still remain concerning the future use o f the Matura scores for admission in
some specialized institutions and fields of study which are stdl planning to keep their own entrance examinations.

    Directors of local inspectorate offices, evaluation experts and selected staff from Teacher Unions
    have also received training and a variety of issues including managing budgets in schools. The
    Inspection Directorate of the MES has kept the main responsibhty for the training of Inspectors
    and h       s i s why the trigger i s reformulated as follows:
    82.         Medium term actions (DPL 111) and new areas of dialogue. DPL I11wdl support
    the consolidation of the policies initiated during the first two phases. The Government will have
    to use the information gathered to promote quality enhancing changes. It will also introduce the
    Matura, and commit to continue participating in international tests, and additional tests to be
    used for quality assessment. N e w areas of support have emerged for the medium term:
    i.The DPLI11couldsupportreformsinhighereducationandvocationaleducation.
          Highquality vocational education can contribute to increasedlabor productivity growth. The
          government's National Program for the Development of School Education (2006-2015)
          mentions the need to reform VET, in particular the need to review the cost effectiveness of
          VET institutions, as well as the number of specializations taught at the school. Moreover, the
          Program calls for a transfer of schools from the state to municipalities since municipalities ``,                                       ..
          bear the direct responsibdity for the comprehensive development of the region, they are best
          informed about the current status of the local economy and output and about the need to
          educate and train specialists within certain occupations.'' To move the Bulgarian VET system
          closer to the best practice examples inEU and OECD countries the government may wish to
          consider some of the following policies that could also be supported by DPL 111: (i)
          introduce per student financing for VET; (ii) ownership of VETSto municipalities;
                                                                              transfer

                delay
          countries have done in order to make workers more adaptable and mobile across jobs.
    ii.Regarding higher education, the government's strategy in this area did not gather the
          necessary support in the Assembly. The Bank remains open to support the Government in
          implementing the strategy inthe future.

84.          The Government initiated -with                 support of DPL I- a series of actions to control
spending in hospitals. There are indications that hospital spendmg is one of the main drivers
of growth in NHIF spending and that the system contains distortions that stimulate this growth.
NHIF spends now 56 percent of its budget on hospitals, and there has been a 7 percent increase
inthe number ofcasesreportedbyhospitals.34 Inadditionoutof530,000 hospitalizations during
the first half of 2007, 22 percent are re-hospitalizations - the same patients are treated under the
same or different case in the same or different healthcare facil~ties.~~Achieving financial
sustainability will require c o n t r o h g spending in hospitals, and in order to tackle this, the
Government has continued the implementation of policies originally supported by DPL I.First,
it maintained a unified method of payment for hospital services.                             NHIF is now the main

purchaser of services for hospitals, using CCPs to pay for services.36                           MoH only finances
psychiatric wards, dialysis centers, and some emergency services. Ths sends clear signals to
providers and limits the possibility of selectively billing either NHIF or the MoH depending on
the prices paid, and eliminates duplicate administrative costs. Second, the Ministq and NHIF
continued monitoring recovery plans signed with major hospitals in order to prevent the
accumulation of debt. Total arrears in hospitals went down from BGN 184 Mnin 2005 to BGN
180 in2007 -more            importantly they have been decreasing as percentage of NHIF budget from
49 percent of budget in2005 to 26 percent of budget in2007. Third, the 2007 NHIFBudget Act
introduced ceilings in the volume of services at the national level by type of CCP and granted
authority to NHIF to reduce the prices of CCPs3' incase budget execution inhospitals becomes
unsustainable. 38 The NHIF also stepped up monitoringand analysis of the work of the medical
institutions.39

85.         The Government has introduced additional measures to control hospital
spending. The Government has introduced inthe 2008 NHIFBudget Act a policy change that
i s among the most significant changes since the creation of the National Health Insurance Fund
in 1998. Over the last ten years there have been many reports recommending changes to the
current system for allocating resources to hospitals -a                     de facto fee-for-service, open ended
budgeting and payment mechanism with lax regulation of new entrants into the system. Instead
of paying an unlimited number of services to every qualifying facility, the 2008 Budget Act
allocates funds to the Regional Health Insurance Funds (de-concentrated branches of the
national fund) on a per-capita basis, with some adjustments made for recent referral patterns.
The RHIFs are then to allocate their resources to the hospitals according to their historical (2006-
2007) share of expenditures from the insurance fund (which would roughly capture quantity and
case-mix of their patients). There are some reserves to be retained at the national (10% of total)
and regional (10% of regional allocation) levels in order to account for new entrants to the
market (with which the NHIF i s legally obliged to contract), changes in referral patterns, and
emergency cases. The contracts between the hospitals and the regional health insurance funds
will have a financial h t . They will also estimate the number of services, by CCPs and according
to the prevailing CCP price, for which the hospital will be providingservices. The actual mix of
services will be allowed to vary, as long as the overall financial ceiling remains the same. For
particularly expensive CCPs @.e.invasive cardiac surgery), the RHIF will pay for these services
additionally from its reserves.            The NHIF Budget A c t was approved by the Parliament on
December 17 2007. The wording of the trigger has been modified to group various activities
related to financing into one trigger and group activities related to service provision into a
separate trigger.

86.         On the supply side, the Government is initiating measures to restructure the
hospital sector to adapt it to modem practices that rely on -less                          expensive-      outpatient
care.       An excessive number of providers creates pressure to increase volumes of services


36 CCPs are a variant o f DRGs where each clinical care pathway sets p d e h e s for treating a particular case and a
price for the overall treatment. When well designed the CCP system may present an advantage over DRGs in that
may provide more clear care guidelines for each case, but it also has some ]Imitations, like the lack of co-morbidities
and other refinements that are incorporated inDRGs.
3' The experience    inmany European countries shows that setting prices is not enough to limit spending by health
care facilities, as they can control volume o f services and recover any reduction in prices by increasing admission
rates. Therefore any meaningful way to control hospital spending has to address prices and volume of services.
38 T h i s can only be a policy of last resort as it may create perverse incentives to increase volumes further and may
penalize certain hospitals that remain withm budget -as            the law does not authorize NHIF to alter prices
Qfferentially across providers.

contracts have been terminated

 delivered and therefore hospital spending.                There i s a large body of evidence suggesting that
 health care i s particularly susceptible to supply-induced demand, especially when the costs are
 paid by a third party such as government rather than directly by consumers. Optimizing the
 hospitals network i s a difficult political issue and therefore requires building consensus first by
 collecting evidence and communicating it to the public and major stakeholders. The first step
 has been to update the National Health Map, detailing the existing hospital infrastructure in the
various regions and municipalities.                Second, the government i s commissioning a hospital
 masterplan to assess the needs of the population and compare them to actual services provided.@


                                                     Originaltn&er 7
      The Government has completed the masterplanningexercise and taken first steps
    towards its implementation. I t is also implementing additional measures to improve
    the financial balance of the national health insurancesystem, for example enforcing
      implementationof recovery plans inhospitals to limit growth of arrears and using
                     accreditationof facilities as a tool for rationalizing services.
  Status: partially completed


 87.      The hospital masterplanning exercise will propose new models for health care
provision in Bulgaria. It will estimate the ideal location of facilities, the type of services that
should be provided at each level, the organizational model for better management and
accountability, and the costs necessary to implement the network optimization program. Based
on that information it will then recommend alternative models to acheve a successful
restructuring, including proposals to increase the private sector participation in the restructuring
and functioning of hospitals, like Public-Private-Partnerships. Even though the entire process
can last a decade, the Government i s planning to start implementing the restructuring plan within
the next two years, and i s looking into other countries experience within the EUin order to take
advantage of Structural Funds to finance part of the process.

88.       The work on the masterplan has begun recently, after a six month-delay due to
disagreements within the coalition party. The Government is committed to complete the
following steps, w h c h are part of the masterplan, by the time the operation is presented to the
Board: (i)    guidehes and recommendations on health service planning and evidence on optimal
configuration of hospital services and benchmarks to be used in national and regional master-
plans; and (ii)   framework/guidelines for prioritizing investment needs that can later be applied to
the investment needs of the restructuring strategy. The Council of Ministers will endorse this
information through the appropriate mechanism. In addition the Government i s attempting to
introduce a measure that would facilitate the restructuring of the supply of services. The Ministry
of Health has submitted legislation to the National Assembly to allow hospitals where the state is
not a majority shareholder to privatize idle assets. And finally the NHIFis requiring new health
facilities to go through the accrehtation process before s i p g contracts with the Fund.




4" There have been some successful experiences       with the restructuring of hospitals that followed this path, like the
case o f Estonia, where a restructuring plan was set up in 2000 with the goal of reducing the number of hospitals from
78 to 21 by 2015. Using demographic and epidemiological models the demand for health care was estimated, as well
as optimal catchment areas by type o f facility, so that for a given catchment area the maximum time limit to reach the
hospital would be one hour. Based on these criteria Estonia identified 3 regional hospitals for tertiary care, 4 central
hospitals, 11 country hospitals, and 3 smaller hospitals. Between 1993 and 2001 the number of hospitals went from
115 to 67, the number o f beds decreased from 14,000 to 9,000, and average length o f stay moved from 15 to 8.7
days.

  The Government has taken the first steps towards implementation of the
  masterplanning exercise by endorsing: (i)the guidelines and recommendations on
  health service planning; and (ii)framework for prioritizing investment needs. I t is also
  usingaccreditationoffacilities as a tool for rationalizing services


 89.      The Government has continued to refine pharmaceutical policy in Bulgaria The
new drug law approved in December 2006 and supported by DPL Iaddresses technical aspects
--like   registration, manufacturing, and clinical research-  as well as administrative and economic
aspects 4 . g . licensing of businesses, pricing, and reimbursement-           based on European
regulatory standards. During 2007 the Government developed new by-laws that provide the
 framework for a more efficient reimbursement. If properly implemented the by-laws should lead
to reduced bureaucracy for registration, pricing and reimbursement decisions for new drugs
 (originals and generics), better access to drugs that have a hgh value for public health; and use of
the purchasing power of public payers to get the best possible prices and share the risk of over-
spending with suppliers. It shouldalso lead to improved governance inthe sector.


                                             PriorAction 8
       The Government further adopts and implements measures that would improve
         pharmaceutical approval, pricing, and reimbursementpolicies to increase the
     efficiency of public spending on pharmaceuticals and access to essential drugs (e.g.
  Unifydruglists into one single list basedonINNname andATC/DDD classification)
  Status: completed


90.       The key by-laws for pricing and approving new drugs were adopted by the
Council of Ministers in December 2007. The first Ordinance on pricing establishes an
improved mechanism for determining the maximum price of a prescription drug that can be
offered in Bulgaria by setting up a system referencing the Bulgarian maximum price to a set of
comparison countries in the EU (the maximum price in Bulgaria will be the lowest of the
reference countries in the case of patent drugs and 80% of the lowest of the reference countries
in case of generic drugs). The effect of this Ordinance should be a faster and more transparent
mechanism to make products available in the Bulgarian market (i.e. the application process i s
defined and time requirements are established). The pricing mechanism may reduce the price
that Bulgaria pays for patent drugs p e n that they wdl reference their price to some countries
that mark the lower end of price dlstribution in Europe, but t h s w d have to be studied. The
second Ordinance on the Positive Drug L i s t (those Drugs w h c h will be eligible for public
reimbursement either under the National Programs or through the NHIF) groups drugs
according to the international non-patent name and in accordance with the anatomic and
therapeutic classification code (ATC) for a defined daily dose; defines a single maximum rate for
reimbursement for the entire group and thus does not favor one drug over another with the same
therapeutic value; and in accordance with defined pharmaco-economic principles, allows a higher
rate of reimbursement for those drug groups with more cost-effectiveness.            Ths will be an
improvement from the current situation where drugs are listed by name and their allowable
reimbursement percentage seems to be subject to discretion. The next step in the process will be
to prepare a positive list based on the new guidelines, assess the actual application of the by-laws

 on the ground, and evaluate their impact on changes in prices, volumes, and access to basic
 drugs. The draft list according to the new procedure is expected to be ready inApril 2008.
 91.        Medium term actions (DPL 111) and new areas of dialogue. Inthe medmm term the
 Government will continue implementing stabilization measures to improve the financial balance
 of the NHIF and start implementing the structural reforms in the hospital sector. One of the
 triggers of DPL I11therefore calls for a decrease inhospital arrears, which shouldbe the result of
 applying the policies controlling hospital spendmg. In addition the DPL I11should consolidate
 the structural reforms in the supply of health care through the completion of the hospital
 masterplan and beginning of its implementation. The Bank and the Government have identified
 additional areas where policy changes are needed. Specifically:

 i. Additionalchanges inpaymentmechanisms. Nowthat the Governmenthas taken the
      first essential step in changing the system for allocating resources to hospitals it i s necessary
      to fine-tune the payment systems, for example improvingupon the per capita dstribution of
      resources across regions to later contract services with hospitals. Inaddition the negotiation
      mechanism with providers (doctors and hospitals) needs to be improved to increase
      efficiency further. The Bank i s already providingtechnical assistance in this area through the
      PHRD grant and the health sector reform project. One technical assistance activity will
      review the current negotiation process and recommend changes to avoid the current
      situation, a bilateral bargaining between the NHIFand the Bulgarian Medical Union inwhich
      the NHIF cannot take advantage of its intended role as strategic purchaser of services.

ii. The government has yet to reach an agreement among its coalitionpartners on a
      rational co-payment policy for health services. Currently there seems to be a significant
      portion of the population making out of pocket payments (see paragraph 103). The current
      co-payment structure has to be reviewed in light of two potentially contradictory facts: first,
      out of pocket payments -many              of w h c h are co-payments-          may be creating a barrier to
      access for some groups. Second, there seems to be evidence of unnecessary demand for
      some services like hospitals. One of the goals of universal health insurance i s to protect
     individuals from large negative shocks to their health, covering catastrophic or large health
     related payments. At the same time unnecessary demand for services should be h t e d by
     introducing adequate co-payments. The PHRD grant i s financing a study to define a basic
     benefit package together with a rational co-payment policy and options to develop
     supplementary health insurance that shouldaddress the abovementioned problems.41
iii.TheGovernmentisstudyingoptionstoincreasetheroleoftheprivatesectorinthe
     health insurance market. This is a controversial issue as reflected by the difficulty in
     reaching consensus in the context of the discussion of the health strategy. Currently NHIF
     holds a monopoly inheath insurance coverage, and there exists a very lirmted private sector
     participation in supplementary health insurance. The options under dscussion now vary


41  According to the Health Insurance Law, every visit to the GP, the specialist (with a referral) or the dentist the
insured patients pay a user fee equal to 1% of the hlinimum Salary (currently minimum salary i s BGN 160/month,
e.g. fee i s BGN 1.6). Every day o f hospital stay i s paid at 2% of the hlinimum Salary.       If the insured person is
hospitalized for more than 10 days in a given calendar year, the person i s only paying user fee for the first 10 days of
his/her stay. User fees are NOT paid by a number of groups, includmg but not limited to: children up to 18,
pregnant women, people in social homes and orphanages, conscript d t a r y , medlcal school graduates, people on
social assistance, etc. When lab tests are being conducted at the referral o f the GP, specialist or dentist, the patient
pays at the lab a fee for collection o f bio-material, not higher than 2 leva per lab visit regardless o f the number of
tests for that visit. Fee for collection o f material i s waived for people with no income, those in social facilities, in
child orphanages and social care homes; and a user fee equal to 1% of the min salary. Finally, co-payments for
medications for home treatments entail a complex system o f full or partial reimbursement, based on a Positive Drug
List approved by MoHand a special Reimbursement List o f NHIF.

          widely and include (i)            maintaining the current NHIF monopoly; (ii)                             defining a basic package
          that NHIF would cover universally and adding complementary private insurance to cover
          services not included in the basic package; (iii) opening NHIF services to competition; and
          (iv) developing further the supplementary health insurance, whereby private companies offer
          improved services also covered by the NHIF. In addition to the PHRD supported study on
          supplementary insurance and co-payments, the Bank has provided assistance on this topic
          through the organization of a health policy roundtable to discuss different models prevailing
          in Europe, and it stands ready to support the Government further once a consensus is
          reached on the extent of private sector participation.

  92.           Expected outcomes. By the end of the DPL Series (2009), the expected outcomes are:
 i.Financial projections of spending and revenues show the health system is fmancially
          sustainable as proxied by decrease in arrears (percent of total NHIF budget); Baseline 2005:
         49 percent; value 2007: 26 percent; target: 25 percent
 ii.PercentageofpaymentstohospitalschanneledthroughNHIFremainsconstantorincreases.
         Baseline: 55 percent (January-December 2005); target: 80 percent; value 2007: 75 percent;
 iii.Theproportionofspendingonoutpatientcarerelativetoinpatientcarehasincreasedby5
         percent;
 iv. With hospital spending under control the system becomes more efficient as shown by a
         convergence in inpatient admissions to the European average; average of EU in 2005: 18.03
         per 100 (inBulgaria 21);
 v. Increase in efficiency through changes inpayment mechanisms to hospitals, as reflected ina
         decrease in average length of stay over time. In2006: 6.59; in2007: 6.32

                                                                            55

vi. The percentage of the Bulgarian population reporting access to pharmaceuticals increases
      (MTHS shows that 66 percent of population had access to all the needed medications in
      2007)
vii. NHIF data showingthat pharmaceutical spending is within budget and growing at a rate not
      hgher than twice GDP growth. (2005-06 GDP growth: 6.1; pharmaceutical spending by
      NHIF:11-0;GDPgrowth 2006-07: 6.4; pharmaceutical spending: 10.3)
viii.In the long term the measures supported by the program should contribute to
      increasing quality and access to basic health care, but will require complementary
      actions inthe medium term. First, the changes inpharmaceutical regulations are intended
      to increase the speed of adoption of new drugs but at the same time make pricing decisions
      more rational and based on cost-effectiveness.                By reducing reference prices and profit
      margins for pharmacists, drugs should become more affordable to the entire population.
      Second, the restructuring of hospitals i s taking into account the epidemiological profile and
      the needs of different catchment areas and populations, and therefore resources are going to
      be allocated where they are needed the most. Third, it i s widely acknowledged that hospital
      wards should have a certain number of cases every year for medical professionals to maintain
      their expertise and provide quality care. By restructuring hospitals, the wards with extremely
      low caseloads would eventually be closed and quality would improve. Also the masterplan
      would result in the creation of day surgery centers that could provide better quality for
      outpatient cases that are currently treated in hospitals. Finally, increase in monitoring by
      NHIF would result not only in tightening financial discipline but also assuring that quality
      protocols are followed as per the agreed requirements of care.

93.       As envisioned under the DPL1, the Government has continued with the
implementation of the financing reform in schools, and since January 1, 2007
municipalities started to receive all funds to cover both salary and non-salary
expenditures for general education in municipal schools on a per student basis (as a
"unified standard").42 Ths move is a first important step in providing better incentives for
municipalities to increase access, improve quality, and optimize their school network.43 The new
financing system set four different financing standards for four different types of municipalities.
Figure 6 presents the groups and per student standards.                     The f u s t group consists of the
municipalities which have over (or equal to) 70,000 people in the municipal center.                            The

42 The term "unified standard" i s used in Bulgaria to describe the amount of money which municipalities receive per
student enrolled in their general education schools. "Unified" indicates that it combines both wage and non-wage
salaries in one amount. The amount, however, i s not uniform; it can take one of four values, varying by municipal
characteristics such as "mountainous", "large metropolitan urban area", "low population density" etc.

94.         A special budget allocation of BGN 35 million was introduced in 2007 for a
package of measures to support municipalities in the process of consolidating schools,
and a similar fund worth BGN 27 million is being set up for school year 2008. To access
t h i s financing in 2007 municipalities had to present detailed plans on how students in the closed-
down schools would be transported to and accommodated within remaining schools, to ensure
that school closures are carefully planned and discussed within communities.                         A similar
mechanism i s in place for the 2008 period. Financing i s awarded to municipalities based on the
number of students in closed schools and reduced number of classes. For closed schools with no
more than 20 pupils, a municipality will receive BGN 80,000; for schools with 20 to 44 students
BGN 150,000, and for schools with more than 44 pupils BGN 250,000. The main criteria are the
share of closed schools in total schools per municipality, the share of students in closed schools
in total students per municipality and share of reduced classes in total classes. The eligible
purposes for the usage of the funds are infrastructure investments - improvements inthe material
base of the school, including fucing up the building, additional class rooms, and improvements
and construction of school canteens. The funds do not cover subsidies for food inthe canteen or
other expenses which are already covered through different MES programs (e.g. transport). Fifty
percent of the funds are provided up front, upon agreement on the proposal and 50 percent after
the closure of the school. A database with a geographical mapping of settlements and schools

 across the entire country has been developed to determine which schools are too far away from
 the next school to ask pupils to commute -i.e.                           schools that need to be protected. So far 11 out
 of 28 regions have been reviewed and 20 schools identified -out of 1,200 schools. Using data
 from the NSI, the World Bank estimates that the number of school closures has risen
 considerably in recent years as showninTable 6.

 95.        To further minimize the risk that drop outs increase as a result of school closures
 (especially among vulnerable groups), a number of initiatives are planned for the school
year 2007/2008. Even though the analysis of previous school closures by the MES has not
 found evidence of drop outs increasingas a result of school closures, the acceleratingpace of the
consolidation process suggests that vigdance i s warranted. Therefore, the M i n i s t r y plans to
continue providing additional financing through the above mentioned package of measures in
2008 to minimize risks of lugher drop-outs throughout the period of school closures. The MOF
i s also considering requiring municipalities to demonstrate that measures have been taken to
target vulnerable groups.
96.         In 2008, the Government has begun implementing one of the two remaining
prongs of the finance and governance strategy -expanding delegated budgets to
municipal schools and kindergartens as well as State schools (i.e. ensuring a rule-based
funding scheme from municipalities to schools).44 The unified standard will help speed up
school consolidation which, in turn should help increase the currently low class sizes. However,
per capita fmancing to municipalities alone cannot be expected to achieve the objective of
improving use of resources at the school level and creating a governance system with better
incentives to lower drop out rates and improve the quality of education. The Government i s
working to ensure that education funds to municipalities are transferred onwards to schools ina
transparent and rule-based manner, i.e. through the use of "delegated budgets".45 According to


14 The   third pronginthe strategy, i.e. school based management, is planned for 2009.
45 Such   shift i s commonly referred to as expanding the use of "delegated budgets". However, there i s some confusion
regarding what "delegated budget" means in Bulgaria. The confusion arises from the fact that municipalities which
have experienced with "delegated budgets" have introduced them in very different ways. Bulgaria began introducing
delegated school budgets and school based management in the late 1990s (with EC support). B y 2006, about 40
municipalities out o f 264 had some form o f delegated school budgets. Since each municipality developed i t s own
system, there are substantial hfferences between them. However, a common feature is that budget delegation i s
lunited in practice, and the school director has discretion only over all or parts of the non-staff budget. In the few
instances where salaries are said to be delegated, it only means that the school manages the payment of salaries, not
the determination of the number o f staff or their salaries as these are determined by hlES regulations. The s h f t to a
delegated non-staff budget has been successful: municipalities and school directors consider their spendmg o n the
non-staff part of the budget more efficient than before. For further details on the evaluation of delegated school

                                                                       58

the 2008 Budget Act, municipalities allocate the education funds to their schools based on the
same formula as the municipality receives the funds (i.e. the unified standard). However, special
circumstances may warrant some departures from this general guidance (e.g. special needs of
disadvantaged students at a particular school may warrant more spending on a particular school,
or the expected closure of a school may also disrupt the basic fundingformula). According to the
Budget A c t the allocation rule i s to be based on municipal formulae, based on the unified
standard and the number of students and chddren in schools and kindergartens. Additional
components of the formula can be objective geographic and demographic factors that define
differences in expenlture for educating one student or factors that reflect national or local
educational policy. The number of staff and number of classes or groups cannot be used in the
 formula. FromJanuary 1, 2008, municipalities are required to pass on 100 percent of education
 financing from the central budget on to the schools. Out of this, 80 percent will be allocated
according to the number of students in each school, whde 20 percent can be reallocated across
schools inrecognition of special financing needs.
97.      Addition of N e w Prior Action. Inorder to assure continuity inthe implementationof
policies complementing the introduction of per student financing throughout the entire DPL
program, the incentive mechanism for school consolidation has been included ina new prior
action for DPL 11and a trigger for DPL 111.




                                        Pmposed newpriar action
    Government has maintained the package of measures and incentives to support the
              implementationof the unified standard and school consolidation
  Status: comdeted


98.      Medium term actions (DPL 111) and new areas of dialogue. DPL I11will focus on
implementing school-based management. With DPL Iand I1having introduced funding schemes
that provide better incentives to focus on quality, access and efficiency, the DPL I11wdl focus on
aligning the legislation governing education with the new financing system, and continue to train
planners and educators to operate within a decentralized system. Given that some municipalities
are further ahead than others, the third DPL will also have a chance to assess strengths and
weaknesses of the unified standard and delegated budgets and propose changes. Two possible
enhancements to the funding framework will be possible to consider by then, both of which seek
to align funding more closely with the ultimate objective sought by the education system:
producing the highest possible number of graduates with the desired level of competency. First,
with external assessment data available by then, it will be possible to consider linkingfunding to
learning outcomes. Second, with municipalities and school h e c t o r s more attuned to receiving
funding on a per capita basis, it will be possible to discuss linking fundmg to the number of
graduates instead of merely to enrollments. School based management would involve relaxing
the regulation governing class sizes and teacher work loads and shifting financial management of
the school to the principals, including responsibihty in hiring and firing of teachers and setting
salaries.

Mr.Robert Zoellick
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

1.      W e appreciate this opportunity to request continuing support from the World Bank for
the implementation of our medium term reform agenda and, on behalf of the Government of
Bulgaria, we request a Second Development Policy Loan (SIR DPL 11) for US $150 million
equivalent with a deferred drawdown option (DDO) to continue the series of three development
policy loans as per the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) between the World Bank and the
Republic of Bulgaria approved by the World Bank Board onJune 13th,2006. W e believe that this
series of development policy loans continues to provide the appropriate vehicle for Bank support
in addressing our medium term policy and institutional reform agenda, and in supporting the
country in its full integration into the European Union after the recent accession on January 1,
2007.

2.      Following completion of the measures from SIR DPL I,we are continuing to use the
support of the Bank for advancing the reforms inthe social sectors and SIR DPL I1continues to
focus on these sectors. The program i s consistent with the Country Partnership strategy and its
strategic areas:


        Raising productivity and employment in support of private sector-led growth
        along the lines of the EU's Lisbon Agenda: The three programmatic DPLs (FY07-
        09) will support the productivity and employment agenda by focusing on: (i) reform
                                                                                        the
        of the labor framework and social protection system to increase employment by lowering
        payroll taxes, reducing social assistance dependency, reforming l s a b h t y benefits, and
        increasing formal employment through more flexible work arrangements and better
        incentives to participate in the formal economy and (ii)    the reforms in the education
        sector to strengthen the institutional capacity to monitor and improve quality and
        increase accountability to lay the foundation for long-term productivity growth.


        Fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds: The DPL
        series wdl focus on improving the efficiency of the health, education, pension and social
        assistance systems to support their financial sustainabhty and effectiveness. In health,
        the focus wdl be on improving financial sustainability of the National Health Insurance
        Fund (NHIF), restructuring of the hospital sector, and improved efficiency in the
        pharmaceutical sector.    In education, the DPLs will support finance and governance

                                                65

         reforms that would help improve both the quality of education, and how efficiently the
         resources available for education are being used. The reforms in these sectors will also
         open windows of opportunity to utilize EU funds as new programs are being created or
         old programs reformed.

3.       Poverty reduction and social inclusion are not explicitly addressed in the DPL program
but many of its policies are expected to have an impact onpoverty.

4.       W e expect that at the end of the DPL series some positive outcomes will be achieved,
specifically (i) an increase in the employment rate of younger workers (15 to 24) to at least 25
percent and older workers (55 to 64) to at least 40 percent, (i) spending level for
                                                                    a sustainable
hospitals, (iii) a basic package of drugs available to the majority of the population and a faster
process to introduce new pharmaceutical products; and (iv) a more efficient school financing
mechanism.


5.       W e have maintained macroeconomic stability as a precondition for the effectiveness and
sustainabhty of the above program. W e will maintain the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA)
untilaccession to the Eurozone. The CBA has served Bulgaria well, providmga stable monetary
environment, contributing to low inflation, and boostingconfidence. W e are fully committed to
take all of the necessary steps to support it. W e will continue to implement a cautious and
flexible fiscal policy, which i s a key to safeguarding external viabhty under the CBA. W e have
aimed to reach, and then maintain, a broadly balanced fiscal stance in the medium term,
remaining prepared to adjust our fiscal policy in case of further widening of the external current
account deficit.


6.       In the course of implementing SIR DPL Iand while preparing SIR DPL 11, we have
developed and implemented various components of our reform program that will be completed
by the end of this series of three loans. The final design of SIR DPL I1 has benefited from a
strong monitoring and evaluation system, implemented in coordination with the Bank and built
during the preceding series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALS).This has enabled u s to
take actions necessary to ensure the sustained implementation of policies and the successful
outcomes of institution-buildmg efforts.        The programmatic approach of the PALS was
transferred to the DPLs as it provides u s with the flexibility to make sound adjustments in our
program and to b d d on new information and additional experience in institutional design and
implementation in moving towards the successful achievement of our strategic objectives and
program outcomes.


7.       This Letter of Development Policy summarizes the elements of our program supported
by SIR DPL I1and with expected follow up in DPL 3, w M e the reform program outcomes and
the critical steps taken to achieve those outcomes are summarized in the accompanying Matrix of
Performance Benchmarks and Desired Outcomes.


8.       The DPL overarching objectives related also to the Country's strategic priorities and the
approved CPS are:


Overarching Objective 1: Increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term
productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of
education

                                                 66

9.          Throughactions under this objective the DPL series will solve severalproblems.

 10.        First, Low employment, highpercentage oflong tenn unemployed and high rates
 of infonnafity in the labor market are an issue. Our government, through the Ministry of
Labor and Social Policy in particular, has started to implement policies under the flexicurity
framework in the context of rapidly falling unemployment and emerging labor shortages. After
amending the Labor Code in2006 to increase flexibility inworking conditions (working time and
fured and part-time contracts) and align it with the EU working time directive the Government
has implemented additional policies to reduce distortions and increase flexibility in the labor
market. The Government has implemented a further 3 percentage point decrease in social
insurance contributions. And, as of January 1, 2008 the Government reduced the share of the
employer in the public pension contribution to 60 percent and increased the share of the
employee to 40 percent. In order to reduce distortions to labor mobility over the medium term
the government has removed the portability of the seniority bonus by transforming it into a
bonus which recognizes professional experience in a certain area.        Following the results of an
impact evaluation of ALMPs, MLSP started restructuring the active labor market programs
(ALMPs) mix inthe 2006 and 2007 annual employment action plans to strengthen their focus on
on-the-job qualification and on linking training to private sector skill needs. The 2007 and 2008
Employment Action Plans restructure ALMPs further, placing additional emphasis on training
and improvingskills among the young, the old and those with low educational attainments.


11.         Second, we will tackle theproblem of the Social Welfare Program design creating
disincentives for job searching. Aiming to promote employment activation intimes of rising
labor demand at all levels of the skills distribution, the MLSP has introduced measures to tighten
eligibility of social assistance for working age individuals who are capable to work. The DPL
series i s not supportingthis policy but its ex ante assessment and impact evaluation, analyzing the
p r o f i e of the affected GMI beneficiaries and the reasons for staying unemployed in the long
term, so that the Government can make informed policy changes to the program in case of
negative welfare effect.      Based on the review of administrative data, the Employment Offices
have held interviews with every affected beneficiary and have developed individual action plans.

12.         By the end of the DPL Program, the expected outcomes are:

vii. An increase in the employment rate of younger workers to at least 25 percent (age 15-24,
     Eurostat data) from the 2005 basehe of 21.6 percent, with intermedate status (2006) of 23.2
     percent;
viii.An increase in the employment rate of older workers to at least 40 percent (age 55-64,
     Eurostat data) from the 2005 baseline of 34.7 percent, with intermediate status (2006) of 39.6
     percent;
ix. An increase in the activity rate of younger workers to at least 30 percent (age 15-24, Eurostat
     data) from the 2005 baseline of 27.9 percent, with intermediate status (2006) of 28.9 percent;
x. An increase in the activity rate of older workers to at least 45 percent (age 55-64, Eurostat
     data) from the 2005 baseline of 38 percent, with intermediate status (2006) of 43 percent;
xi. As an intermediate output that would result in a decrease in long term unemployment the
     relative share of individuals benefiting from training out of the total number of beneficiaries
     of active labor market programs increases, from the 2005 baseline of 19.4 percent with


                                                  67

     intermediate value of 26.5 percent (December 2007), as well as an increase in absolute
      numbers of beneficiaries of training programs; and
xii.Increaseincont+bution compliance in2006 (as a proxy for the incentive to job creation and
      reducing informality associated with the reduction in social security contribution rate by 6
     percentage points inJanuary 2006), evident in a lower actual decrease in contribution revenue
      (94.1 percent in 2006, 2005=100) compared to that implied by the rate cut (79.3 percent,
      2005=100) @ked to DPL Iaction).


13.        Third, we will address theproblem that quality of education has been declining
and the institutional capacity for quality assessment is Iacking. The strategy to improve
quality of education in Bulgaria consists of increasing training of educators, introducing modern
technologies in the curriculum, gathering data on performance, and building capacity at the MES
to assess quality and performance. The Government expects that improvingeducation will also
contribute inthe medium term to the goal of increasing productivity and skills of workers.


14.       The SIR DPL 2 will support our strategy to strengthen the Ministry of Education and
Science's (MES') institutional capacity to assess the impact of curricular and other reforms on the
quality of education. T h i s has the potential to radically switch priorities inpolicy making for the
education sector, bringing the quality of student learning to the top of the policy agenda. The
Centre for Control and Assessment of the Quality of Education (CKOKO) will institutionalize
and sustain the goals of an efficient, transparent, and outcome-oriented education system. The
DPL series will be supportingfour different testing activities inBulgaria: a) a new placement test
at the end of 7th grade which has the potential to radcally overhaul current patterns of student
access to upper secondary school; b) designing and pilotinga new Matura, i.e., secondary school-
leaving examination; c) new tests (sample or census-based) to be used strictly as system-wide
evaluation of education quality; and d) managing Bulgaria's participation in international
achievement tests. As part of DPL Iw e have approved a three-year plan for CKOKO, and our
Council of Ministers approved action plan for the implementation of the National Strategy for
the Introduction of InformationTechnologies inBulgarian Schools and begins implementation.

15.       By the end of the DPL Program, the expected outcomes are:

vi. Reports on Quality assessment prepared by CKOKO and made available to the public
     increase (from a baseline of 0 to a target of 5) (an intermediate output showing progress in
     buildingcapacity for quality assessment -and     ultimately improvingquality if the information
     i s used in critical ways)

viii.Placement of students inupper secondary institutions is done on the basis of objective ability
     testing (using the new 7th grade national test) (intermediate outcome that shows information
     i s used for quality improvements).

ix. Matura examination results are used by Bulgarian universities as credential for admission
     (showinginformation on quality is beingused critically)

x. The percentage of Regional Inspectorates and of newly appointed principals reporting that
     student assessment data (regional and school-level, respectively) are being used as one of the
     key factors to decide on staffing, budget allocation and innovation programs increases (from
     a baseline of 0 in2005 to a target of 60 percent)




                                                  68

xi. Schools principals have the capacity to manage schools as shown inthe number of principals
     receiving training

xii. 35 percent of subjects in the primary and secondary education curriculum have e-technology
     and multimedia content available to teachers and students.


Overarching objective 2: Promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in social
sectors


16.      Under this overarching objective we will address two main problems.

17.      First, the inefliciency in health serviceprovision and less than universalaccess to
care, as weU as threats to the financial sustainability in the National Health Insurance
system. Our Government initiated -with           support of DPL I- a series of actions to control
spendmg in hospitals. The government has introduced in the 2008 NHIF Budget A c t an
indicative ceiling in the budget of hospitals using historical figures and population needs. This
should control spending by hospitals and close the open ended nature of the budgeting system
used in the past. On the supply side, we are initiating measures to restructure the hospital sector
to adapt it to modern practices that rely more on outpatient, less expensive care. W e started a
hospital masterplanning exercise, which will propose new models for health care provision in
Bulgaria. It will estimate the ideal location of facilities, the type of services that should be
provided at each level, the organizational model for better management and accountability, and
the costs necessary to implement the network optimization program.          We also continued to
refine pharmaceutical policy in Bulgaria The new drug law approved in December 2006 and
supported by DPL I addresses technical, administrative, and economic aspects based on
European regulatory standards. The key by-laws for pricing and introduction of new drugs were
adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 2007.

18.      By the end of the DPL Series (2009), the expected outcomes are:
ix. Financial projections of spending and revenues show the health system is financially
     sustainable as proxied by decrease inarrears (percent of total NHIF budget); Baseline 2005:
     49 percent; value 2007: 26 percent; target: 25 percent
x. Percentage of payments to hospitals channeled through NHIF remains constant or increases.
     Baseline: 55 percent (January-December 2005); target: 80 percent; value 2007: 75 percent;
xi. The proportion of spending on outpatient care relative to inpatient care has increased by 5
     percent;

xii. With hospital spending under control the system becomes more efficient as shown by a
     convergence in inpatient admissions to the European average; average of EU in 2005: 18.03
     per 100 (inBulgaria 21);
xiii.Increase inefficiency throughchanges inpayment mechanisms to hospitals, as reflectedina
     decrease inaverage length of stay over time. In2006: 6.59; in 2007: 6.32

xiv.The percentage of the Bulgarian population reporting access to pharmaceuticals increases
     (MTHS shows that 66 percent of population had access to all the needed medcations in
    2007)
xv. NHIF data showing that pharmaceutical spendmg i s w i h budget and growing at a rate not
    higher than twice GDP growth. (2005-06 GDP growth: 6.1; pharmaceutical spending by
    NHIF:11.0; GDP growth2006-07: 6.4; pharmaceuticalspendmg: 10.3)
                                                 69

 19.      The secondproblem is that Currentgovernance and fmancing system for schools
provide only weakincentives tofocus on qualiq, drop-outrates, and efficiency of
 spending. As envisioned under the SIR DPL I, continued with the implementationof the
                                                    we
 financing reform in schools, and since January 1,2007 municipalities started to receive all funds
 to cover both salary and non-salary expenditures for general education inmunicipal schools on a
per student basis (as a "unified standard"). A special budget allocation of BGN 35 million was
introduced in2007 for a package of measures to support municipalities in the process of
consolidating schools, and a s d a r fund worth BGN 27 d o n i s being set up for school year
2008. To further minimize the risk that drop outs increase as a result of school closures
 (especially of vulnerable groups), a number of initiatives are planned for the school year
2007/2008. In2008, we have begun implementing one of the two remaining prongs of the
 finance and governance strategy -expanding      delegated budgets to municipal schools and
kindergartens as well as State schools (i.e. ensuring a rule-based fundingscheme from
municipalities to schools).

20.      By the end of the DPL Series (2009),the expected outcomes are:
v. Increased efficiency as shown by halting the decreasing trend inpupil-teacher ratio inpublic
     schools (for grades 1-12) observed since 2002. That is, the pupil-teacher ratio remains
     roughly unchanged at its 2006 level (13.1).
vi. Increased efficiency as shown by improvements in average drop-outs as a percent of total
     enrolments in small mountainous municipalities (proxies for regions that struggle with largest
     declines inpopulation) (frombaseline of 3.7, 5.1 and 4.2 percent for grades 1-4, 5-8 and 9-12,
     respectively, in2005)
vii. Percent of municipal education budget delegated to schools increases (frombaseline of 0 to
     target of 100 percent; value 2006-2007: 80 percent)
v i .Percent of municipal schools financed through unified standard increases (frombaseline of 0
     to target of 100percent; value 2007/2008: 100percent)


21.      W e would like to reiterate that the Bulgarian Government i s committed to continuing
reforms and, inparticular, to sustaining and continuing the reform agenda needed for the full
integration into the EUas defined above, now that Bulgaria i s a member of the Union. A new
government program has just been drafted and adopted by the Government coalition partners,
which further defines the specific actions inthe months ahead. W e look forward to the World
Bank`s support to Bulgaria inits development program including through development policy
loans focusing on the future reform agenda for successful integration into the EU.

 ANNEX 6: POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT ofDPLI1SUPPORTEDPOLICIES

 101.     The health sector reforms should contribute to increasing access to basic care
 through the new pharmaceutical policy. The new pricing and registration should lower
 the price of drugs by setting a mechanism to reference prescription drug prices based on the
 lowest price across other countries in Europe that have already achieved low drug prices.
 However, the new procedures are also expected to increase the speed of introductio-
 drugs in the market, w h c h tend to have higher prices. The final effect on overall spendmg
 in drugs is thus ambiguous but it is expected that basic drugs, whch are not based on new
 technologies, should ingeneral become cheaper and more affordable. The recent household
 survey provides information on the accessibhty of pharmaceuticals that should serve as a
 basehe. Even though there are differences across consumption quintiles, it seems that
 accessibility i s not a major problem (less             than 2 percent of those who needed melcation
 were not able to afford them).               However there i s significant room for improvement. In
 addition, the new regulations also changed the procedure to determine the State
 reimbursement policy, grouping products according to the therapeutic value, prioritizing the
 therapeutic groups that have higher socio-economic value for higher rates of state
 reimbursement. Together, these measures allow for the state to increase the cost-benefit of
 i t s spending and set up the necessary conditions for patients to receive prescriptions for the
 cost-effective pharmaceuticals.4~These actions will need to be supplemented with measures
 aimed at changing the behavior of the patients (i.e. trusting generics) and of prescribing
physicians (i.e. being motivated to follow the best prescribing guidelines) in order to have
 the most positive impact. Since the first reimbursement list following the new guidelines will
be effective inApril 2008, its effect cannot be s t u l e d und2009.50

102.      The policy actions which aim at increasing sustainability of the health system
by changing the hospital payment method (from an open-ended fee-for-service
model to a model with a limited financial commitment) is not intended to restrict
necessary hospitalizations. As mentioned before, there is an indication of large increases
in hospitalizations during 2007, but there has been no significant demographic or

introduction of these policy changes.
so April 2008 i s the earliest date it will go into effect. D u e to the effort that will need to be taken to establish a
new drug list according to the new procedures, the April 2008 may be delayed until end-2008. In which case,
the policy willgo into effect in 2009.

epidemiological change in the morbidity profile of the population that could explain such
increase alone. The increase in hospitalizations i s largely a reaction of the health providers
to both sustain their official and possibility for unofficial income, especially given that the
national health insurance expenditures are being spread to an increasing number of
providers. According to NHIF data between 2000 and 2007 hospital admissions increased
about 26 percent and spending increased by 964 percent in real terms.              Many of those
services being provided could be handled on an outpatient basis which i s both more
affordable and safer for the ~atient.5~In fact, as Table 9 shows most people seek care
outside hospitals. The NHIF will maintain reserve funds in 2008 and will be monitoring
providers to ensure that access i s not unreasonably denied to patients, given the change
limiting the financial commitment to hospitals. The current structure of the hospital system
also does not serve the population, with too many acute beds and an insufficient supply of
long-term ~ a r e . 5 ~The open-ended access to the Bulgarian hospital market i s also not
conducive to proper patient care. The Masterplan being developed would set guidehes for
restructuring hospitals with attention to the needs of populations in dfferent regons of the
country, ensuring that appropriate services of good quality are within reasonable geographic
access to the patients. Access to care by the vulnerable groups will be monitored.

103.      The preliminary analysis of the household survey shows that about 90 percent
of the population has health insurance, with variation across quintiles from 78 to 96
among the poorest and richest respectively. About 96 percent of individuals are also
enrolled with a primary care physician (between 90 and 97 percent in the poorest and richest
quintiles respectively). According to the survey data two issues of concern do not seem to
be sipficant: first, the incidence of informal payments i s rather small, and the amounts paid
are also small as percentage of total out of pocket; second, the health insurance system
seems to be doing an effective job at protecting individuals against catastrophc payments.
One way to assess this i s to look at the percentage of people who fall into poverty as a result
of out of pocket payments in health. About 70 percent of the population declared having
made out of pocket payments for health during the last 12 months (40 percent in the last
month), paying approximately BGNlOO during the year (about BGN15 in the last month).
But less than 1percent of those declared having made informalpayments. This information
i s preliminary and has to be validated by cross-checks with other questions in the survey and
other upcoming studies on informal payments in the health sector, therefore it should be
treated with caution. Regarding the impoverishing effect of health care, depending on the
assumptions, between half a percent and two percent of the population i s estimated to have
fallen into poverty as a result of out of pocket payments for health. This suggests that more
could be done to protect certain groups against the impact of catastrophic payments for
health. The MTHS should provide details on the characteristics of the individuals who fall
into poverty due to out of pocket payments so that adequate interventions can be designed.

 104.     The main poverty and social impact risk in the Government's education
reform program is that drop outs of disadvantagedstudents could increase as a result
of school closures. The changes supported under in the finance and governance reforms
provide better incentives to municipal officials to improve the efficiency of spendmg by
merging classes within schools and/or merging schools.53 Indeed, prelirmnary evidence for
2006 and 2007 suggest that municipalities are responding to the incentives embedded in the
new financing system and are closing down schools at a faster past than in previous years
 (see Table 6).     In theory, a school closure could either raise or lower drop outs. On the
positive side, the closure frees up additional resources for the municipality to spend on
improvingthe overall quality of the schools inthe municipality, helping to lower the risk that
students leave. On the negative side, the closure of a school disrupts the life of students,
teachers and parents and for disadvantaged students - already at high risk of dropping out -
and the disruption may be the tipping point. Moreover, the closure usually implies that
students would have to travel further and incur a higher cost of transportation (if not in
monetary terms, at least in terms of a longer time period spent away from home).

105.     The key question is whether there are adequate measures in place to ensure
that drop outs do not rise         -especially        of the most vulnerable          -as    a result of these
closures. The PSIA assessed this in two ways: first, the PSIA reviewed the measures
currently in place to prevent such rise. Second, given that school closures have taken place at
different pace across Bulgaria, historical data was used to examine whether there i s an
association between school closures and drop 0uts.54 The information available on dropouts
across Bulgaria suggests that the country i s well-equipped to handle an accelerated pace of
school closures. First, historical data for the past 6 years - a period where almost 200 general
education schools were closed (out of around 3,000)-                  suggests that other factors beyond
school closures have more of a correlation with drop outs. More likely, ethnicity and poverty


j3 Under the new system, municipalities receive all funds for education based o n a per capita formula (as
opposed to pre-2007 where only maintenance expenditures were on a per capita formula). Thus, municipalities
have an incentive to use their teaching workforce optimally (i.e. strive to get as large classes as possible, within
the class size norms). Merging class within a school i s one way to do so. However, this option i s usually only
available in schools beyond a certain size. The only way to get larger class sizes in smaller schools i s to
introduce multi-grade teaching or merge schools.
54 Obviously, when examining such relationship, other factors that could explain differences in   drop outs across
districts- such as differences inpoverty rates, differences inethnic composition of population, etc - had to be
controlled for.

are more important underlying factors for chtldren dropping out of school in Bulgaria, a
hypothesis supported by data on years of completed schooling by ethnicity and drop outs
(see Figure 7). Second, more than a decade of declining student numbers has generated
experience inmunicipalities across the country in d e a h g with the problem.

106.     Historical data on school closures show that districts with relatively more
school closures do not seem to have relatively higher drop outs. For the analysis, a rich
data set was created by combining two household surveys - one from 2003 and one from
2007 and covering a total of more than 20,000 individuals - with information on schools
obtained from the National Statistical Institute's annual census of schools. The data were
used to examine whether districts that had closed down relatively many schools were more
likely to have a larger proportion of the sampled population in the age group 10-16 not in
scho01.5~Given that "the proportion of the sampled population in the age group 10-16 not
in school" is an imprecise measure of drop-outs, the analysis was also done using an
alternative - but also imperfect - measure of drop outs, namely, principals' reported number
of students leaving school.56 This analysis shows no association between schools closures
and drop outs. Figure 8 shows a scatter plot with the extent to which districts closed schools
on one axis, and a measure of drop-outs on the other axis. Each dot in the figure represents
a district, with every district being represented twice: once for the period 2003 and once for
2007 (with school closures being measured between the 2003 and 2000 for 2003 and
between 2005 and 2003 for the 2007 data point). The figure shows that there i s no obvious



55To be precise, for each of Bulgaria's 28 districts, the number of schools in2003 was compared to 2000, and
the number of schools in2005 was compared to 2000. The variable examined was the percentage change in the
number of general education schools between 2003 and 2000 and 2005 and 2003 for each of the 28 districts.
Thus, a total of 56 data points were obtained.
56The reason why this i s also an imperfect measure i s that, potentially, the student leaving one school could
reappear in another school.

association between the two: districts that drastically reduced their number of general
education schools managed to do so with virtually all of its 10-16 years in schools, and
districts that did have a relatively low share of its 10-16 year olds in school were not
necessarily those that reduced the number of schools the most. This result was conflrmed
using a regression analysis, examining the statistical relationship between the two variables,
and taking into account that districts across Bulgaria differ in important dunensions that
could potentially impact the extent to which youngpeople are in school.57

107.      Education officials at both the central and municipal level have gained
significant experience from school closures during the past decades, and are
incorporating the lessons into policies. In some instances, municipalities had to close
downmore than half of their schools duringthe past decade, and officials bothat the central
and municipal level gained important experience inthe process. Reflecting these experiences,
the process of closing down a school i s fairly elaborate and a number of safeguard measures
are built into the process. For instance, a school closure proposal has to include a discussion
of how transportation of students affected will be addressed. Moreover, to aid policy makers,
Bulgaria has a relatively sophisticated education management information system that allows
the ministry to track the enrollment of individual students (i.e. it i s a data base where every
student has an ID and i s tracked, as opposed to EMIS systems where only the sum of
students enrolled at a particular school i s tracked). Finally, anticipating that the number of




57h multivariate OLS regression was run with the share of the 10-16 year olds in school as the dependent
variable and the change in the number of schools as a regressor. In adhtion, a number of district characteristics
were included: share of population living in municipal centers, share of population of being Roma, share of
population being Turkish, change in population size of district, district poverty rate, number of settlements,
population density, and average student-teacher ratio.

school closures would increase, MES and MOF agreed to earmark addtional funds to
municipalities undertalung a school closure as described inSection V.

108.    The main poverty and social impact risk in the Government's social
protection reform program stems from the tightening of eligibility for Guaranteed
Minimum Income (GMI), with a cancellation of eligibility for able bodied working age
individuals after 18 months of benefit receipt, with ineligibility for the following 12 months.
The DPL program i s not supportingthe policy change, but an assessment of its impact, as a
prior action in DPL2.         Accordmg to this agreement the National Statistical Institute
conducted a survey of affected beneficiaries in March-April 2008. I t s results were taken and
will be taken into consideration in on-going adjustment of the programs offered to affected
beneficiaries by the EA as well as the service provision.The survey looked at the following:

1.      pmjle ofthe bent$ciay - age, gender, educational level, health status, work experience,
        family status, number of dependents;

11.     ethnicpmjleof the affected beneficiaries;

lll. residentialcharacteristicsoftheaffectedbeneficiaries(urban/rural);
...

IV.     reasonsfor being on soezal assistance, period(s) duringwhich the social assistance has been
        received, level of the received GMI benefit, supplement of GMI by other individual
        benefits and/or payments (e.g., unemployment benefit, survivors' pension, stipend),
        etc.

V.      pmjle  of the   beneJciaries'families and /or households - number, age, gender and
        employment status of family/household                members, urban vs rural location,
        educational and health status, number of children, retired or family members with
        disabilities, incomes, consumption, etc.

vi.     simulation  of how the weyare status    of thehousehold would change if the GMI support i s
        stopped for (a) the individual beneficiary for 12 months; @) the whole household for
        12 months;

Vii.    assessment ofthe expected coping strategieswith respect to the policy measure - activation
        (joining the labor market), going into the informal economy, opting for disability
        pension, continuing to rely on social assistance, reliance on intra-household or
        extended family transfers, etc.; and

Viii.   stub  of the  reasons w b the afected GMI reGipients do not enter the labor market - hgh
        reservation wage, disincentives to work related to the level of the benefit, the level of
        wage, taxation, etc., low s k d s and qualification, lost habits to work and other reasons
        which make the person unemployable.

109.    A preliminary analysis of this policy in the context of DPL 2 preparation suggests
that (i)the majority of GMI beneficiaries are poor and highly vulnerable across a number of
dimensions, which makes their true activation - as opposed to merely canceling their
benefit and placing them in public works programs -a sizable challenge, (ii)         the loss of the
GMI benefit is substantially deepening the already deep poverty among beneficiaries, but
adds relatively little to the poverty headcount; (iii) activation measures, if effective, could
                                                         the
get individuals out of poverty by raising their chances inthe labor market and thus increasing
their potential earnings in excess of the benefit; and (iv) the EA needs to focus on
developing effective activation mechanisms with close monitoring of beneficiaries and

 enhanced cooperation with the social assistance offices and community based organizations
and specialized service providers. The following paragraphs explore these issues.
 110.     Beneficiaries of GMI, despite receiving the benefit, are a specifically
vulnerable group. The analysis in this section is based on data from the Multi-Topic
Household Survey (MTHS) which was conducted in the spring of 2007.58MTHS data
presented in Figure 9 shows that the poverty incidence among GMI beneficiaries, despite
the benefit, remains very high, with a poverty rate among GMI beneficiaries of 55.5 percent,
compared to 9.4 percent for those not on GMP. In addition to the simple headcount
measure of poverty, which does not indicate whether all poor are equally poor, we estimate
the poverty gap which reveals how far below the poverty h e people are. Whde the poverty
gap for non-beneficiaries, at 2.1 percent, i s low, the gap for GMI beneficiaries i s a deep 16.3
percent. Remarkably, the poverty gaps for both beneficiary and non-beneficiary Roma are
staggering. Poverty severity, closely related to the poverty gap but giving a higher weight to
those further away from the poverty line, i s 6.2 percent for GMI beneficiaries compared to
0.7 for non-beneficiaries, Moreover, more than 80 percent of GMI recipients reported
difficulties with meeting food, clothes and heating needs respectively, compared to between
30 and 40 percent among those not on the benefit. Close to 40 percent of GMI beneficiaries
reported they have unpaid bds. Table 10 shows average characteristics of GMI beneficiaries
based on the MTHS. It reveals that GMI beneficiaries live in larger households with more
adults on average and tend have more than double the number of children than non-
beneficiaries. At the same time, they reside inmore precarious housing- smaller living space
and fewer rooms. Almost 35 percent have no hot water, close to 50 percent have a leaking
roof and 40 percent have broken windows.

111.    MTHS analysis suggests that activating GMI beneficiaries will be a sizable
challenge, owing to their specific vulnerabilities and characteristics. Specifically, the
majority of GMIbeneficiaries:

   are from the Roma minokp. According to the MTHS, 74.5 percent of the respondents
   reporting to receive GMI were Roma, compared to 9.6 percent ethnic Turkish and 15
   percent ethnic Bulgarian. Experience from Bulgaria and other countries in the region
   indlcates that the exclusion faced by Roma i s typically so profound that it requires
   specifically designed interventions to promote access of long-term unemployed and
   welfare recipient Roma to the labor market.

   have low educational attainment. More than 80 percent of surveyed beneficiaries have
   primary education or less. This suggests that activation interventions through the EA will
   have to focus on basic training, including literacy, as well as skills upgrading components
   of subsidized employment programs.

   are long-tern unemployed and a sixeable share are outside the laborforce. 66.7 percent of surveyed
   GMI beneficiaries who are unemployed reported to have been unemployed for more
   than 12 months, compared to 47.8 percent of those unemployed not receiving the GMI.
   While 20 percent of GMI beneficiaries reported to be working, almost a third reported
   not being part of the labor force.

 112.      At the same time, many GMI beneficiaries appear to have only had limited
exposure to the Employment Agency prior to the introduction of the "18 month rule".
According to data from the MTHSGO, percent of respondents who consider themselves
                                                     27.4
part of the labor force and who reported receiving GMI stated they were not registered at
the Employment Office (EO). That was caused by a regulatory exemption from the rule for
compulsory nine-month registration at the Employment Office (EO). It referred to the
following categories of persons: parents looking for a chdd up to the accomplishment of the
third year of life; dsabled persons with working capacity reduced by 50 and above 50
percent; persons, taking care for a seriously ill family-member or co-habiiing person;
mentally diseased persons; persons above the age of 18, who attend the regular form of
education in a school of the national secondary educational system and secondary vocational
schools. For any other beneficiaries of the program, the uninterruptedregistration at the EO
i s a precondition for social assistance entitlement. It could be concluded that the prevading
part of GMI-beneficiaries under the program did maintain their EO-registration solely for
the purpose of entitlement without to seek actively a job, including involvement in training
and retrainingG1,because before the amendment, the Social Assistance Act provided for the

113.       While the majority of affected beneficiaries will go onto training and
subsidized job programs, the biggest risk of the measure is faced by those
beneficiaries who drop out altogether from the EA or who were not registered in the
first place. Subsidized job programs typically offer minimum wage plus social security
contributions, therefore, not making beneficiaries and families worse off. To date, the
numbers of drop-outs have remained low, as explained in paragraph 74 (1,742 between
September and October and 1,222 between October and November 2007, together



6o T h e MTHS was conducted in the springof 2007 and prior to the EA'Sengagement of all individual affected
GMIbeneficiaries afterJuly 2007.
61 Out of 74 individuals, 10 have been offered a job by the EO, of which 9 took the job. In addition, 2 were
offered trainingand found a job afterwards.


                                                         86

 amounting to about 10 percent of the initial number of 29,954 affected beneficiaries). The
 EA is not tracking the profie or destination of such beneficiaries, and it is not clear to what
 extent their drop-off i s due to finding employment in the labor market or other reasons.
The DPL2 dialogue with the MLSP, EA and the S A A have focused on the development of
improved administrative data management to allow traclung beneficiaries as well as increased
 collaboration of S A A and EA at the local level.
 114.       The loss of GMI risks raising the poverty level further for those who drop out
 of the EA before they re-qualify for GMI and do not participate in training or
subsidized employment. Simulations using MTHS data presented in Table 11 show that
the loss of benefit will increase the poverty headcount by almost 5 percentage points 62.
However, more importantly, the loss of benefit will substantially further deepen poverty
among current GMI beneficiaries - it will add 10 percentage points to the poverty gap
overall. GMI on average represents 17.6 percent of household consumptionG3.

115.        The effectiveness of the "18 month rule" in activating beneficiaries into the
labor market with minimal adverse social impact will depend on the interaction of
social work interventions and EA activation programs. As shown, GMI beneficiaries in
working age face multiple and mutually reinforcing vulnerabilities. For example, experience
from Bulgaria and other countries in the region suggests that Roma long-term unemployed
often face particularly severe forms of social exclusion and isolation, often necessitating a
tailored      approach in partnership with community-based organizations                              to act      as
intermediaries between public services and the beneficiary. Effectively addressing these will
require a complex approach. With a majority of affected f a d e s likely to remain partly on
GMI, covering the second adult and the children, should family income remain below the




62 N o t e that the biggest poverty increase applies for    GMI beneficiaries of the Turkish minority. Interestingly,
the GMI beneficiaries of the Turkish minority are less poor than those not receiving benefits. The reverse i s
true for both ethnic Bulgarians and ethnic Roma.
63The average amount of GMI per adult equivalent for GMI beneficiary households was BGN 30.9, while the
average amount of for individual GMI recipients was BGN 47.5. The eligibility threshold for GMI per adult i s
BGN 55.


                                                            87

threshold even after the first adult's activation, the local Social Assistance Offices (SAO) will
have a key role following up on cases of beneficiary drop-off.

116.    The employment policy reform supported by the DPL program -namely
shifting ALMPs from simple subsidized employment towards more training and
qualification-focused program mix- is not expected to have any adverse social or
poverty effects. As levels of remuneration for participation on ALMPs do not vary between
those with and without a training and qualification focus, the change of the program mix i s
therefore not leading to income changes for beneficiaries. The greater availability of private
sector-run subsidized employment and training i s expected to have a greater effect in
promotingthe employability in the primary labor market of job seekers, and to reduce their
reliance on subsidized public works programs. Improved primary labor market access for the
less disadvantagedjob seekers as well as continued availability of subsilzed employment for
those with limited or no chances in the primary labor market represents a net welfare
enhancement from the perspective of the currently regstered long-term unemployed job
seekers.

 ANNEX 7: FIDUCIARYASPECTS

 Budgetformulation

 117.     The 2003 CFAA noted that budgeting with a medium term outlook and program
 budgeting was at an early stage of development. Since 2003 the budget document has
 addressed many of these concerns and now includes (a) macro-economic assumptions
 underpinning the budget; (b) a three year tax policy; (c) a proposed national expenlture
 policy; and (d) a public debt policy with forecasts of payments due. The Government also
progressively implemented program budgeting to comprise 10 ministries in 2006. Currently
 all line ministries and state agencies (First Level Spendmg Units) develop their budgets and
report on their execution in programme format. Capital budgets are fully integrated into
 these program budgets. Performance indicators and targets are also published for all line
ministries and are included in the budget documents presented to the National Assembly.
The Ministry of Finance has developed and implemented a system that would allow for
recording, monitoring and reporting of all capital expenditures and a Strategic Investments
Divisionhas been established to coordinate investment policy inthe public sector. With the
L a w on the State Budget for 2006 for the first time appropriation of funds by policy areas by
parliament has been introduced. With Council of Ministers Decree on the implementation of
the State Budget for the respective year appropriation of FLSU's expenditures by line
ministres'/agencies' programmes has been introduced. The Government i s in the process of
developing a new Public Finance Budget A c t which will supersede the Organic Budget L a w
and regulate the consolidated fiscal program, including new fiscal regulations related to state
financial statistics, budget accounts and internal control.

Budget execution,including cash and debt managemen2
118.      Overall the CFAA concluded that the systems and processes of cash management
and treasury worked well and broadly in conformity with modern practices. The process of
integrating the BGN-denominated budget accounts of the Central Government into the
SEBRA system has been by and large finalized with the inclusion of the Supreme Julcial
Council in 2005. In this way, the main objective of the reform within the payments system
for the central budget supported sector - the centralization of cash management within the
single account and the rationalization of the payment processes by means of concentrating
all payments within the structure of the respective first level budget spender via SEBRA, as
well as through the implementation of an integrated expenltures control by means of the
introduction on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of spendmg ceilings for the payments
made through the BNB accounts of the first level budget spenders. The h k a g e between the
cash management system and the management of debt has been improved thanks to the
organizational transformation of the structure of the Ministry of Finance related to the
creation of the State Treasurer function, which integrates the responsibilities involved both
inStateTreasury management andinpublic debt management.


Public sector accounting and reporting

119.     The proposed strategy of the Government for FMIS development had been to
develop a financial management information system, using SAP R/3 ERP software. The
complexity of the project was under-estimated and in the end a less ambitious approach has
been undertaken to set more realistic goals for the achievement of which adequate resources



                                                89

and staff have been ensured. Further to that and in view of continuing changes in the legal
framework in the course of the strategy implementation a decision was made to initially
introduce the project in the whole system of the Ministry of Finance and those line
ministries, that have relation to the accounting information, related to the management of
EU financial instruments. As a result the FMIS as an internet based system was introduced
in MoF , all second level spending units to the Minister of Finance, all EU PHARE and
ISPA Implementing Agencies, all Managing Authorities of the Operational Programmes
under the EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund, as well as all territorial offices of the
National Revenue Agency. The line ministries were allowed to develop their own accounting
systems although the Government's goal remains the development of an integrated FMIS,
the realization of which i s subject to upcoming projects

 Internal controland internal audit

120.     The CFAA reported that the structural reforms were at an early stage and identified a
number of key steps to be taken in the areas of financial internal controls and public sector
internal audit. Bulgaria made changes in the Public Internal Financial Control framework
through the introduction of three new Acts in consultation with the EC, with supporting
guidelines, which cover financial management and control, internal audit and financial
inspection at all levels of Government. The new legislative framework introduced managerial
accountability, with specific responsibilities for the heads of public sector organizations and
a wider interpretation of financial management and control applicable to all managers. The
internal audit function i s now completely decentralized to the budget units. Functional
independence i s assured through the internal audit function reporting to the management/
line minister. An Internal Control Directorate has been established in the MoF (consisting of
Central Harmonization Units for financial management control and internal audit). Training
and capacity building continues with all internal audtors required to be certified by Juli
2008.

External audit

121.    The CFAA noted that the National Audit Office (NAO) submits its reports to the
National Assembly, and had adequate operational independence, resources and staff.
Bulgaria amended in 2004 the S P 4 audit act, further harmonizing the Bulgarian external
audit legal framework with current EU practice. The NAO has also made a number of other
changes to improve its methodology and approach to its work including new manuals, audit
standards and budding a clearer and more coherent relationships with inspection and
oversight agencies in Government. The NAO i s currently finalizing i t s strategc long term
plan which will be submitted to the National Assembly shortly. The focus of future capacity
building efforts from the UK NAO will be on fraud and corruption and the audt of EU
Funds.


Procurement


122.    A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was submitted to the Government in
July 2004 which concluded that the environment for conducting public procurement in the


64SP - Smetna Palata -Bulgarian NationalAudit Office


                                                  90

country was high risk. This CPAR has informed PAL-3 and DPL preparation, specifically,
the regulatory framework for public procurement has been improved under PAL-3, and the
government has made good progress in the initial implementation of the CPAR action plan.
Bulgaria has adopted a new public procurement law (effective as of July 1, 2006) with the
objective of being fully aligned with the EU acquis. Since July 1, 2006, the Public
Procurement A c t has been enforced and it i s aligned with all European duectives with
regard to public procurement. All the by laws have been in force since the above stated
date: Manual for the implementation of the Public procurement Act, Ordinance for the
award of special public procurement, Ordinance for the award of small public procurement.
Model tender documents are being used under Regulation 2005/1564 of the EC. There i s
an operational Public Procurement Register, where all the info of public procurement i s
available. The Regster i s public and the access to it i s free.



Foreign exchangeenvironment


123.    The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB)
in 2002 and found that safeguards are generally adequate. The 2004 follow up assessment
carried out by the IMF concluded that further progress had been made in strengthening the
overall safeguards framework of the BNB. Recommendations by the IMF were promptly
addressed by the BNB. Significant developments included:

    BNB's frnancial statements have beenimprovedand earlier qualifications e h a t e d .

9   The internal audit function has been significantly strengthened, its scope of operations
    has been widened and a risk- based methodology has been introduced.

    Foreign reserves management has been strengthened, including the adoption of detailed
    investment guidehes and the establishment of risk analysis and control capabhties.

    Furthermore, accounting functions have been further automated and procedures
    manuals have been completed for a number of activities.

Overall, the 2004 Safeguards Assessment report concluded that the risk was low. The
BNB's audited financial statements, together with the audit opinion are published in the
BNB's annual report and on the BNB website. The au&t reports for the last 6 years (2001-
2006) have unqualified opinions. Past audits and the positive assessment by the IMF
indicates that there are no additional fiduciary safeguards considered necessary as far as
management of the foreign exchange i s concerned.

ANNEX 9: IMFRISKASSESSMENT

B o x 4   Bulgaria:External Stability RiskAssessment

      IMFStaffestimates of the equilibrium current-account deficit center around 8 percent
of GDP:
       The macroeconomic balance approach, based on panel data for 38 industrial and
transition countries for 1992-2006, suggests that Bulgaria's current-account deficit normi s
somewhat above 5 percent of GDP. However, this estimate i s backward-looking and might
underestimate the sustainable current-account deficit ina setting of globalized frnancial
markets and EUconvergence.
       External sustainability considerations based on stabilizing the net international
investment position (IIP) at a medium-term level of about 80 percent of GDP, but ignoring
EUcapitalgrants, pointto a sustainable current-account deficit of about 8 percent of GDP.
       Bulgaria i s likely to receive EU capital grants amounting to about 2 percent of GDP,
and the sustainable current-account deficit could be correspondingly higher as these grants
will not add to Bulgaria's external Liabilities.

      Notwithstanding the presently large current-account deficit relative to equilibrium, the
real effective exchange rate appears fairly valued:
       Different measures of Bulgaria's real effective exchange rate have all appreciated over
recent years, but the pace of appreciation has been inline with experiences in other
transition economies.
       Purchasing-power-parity and dollar wage-cost comparisons inindustry across
countries also yield no strong evidence of overvaluation.
       Estimates of the real equilibrium exchange rate (CPI based) as a function of relative
productivity and the net foreign asset position during 1996-2006 indicate that the actual real
exchange rate has appreciated largely inh e with the estimated equilibrium real exchange
rate.
       Recent export volume growth (11percent during 2004-06) remained solid, and export
market shares have increasedinall major export destinations. However, a constant market
share analysis at SITC l-digit product level indicates some erosion of competitiveness
relative to other low- and middle-income countries during 200605, albeit coming on the
back of large gains during 2001-03

Re: SecondSocial Sectors Institutional ReformDevelopmentPolicyLoan
     (SIR DPL2) Type of Loan
                   -

DEARMR. FICHTL,

In connection with the forthcoming negotiations on the Second Social Sectors Institutional
Reform Program Development Policy Loan (SIR DPL 2), we would like to inform you with
the present letter about the preferred option with respect to the terms of the future loan.
Having in mind the recent improvements of the borrowing instruments offered by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and our current fiscal
position, we consider the Deferred Drawdown Option @DO) to be the most suitable
instrument for the purposes of SIR DPL 2.

Our decision to apply thls option with respect to the Second Social Sectors Institutional
Reform Program Development Policy Loan (SIR DPL 2) i s dictated by several fundamental
factors, most significant among which are the fiscal surplus achieved during the last several
years and the accumulation of a considerable fiscal reserve. The hgher levels of the fiscal



                                            97

reserve permit a more flexible debt planning and management in the short term and in the
medium term perspective. On the other hand, the Deferred Drawdown Option will ensure
our prompt access to borrowed funds whenever necessary to secure liquidity in the future,
while it will also provide the opportunityto continue our fruitful cooperation with the World
Bank. T h i s option will guarantee the continuation of the constructive political dialogue
between the Bank and the Bulgarian authorities in a longer-term perspective by means of
committing the international financial institution with the monitoring of the sequencing of
the implementation of the agreed social sphere policies withm a stable macroeconomic
environment.

The current economic situation in Bulgaria, as well as the established medium term fiscal
goals do not presume an immediate need of borrowed funds, but Bulgaria appreciates very
highly the Bank's expertise and would like to be able to use it inthe future, as well as to have
the opportunity for an immediate access to liquidityin case of need.

Inconnection with the advance clarification of the financial terms of the SIR DPL 2 loan in
case of using the deferred drawdown option @DO), we attach a completed form of the
Worksheet for Loan Choices, which will be finally confirmed by u s during the forthcoming
official negotiations. W e propose that the loan should be EUR denominated, with an initial
preference for a 17-year maturity, including a five-year grace period and level repayments
with respect to the principal, with variable spread interest-rate and with advance payment of
the front-end fee from our own proceeds.
