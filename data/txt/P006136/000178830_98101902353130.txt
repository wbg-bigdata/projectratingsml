REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF IBRD TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
structural adjustment loan to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent
of US$50 million. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 8.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on Bolivia" (No. 2195-BO)
dated November 3, 1978, was distributed to the Executive Directors. A number
of economic missions have visited Bolivia since then to review current develop-
ments and to discuss policy measures with the Government. Annex I contains
the basic country data.
Background
3.        Up to 1952, Bolivia's economic structure had only changed slowly
since independence in 1812. The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the
colonial structure that shaped Bolivia's economy, and to deprive the landown-
ing and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This objective was partially
achieved. Progress was made in eradicating feudal relations, distributing the
land more equitably and mitigating obstacles to social mobility, notably
through an impressive effort in primary education. The agrarian reform and
the nationalization of large mines, however, were followed by falling produc-
tion and declining GDP throughout the 1950s. During the subsequent decade,
output increased steadily at an average annual rate of about 5%, and real GNP
per capita recovered to its 1952 level by 1970.
4.        In spite of substantial economic progress during the early seventies,
Bolivia remains one of the poorest countries in South America. The majority
of its population is engaged in traditional agriculture in the inhospitable
Altiplano, a 3,000 to 4,000 meter high plateau. The economic infrastructure
is still primitive and the road and rail network reach only a fraction of the
country. The relatively slow growth of rural population (1.9% per annum)
reflects the low health and nutrition standards which prevail. Life expectancy
for Bolivia is 52 years, a full decade below South American standards.
The Current Economic Crisis
5.        Bolivia's current economic problems stem in large measure from
the consequences of unfulfilled expectations. The increase in world energy
and metal prices in 1973, together with indications of sizeable petroleum and



- 2 -
gas deposits in the country, created an atmosphere of euphoria and great
expectations.  The Government, anticipating substantial increases in financial
resources from sales of hydrocarbons, undertook a massive program of public
investment. A large portion of this investment was undertaken by enterprises
over which the Central Government exercised little control, and was financed
primarily by loans from foreign commercial banks, which were attracted by
Bolivia's improved economic prospects. Unfortunately, the outcome, in terms
of output of hydrocarbons, was substantially more sobering than the Government
had envisaged. The country was thus saddled with large repayments on short-term
external debts without the expected increase in the capacity to service them.
However, Bolivia's current economic crisis is more than one of needed refinanc-
ing of short- and medium-term loans. In particular, past unrealistic policies
of pricing, exchange rate and mineral taxation, together with excessively
ambitious public sector investment, have caused severe dislocations in the
economy which nece-sitate a thorough-going stabilization program, coupled
with a realistic and consistent medium- and long-term development strategy.
6.        Over the past several years, the principal source of disequili-
brium in the economy has been the poor performance of the public sector.
The financial deterioration of the sector can be traced to (i) the rapid
expansion in public investment, particularly in capital-intensive processing
plants, such as oil refining and mineral smelting, aimed at augmenting the
domestic value-added content of Bolivia's exports; and (ii) the sharp decline
in the operating surpluses of the public enterprises, particularly of the
Bolivian Mining Corporation (COMIBOL) and the Bolivian Petroleum Corpora-
tion (YPFB), the two largest export-oriented enterprises. As a result
of sluggish world demand, prices for most of Bolivia's mineral exports
deteriorated in 1975 and recovered only slowly through mid-1979. In the
case of YPFB, artifically low administered prices for domestic fuel products
have been largely responsible for the poor performance.
7.        The impact of these factors on public finances can be seen from
Table 1. Capital expenditures of the consolidated public sector more than
tripled between 1974 and 1977, to a level of about 15% of GDP, at a time when
public sector savings declined from about 8% of GDP to less than 4% of GDP.
During 1978 and 1979, there was some leveling off of capital expenditures
but since current savings deteriorated further in those two years, the overall
financing deficit remained at the high level of over 10% of GDP. During
the period 1974-78, most of this financing gap was filled by foreign loans,
especially from commercial banks, whereas during 1979, borrowing from domestic
banking sources was more important.
8.        The surge in public expenditures was accompanied by a rapid increase in
private consumption, and, given the openness of the Bolivian economy, this rise
in expenditures partly spilled over into the balance of payments, with the share
of recorded imports (including nonfactor services) rising from about 20% of GDP
for 1970-1974 to about 25% of GDP during 1975-1979. By contrast, registered
exports (including nonfactor services) have remained unchanged in real terms
between 1974 and 1979. Several factors accounted for the poor performance of
registered exports, apart from the generally unfavorable international prices
for most of Bolivia's exports for the period 1975-78. These factors included
the following:

(i) the drop in oil production over the last five years can be
attributed to the rapid depletion of old wells with no major
new discoveries. At the same time, the heavily subsidized prices
for domestic fuel products have encouraged a rapid increase in
domestic consumption;
(ii) growth of agricultural exports continued to be constrained by
marketing difficulties and controlled farm-gate prices; and
(iii) mining exports have been affected by the continuation of a
tax structure in mining which discourages new investment
(see paras 24-26), by the steady decline in the metal content
of the tin ore, and by extensive labor problems during 1977
and 1978.
9.        The deteriorating external resource balance, combined with increased
interest payments on public debt, caused the current account balance to move
from a surplus of US$127 million (5.7% of GDP) in 1974 to a deficit of US$537
million (10.7% of GDP) in 1979 (see Table 2). Most of this deficit was
financed by public sector external borrowing. Notwithstanding these inflows,
net international reserves declined by about US$104 million during 1978 and
by US$230 million during 1979. Concomitantly, the debt service ratio increased
from about 11% in 1974 to about 31% in 1979.
10.       Real GDP growth, which had averaged over 5.5% annually for the period
1970-1977, amounted to only 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively, during 1978 and 1979.
These declining growth rates coincided with the intensification of pressures on
domestic prices. As measured by the GDP deflator, the rate of domestic
inflation accelerated from an average of about 10% during 1975-1977 to about
17% in 1978 and 19% in 1979.
Government's Response to the Crisis
11.       Over the past two years, successive governments in Bolivia have felt
the need for taking serious economic measures to halt the deteriorating economic
situation. Action was delayed primarily because of frequent political changes
that have occurred over the period. Finally, on November 30, 1979, the Govern-
ment of President Gueiler took a series of economic measures the key objectives
of which were the reduction of fiscal and balance of payments deficits. In
particular, the following measures were adopted:

(i) Exchange Rate Adjustment. In view of the relatively high
domestic inflation rates of the past few years, and the fixed
exchange rate since 1972, the competitiveness of Bolivia's
exports had steadily eroded. As part of the stabilization
program, the fixed relationship of US$1=$b 20 was abandoned on
November 30, 1979, and a new exchange rate regime based on a managed
float was established at US$1=$b 25. This implied a depreciation of
25%. Further adjustments would be made to ensure the maintenance of
Bolivia's export competitiveness.
(ii) Increase in the prices of hydrocarbons. The Government has
increased the prices of petroleum derivatives sold in the
domestic market by about 100% on average, actual price increases
varying by product. For instance, the price of regular gasoline
was tripled to the equivalent of US$0.76 per gallon. This
measure is expected to yield additional revenues of about
US$135 million (over 2% of GDP) during 1980, to be shared
between the Treasury, YPFB and local governments. This should
permit YPFB, the greatest beneficiary from the measure, to
undertake new investment in exploration and development. The
measure should also dampen somewhat the domestic demand for
hydrocarbons, which has grown sharply in recent years, thereby
increasing the quantity available for export.
(iii) Monetary policy changes. These include the elimination of
dollar-denominated peso deposits, and the restructuring of the
system of interest rates and legal reserve requirements to
encourage the growth of peso-denominated financial savings.
12.       These economic measures formed the basis for an agreement with
the IMF for a stand-by arrangement. Under this arrangement, approved by
IMF Board on February 1, 1980, Bolivia is eligible to draw US$115 million
during 1980. The program also includes ceilings on net domestic borrowing
of the public sector from the banking system, and on the magnitude of external
borrowing of less than 10 years' maturity, as well as targets for the levels
of international reserves.
13.       The Government is also pursuing a major debt refinancing opera-
tion with foreign commercial banks. The aim of the Government is to
arrange for a seven-year (including three years of grace) refinancing loan
of about US$200 million, which would be used to repay some of the Central
Bank short-term borrowing.
14.       While the stabilization and debt refinancing programs outlined are
expected to play a significant role in removing some of the short-term fiscal
and balance of payments dislocations, they address only indirectly the
longer-term structural problems of the Bolivian economy. Therefore, the
Government is initiating, with Bank assistance, an Economic Recovery Program
which would strengthen Bolivia's export capacity and improve growth perform-
ance in the medium- and long-term. The program includes, in addition to the

stabilization actions, measures to improve the composition of public sector
investment, rationalization of mineral taxation, changes in pricing policies
of certain agricultural products and adjustments in the tariffs and prices
of public enterprises. Details of the Economic Recovery Program are pro-
vided in Part II.
Balance of Payments and Creditworthiness
15.       The balance of payments performance for 1980 is expected to be
considerably better than that during the past two years owing partly to the
impact of the stabilization program and partly to the improved commodity
prices for minerals and hydrocarbons. Exports of minerals are expected to
increase over 1979 by about 27% in nominal terms, and exports of natural gas
to Argentina are expected to increase significantly as additional pumps begin
to operate on the pipeline during the year. Total exports of goods and
nonfactor services are projected to increase from US$874.1 million in 1979 to
about US$1,171 million in 1980, a nominal increase of about 34% (see Table 3).
By contrast, imports of goods and nonfactor services are projected to increase
by only 6% in nominal terms in 1980, primarily because there was considerable
speculative stocking of imports during 1979 in anticipation of exchange rate
adjustments. On this basis, the current account deficit in 1980 is projected
at about US$354 million (6.3% of GDP), compared to US$537 million (10.7% of
GDP) in 1979.
16.       Over the period 1980-1985, the current account deficit is projected
to average about US$417 million annually, with the largest deficits expected
over the period 1982-1984, the period of construction of the proposed gas
pipeline to Brazil. In addition, amortization payments on existing and new
debt to be contracted are expected to average about US$230 million annually.
Thus, the annual external capital requirements to cover both current deficits
and requisite amortization payments are estimated to average US$647 million
annually.
17.       It is projected that net direct foreign investment would provide,
on an average, about US$63 million annually. Gross disbursements from medium-
and long-term project loans already committed are expected to average US$100
million annually. Disbursements from new project and non-project loans
(including IBRD program lending) are projected to amount to US$479 million
annually, many of these inflows being related to the construction of the
gas pipeline. Complemented by potential net disbursements from the IMF,
averaging about US$60 million annually, this would be sufficient to cover the
indicated capital requirements and also to provide for strengthening of
international reserves.
18.       Bolivia's public external medium- and long-term debt has grown
rapidly in recent years. At the end of 1974, such debt outstanding and
disbursed was US$630 million, or about 28% of GDP. By the end of 1979, it had
risen to about US$2.0 billion, or about 40% of estimated GDP. Particularly

- 9-
because of the shorter maturities of much of the recent borrowing, the growth
in debt service has been more rapid than the growth of debt. Service payments
on this public debt were about 31% of exports (including nonfactor services)
in 1979, compared to about 11% in 1974.
19.       Debt and debt service, in relation to GDP and exports, are now
above the levels that are desirable for an open economy that is not diversi-
fied. The role of external borrowing will necessarily be limited by the
need to improve these indicators.  The projected debt service ratios, after
the debt refinancing of 1980, are shown in Table 3. The ratio is projected to
remain around 25% until 1984, because repayments on some loans refinanced in
1978 and 1980 will start falling due after 1981, whereas the substantial
increase in export revenues from sales of natural gas to Brazil could not
commence until 1985 even if this project proceeds without delay. The balance
of payments situation over the next four or five years is, therefore, expected
to remain tight, and debt refinancing may become necessary again around 1983.
However, the debt burden is projected to decline considerably after 1984. A
gradual improvement in the structure of the external debt is foreseen, in
line with the Government's limits on the authorization of new public sector
indebtedness of less than ten years' maturity.
PART II - THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
20.       Bolivia's long-term development problem derives from the need
to integrate its long neglected indigenous population into the modern
economy. This process is likely to be a slow and difficult one, as well
as one that will require sizeable resources. Therefore, only with a far
healthier balance of payments and more solid public finances than it has
now can the country hope to deal with its fundamental development problems.
Consequently, the two main objectives of the Government's Economic Recovery
Program, in the short- as well as medium-term, are strengthening of the
country's balance of payments position and improving the quality and pro-
ductivity of public investment within the context of closely monitored
and controlled public expenditures and borrowing.
21.       Bolivia's overall merchandise exports have experienced no real
growth between 1974 and 1979. To a large extent, this poor performance has
been the consequence of an overvalued exchange rate, inappropriate domestic
pricing policies for hydrocarbons and agricultural products, lack of specific
incentives for agricultural exports and a structure of mineral taxation which
has discouraged investment and production. The financial situation has deter-
iorated primarily because of the excessively ambitious and highly capital-
intensive public investment as well as the lack of control over the operations
of the major public enterprises. After considerable procrastination by
successive administrations, the Government of President Gueiler adopted a
number of measures, and expects to adopt others, which would not only assist
in alleviating the short-term financial problems but also provide the basis
for sustained export-oriented development over the next several years. In the
following paragraphs, the main elements of the Government's economic program
are described, whereas a summary of the program is provided in the chart on
the following page.

Economic Stabilization Measures
22.       These measures, already described in paragraphs 11-13 of this
report, consist of the establishment of a new exchange rate regime, adjust-
ment of the domestic prices of hydrocarbons, monetary policy changes and
refinancing of short-term external commercial bank debts. With the excep-
tion of the debt refinancing exercise, which is progressing satisfactorily,
all the other measures have already been taken. The aim of the 1980
stabilization program is to reduce the current account balance of payments
and the overall fiscal deficits from their high levels of the past year.
The Government has also indicated its expectation to enter into an Extended
Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF at the expiration of the present
stand-by arrangement.
Medium Term Objectives and Policies
23.       Public Investment and Financing Program.. Prior to 1974, public
investment averaged around 7% of GDP. Over the next few years, public invest-
ment rose rapidly, reaching a peak of about 15% of GDP in 1977. A large
portion of this investment was undertaken by public enterprises over which the
Central Government exercised little control, and was financed primarily by
loans from foreign commercial banks. Several of the large scale projects in
oil refining and mineral smelting were not economically justified and led to
significant excess capacity. (For example, oil refining capacity has been
increased three-fold since 1974, and now exceeds production by about two-
thirds.) Such projects have contributed to Bolivia's current economic diffi-
culties by absorbing a large portion of financial resources without making a
significant contribution to the country's economic development. The Government
has completed the preparation of a medium-term public investment and financing
program for the period 1980-1983. The program is designed to support the
Government's medium term objectives summarized in its Letter on Development
Policies (see Annex IV), including, in particular, the shifting of resources
into sectors offering prospects for expanding the range and volume of Bolivia's
exports, so as to attain an average annual export growth rate of about 6%
and to diminish over time the excessive dependence on tin exports. Part III
summarizes the main features of the investment and financing program together
with Bank staff assessment of this program.
24.       Reform of Mining Taxation.  Bolivia's main export sector is mining.
It is, therefore, a serious matter that the structure and level of taxation of
the sector is such as to create substantial disincentives to its expansion and
to efficient utilization of installed capacity. The two major mineral taxes
are: (i) the regalias, which are levied on the difference between gross value
of production (i.e. exports) and presumed operating costs which are brought
up-to-date only infrequently; and (ii) the export tax, which was originally
imposed as a temporary levy in 1972 to capture some of the "windfall" gains
(resulting from the devaluation in that year) but which has continued as a
levy on gross values. In addition to these two taxes, there is a multiplicity
of earmarked and "nuisance" taxes which bring in very small amounts of revenue
and are a source of administrative and compliance difficulties. No fewer than
forty such taxes are levied on mining exports and property, but together they



- 12 -
account for less tlharn D.5j of mining sector taxes. Overall, the level of
mineral taxation in Bolivia is one of the highest among the major tin-producing
countries.  The existing structure of mining taxation in Bolivia has a number
of serious drawbacks. These include: (a) the present tax structure has
adverse effects on incentives for efficiency, exploitation and concentration
since the system makes the processing of low-grade ore unprofitable. It also
leads to inefficient use of concentrators since the taxes are based on the
concentrates actually produced, not on the ore taken from the mine; and (b)
the present tax regime serves to dampen incentives for both exploration and
development because it does not take into account inter-enterprise cost
variances of any kind, including exploration costs. Under the existing
system, the mine that spends large sums on exploration and development pays
the same taxes as a mine that spends none. The exploration incentive is
further dampened by the low rates of land taxes (patentes) since it is profit-
able for individuals to hold large tracts of potentially rich land as unex-
ploited reserves. These problems were carefully analyzed in a study by the
Institute of International Development of Harvard University, under the
technical assistance program financed by the Bank Group.
25.       The Government has just adopted significant changes in mining taxa-
tion. The main features of the reform are: (i) the elimination of the ad
valorem export tax; (ii) the updating of the presumed costs. The new presumed
costs for tin are US$3.80/lb, US$3.30/lb and US$3.55/lb respectively, for
COMIBOL, medium miners and small miners, compared to a level of US$1.85/lb
before; (iii) the rate of the regalia has been increased from 38% to 53%; and
(iv) an adjustment mechanism has been adopted which would allow for more
realistic (and more frequently adjusted) deduction of presumed costs from
taxable base. Under the new system, the presumed costs would be updated in
line with the floor price of the International Tin Council. As a result of
these reforms, COMIBOL and private miners together are expected to pay about
US$40 million less in taxes than they would have paid without these measures.
26.       The present reform of mining taxation can be expected to go a long
way in encouraging investment and production. However, further reform in
this area may be needed over the next several years for rationalization of
the tax system to (i) increase incentives for exploration and development
of low grade ores; (ii) increase substantially land taxes (patentes); and
(iii) modify the adjustment factor for presumed costs to take into account
changes in relevant costs. Financing would be provided from the proposed
loan for a study to analyze these and other aspects of further tax reform
(see Part IV). The study would also analyze the level of mineral taxation
in Bolivia.
27.       Changes in Agricultural Pricing and Marketing Policies.  Two of the
major drawbacks to agricultural exports in Bolivia have been: (i) the low
domestic farm-gate prices for several agricultural products with export or
import-substitution potential; and (ii) lack of institutional support,
inadequate marketing technology and low standards of quality. With regard to
(i), the Government has allowed significant increases in farm-gate prices for
beef (by about 55%), dairy products (by 62%) and poultry (by 25%). The



- 13 -
Government recognizes that further action would be required in this area in
the future. In particular the Government is expected to increase the farm-gate
price of coffee and to eliminate the quota which constrains exporters to sell
a considerable portion of their coffee in the domestic market. At the same
time, the Government would introduce differential pricing for be-f, with
higher prices for better cuts, unlike the present system where beef is sold by
weight, regardless of quality. The Government's objective is to set prices
so that they provide adequate incentives to producers for export and to adjust
these prices as necessary to meet this objective. A small proportion of the
proposed loan would be used to carry out a study of the institutional and
marketing support that would be needed for promoting agricultural exports.
28.       Adjustments in the tariffs and prices of public enterprises.  The
Government recently increased the tariff rates of AASANA (airport services) by
70%, of ENDE (power) by 30% and of ENFE (railroads) by 30%.  These   tariff
changes should help to improve the financial position of these entities.
However, further increases would be necessary. The Government has stated
its intention that public sector tariffs would be periodically adjusted to
allow enterprises to earn satisfactory rates of return and to cover a significant
portion of their financing for investment. The Government also intends to
increase further the prices of hydrocarbons which would be necessary to bring
the domestic prices closer to international prices.
29.       Proposed Exports of Natural Gas.  Finally, one of the promising
aspects of Bolivia's long-term export prospects beyond 1985 is the potential
for sales of natural gas to Brazil. The plan is for sale of about 400
million cubic feet of gas per day for 20 years to Brazil, about half of the
estimated available supplies from known and prospective reserves. This is a
sensitive issue in Bolivia since the view is sometimes expressed that sales of
gas to Brazil on such a large scale would inhibit the development of energy-
based industries in Bolivia. The Government's view is that the development of
domestic industry and export of gas to Brazil are not mutually exclusive, and
a program, partly financed by the Bank, is under preparation to ascertain the
magnitude of gas reserves. The gas pipeline project is included in the
Government's public investment program; work is expected to commence in 1982
and to be completed by late 1984. The Government has stated its intention to
initiate construction of the pipeline once sufficient reserves have been
confirmed and agreement has been reached with prospective buyers on the sale
price.
PART III - PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND FINANCING PROGRAM
30.        The Bolivian Government has prepared a medium-term public invest-
ment and financing program for the period 1980-1983. In this, the Government
has pursued the following objectives: (a) to give increasing priority to pro-
ductive projects in agriculture, mining, and hydrocarbons sectors, particularly
to projects with export potential; (b) to complete ongoing priority projects



- 14 -
potential; (b) to complete ongoing priority projects before initiating new
ones; and (c) to maintain adequate levels of investment in social and transport
infrastructure consistent with the needs of the country.
31.       The magnitude of the program appears feasible, and the 1980 level of
investment (11.5% of GDP if fully executed, compared to about 12.4% of GDP for
the period 1976-79) is consistent with the ceiling on total expenditures under
the one-year IMF stand-by arrangement. With regard to the composition of the
program, the Government has decided to postpone indefinitely or delay most of
the projects that appeared to have doubtful economic justification.
32.       Table 4 summarizes the main features of the public investment
program for 1980-83. One feature of the program is the projected increase
in the share of productive sectors (agriculture, mining, hydrocarbons and
industry) in total public investment from about 33% in 1979 to about 54%
in 1983. The major projects in the agricultural sector are in the areas
of rural development, irrigation and colonization programs. In the mining
sector, the planned investment for 1980 and 1981 is dominated by Karachi Pampa
lead-silver smelter, but the investment of COMIBOL is expected to increase
rapidly over its exceptionally low level of US$7 million in 1979. In the
hydrocarbons sector, the largest planned project is the gas pipeline to
Brazil, on which work should commence in 1982 and which would account for
about 55% of the planned investment for the sector in 1983. Other proposed
projects include the gas pipeline to the Altiplano, the Vuelta Grande gas
recycling project, certification of gas reserves, exploratory drilling in
several parts of the country and secondary recovery operations in Monteagudo
and Camiri.
33.       The Government feels that the relative share of investment in
the transport sector has been too large for the available resources over
the past few years. Accordingly, its share in total public investment is
expected to decline from an estimated level of over 26% in 1979 to about
15.5% by 1983. The strategy is to complete on-going road projects and
to avoid large investment in new roads. The planned purchase of airplanes
by the national airline, LAB, is also being spread out over 4 years, 1980-83.
34.        In the social sectors (education, housing, basic sanitation and
health), the objective is to maintain the share of these at around 20% of
public investment over the period 1980-83. Health and social welfare are
expected to have the largest share (47%) of the investment in the social
sectors, mainly because of the low health standards and the poor quality
of health services.
Financing of the public investment
35.       The overall public sector investment over the 4-year period 1980-83
is estimated at about $b89,832 million, averaging about 12.7% of GDP annually.
Financing of this level of investment is predicated upon improvement in
public sector savings and continued inflows of external resources in support
of the public investment program.



- 15 -
36.       Central Government savings are expected to reach a level of $b2,000
million by 1983, compared to a deficit of about $b2,700 million in 1979
(see Table 5). This improvement is expected for a variety of reasons:
(i) because of the financial problems of COMIBOL and YPFB over the last
several years. these enterprises made lower than expected tax payments to
the Treasury, a serious shortfall for the Treasury which depends for about
30% of its total revenues on these two entities. The improved financial
situation of these enterprises is expected to result in higher revenues
to the Central Government; (ii) the Government intends to improve the
collection of internal and customs taxes and to reduce import duty exemptions
where unwarranted. There is also a plan for a reform of the tax system
(which is expected to be ready for legislative action before the end of 1980)
to extend the coverage of the income tax to financial enterprises, and to
introduce some new indirect taxes; (iii) in the area of expenditure control,
the Government intends to strengthen its supervision of the main public
enterprises. Details on this are provided in para. 42.
37.       Current savings of the rest of the public sector are also expected
to increase over the period.  The financial position of YPFB has improved
considerably because of the increase in the domestic prices of petroleum
products. COMIBOL has benefited greatly from the exchange rate adjustment
(most of its costs are domestic whereas most of its sales are foreign) and
from higher mineral prices. It is also expected to benefit further from the
Government's mineral tax reform. The financial positions of the other enter-
prises, especially ENDE, ENFE and AASANA, are expected to improve owing to the
recent tariff changes as well as planned tariff adjustments.
38.       Net domestic borrowing is projected to average about 3.5% of
GDP annually, compared to about 6.3% in 1979. Together, public savings
and net domestic borrowing are expected to finance about 60% of the 1980-83
public investment program.
39.       The remaining financing, about $b35,652 million in current prices,
(or 40% of total public investment) is expected to be in the form of net
external inflows. A large proportion of these inflows is expected for projects
in mining and hydrocarbons sectors.
40.        On the whole, the public investment program appears realistic in
terms of its objectives, magnitude, composition and the Government's ability
to finance it. Most of the projects which appeared incompatible with the
Government's objectives have been eliminated or delayed. During 1980, about
77% of expenditures are on projects initiated in prior years.
41.        While the program generally reflects the Government's effort to
allocate scarce resources to projects of high priority, it is constrained
by a shortage of attractive projects in agriculture and mining. For this
reason, a portion of the proposed loan funds would be allocated to studies
aimed at identifying specific priority projects in agriculture and mining
sectors (see Part IV).

Control over Public Expenditures and Borrowing
42.       While the preparation and approval by the Bolivian authorities
of a realistic investment program is important, it is equally important to
ensure that the execution of the program is in line with the objectives and
targets of the program. As already mentioned, one of the main reasons for the
financial deterioration of the public sector in the past has been the lack of
Government control over the expenditures and borrowing of the major public
enterprises. The Government plans to strengthen the special unit in the
Ministry of Planning and Coordination for controlling and monitoring expendi-
tures of the main public enterprises. It also plans to initiate measures
for improving the information system of these enterprises. The UNDP is
expected to strengthen the staffing of the monitoring unit and to provide
training for the staff, with the Bank expected to act as Executing Agency.
In the area of controls on external borrowing, the control on foreign borrowing
of public enterprises has been extended to include loans with maturity of less
than one year. It is expected that these measures should assist the Government
in controlling the expenditures and borrowing of the main public enterprises.
The level of public investment programmed for 1980 - US$652 million - is not
expected to be exceeded.
PART IV - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
43.       In September, 1979, the Government made a request for Bank
program assistance, and a mission was sent to Bolivia. Since then,ithree
missions have returned to Bolivia to continue the macroeconomic evaluation
of the need for program assistance and, in addition, to provide technical
assistance to the Bolivian authorities in the preparation of a realistic
medium-term public investment program.
Objectives
44.       The proposed loan has been developed through a close dialogue
between the Bank and the Bolivian authorities and is aimed at supporting the
Government in its economic recovery program. The loan has several objectives:
(i) to provide support to the Government's stabilization and debt refinancing
programs. The loan would be part of the Government's monetary and fiscal
programs for 1980; (ii) to help the Government in the formulation and adoption
of a more export-oriented long-term development strategy, based on selective
action in the agricultural and mining sectors; (iii) to support the Government
in executing a realistic public investment and financing program. In this
context, the objective is to set up a mechanism for Government control
over the expenditures and borrowing of the major public enterprises. One
aspect of this would be the maintenance of realistic tariffs and prices
charged by the main enterprises. These objectives are discussed in the
Government's Letter on Development Policies (see Annex IV).
45.       Given the long-term nature of some of these problems and policies,
and the prospects for tight balance of payments and public finances for
the next few years, Bolivia may well need additional program assistance
during the period 1981-83. In this context, the Bank would suggest further



- 19 -
reform in the areas where action has already been taken and explore new
areas where policy changes might prove useful. Development of the proposed
and subsequent structural adjustment loans to Bolivia is thus expected to
provide an effective vehicle for a far-reaching dialogue between the Govern-
ment and the Rank on the economic adjustment program which is expected to
rebuild the creditworthiness of the country.
Allocation of the Loan
46.       All but US$1,300,000 of the loan would be used to help finance
imports of raw materials, intermediate goods, spare parts and capital goods.
Annex V identifies the agreed upon eligible imports.  It is estimated that
eligible imports in 1980 will total about US$650 million. The proposed loan
would finance about 8% of this, thus ensuring rapid disbursement.
47.       Up to US$1,300,000 of the proposed loan would be made available
to finance the foreign and domestic cost of technical and pre-feasibility
studies necessary for formulating future economic policies and for improving
the quality of public investment. The Government plans to spend about US$50,000
to finance a study of the structure and level of future mineral taxes as well
as of specific investment incentives in the sector. Another US$50,000 would
be used to analyze the key problems and constraints to the expansion of
agricultural exports, including a study of the required institutional and
other support. The remaining US$1,200,000 would be used to prepare pre-feasi-
bility studies for projects in agriculture (US$400,000) and mining (US$800,000)
(Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement). The terms and conditions of employment
of consultants for the various technical studies would be satisfactory to
the Bank, and findings of the various studies would be reported to the Bank
promptly on completion of these studies.
Counterpart Funds
48.       The Bolivian peso equivalent generated by the sale of foreign ex-
change to importers of US$48.7 million (the loan funds allocated for technical
studies would not generate counterpart funds) would be credited to a special
account in the Central Bank and used to finance development projects in the
approved public investment program (Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement).
Disbursement and Procurement
49.       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches in accordance with
progress on the execution of the economic program. US$25 million would be
available for disbursement after the loan is declared effective. The remaining
US$25 million would be available for disbursement after a review of performance
by August 31, 1980 (Section 3.06 of, and Schedule 1 para 2(d) to, the Loan
Agreement). The review would consist of: (a) analysis of progress on the
-Government's stabilization program as defined in the Letter on Development
Policies. This would involve ascertaining that Bolivia's export competitive-
ness is maintained; and (b) restatement by the new administration, expected to
take office in August, of its willingness to pursue the policies defined in
the Letter on Development Policies.



- 20 -
50.       The proposed loan would reimburse the foreign exchange cost of
eligible imports and foreign and domestic cost of studies, on the basis
of evidence provided by the Central Bank. The Central Bank would be
responsible for the collection of the necessary documentation, the
reparation and submission of withdrawal applications, and the main-
tenance of necessary accounts for the loan funds. A minimum value of
50,000 pesos (about US$2,000 at present exchange rate) is proposed for
eligible invoices (Schedule 1, para 4(c) to the Loan Agreement).
51.       All imports would be procured from Bank member countries and
Switzerland. All procurement would be through normal commercial channels,
except in the case of contracts costing over US$5 million which would be
procured in accordance with international competitive bidding.
52.       Reimbursement would not be permitted for goods imported and paid for
before January 1, 1980 (Schedule 1, para 4(a) to the Loan Agreement). It
is expected that the entire portion of the loan allocated for imports would be
disbursed by December 31, 1980.
Benefits and Risks
53.       The principal benefits anticipated from the proposed loan are the
following:
(a) The loan would support the Government's efforts to restore Bolivia's
creditworthiness by adopting a more export-oriented strategy in the
key areas of mining taxation and agricultural pricing and marketing
policies.
(b) It would assist the Government in implementing a realistic
public investment program.
(c) The loan would permit the importation of essential raw
materials, intermediate goods, spare parts and capital goods
items. The proposed loan would finance about 8% of such
imports in 1980.
(d) The loan would help ensure, through counterpart funds generated,
that execution of high priority projects is not delayed because
of the Government's fiscal problems.
(e)  The Bank's loan and the IMF stand-by arrangement are expected to
encourage commercial banks to refinance a substantial part of
Bolivia's external debt.
(f) The loan has provided, and will continue to provide, an effec-
tive vehicle for a dialogue on economic issues and policies.
54.       Two principal risks are involved in the proposed loan.  One is
related to the ability of the Government to carry out the economic program.
The economic measures recently adopted by the Government were long overdue
and are expected to have a significant effect in reducing the major distor-
tions in the economy. However, by their very nature, they involve at



- 21 -
least short-term costs to some groups within the society.  In particular,
there has been considerable opposition from labor unions on the grounds that
the program would lead to higher unemployment and inflation rates. Opposi-
tion has also come from users of transport services and subsistence farmers.
The next several months are expected to be marked by considerab'e tensions
and the possibilities of renewed political instability can never be completely
ruled out in Bolivia.
55.       The possibility that an incoming government might attempt to pursue
a different economic strategy is the second risk. With elections planned for
June 29, 1980, it will be important to ascertain that the future administration
(expected to take office in August, 1980) will continue the economic program
outlined in the attached Letter on Development Policies and initiated by the
present administration. Bank staff review for the second tranche would
provide an opportunity for a careful assessment of the new administration's
short- and medium-term economic policies and its ability to implement these
policies. Indications are that most major political parties favor the con-
tinuation of the economic program.
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
56.       Although Bolivia is an original member of the Bank, it did not obtain
any Bank Group financing until 1964. Because of Bolivia's restricted capacity
to service external debt, Bank Group financing was, except for a US$23.25 million
Gas Pipeline loan, exclusively on IDA terms until Bolivia started to export
small quantities of natural gas and petroleum. In view of promising prospects
for rapid expansion, IDA lending to Bolivia ceased in 1975. In 1978, however,
it became apparent that the expectations of large petroleum exports, and with
it dynamic economic development, would not materialize. Starting with the
Ulla Ulla Rural Development project, financed in equal amounts on Bank and IDA
terms, Bolivia was treated as a blend country. To date, the Bank and IDA have
approved 27 operations (12 credits, 14 loans and one blend operation) for
Bolivia amounting to US$354.1 million, of which 8 have been fully disbursed.
57.       Bank Group lending to Bolivia has assisted in the development of
infrastructure and social sectors. In the agricultural sector (8 operations
amounting to US$48.2 million), the Bank Group has helped the Government to
develop a viable livestock industry, to increase agricultural production,
to improve living conditions on the Altiplano and to promote the development
of the alpaca/llama industry; efforts to strengthen the Agricultural Bank
of Bolivia have met with limited success. In the power sector, through 5
operations amounting to US$53.4 million, the Bank Group has been instrumental
in modernizing the sector, expanding electricity supply, improving the quality
of service and setting up a regulatory agency and a public power company,
which has been operated in an efficient and financially sound manner. In the
transportation sector, Bank Group assistance to the railways (3 operations
amounting to US$75.0 million of which US$3.3 million were cancelled) has
helped to improve the railways' quality of management, efficiency of operations
and financial condition; a US$23.3 million loan was made for the construction
of a gas pipeline from the Santa Cruz area to the border with Argentina;



- 22 -
a US$25.0 million loan for an aviation development project is assisting
Bolivia's efforts to develop hitherto isolated areas by providing safe and
efficient freight and passenger transportation; a US$25.0 million loan for
a highway maintenance project is helping Bolivia protect its investments in
highways. In the mining sector, 4 operations amounting to US$35.7 million
have aimed at increased exploration and production and improved sectoral
coordination. A US$16 million loan is expected to prove sufficient gas
reserves to satisfy the local market and to undertake further gas exports.
A US$11.5 million loan for a water supply and sewerage project, of which
US$6.3 million was cancelled as two cities withdrew from the project, is
improving services in 70 rural communities; a US$9 million credit will help
finance the expansion of water supply and sewerage services in the city of
Santa Cruz de la Sierra. A US$15 million loan for an education and vocational
training project is assisting Bolivia to develop its human resources in a more
effective way. A US$17 million loan is helping Bolivia to improve the living
conditions of the urban poor in the city of La Paz.
58.       Because of the narrow scope for private investment, IFC became active
in Bolivia only in 1973 through an investment of US$400,000 in a firm producing
cables and plastic products. Two IFC investments since then have contributed
to the establishment of a local market for long-term securities: an equity
participation of up to US$550,000 in Banco Industrial S.A. (BISA) in conjunc-
tion with a Bank loan of US$10.0 million for the same institution to assist in
financing medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, and US$337,500 in
Banco Hipotecario Nacional to assist in the development of mortgage banking.
Annex II contains a summary statement of the status of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments in Bolivia as of March 31, 1980, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
59.       Bank Group lending to Bolivia has supported a broadly based Govern-
ment effort to expand and upgrade Bolivia's economic and social infrastructure.
Until 1978, the Government had established an excellent record in providing
the required local funds, and in general, projects were adequately carried
out. During the past year, the execution of ongoing projects has been affected
adversely by the shortage of local funds and changes in Government personnel,
reflecting the difficult economic and political situation of Bolivia. The
Bank Group is reviewing with the Government the possibilities of overcoming
these difficulties. For future lending, the Bank Group is giving priority,
to the identification of projects that would help Bolivia diversify and
increase its exports. Once such projects, in the context of Government policies
like those described above, have strengthened Bolivia's finances and debt ser-
vicing capacity, it is expected that increasing emphasis will also be given
to projects and programs that address the country's long standing socio-economic
problems.
60.       For the period 1974-78, total official development assistance to
Bolivia has been as follows: Bank, US$226.0 million; IDA, US$22.7 million;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), US$263.8 million; US Agency for Inter-
national Development US$191.9 million; other, US$322.2 million. Net of
undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt to the Bank and IDA in 1978 represented
7.7% of its public debt. Bank and IDA's share of the Bolivian debt service
was 3.9% in 1978.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the
Bank and the Peport of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed in Annex Ill, Section
III. The conditions of disbursement of the second tranche are: (i) satisfac-
tory progress on the Government's stabilization program, as defined in the
Letter on Development Policies. This would involve ascertaining that Bolivia's
export competitiveness is maintained; and (ii) restatement by the new administ-
ration, expected to take office in August, of its willingness to pursue the
policies defined in the Letter on Development Policies.
62.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
63.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June 23, 1971;
Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The credit portion of the project has been almost fully disbursed;
only about US$800,000 including about US$400,000 for technical assistance
remains to be disbursed and the credit should be fully committed by the
Closing Date.
Credit 455-BO - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Effective Date: June 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and the credit should be
fully disbursed by the Closing Date or shortly thereafter.
Credit 561-BO - Agricultural Credit I, US$7.5 million, June 20, 1975;
Effective Date: December 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Funds originally allocated for cattle and subsequently for grape
orchards are fully committed; whereas demand for sheep, annual crops and
sugarcane has been less than anticipated. The loan is now fully committed.
Loan 1121-BO - Second Railway Project, US$28.7 million, June 5, 1975;
Effective Date: August 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.

Loan 1211-BO - Ingavi Rural Development Project, US$9.5 million, March 8, 1976;
Effective Dat^: October 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
There have been delays in the implementation of some components of
the project. Corrective measures have been taken and the project is now
proceeding satisfactorily. The average size of subloans has been smaller
than anticipated; consequently, project area may have to be expanded.
Loan 1238-BO - Fourth ENDE Power Project, US$25 million, June 2, 1976;
Effective Date: August 23, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project has been delayed somewhat by poor performance of local
contractors and difficulties experienced in the transportation of a major
equipment component. Overall progress of the project has been satisfactory
and the loan should be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Loan 1290-BO - Banco Industrial Mining and Industrial Credit Project,
US$10 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: April 14, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
After initial delays, the project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1324-BO - Urban and Rural Communities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$11.5 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: December 10, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
At the Government's request, the water supply and sewerage invest-
ments for the cities of Sucre and Potosi were cancelled because these cities
were not prepared to proceed without substantial Government subsidies.
The rural component of the project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1331-BO - Small-Scale Mining Development Project, US$12 million,
October 15, 1976; Effective Date: July 15, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Owing to institutional and managerial problems, the preparation of
subprojects was delayed about 15 months. To facilitate loan utilization
a number of measures were taken in mid 1978. While progress has been slow
so far, there are indications that commitments will accelerate during 1980.
Loan 1404-BO - Education and Vocational Training Project, US$15 million,
May 11, 1977; Effective Date: September 7, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
In its initial phase, the project proceeded well, but subsequently
experienced delays because of the lack of Government contributions. Recent
managerial problems have now being resolved through the appointment of a new
project director and improved participation of teachers.

Loan 1422-BO - Third Railway Project US$35 million, June 6, 1977;
Effective Date:  September 29, 1977; Closing Date:  December 31, 1981.
The progress o' the project has been seriously impaired by heavy
rains and extensive floodings of January, February 1979. A reduction in the
project scope is expected as the railways have to divert funds to repair
damages. The Bank is discussing with Government on how best to proceed.
Loan 1423-BO - Aviation Development Project; US$25 million, June 9, 1977;
Effective Date: September 29, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project has been delayed by about one year because of poor
weather conditions and, subsequently, because of management changes and delays
in Government contributions. Most components are now proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1489-BO - Urban Development Project, US$9 million, November 30, 1977;
Effective Date: June 22, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project has been delayed one year because of slow processing
of subsidiary loan agreements, frequent changes in management and delays
in Government contribution. These factors continue to affect the housing
component. The other components are now proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1510-BO and Credit 762-BO - Ulla Ulla Development Project, US$9 million
each, April 6, 1978; Effective Date: July 31, 1978; Closing Date: June 30,

Effective Date: October 4, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.

finance projects in the approved public investment program
(para 48).
(b) Disbursement of the second tranche of the loan would be based on
satisfactory progress being made in carrying out the economic
program outlined in the Letter on Development Policies. This
would include a finding that Bolivia's export competitiveness is
maintained; and endorsement by the new administration, expected
to take office in August, of the Letter on Development Policies.

LETTER ON DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
Dear Mr. McNamara,
Bolivia is currently facing an economic crisis which has been
aggravated by delay in the adoption of corrective measures.  The current
account deficit of the balance of payments in 1979 amounted to about
10.5% of GDP, compared to a surplus of about 6% in 1974. This deterioration
reflects a decline in export volumes, a rapid increase in imports, and
increased interest payments resulting from the growth of external debt.
On the fiscal side, the rapid expansion in public investment during 1975-78,
particularly in capital-intensive processing plants, and the decline in
the operating surpluses of the major public enterprises led to a severe
disequilibrium. The overall balance of the public sector moved from a small
surplus in 1974 to a deficit of about 10.5% of GDP in 1979. Real GDP growth,
which had averaged over 5.5% for the period 1970-77, amounted to only 3.3% and
2.1%, respectively, during 1978 and 1979. At the same time, the rate of
inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, accelerated from an average of
about 10% during 1975-77 to about 17% in 1978 and 19% in 1979.
2.        The Government of Bolivia has formulated an integrated economic
recovery program, of which important initial measures have already been taken.
The program is aimed at (i) removing short-term domestic and external imbalances,
and (ii) reducing or eliminating major structural problems which have affected
this country's economic growth performance over the past several years. The
main components of the program are the following:
(a) Economic and Financial Stabilization Program;
(b) Specific Measures for Export Promotion;
(c) Public Investment and Financing Program.
Economic and Financial Stabilization Program
3.        On November 30, 1979, the Government took a series of economic
measures aimed at reducing the fiscal and balance of payments deficits.
One such measure was the replacement of the fixed exchange rate of
US$1=$b20 by a new exchange rate regime based on a managed float, set
initially at US$1 = $b25. This implied a depreciation of 25%. In the
future, the exchange value of the peso will be determined in relation to
the net international reserve position of the Central Bank and the relation-
ship between domestic and foreign costs. Another measure was the increase
of about 100%, on average, in the prices of petroleum derivatives sold in



- 35 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2
the domestic market. This measure will not only improve the financial situation
of the public sector, but also help to dampen domestic demand for hydrocarbons,
thereby increasing the quantity available for export. The Government is willing
to consider the formulation of further action in this area. In the area of
monetary policy, we have eliminated dollar-denominated peso deposits, and have
restructured the system of interest rates and legal reserve requirements to
encourage the growth of peso-denominated savings. The program also includes
ceilings on net domestic borrowing of the public sector from the banking system,
and on the magnitude of external borrowing of less than 10 years' maturity as
well as targets for the levels of international reserves.   These measures
formed the basis for an agreement with the IMF for a one-year stand-by arrange-
ment, which was approved by the IMF Board on February 1, 1980.
4.        As a result of the rapid growth in external debt and the poor export
performance of the last several years, external debt service payments have
risen sharply in relation to exports. We are negotiating a debt refinancinlg
operation with a number of foreign commercial banks. Our objective is to
arrange for a refinancing loan of about US$200 million, which would be used to
repay some of the Central Bank and COMIBOL short- and medium-term loans.
Specific Measures for Export Promotion
5.        Bolivia's overall merchandise exports have experienced no real
growth between 1974 and 1979. To a large extent, this poor performance
has been the the consequence of an overvalued exchange rate, inappropriate
domestic pricing policies for hydrocarbons and agricultural products,
lack of specific incentives for agricultural exports, and an inappropriate
structure of mineral taxation. It is the Government's intention to reverse
this tendency and to pursue policies that will foster the development of
exports in industries in which Bolivia can be an efficient producer. In
addition to the action already taken on the exchange rate and hydrocarbons'
prices (discussed in para 3) and to the increased emphasis on export-
oriented projects in the public investment program (discussed in para 9),
the following specific measures for promoting exports have been adopted,
or are expected to be adopted in the near future. The two main objectives
of these measures are: (l) to allow exports to grow at about 6% per annum
in real terms over the period 1980-85, and (ii) to reduce the heavy reliance
on exports of tin from over 50% of merchandise exports in 1979 to about 33%
by 1985.
a.   Reform of Mineral Taxation
6.        Bolivia's main export sector, mining, has been negatively affected
by a structure of taxation which discouraged exploration and development.
The Government has recently adopted a mineral tax reform which includes:
(i) the elimination of the export tax, (ii) the updating of presumed costs,
and (iii) the establishment of an adjustment factor for presumed costs, based



36 -
ANNEX IV
Page 3
on the floor price of the International Tin Council. In our opinion, these
measures initially provide sufficient incentives to the mining sector to
develop efficiently the mineral resources of Bolivia. The Government considers
that further analysis of, and possible action on, the formula to update pre-
sumed costs, the provision of specific tax incentives and overall level of
mineral taxation are needed. It is our objective to increase investment and
production in the sector, and to increase the exports of the sector by at least
3.5% per annum in real terms between 1980 and 1985.
b.   Agricultural Pricing and Marketing Policies
7.        Low domestic producer prices for several agricultural products with
export potential have been a major drawback to agriculture exports. To promote
production of commodities with the highest export and import substitution
potential, the Government has significantly increased farm-gate prices for a
number of agricultual products, among others for beef, by about 55%, for dairy
products by 62%, and for poultry by 25%. We recognize that further action is
required. Most importantly, the action would refer to (i) an increase in the
farm-gate price for coffee and the gradual introduction of differential prices
taking quality into account; and (ii) the introduction of differential pricing
for beef, with higher prices for better cuts. It is intended to gain experience
on a pilot basis before introducing differential prices on a national basis.
It is our objective to set prices so that they provide adequate incentives to
producers for export and we intend to adjust these prices as necessary to meet
this objective. In addition, the Government expects that the findings of the
Bank supported study would provide the framework for export promotion programs
and relevant institutional measures.
c.   Future Exports of Natural Gas
8.        One of the bright aspects of our country's long-term export prospects
is the possible sale of large quantities of natural gas to neighbouring
countries. A program, partly financed by the World Bank, is under preparation
to ascertain the magnitude of gas reserves. The Government intends to take
preparatory steps as early as possible to allow initiation of the construction
of a pipeline to export gas immediately after sufficient reserves have been
confirmed provided satisfactory agreement on the sale price has been arrived
at with prospective buyers such as Brazil and other countries.
Public Investment and Financing Program
9.        The Government has completed the preparation of a public investment
and financing program for the period 1980-83. The main objectives of the
program are: to give priority to productive projects in agriculture, mining,
manufacturing and hydrocarbons, particularly to projects with export orienta-
tion; to complete ongoing priority projects before initiating new ones; and to



- 37 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4
maintain essential levels of investment in social and transport infrastructure
consistent with the needs of the country. We have prepared a revised and
significantly cut down priorty investment program which is now in line with
domestic and external financing availability. In the process, a number of
large projects have been eliminated from the program while others have been
delayed or cut down in size.   We also expect that the feasibility reports
to be financed by the World Bank will help improve the quality of public
investment in the future, particularly in agriculture, mining and hydro-
carbons sectors through identification of high priority projects.
10.       On the financing side, we anticipate continued inflows of
external assistance, plan to maintain net domestic borrowing of the public
sector at levels consistent with our stabilization program, and intend to
take further measures to improve public sector savings. Two such measures
for increasing savings are the following:
a.   Maintenance of Realistic Tariffs and Prices of Public Enterprises
11.       Recently the Government has increased the tariffs of ENDE by 30%,
of ENFE by 30% and of AASANA by 70%. Our policy is to set public sector
tariffs at levels that allow enterprises to earn -reasonable rates of return
and that ensure a significant proportion of self-financing for investment. In
particular, the tariffs of ENDE will have to be increased significantly to
help finance the envisaged large investment program. We also plan to increase
hydrocarbon prices gradually in order to bring the domestic prices closer to
international prices.
b.   Control over the Expenditures and Borrowing of Public Enterprises
12.       In the area of controls over expenditures and borrowing, the
Government intends to strengthen its control, particularly of the major
public enterprises. Wage guidelines have been set in the context of the
stabilization program. To ensure that the level of programmed investment
is not exceeded, we intend to improve the information system for major public
enterprises and to strengthen the mechanism of control over these enterprises
through instructions based on generally accepted principles of public enter-
prise management,through Government representatives in the Board of Directors
of enterprises, and through strengthening, before August 31, 1980, of the
staff in the Ministry of Planning and Coordination. In this connection,
the proposed technical assistance of the World Bank and UNDP to help set
up an appropriate control system and train staff will prove useful. In
the area of controls on external borrowing, INDEF - the entity responsible
for external borrowing - has been dissolved and all matters relating to
external borrowing have been passed on to the Central Bank. The control on
foreign borrowing of public enterprises has been extended to include loans
of maturity less than one year.

13.       While important and difficult measures have already been taken as
outlined, the process of economic recovery will probably take three to four
years and require further action. It is in the context of our program for
economic recovery that we consider World Bank support essential.
Yours sincerely,
