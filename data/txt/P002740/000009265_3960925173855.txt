PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FIRST HOUSING LOAN TO CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER (CIHI
(LOAN 2245-MOR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Coal Engineering
Project in Tanzania for which Credit 1371-TA in the amount of SDR 5.9 million,
(equivalent to US$6.3) was approved on May 19, 1983. The credit was closed on
June 30, 1990, three years behind schedule. It has been fully disbursed and
the last disbursement was on January 4, 1991.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy Division of Asia
Technical Department and Industry and Energy Operations Division of Southern
Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). On March
28th, 1991 the Bank sent to the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to
prepare Part I1 within three months, but no reply was received.
Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank s final
Supervision Mission in August 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the
President s Report; the Credit and Project Agreements; supervision repuots;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

CALg ENGtINEERING PROJECT  CREDIT 1371-TAM
Evaluation Summarv
1. Oblectives
The project objectives were to provide the Government with updated
geological data of Kabulo Ridge area in the Songwe-Kiwira coalfield; to prove
additional coal reserves to extend the life of the existing Ilima colliery;
and to strengthen the technical and managerial capabilities of the then
Ministry of Minerals (MOM) and the State Mining Corporation (STANICO) in coal
operations (para. 3).
2. Implementation Experience
The Credit Effectiveness was delayed by more than 8 months due to
the failure of STAMICO to sign a contract with selected consultants who were
to provide technical assistance and to obtain necessary mining rights from the
MOM for the Kabulo Ridge area (para. 8).
The exploration of Kabulo-Ridge was delayed only by a period
equivalent to the delay in start but the Ilima component was not completed
until mid-1990, almost 3 years behind schedule (para. 9).
The selection of the principal consultants was very slow because of
lack of familiarity of STAMICO with the Bank guidelines on the subject.
Delays in goods procurement resulted from a slow start-up in the process by
STAMICO and until the consultants were In place (para. 10).
3. Results
More than 45 million tons of reserves amenable to open-pit mining,
and suitable for thermal power generation were proved at Kabulo Ridge.
Another 0.5 million tons of reserves were proved at Ilima colliery. All
equipment for full rehabilitation of Ilima mine were procured but lack of
available funding prevented rendering technical assistance for installation
and commissioning them. The sectoral study showed that the Chinese-financed
coalmine was not financially viable but this did not prevent its construction.
A satisfactory budgetary system was established at STAMICO and all financial
reports were made current (para. 15).



4. Su tainability
STAMICO may not be able to sustain the improvements in management
and the colliery operations following the termination of technical assistance
and of funding to provide necessary foreign exchange for spare parts and
consumables. Improvements in STAMICO is further jeopardized by frequent
transfer of staff and re-assignments. However, the country has gained from
the valuable training and technical assistance input (para. 18).
5.  Findings and Lessons Learned
The Bank made a positive contribution to the exploration of coal
resources and in the preparation of the reports on the role of coal in the
economy. The Bank, however, failed to (a) prevent the construction of an
uneconomic Chinese-assisted coal project in the immediate vicinity of its own
project (para. 19(a)); (b) insist that the PIU in STAMICO should be fully
staffed and shoulder more responsibility in the project implementation (para.
19(b); (c) STAMICO used the consultants not only to implement the technical
aspects of the project but also to handle many administrative tasks wherever
its own staff was found wanting. Thus valuable consultant time was put to
lower priority use (para. 19(c)).

B. Backeround
1.        During the period 1970-75 demand for commercial energy in Tanzania
grew at an average rate of 4.9% p.a. In 1975-80, this rate of growth slowed
to 1.4% p.a. following steep increases in oil product prices, import
restrictions, higher domestit; prices and conservation measures together with
an overall decline in economic growth. In 1980, it was believed that
consumption of commercial energy would grow at about 3% p.a. during the 1980s,
including a 6.6% per annum increase in electricity sales following expansion
of the national grid.
2.        In view of the above anticipated growth in energy consumption, and
electricity consumption in particular, the Government developed a strategy to
foster domestic exploration for oil, gas and coal with a view to eventual
development of such resources and to the lowering of the country s dependency
on imported oil. The Government at the time looked to coal development (a) to
satisfy the immediate and future demand of industries for which energy is an
important cost item and coal an appropriate fuel (cement, paper, sugar);
(b) to substitute for firewood and chaucoal in household uses and hence reduce
deforestation; and (c) to replace fuel-oil in power generation, as far as
possible, in the 1990s.
C.  Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.        Prolect Objectives.  The project was designed to support the
Government s efforts to evaluate the economic potential of the coal resources
of Tanzania as a first step towards increased coal usage. The project s
objectives were: (a) to provide the Government with updated geological data
on the Kabulo Ridge area in the Songwe-Kiwira coael field and, if warranted, to
complete a mine feasibility study for this deposit; (b) to further assist with
the exploration and delineation of reserves to extend the life of the existing
Ilima colliery; and (c) to strengthen the technical and managerial
capabilities of the then Ministry of Minerals (MOM) and the State Mining
Corporation (STAMICO) in coal operations.



2-
4.        Project Descrigtion   The Coal Engineering Project originally
provided for a three part program as follows:
latx_.:  Exploration and Feasibilitv Studies of K&abulo Ridge Project
(i) First Phase: Research and interpretation of the available
geological data base, photogeological studies, and initial
field works.
(iL)   Second Phase:  Collection of all data for the feasibility
study included in the third phase blelow, including drilling of
about 120 drillholes, evaluation of all data so obtained,
geological and topographic mepping, test pitting, bulk
sampling and underground drivage for bulk samples.
(iii)   Third Pbasg.  Feasibility study to determine the economic,
financial and technical viability of an open-pit coal mine in
the most favorable area located by the exploration carried out
in phases one and two above. Special case was to be taken to
assess the environmental impact of the mine development,
particularly the risk of possible pollution through the acid
water drainage from the mine. The program was to be a staged
exercise with the decision to progress from one phase to
another to be agreed between the Borrower and the Bank.
Part B:  Exploration of the Tlima Coal Reserv__
Exploration in the immediate vicinity of the Ilima Colliery to
establish additional economically minable reserves.
Part C:  Technical Assistance and Training
(i)   Strengthening the Borrower s capability to manage development
of coal reserves in Tanzania and training of staff of the
Borrower s Ministry of MInerals.
tit)   Establishment of a financial management and control system and
training of STAMICO s staff.
5.        In addition to the above, IDA assisted the Government to prepare a
Coal Sector Report and provided funding to rehabilitate the Ilima mine
following the establishment of additional reserves.
D. Project Design and Organization
6.        STAMICO was the coordinating agency for all mining enterprises under
the Government of Tanzania. The project was to be implemented under the
authority of STAMICO, with guidance from MOM. Major emphasis was given to
strengthen the capability of STAMICO through the technical assistance and
training programs. A project implementation team or unit (PIU) at STAMICO
headquarter was to report to the Director of Mining Development. The PIU was



-3-
to be chaired by a senior administrator and include senior technical
officials,
7.        Internationally recruited geology and mining consultants were to be
retained to undertake supervision of the Kabulo Ridge component of the
project. They were also to assist STAMICO staff with exploration and mine
planning at Ilima. The PIU was to oversee the activities of the consultants.
E. Project Implementation
8.        Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start-Up.  Although Credit 1371-TA
was approved on May 19, 1983 and signed on September 22, 1983, the Credit did
not become effective until August 23, 1984. The delay was due to the failure
by STAMICO, the executing agency to: (a) sign a contract with the selected
consultants who were to provide technical assistance (Section 3.02(a) of the
CA); and,(b) obtain the necessary mining rights from MOM for the Kabulo Ridge
area (Section 3.06 of the CA). Project start-up was thus delayed almost 8
months from the original schedule.
9.        ImpleMentation Schedule.  The project was originally scheduled to be
completed by December 31, 1986. While the exploration component at Kabulo
Ridge was completed by late 1987 4.e. delayed only by a period equivalent to
the delay in start-up, the Ilima mine rehabilitation component was not
completed until mid-1990. The principal delays were caused by:
(a)  the delayed start-up of the total project;
(b)  the failure of STAMICO to maintain a fully staffed project
implementation unit;
(c)  delays in the provision by the Government to STANICO of the
necessary local funds; and
(4)  slow initiation of the procurement of the spares/consumables for the
Ilima rehabilitation.
Possible means to avoid future delays of these types are discussed below in
paras. 19 and 20.
10.       Procurement.  The general progress with procurement was slow.  The
selection of the principal consultants for the project was especially slow
because of lack of familiarity with Bank guidelines. Delays in goods
procurement usually resulted from a slow start-up in the process by STAMICO
rather than from slow evaluation and contract placement. It should be noted
that consultants were responsible for processing most of the goods procured
with STAMICO having a review and approval role.
11.       Project Costs.  The total project cost was estimate4 at appraisal to
be about US$7.0 million of which US$5.9 million would be in foreign exchange.
The project was essentially completed within the budgeted costs but it would
have been preferable if an additional US$100,000 had been available for



-4-
technical assistance to complete the rehabili,.atior %2 the Ilima mine and to
supervise start-up of the new equipment.  No detaileu _akdown of local costs
is available from STAMICO but it ls believed that while they exceeded the
budgeted Tanzanian shillings they were generally in line with the budgeted
dollar equivalent sum.
12.       pisbursements.  The estimated disbursements of Credit 1371-TA
relative to actual disbursements are given in Table C in Part III. The
disbursements were delayed by a very slow start-up in implementation of the
project and then further delayed by both the lack of timely availability of
local counterpart funds and the delays in processing withdrawal applications.
The original closing date for the credit was June 30, 1987; however, the
credit closed only on June 30, 1990, after three extensions of the closing
date. Disbursement against commitments were made until January 4, 1991 at
which time the available funds were fully disbursed.
13.       Credit Allocation.  The original and revised allocation together
with actual disbursements are shown in Table F.l, Part III. The original
allocations were revised in June, 1988 to reflect changes in the Kabulo Ridge
exploration/feasibility component and to provide additional funding for the
rehabilitation of the Ilima mine.
F. Proiect Results
14.       Project Objectives.  Overall the project was successful in defining
a large coal reserve at Kabulo Ridge suitable for mining as a fuel for a
thermal power plant. The fact that the reserve has not been developed and
indeed is not planned for development in the foreseeable future is a
reflection of the severe decline in actual and projected energy prices since
project appraisal.  A comprehensive analysis of the role of coal in the
Tanzanian economy was completed which permitted the Government to
realistically assess the potential role of indigenous coal in the economy.
The Ilima mine was demonstrated to have significant additional coal reserves
of a quality suitable for cement production and for industrial uses. The mine
was rehabilitated to permit exploitation of these reserves. The project also
assisted in strengthening the management and organization of STAMICO to a
stage at which planning and budgeting now can be undertaken without outside
assistance and the maintenance of financial records can be current.
15.       Physical Results.  The project proved coal reserves of more than 45
million tons at Kabulo Ridge which are amenable to recovery by open-pit
methods. All equipment for full rehabilitation of Ilima mine were procured
but lack of available funding prevented rendering technical assistance under
the credit for installation and commissioning them. The sectoral study
indicated to the Government that the Chinese-financed coalmine was indeed to
be a non-viable operation as had been suggested during project appraisal. A
Financial Adviser was recruited in 1987, almost 3 years behind schedule.
After his appointment excellent progress was made in bringi,ng the financial
reporting of STAMICO current by 1989, and in setting up a budgetary system
within the corporation. However, the Bank has not yet received the audited
accounts for 1989.



- 5 -
16.       gnvironmental Impact.  The execution of the project did not entail
any environmental issues, as disturbances of the surface, such as drill sites
and coal sample test pits were very minor. The mining underground at Ilima
has also not caused any visible surface damage. Due to very low sulphur
content of the coal, the mine effluents were not found acidic. There were no
gas and dust problems in the mine.
17.       Financial Performance.  As the project was a technical assistance
project there are no measurable financial parameters.
G.  Proiect Sustainability
18.       It is doubtful whether STAMICO will be able to sustain the
improvement in management and project execution following the termination of
technical assistance and of funding to provide the necessary foreign exchange
for consumables and replacements. The sustainability of the improvements in
STAMICO is further jeopardized by frequent staff re-assignments and transfers
to the Ministry. While the direct benefits to STAMICO may deteriorate the
more qualified personnel will continue to assist in the development of the
mining sector either in the Ministry of Water, Energy, and Minerals or in the
private sector.
H.   Bank Performance
19.       Throughout the implementation of the project the Bank made a
positive contribution to the exploration of the coal resources and in the
preparation of the reports on the role of coal in the economy. However, in
retrospect, the following lessons may be learnt from the experience in the
project.
(a)  at project negotiation the Bank failed to take a firm stand with
respect to the proposed Chinese-financed coal mine. A firm stand by
the Bank would have avoided needless investment by Tanzania in a
white elephant ;
(b)  Bank should have been more forceful in insisting on the maintenance
within STAMICO of a fully staffed and effective project
implementation unit or team at all time; and
(c)  while having consultants manage many aspects of the project
management may expedite the project, it leads to reduced
responsibility by the Borrower thereby reducing the technology
transfer aspects of the project.
I.   Borrower Performance
20.       Table G, Part III contains a review of the performance of the
Borrower and STAMICO with respect to the legal covenants. MQM played only a
minor role in project implementation and all significant activities were
undertaken by STAMICO.  Early in the project it became clear that for STAMICO,
a new borrower, implementation of the project would not be easy. There were



-6-
delays in the formation of the project implementation unit and Bank procedures
were more complex than those to which STAMICO were accustomed. Consultants
were used not only to implement the technical aspects of the project but also
to replace STAhIICO staff who were not qualified to handle procurement. The
chief of the project unit performed well until such time when he left STAMICO
at which time STAMICO became totally ineftective in monitoring the project.
Failure by the Borrower to provide local tunds at the timing required
seriotisly delayed project implementation from time to time. The main lessons
the borrower should learn from the project are:
(a) there is a need to maintain a strong project implementation unit or
team and not to relinquish all project authority to consultants; and
(b) local funds must be provided to the project in a timely manner to
prevent costly implementation delays;
J.   Project Relationshi]2
21.       The IDA relationship with the Government and STAMICO on the project
was generally good. Some difficulties were encountered at credit closing
owing to misunderstandings with regard to responsibilities for monitoring the
remaining funds in the credit.
K.   Consulting Services
22.       Extensive consultancy services were provided throughout the project
to support STAMICO in all aspects of project implementation. The Bank was
actively involved in supervising the consultants and their overall performance
was deemed technically satisfactory. A stronger role by STAMICO would
probably have resulted in significant project cost reductions as the
consultants reportedly spent much time on day-to-day administrative matters
more properly handled by STAMICO. While STANICO believe the consultants
unnecessarily took on these tasks 't remains questionable as to whether the
project could have been implemented on any other basis.
L. Project Documentation and Data
23.       The Credit Agreement and Project Agreement in the case of Credit
1371-TA were quite adequate and appropriate for achieving project objectives.
Various covenants provided opportunity for periodic review of progress of work
up to that stage, before proceeding to the next stage. It was not possible to
accurately collect the data of local costs incurred by the Borrower, due to
inadequate bookkeeping at STAMICO.

Once the exploration of                       Cowpleted in December,              The study concluded that the
Kabulo Ridge was completed,                   1987.                               existing Ilima mine and the

including the existing lime
mine, Chinese assisted Kiwirs
mine under construction and a
new mine at Kabulo Ridge.
Comments:
(a)  The production of Ilima and Kiwira mines alone, at their current design
capacity of 10,000 and 110,000 tons of saleable coal per year respectively,
is likely to be sufficient to meet any market demand until late in 1990s.
(b)  Kiwira will be a very high cost mine and will sustain heavy financial loss.
(c)  Kabulo mine will be justified only if there is a pit head thermal power generation.
