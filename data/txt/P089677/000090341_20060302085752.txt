                            Loanand ProgramSummary

Borrower:      Kingdom of Morocco

Amount:         98.6 million (US$l20 million equivalent)

Terms:         Libor-based Fixed Spread Loan, commitment linked, annuity maturity type,
               repayable in20 years, including eight years o f grace period.

Description:   The Government's public administration reform program, consists of
               specific actions spreading over at least six years (2003-2008 in the current
               matrix) and aiming at: (a) improving Government efficiency in the
               management      of    budget   resources    through    greater  transparency,
               accountability, and by introducingperformance measurement; (b) improving
               Government efficiency in the management o f human resources (HR)
               through the preparation of new management system for staffing and
               remuneration with performance measurement, and streamlining current
               human resources management (HFW); and (c) actions consolidating and
               controlling public payrollevolution.

               The proposed loan will be the second in a series o f annual programmatic
               loans supporting the implementation of the reform program. The proposed
               loan i s complemented and strengthened by the ongoing multiyear
               Programmatic Economic Sector Work (P-ESW) activity through which the
               Bank i s providing the Government with advice, training, and technical
               assistance as required in the areas o f budgetary management, civil service
               reform, and wage bill containment.

Benefits:      The major benefit o f the operation i s the improvement of the effectiveness
               o f public resources management. By beginningto address some o f the main
               constraints affecting the effectiveness o f public service delivery, the PARL
               program will contribute to private sector development and to improving the
               living standards o fthe population. By contributing to keepingthe wage bill
               under control, the program will help ensure macroeconomic stability and
               fkee fiscal space for other expenditures.

Risks:         The main expected risk i s that the objective set for payrollas apercentage o f
               gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 will not be reached.              So far,
               Government has managed to control numbers o f employees by banning
               additional hiring since 1996, despite pressure from sectors and trade unions,
               but has not been in the position to avoid massive promotions leading to
               wage bill increase. This risk i s being mitigated by the ongoing reform
               program,     which changes promotion regulation and modifies the
               remuneration system. Another riski s that the implementationof the reforms
               would be stalled, as was the case in the past, because of opposition from



                                            i

               interest groups. The risk i s mitigated by the political coordination put in
               place by the Cabinet to implement reforms, lead regular dialogue with trade
               unions and by the strategic policy dialogue pursued between Moroccan
               authorities and the Bank. Along with key partners, an extensive supervision
               o f the implementation of the reforms by the Bank, together with the
               knowledge sharing and technical assistance entailed by a continuation o f the
               P-ESWsupport, will help mitigate bothrisks.

Disbursements: The proposed Loan would be disbursed in one installment upon Loan
               effectiveness.

                    A PROPOSEDSECONDPUBLICADMINISTRATION
                               DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                             TO THE KINGDOM OFMOROCCO


1.      The proposed loan to the Kingdom o f Morocco for  98.6 million (US$120 million
equivalent) would be the second in a series o f three single-tranche Programmatic Development
Policy Loans (P-DPL) that build on the public administration reform framework initiated by the
government in 2003. A first loan was approved by the Bank Board on July 1, 2004. The
objectives o f the proposed loan are to support the Government's continuous efforts to improve the
effectiveness o f publicresource management, a key step for increasing growth and improvingthe
quality o f public services.    The reform program supported by the P-DPLs includes three
components: (a) budgetary reforms designed to improve the efficiency o f public expenditure, (b)
a reform of civil service management, and (c) measures to keep the wage bill at a sustainable
level over time. All three components have both short term impacts on the current management
systems and longer term effects resulting in a structural change in these systems. Inparallel, the
reform program i s supported by a P-ESW activity through which the Bank i s providing the
Government with advice, training, and knowledge transfer as requiredin the areas o f budgetary
management, civil service reform, and wage bill containment.

2.      Under the first P-DPL, Public Administration Reform loan, PARL 1', implementation of
the reform program proceeded satisfactorily, even though some components o f the reform
experienced delays. There i s a high degree of ownership, with the Prime Minister's office
following it closely and requesting frequent progress reports. An Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) was completed in June 30, 2005, which concurs with this broad assessment. An
Operations EvaluationDepartment (OED) review has confirmed the main conclusions of the ICR.

3.       The proposed loan is closely coordinatedwith the European Union (EU) and the African
Development Bank (AfDB). The EUhas granted support in the form o f a Structural Adjustment
Grant of 79 million, to be disbursedinfour yearly tranches. The negotiation o f PARL I1would
coincide with the EU's review o f its third-tranche disbursement. The AfDB has approved a first
budget support loan of 100 million units of account in 2004, and it i s now preparing a second
loan. The borrower has requested that the Bank Loan be a Libor-based Fixed-Spread Loan,
commitment linked, annuity maturity type, repayable in 20 years, including a grace period of
eight years. Itwould be disbursed inone installment upon effectiveness.


                          I.COUNTRYANDECONOMICCONTEXT
                                         COUNTRYCONTEXT

4.       Morocco i s a lower-middle-income country with a population o f about 30 million and a
gross national income per capita estimated at US$1,500 in 2004. Agriculture still retains a key
role in the economy, with a share o f GDP at around 15 percent over the last 10 years, and
employing some 40 percent o f the labor force, compared to 25 percent and 35 percent for industry

 'Whenthe  first loan (PAFU I)fthis series was approvedby the Board, inJuly 2004, the Bank hadnot yet
                              o
created the lending instrument (DPL) now in use for the proposed loan. The acronym o f the program,
PARL, has therefore been kept for easier reference notably in-country, hence the name PARL11.


                                                    1

and services, respectively. The economy i s relatively open, with exports and imports amounting
to about 70 percent of GDP. Europe remains Morocco's major trading partner, and important
exports include phosphates and phosphate derivatives, textiles, fresh and processed food, and
tourism.

5.      Economic growth averaged only 2.5 percent per year during the 1990~~             and was
characterized by high volatility originating from output swings in drought-stricken agnculture.
Nonagricultural growth was less volatile-3.3    percent on average during the period-reflecting
stagnant private investment and Morocco's failure to take advantage of the growth inworld trade
during the 1990s. This same period witnessed the firming up of macro stability, with budget
deficits averaging 3.5 percent of GDP, declining external debt, and inflation rates-underpinned
by a fixed exchange rate-convergingtoward 2 percent by the endofthe decade.

6.       On the social front, although improving, social indicators are still lagging behind
comparator countries. Many indicators such as life expectancy, access to basic infrastructure, and
school enrolment rates have improved steadily over the last few years. But Morocco still has a
way to go to reach comparable countries interms o f poverty, equity, health, and education. First
results of the 2001 consumption survey show that poverty has declined to 17 percent down from
19 percent registered in 1998/99. World Bank projections indicate that poverty probably
decreased to 15 percent by 2004, given the strong agricultural performance of the past few years.
But there remain significant economic and social disparities both between and within rural and
urban regions, and between men and women. Inresponse to these persistent social deficiencies,
King Mohammed VI launched in May 2005 a National Initiative for Human Development in
order to scale-up the fight on poverty and exclusion, aiming at improving human development
indicators inthe mediumterm.

                          POLITICAL AND ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

7.       Morocco stands out inthe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for its political
opening. Broad political changes have been manifested in free and fair elections, a flourishing
civil   society-including    thousands    of   development     and   advocacy     nongovernmental
organizations-a    dynamic press corps, and recent reforms o f the family law -- the Moudawana   --
that greatly advancesthe rights o f women and encourages a more inclusive society.

8.       Macroeconomic stability has been preserved, in spite o f internal and external shocks, but
growth has been volatile and insufficient to make a dent on unemployment and poverty
significantly. Inthe 2000s, Moroccohas consolidated its macroeconomic stability, strengthened
its external position, and developed several structural reforms. As a result, inflationremains low
(1.6 percent on average), and the external position i s at a comfortable level (about 10 months of
imports), supported by high and steady inflows o f remittances, tourism receipts, and foreign
direct investment (FDI) inflows. Structural changes are under way in many areas, including
customs reform, financial sector consolidation, telecom privatization, and apculture, public
sector modernization and trade liberalization. However, the economy achieved only an average 4
percent growth rate during 2000-04. Modest growth rates were due to the variability o f the
agricultural output, the slow transformation o f national savings into high-productivity
investments, and the weak competitive position o f Moroccan firms in the global economy.
Combining growth rates with a large number o f new entrants to the labor force has not permitted
a significant reduction in the level of urban unemployment: urban unemployment fell to 18.7
percent in 2004, after it peaked at 22 percent in 1999. Moreover, the unemployment rate still i s
high, particularly among the young (34 percent), the educated (26 percent), and women (25




                                                 2

percent). Reduction in poverty rates was also modest, declining from 19 percent in 1999 to an
estimated 15 percent in 2004.

9.       Efforts to consolidate public finances have been undermined by a series of exceptional
wage increases, subsidy expenditures mostly related to oil since 2003, arrears clearance and a
weak revenue performance. Consequently, fiscal deficits have increased and remain large2 --
averaging 5.4 percent o f GDP during 2000-04. A rising wage bill attained 12.8 percent o f GDP
in2004, upfrom 12percent in2000. This resultedfrom gradual wage increases to civil servants
and security personnel amounting to 3.4 percent of 2004 GDP, most o f which have been applied
over a period of 3 years.3 Subsidy expenditures amounted to 1.6percent o f GDP on average over
the 2000-2004 period, and clearance o f arrears averaged 1 percent o f GDP over 2001-2003. For
their part, weak revenue performance -- down from 26.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 25.1 percent
in 2004 -- was, mainly caused by declining customs duties4 -- owing to free-trade agreement
implementation -- and tax-exemptions, and also contributed to large deficits. As a result, the
composition of public expenditure has shifted in favor o f current outlays. The share o f current
expenditure' within total expenditure has risen from 53 percent in 2000 to about 59 percent in
2004. Payroll alone increasedby almost 4 percentage points over the same period (from 38 to 42
percent).

10.      An active debt management has helped reduce service payments and the public debt
stock, while improving its maturity and currency composition and increasing investor confidence.
Total external government debt steadily decreased from 34 percent o f GDP in 2000 to an
estimated 16 percent in 2004, partly as a result o f substituting external debt for domestic debt.
Excess liquidity, following large capital inflows, contributed to lower domestic interest rates,
which made domestic debt more attractive. Bilateral debt swaps for investment, signed with
donors, also reducedthe public debt stock. Consequently, domestic debt has increased from42 to
51 percent of GDP over the same period. Overall, public debt fell from 76 percent of GDP in
2000 to 67 percent in 2004. In2005, Morocco's public debt ratings were upgraded to one step
below investment grade.

11.      In2005, the fiscal deficit isprojectedto reach6.8 percentofGDP, mainly reflecting one-
o f f severance payment of the Early Retirement Program (EW, which involved 38,600 civil
servants, see Annex I11and paragraph 60), higher than projected oil subsidies, and exceptional
outlays related to the drought (see Table 1). The one-off net impact o f severance payments
related to the early retirement program is equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP (or to 1.7 percent o f
GDP innet terms, when including wage savings from staff retiredby midyear and equivalent to
0.4 percent o f GDP) (see Table 2). Higher expenditures would also result from higher petroleum
subsidies (1 percentage point despite two increases o f domestic fuel prices):      exceptional outlays
to deal with the negative impact o f the drought (around 0.5 percent o f GDP). This outcome
would occur despite a projected increase in revenues to 26.3 percent of GDP compared to 25
percent in 2004; mostly due to higher-than-budgeted value-added tax (VAT) revenues and
personal and business income taxes. The financing o f the fiscal deficit and the recognition of

expenditures o fthe HassanI1Fund.
 MAD8.8 billion over 2000-2002 period, MAD5 billionin2003, and MAD2.3 billion in2004. The last
round of exceptional salary-increase negotiations began in 1996 and ended inearly 2005. Successive wage
increases led to an additional cost ofMAD23.5 billion, or 5.3 percent of 2004 GDP.
 Customsduties declined by 1percentage point of GDP during 2000-04.
 Wages and other expenditures on goods and services.
 The two 2005 fuel price increases occurred on May 15 and August 7, spanning from 11percent for Super
to 38 percent for Industrial Fuel.

arrears to the pension fund (amounting to 2.4 percent of GDP) will temporarily increase the
public-debt-to-GDP ratio to around 71.4 percent of GDP, up from 67 percent registered in 2004.
Projected lower fiscal deficits from 2006, aiming to reach the mediumterm target o f 3 percent of
GDP set by the authorities, should also bring this ratio to gradually decline to 66.5 percent by
2008.

                     MEDIUM-TERM          MACROECONOMICAND FISCAL              OUTLOOK

12.      Taking into account the Government program and the developments underlying the
PARL, the macroeconomic outlook i s positive, supportedby fiscal consolidation and continuation
o f structural reforms. From 2006 onward (see Table 2), economic growth should recover to 4
percent on average, with exports and domestic demand its main driving forces. Inflation should
also remain low, which would improve Moroccan competitiveness. Increasingtax revenues and
reducing current public outlays should strengthen fiscal sustainability.              Continuous structural
reforms and public investment ininfrastructure would foster private investment and productivity,
especially inexport sectors. Improvingthe business environment by makingthe labor code more
conducive for businesses, overhauling the judicial system, and improving access to land and
financing for small and medium enterprises should help improve investor confidence and growth
potential. Although the trade deficit could widen further, and the current accounts turn into
marginal deficits, the external position will remain solid in view o f upward trends o f workers'
remittances, tourism receipts, and FDIflows, with international reserves amounting to more than
nine months of imports. As a benefit of an improved fiscal stance, public debt should remain
sustainable inthe mediumterm and continue declining to reach 66.5 percent o f GDP by the end

of 2008. The widening of regional integration should also improve prospects of higher FDI
inflows and export-oriented investments, improving the competitive stance of Morocco and
strengthening i t s external position.

13.     More in particular on the fiscal outlook, the projected phasing out o f the privatization
receipts i s leading authorities to adopt urgent fiscal measures to put the budget on a sustainable
path. After having represented an annual average o f about 1.5 percent o f GDP in the last 12
years, privatization receipts are phasing out from 2005, which makes fiscal adjustment a top
priority for the next few years. To preserve fiscal consolidation, Authorities are committed to
gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 percent o f GDP by 2009. Before elections take place in
2007, front-loaded and decisive actions are needed to increase revenues, reverse expansionary
payroll weight and liquidate existing arrears. Exceptional financing required by shocks like the
locust attacks, the Al-Hoceima earthquake, hikes in world petroleum prices, and the drought, add
to the need for urgent budgetary adjustments inorder to create a cushion to absorb with flexibility
such unforeseenshocks.

14.     Further measures are expected on the revenue side to broaden the tax base, simplify the
system, and continue strengthening its administration. The neededrevenue consolidation calls for
broader fiscal reform in line with the recommendations o f a 2004 International Monetary Fund
(IMF) study requestedby the Government. The IMFproposed changes intax policy to simplify
the tax structure and reduce fiscal exemptions. Inthis regard, the 2006 Budget L a w contains an
Annex with the main findings o f a 2005 study, financed by the EU, on tax exemptions and other
"tax expenditure" mechanisms. Those studies findings should help the authorities make informed
decisions with regardto the exemption schemes to be scaled down or abolished inthe future.

15.      The ongoing reform o f public administration supported by this loan aims at addressing
the expenditure side. The actions supported by the proposed loan are instrumental to reversing
the previous expansionary trend in current expenditures, in particular the wage bill, while
increasing the efficiency o f the civil service and the impact o f government service delivery. The
gradual implementation o f the public administration reform program supported by PARL I1
implies a reduction o f the wage bill to below 12.1 percent o f GDP in 2006, with a view to
reaching the programmed medium-tern target o f 11.5 percent in 2008. Achieving such target
will not be easy, however, given the present sizable cut inthe payroll andthe sensitivity to further
downsizing, pressures for new rehiring, and possible salary increases inan electoral year.

16.      The Government has confirmed its commitment to continue reducing payroll and
expenditures to a target 11.5 percent o f GDP in 2008. Overall, the early retirement program
(ERP) would generate sizable net fiscal savings estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP fkom 2006
(Table 3). The present value o f the total contribution required by the pension fimd to meet the
additional outlays that it will incur over 30 years before all the voluntary retirees had reachedthe
normal retirement age (60 years) i s estimated at 2.2 percent o f 2005 GDP. The authorities are
considering paying a lump sum amount in four installments o f MAD 2 billion each starting in
2006 to compensate for these additional outlays. The budget will also incur a marginal loss in
personal income tax o f about 0.1 percent of GDP in2005. Following the early departure o f civil
servants, a complementary agenda streamlining civil service personnel will consolidate ERP
results through the continuation of a zero net recruitment policy, freezing of exceptional wage
increases, and enactment o f improved civil servant recruitment, remuneration, and promotion
statutes.

17.      Insum, the Government has taken significant actions to consolidate its public finances,
including a sizable reduction o f the wage bill, and other actions are also considered. These
actions include the overhauling o f the subsidies system. The authorities still need to carry out the
decision taken in the 2005 Budget L a w to dismantle the sugar and flour subsidy systems by
progressively liberalizing their respective markets.     Finally, they are also reconsidering the
petroleum pricing indexation system, whereby variations inworld petroleumprices are passed on
to domestic prices. This will allow making significant savings by balancing the Petroleum
Compensation Fundand reducing significantly expenditure volatility and arrears accumulations.

       11. GOVERNMENT'SPUBLICADMINISTRATIONREFORMPROGRAM

                                       PUBLIC SECTOR ISSUES

18.      Public administration i s characterized by excessive centralization which has resulted in
slow program implementation. The culture o f centralism inMorocco applies not only to budget
procedures, but also to the way central Ministries deal with the operations o f their branch offices.
The .public expenditure management system i s basically sound, as was documented by the
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) completed in2003. Expenditure controls,
reporting, and auditing are all solid, including for human resources financial management.

 19.     Civil service i s managed according to a tenure and corps system, with pay scales and
grades specific to each corps and with few performance incentives. It inhibits staff redeployment,
impedes administrative decentralization, and prevents the effective use o f a merit-based
compensation system. Pay raises and promotions are usually decided based on seniority and
collective bargaining. A s a result o f the latter, a number o f wage increases, called "exceptional
promotions" because they are not statutory, have been granted to sometimes large groups
(teachers for instance) and have ledto increases insalaries and even more so inbonuses (see para.
 10). These actions triggered discussions on salary realignment across the civil service to preserve
relative pay levels on behalf o f staff in Ministries or corps that had not received the same
adjustment.     The last of these adjustments occurred in 2004 and ended the process o f
"competitive realignment," which spans five years, to reach its full impact in 2006. The
dynamics o f the "exceptional" promotions, which were the main factor for the wage bill increase
for the last five years, are now under control. Every corps inthe civil service has had an increase.




                                                   7

20.      The cost o f the system as a whole i s high' although civil service merely consists o f 7
percent o f the labor force. The wage bill increase i s the reflection of recruitment policies, pay
raises resulting from collective bargaining, and "exceptional promotions. Gross public wage
increased at a rate of 5.4 percent during 1990-2002, while the minimumwage evolved at a lower
rate o f 5.1 percent. Considering the 3.8 percent inflation rate for the period, the increase for
public employees was around 1.6 percent inreal terms per year after 1984.

                                        PROGRAM   OVERVIEW

21.      The Government's public administration reform program, as reflected in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex I), o f specific actions spreading over at least six years
                                     consists
(extending to 2008 in the latest matrix) and aiming at: (a) improving Government efficiency in
the management of budget resources through greater transparency, accountability, and by
introducing performance measurement; (b) improving efficiency in the HRM through the
preparation o f a new management system for staffing and remuneration including performance
evaluation, and streamlining current HRM; and (c) actions consolidating and controlling public
payroll.

22.      Three actions already taken under PARL Ihave set the reform program on sound
grounds: (a) in budget resources management, the introduction o f budget flexibility associated
with performance indicators in 14Ministries representing 40 percent o f the budget; (b) inHRM,
the development of strategic staffing frameworks (rbfbrentiel des emplois et compktences, REC)
in key Ministries, as the basis for far-reaching civil service reform; and (c) in wage bill
consolidation and control, a successful early retirement program which has resulted in the early
retirement o f about 7 percent o f the work force over a period o f only one year, and has generated
net budget savings sufficient to bringthe weight o f the wage bill down from 12.8 percent o f gross
domestic product (GDP) in2005 to a projected 11.5 percent in2008 (see Annex 110.

23.      All elements of the reform are interrelated: for instance, de-concentration, RECs and
performance contracts between branch offices and central administrations condition each other's
contribution to the empowerment o f branch offices. The development o f MTEFs (medium term
expenditure fi-amework) for sectors is consistent with result-based budgeting at the sector level,
butwould not make sense without a comprehensive consolidated macro MTEFand will need the
REC results to document provisions for staffing over three years, thus also contributing to wage
bill control. Implementing the recommendations o f the RECs both for adequate staffing and
professional skdls improvements o f staff, will be instrumental to ensure that branch offices can
live up to the challenge, and that personnel is well trained to implement the budget reform
activities. Finally, the reform path has been designed in such a way that the same major line
Ministries are involved in the testing phase of the various reforms: namely, the Ministries o f
Education, Health, Public works and possibly Agriculture, which has already completed its REC
and is part o f the budget flexibility experiment.

24.      A s mentioned earlier, all three components have both a short term impact on the current
management systems and longer term effects resulting in a structural change in these systems.
Although some are short term adjustments of current bottlenecks inthe current systems, they still
 contribute to the preparation o f more structural changes, notably by creating a change culture.
The time horizon o f the program, as reflected inthe DPL, has been extended from 2006 to 2008
 inorder to allow for morestructural results toreacha criticalmass, evenifnotfully completedby


  For 1996-2000, the wage bill reached 10.7 percent of GDP, compared to 8.5 percent of GDP in similar-
 income countries.

2008, such as: (a) for budget management reform, the general and sector MTEFs, budget
flexibility, de-concentration and performance audit; and (b) in the case o f HRM reform, the
completion of the strategic staffing plans and their actual use, and the initiation o f an in-depth
reform o fremuneration and promotions. The expected outcome of the whole program i s a critical
mass of changes in public sector behavior and management which will generate, in the medium
term, better public services to the populationwithin a stable macroeconomic environment.

     SUB-PROGRAMA: IMPROVEGOVERNMENTALEFFICIENCY INBUDGET                         RESOURCES
                                            MANAGEMENT

25.       The program aims at strengthening macroeconomic management and improving the
quality o f public services by increasing efficiency o f public spending. Three main reforms have
been adopted to reach these goals:


             0   introducing a medium-term perspective to allow for policies and strategies to be
                 reflected fully by the budget while keeping the macro-economic situation as a
                 known and shared constraint;

             0   increasing progressively but steadily the autonomy and responsibility o f line
                 Ministries and their branch offices to allow for sector policies and strategies to be
                 actually designed and implemented as closely as possible to the end-user o f
                 public service; and

             0   introducing a set o f incremental measures building on the solid base o f public
                 financial management to streamline some processes while introducing
                 performance-based budget management and audit.

This section details the early results ofthe reformprogram and the expected steps under PAFUI1
inthe three mainreformareas.

Component A.l: Greater visibility of policies and their medium-term budgetary
implications, placingbudgetary allocation decisionsina multi-year framework

26.       The Government is developing a three-year rolling Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) in order to reinforce consistency between the macroeconomic framework
and the sector strategies.       Policies and their medium-term implications thus place budget
allocations in a multi-year and multi-sector perspective. The option has been to have both a three
year rolling medium term fiscal framework (tableau des opdrationsJinanci8res de 1'Etat, MTFF),
regularly updated, and sector MTEFs. The roll-out i s planned to be progressive. Still, making an
MTEF fully effective will require a complex set o f changes to the businessproceduresand inthe
behavior o f key ministers and the Cabinet. This will require a sustained effort and commitment
from the Government, extending over several years.

27.       The final objective i s to reach the stage o f an initial aggregated MTEF, providingbudget
ceilings and taking into account sector MTEFs, inter-sector priorities, and financial constraints
identified by the MTFF. These MTEFs should make changes o f policies more transparent.
Credit allocations would be presented by large programs. Ultimately, sector MTEFs, revised
after budget arbitrations, will be integral part o f the budget preparationprocess, when the whole
process will have been settled and consolidated.




                                                    9

28.      Promess under PARL I.Delays have occurred inthe adoption of a methodology for the
MTEF,while waiting for the adoptionofthe TORs for the Commissionincharge ofpreparingthe
methodology of the MTEF. With the help o f the P-ESW, which provided the Moroccans with a
perspective on best practice abroad, and helped with its adaptation to Morocco, the authorities
have agreed on a methodology reflected in a draft Terms of Reference (TORs) for an ad hoc
commission. The Prime Minister has issued a letter appointingmembers of the Commission and
giving them their TORs (a trigger for PAl2L 11):the commission is composed o f the Ministries of
Finance and Privatization (MFP), Education, Public works and Transport, and Health.

29.      Program under PARL 11. The role of the Commission i s to design the details o f the
methodology and to supervise the development of the instrument. During a pilot phase (2005-
06), four Ministries (Education, Health, Housing, Public Works) will have developed full sector
MTEFs, which will be used for 2007 budget preparation and updated in order to reflect changes
after budget arbitrations. A consolidated MTEF will be prepared for the 2007 budget, to be
presented to a Cabinet meeting focused on discussion of broad budget orientations,         After
evaluation o f the pilot period, the method for sector MTEFs will be extended to all other
Ministries in 2007 for the preparation of the 2008 budget, and updated according to budget
arbitrations. The MTFFwill be integral part of the budgetdecision process.

Component A.2: Greater responsibility for             deconcentrated offices    in budgetary
programming and execution, with a focus on results and accountability

30.      In2005, the MFP revisedits budgetpresentation andbudgetnomenclature, to adapt itto
the new features of budget management. Now the budget presentation is more geared toward
performance-oriented budgeting. In addition, the 2006 budget i s presentingappropriations on a
regional basis to allow Parliamentarians to assess progress made in the de-concentration o f
functions. Conversely, the development of performance indicators has made progress inparallel
with the newbudget flexibility.


         1.     Introducing Budget Flexibility and Performance Indicators

31.      The Government i s progressively increasing budget management autonomy for line
Ministries and branch offices through budget flexibility (globalisation), which consists of a
greater aggregation o f budget allocations, first within one grouping o f items or "paragraph"
(paragraphe) for investment and some non-salary current expenditures. This greater flexibility
allows managers to reallocate freely within this grouping of items, without having to request ex-
ante authorization fkom the MFP. Although it has been an official decision to move toward
flexible budgeting, its implementation by individual Ministries i s done on a voluntary basis.
When a Ministryis ready to join, and has submitted its budget with performance indicators, the
MFP signs a Ministerial order (arr2tk) confirming that managers in that Ministry can reallocate
resources within individual paragraphs (separately within the capital expenditures and non-
personnel current expenditures sections; no such flexibility i s allowed for personnel
expenditures).

32.      Proness under PARL I.The Ministry o f Health was the first pilot in 2002, and was
joined by four others (Planning, Finance, Fisheries, and Agriculture) in2004. Now performance
budgeting i s being implemented by 14 Ministries representing more than 40 percent o f the
Government's capital budget. Pilot Ministries have started experimenting with a contractual
approach by which central offices and field offices agree on a "performance contract" specifying
mutual obligations.


                                                10

33.      Program under PARL 11. The program in 2006 will aim at generalizing the approach to
most Ministries, to extend performance contracts within the 14pilot Ministries, and to extend the
flexibility of the use o f appropriations within the agencies. Tools for performance management
are being introduced. Ministries engagedin the new approach are preparingyearly "performance
reports."

         2.      Increasing Branch Offices Responsibility in BudgetManagement

34.       The reform program supported by PARL i s aimed at starting a process to change an over-
centralized environment, by devolving more responsibilities to regional and provincial branch
offices o f Ministries. The approach to this objective has been twofold: setting de-concentration
as a Government priority policy, by adopting a decree setting a de-concentration policy
framework, and creating de-concentration tools inevery Ministry.

35.       Promess under PARL I.First, a decree (a trigger for PARL 11)has been adopted, which
codifies inbroad lines the organization of Ministries, and the allocation of units, responsibilities,
and staff between the center and the field. It states as a general principle that implementation
functions should be carried out in field offices while central administrations should keep only
conceptual, strategic, and regulatory functions. Second, a letter from the Prime Minister in 2004
asked Ministries to prepare de-concentration master plans and established a de-concentration
committee to evaluate the master plans and give recommendations for their clearance. So far,
only two Ministries have submitted their master plan; the other Ministries have wanted to wait for
the decree to make sure their master plan would be inaccordancewith it.

36.       Program under PARL 11. De-concentration master plans will provide a detailed
description o f the list o fresponsibilitiesto be devolved to branch offices, includingthe categories
of expenditures to be managed at the de-concentrated level. Performance contracts specify
responsibilities and budget allocations, and will be audited. The movement will gain momentum
in2006, with the adoption of4 master plans and performance contracts with the relevantbranch
offices (Education, Health, Public works, and Housing), seven more in2007 and extension to all
other Ministries in 2008. They should feed the RECs while their implementation would benefit
from the staffingproposals from these same RECs.


Component A.3: Improving the performance of public administration through the
introductionof internalauditing, evaluation, andperformancecontrol

          1.     Introducing Perform anceAuditing

37.       Promess under P       a I.Efforts under this sub-component have focused on better
specifying the quality of the performance information, its collection, andhowperformanceresults
can be evaluated. Under the aegis of the Finance General Inspectors (inspection gdndrale des
finances, IGF), authorities have started to codify the practice o f performance auditing of
government agencies. However, there have been delays in the preparation of a manual for
performance auditing, due to delays inprocurement. Issues are now resolved, and the manual is
expectedto be adopted early in2006, andtraining o f internal auditors to start now.

38.       Programunder PARL 11. In2006, 50 inspectors o f the Ministerial General Inspectorates
(inspectionsgdndrales des minist&es, IGM) will be trained inthe basics ofperformance auditing.
It is also expected that a performance audit manual will be delivered inApril 2006, and will be
following internationalstandards for public sector auditing. Inspectors from boththe IGFand the


                                                   11

14 IGMs will then be trained with this manual. Finally, joint IGF/IGM performance audit
missions will be conducted in the 14 pilot Ministries who have adopted flexible budgeting. The
same sequence will repeat itself in 2007, this time for 20 pilot Ministries and IGMs. It i s
expected that by 2008, all IGMswill be able to conduct performance audits by themselves.

         2.      Improving CurrentBasic PFM systems
39.      This section of the program aims at consolidatingthe basic functions of Public Financial
Management in Morocco, thus making sure that the gradual reforms envisioned above are not
prevented or slowed by the current system while preservingits existing soundness.

40.      Prom-ess under PARL I.The office of the General Comptroller (contrdleur gknkral de
I'engagement de dkpenses de I'Etat, CGED).has launched the development o f an integrated
personnel expenditure control software (syst8me de gestion intkgrie du personnel de 1'Etat,
GIPE),which will facilitate the control function for comptrollers and lineMinistries, and result in
a shortening o f lags related to expenditure control. Manuals for procurement and expenditure
controls have also been prepared and disseminated by the CGED (a trigger for PARL 11) and
resulted in the training o f 5,200 agents in both control offices and line Ministries. The General
Treasurer of the Kingdom has conducted a study on its branch offices procedures, and
implementedreforms, which have already resultedinshortening payment delays.

41.      A draft decree on government accounting has been prepared, which revises both the
modalities of controls by the accountant and provides a new accounting plan.                  The new
accounting methodology will be a partial accrual accounting. The General Accounting Office has
also revised its approach to the development of an integrated budget management system
(systzme de gestion intkgrke de la dkpense, GID). The new system has been tested on three
Ministries in 2005 (Interior, Finance, and Health).           A computerized platform to exchange
budgetary information will be inplace inJune 2006. The next phase will consist in choosing the
technical option.

42.      Prom-amunder PARL 11. Testing o f GID will be extended to other Ministries in2006. It
i s estimated that the system could be fully operational by 2010. GIPE should be put in place at
the CGED level in 2006, and progressively rolled-out in line Ministries beginning in 2007. The
MFP has decidedto go a step further in the overhaul of its expenditure management system by
launching a study to review the coherence and efficacy o f the expenditure circuit and the various
ex ante controls. Its objective i s to assess ifit can go further inthe streamlining o f the controls by
eventually eliminating redundant functions in the present setting. This study, which i s being
added to the reform program, should be available early in2006. An action plan to implement its
recommendations will be designed in2006 and implementedprogressively.

       SUB-PROGRAMB: IMPROVE GOVERNMENTAL                  EFFICIENCYINHUMAN       RESOURCES
                                            MANAGEMENT

43.      The objectives of the program are to transform the current civil service by putting
competences and performance at the core o f the new system while keeping a career system. It
also creates modernHRMtools to adapt civil service to key public sector missions and to manage
staff ina more efficient manner. The new remuneration system, together with the mainstreaming
of the RECs, will be a key achievement inthe overall HR reformprogram. The programhas both
an in-depthstructural reform component, which will transform civil service architecture when all
activities are completed; and a component aiming at easing current management constraints, and
mitigating immediate risks for the wage bill:




                                                    12

        preparing a new HRM system by (i)developing a REC in each Ministry to improve
        consistency between staffing and missions; (ii)creating a new job classification; (iii)
        preparing a new remuneration based in part on performance and the new job
        classification; and

    0   streamlining the current HRM system by (i)improving recruitment and mobility, (ii)
        changing rules for evaluation and promotion, and (iii)strengthening professional in-
        service training.

ComponentB.l: Preparationof the new managementsystem

        1.       Strategic Staffing Frameworks

44.     The REC represents the cornerstone of the civil service reform since it will provide
Morocco with the tools to: (a) adapt structures and staff to each Ministry's missions, therefore
help de-concentration to branch offices; (b) createjob families to replace the existing corps and
cadres, with a view to ease the current constraints of statutory management; (c) evaluate
individuals' performance more accurately, thus allowing for performance-based promotion; (d)
design training plans, so that staff can adapt to new demands, notably the new budget
management system and de-concentration; (e) organize redeployment of staff, as a companion to
de-concentration and a tool for service delivery improvement; and (0 provide a sound analysis
and agreedprinciples for areformo f the current remunerationsystem.

45.     The full impact of the RECs, through better organization andmore accurate staffing, and
the introduction o f the new promotion and remuneration system, should ensure better wage bill
predictability. Major management tools generated by the RECs are rolling staff management
score-cards, HR databases, and rolling in-service training plans. The Government expects to have
a critical mass o f findings by the end of 2007 to start reengineering public administration and
civil service organization.

46.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. RECs in the Ministries o f
Agriculture and Public works (a trigger for PARL 11) have been completed, and RECs have
started inMFP and the Ministry o f Modernization of Public Sectors (MMSP), another trigger for
PARL 11. The major Ministries in terms of variety o f jobs and of numbers will have completed
their REC by end-2007, thus ensuring that RECs inthe following seven Ministries: Public works,
Agnculture, Education, Health, MFP, MMSP, Interior and Justice will then cover at least 80
percent of total civil service. All other Ministries will start their REC in2007. Completion o f the
RECprocess inthe first four Ministries in2006 and starting it inan additional four Ministries in
2006 have therefore been selectedas triggers for PARL 111.

         2.      New Job Classification

47.      The corps and cadres system i s expected to be deeply changed with the new job family
system. This new job classification is meant to by-pass the constraints o f the current 70 or so
statutes, which among other negative effects impede mobility, encourage esprit de corps and fuel
inter-corps competition for pay raises, because corps are anxious to preserve the gaps between
theirrespective remunerations.

48.      Promess under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. New jobs families are emerging
fiom the REC process, and the MMSP i s beginningthe job classification. Inthe meanwhile, the
MMSP has also managed to unify 22 statutes into three for all administrative jobs (a trigger for



                                                  13

PARL 11). It i s expected that the three corresponding decrees will be adoptedby Government in
2006. With the progress inthejob classification work statute unification i s not relevant anymore.

        3.       New Remuneration System

49.      The current remuneration system in Morocco has been distorted by ad hoc pay raises in
the form o f bonuses to each and every corps successively, a process initiated in 1996 and
concluded in 2005, whichreaches its full impact in2006. As a result, today payroll consists of a
low base salary, and up to 60 percent of the overall remuneration in bonuses in some instances.
Designing a new remuneration system that will result in a more predictable and slow growing
wage bill is a priority.

50.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. The Government has finalized
terms of reference of a major study to reform the remuneration system. This study should
provide Government with diagnosis and proposals to rationalize the structure of remuneration
first, by reintegrating as muchas possible of current bonuses inbase salaries in2006, and second
proposals for a new remuneration system (a trigger for PARL 111), informed by preliminary
results of the RECs ( i.e. job families and positions).

ComponentB.2: Reformofthe current managementsystem

51.      While the above mentioned reforms are far reaching and require time and a long
preparation, the current HRMsystem can bear short terms improvements, which will ease current
bottlenecks while inuring civil servants and civil service to changes inHRM and lower risks on
current payroll control. The law and the decrees which allow reforms o f recruitment, mobility,
redeployment, evaluation and promotion have been adopted. The next period will be devoted to
the implementation o fthese reforms.

         1.       Recruitment andMobility

52.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. A law modifying the General
Statute of Civil Service, by instating two major concepts, competitive exam as the recruitment
rule, and contract employment, provides immediate tools to improve civil service systems. It also
changes staffing rules, notably by instating mobility, secondment and re-deployment. Decrees
will be adopted in 2006 to specify implementation rules. The MMSP i s also creating a database
to provide all civil servants with information on employment opportunities.

          2.      Evaluation and Promotion

53.       Progress under PARL Iand proaamunder PARL 11. The new evaluation system reflects
the negotiation with unions, who have obtained a less radical change than initially planned. Still
the changes remain significant and provide a consensual basis for the renovated promotion
system. Performance has been instated as the prevailing criterion for promotion, and ceilings are
being applied to promotions as a percentage o f the eligrble population. The new system defuses
potential "exceptional" promotions demands by opening more promotion positions each year,
thus eliminatingthe bloatingofthe career systemat the last step ofthe scale. The new system of
evaluation will be implemented for 2006 performance. The PARL I1trigger, dissemination o f a
circular letter to implement this new system, has not been met, since it requires the decree to be
adopted first. A draft actionplan for the implementationo f the new system by end-2006 has been
communicatedto the Bank.

        3.      In-service Training

54.     Prowess under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. The PARL provides the
opportunity to rationalize and increase spending for in-service training, while de-linking
promotions from training. The decree presenting the training strategy has been approved by the
Cabinet. For its implementation, it i s plannedto the training budget to rise up to 1percent o f the
wage bill (usually it i s 3 percent in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries), by progressive steps. Training plans are parts o f the expected outputs o f the RECs,
and will progressively put in place following the progress in RECs. An evaluation o f the
planning experience will take place in2007.

              SUB-PROGRAM c:CONSOLIDATEAND CONTROL PUBLICPAYROLL

55.     Inthe short term, the Government has resorted to a number of measures to monitor and
lower the weight of public payroll: wage bill projections, early retirement program and limiting
the number o f yearly recruitment to the number o f regular retirees. Inthe medium term, the main
reforms o f the civil service management system supported by PARL will have a positive impact
onthe wage bill, through a combinationo f control o f staffnumbers andthe level of salaries:


    0   Ensuringsmaller public payroll inthe medium term: (a) RECs (which allow for staffing
        management), (b) mobility, (c) redeployment, and (d) in-service training.

    0   Ensuring that the ratio o f wage bill to GDP decrease in the medium term: (a) new
        remuneration system, (b) newjob classifications, (c) new performance evaluation system,
        (d) new promotion system, and (e) reformo fbudgetmanagement.

Component C.l: Civil service wage bill projections

56.     Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. Three year rolling projections o f
wage billhave been developed for 2005-08. Besides the impact o f the ERP, the main assumptions
underlining these projections consist o f a wage drift based on observed increase rate for normal
statutory promotion and a zero net recruitment. These projections will be updated.

Component C.2: Qualitative reprofiling of the civil service

        1.       Early Retirement Program (Em)

57.     Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. After an unsuccessful attempt in
2004, an early retirementprogram (ERP) scheme was implemented duringthe first six months o f
2005 with a more attractive severance package (see details in Annex 111). Retirement was
voluntary, although Ministries had the right to refuse applications when the positions were
considered crucial. The operation has been successful: more than 52,500 applications have been
received, o f which more than 38,800 have been accepted (38,500 by end of September 2005), or
about 7 percent of the work force, therefore reaching by end o f 2005 the target set for 2007.
Preliminary estimates (see table 3 above and Annex III) show in 2006 a gross 1percent o f GDP
saving on the wage bill. From 2006 on, the net yearly impact is an estimated saving of 0.6
percento f GDP.




                                                 15

         2.      Redeploymentof Existing Staff

58.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. Progress inRECs and adoption o f
the relevant legislation now allow for Government to re-deploy staff, notably from the over-
staffed areas to less well served areas. De-concentration o f recruitment should also help re-
deploy staff, while budget positions have consistently been re-deployed between Ministries:
positions liberated by regular retirement are eliminated by MFP, and reallocated to priority
sectors (education, health, security, and justice).      Conversely, the ERP has alleviated the
overstaffing in some areas (to be confirmed in the upcoming evaluation report). Yet, the M M S P
wants a more proactive stance to be taken, hence the addition o f this sub-component to the
program initially agreed under PARL I.

         3.       Ban on Specific Profiles

59.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. The progressive eradication o f
temporary positions will have a long-term impact by erasing a cause o f pressure for integration o f
these short-term (and low-skilled) employees into the permanent civil service.             The same
observation stands for the prohibition o fhiring staff inthe lower scales (1to 4) of civil service.

Component C.3: Stabilization of the number of civil servants

60.      Progress under PARL Iand program under PARL 11. The key to the continuous decline
of the relative weight of the civil service resides in the assurance by the Government that it will
strictly maintain: (a) the ceiling o f yearly recruitments; and (b) the new promotion system. For
the time being, Government has kept the limitation o fhiringto replacement o f positions freed by
normal retirement, as reaffirmed in every budget law since 1996, except for 2006, where it has
budgeted the hiring o f 12,000 new agents, compared to an expected 7,000 regular retirees. The
argument by the Government has been that 50 percent o f recruitments in 2006 were decided to
help the reform o f the military pension system, and fill the exceptional needs of security services.
Although the budgetary impact will be marginal, if such an exception were to be repeated, the
benefits  o f the ERP would rapidly vanish, leaving only as a legacy the cost o f the operation.
Therefore, the Prime Minister has issued a letter to the Minister o f Finance asking him, starting
with the 2007 budget, to take all necessary measures to ensure that the number of new positions
created be decided be referring to the number freed by those retiring at normal retirement age.
The objective i s to reduce the weight o fthe wage bill to 11.5 percent o f GDPby 2008.

                                 111. THE PROPOSEDPARLI1

                              LOAN     OBJECTIVESAND DESCRIPTION

 61.     The objectives of the proposed second Public Administration ReformLoan (PARL II)are
to continue support to the Government's efforts to improve the effectiveness o f public resource
management, a key step for accelerated growth and poverty reduction.

 62.     The proposed loan would be the second in a series of annual programmatic loans
 supporting implementation o f the reform program. It i s a single-tranche operation, and the key
 reform measures under PARL I(see triggers table for PARL 11below) have been met before
 Board presentation. Decisions on continuing financial support would be based on meeting a
number of triggers selected among the benchmarks as indicated in the action matrix covering
 2003-08 (see triggers table for PARL 111below). By negotiation o f PARL 11, eight out o f nine
 triggers have been met. The circular letter from M M S P for the new evaluation system will not

have been issued, the decree having been adopted in November 2005. In lieu, Government has
provided the Bank with a draft action plan for the implementation of this new method, which will
be implemented for the 2006 performance evaluation.

                                    Status of triggers for PARL I1

      The Borrower has:
  1. established, by a letter of the Prime Minister, a committee composed o f representatives o f the
      Ministry of Finance and Privatization of the Borrower and three (3) pilot Ministries, responsible
      for preparingthe methodology of the MTEF ("cadre de dipenses i moyen terme" or "CDMT');
  2. adopted Ministerial orders ("arr8tCs") extending budget flexibility to, respectively, twelve (12)
      Ministries o f the Borrower;

  3.  prepared and disseminated procedure manuals pertaining to monitoring and control o f
      procurement by the Borrower's        General Financial Controller ("Contr6Ze GBniraZ des
      Engagements et des Dipenses");

  4. submitted to the Bank the strategic staffing frameworks ("Rifirentiel des emplois et des
      compdtences") for, respectively, the Borrower's Ministry o f Agriculture and Ministry o f
      Equipment;

  5.  submitted to the Bank a status report on work undertaken on the REC of, respectively, the
      Borrower's MFP andMMSP;

  6.  adopted in its Council o f Ministers a decree providing for the establishment o f performance
      evaluation for civil servants;
  7. adopted inits Council o f Ministers a decree setting forth revisedrules for the promotion o f civil
      servants;

  8.  disseminated a circular letter by the Borrower's MFP, setting forth the methodology for staff
      evaluation; inlieu of, has providedthe Bank with a drafl action plan for the implementation o f the
      new system end-2006;

  9. prepared harmonized statutes for admmstrative corps.


                               RATIONALE FOR BANKINVOLVEMENT

63.     The proposed PART, I1i s consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) adopted
inMay 2005. It explicitly addresses outcome 1.2: Increase efficiency of public administration.
The proposed loan will complement and strengthen the ongoing multiyear Programmatic
Economic Sector Work (P-ESW) activity through which the Bank i s providing the Government
with advice, training, and technical assistance as required in the areas o f budgetary management,
civil service reform, and wage bill containment. A new FY-06 to FY08 P-ESW program has
been discussed with the Government and the terms o f a Memorandum o f Understanding have
been agreed.

64.     Some actions or components of the reform have experienced some delays, but all major
elements of the program are under way, and most o f the detailed elements agreed with the
Government a year ago are still valid, as documented by supervision missions by the Bank and
the European Union, by the PARL IICR, and by the ongoing P-ESW. The matrix negotiated in
March 2004 and revised for PARL 11provides guidance for decisions on future operations related
to this program. As was done for PARL I,         specific actions, singled out in the new matrix (see
Annex 19,will provide points for the supervision o f this PARL I1and triggers for the preparation
o fthe next loan.

                                        Triggers for PARL I11

      The Borrower will have:

  1. extended the implementation o f the medium-term expenditure framework, as designed by the
      MTEFcommittee, to 4 pilotMinistries for the period2007-2009;

 2.   extended flexible budgeting to 6 additional Ministries;
 3.   prepared and implemented master plans for deconcentration o f 4 pilot Ministries;

 4.   completed the new study on reforming the ex-ante control system o fpublic expenditure;

 5.   finalized RECs for 2 additional Ministries including 3-year rolling score-cards, databases and
      training plans;
  6.  started work on RECs for 4 additional Ministries;

 7. begun a newjob classification;
  8. finalized the report on a new remuneration systembased on the jobiskills classification.


                               POVERTYAND ENVIRONMENTASPECTS

65.     Social Safeguard and Poverty Alleviation. The Social Safeguard policy pertaining to
Involuntary Resettlement (OPBP 4.12) does not apply to this project. The program having the
objective to improve efficiency o f the public sector will have a direct and positive impact on
growth. The operation has been prepared following extensive discussions o f the CAS, and
members of Parliament sensitization to budget reform, basics of sound public finance
management andbudgetprocess.

66.     Environmental Aspects. The program i s not expected to have any significant effect on
the environment, forests, and other natural resources.

                                 LESSONSLEARNED PARL1    FROM

67.      The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for PARL I has confirmed the
appropriateness o f using programmatic lending for institutional reform requiring long-term
involvement and partnership between the Bank and the client, and specifically for supporting
public sector reforms in Morocco as the country proceeds step by step in a medium-term
program. Using successive single tranche adjustment loans has been assessed by the ICR as an
effective way to assist structural reform, provided it i s rigidly linked to an agreed medium-term
reform programwith well-defined milestones andtransparent triggers for subsequent operation.

68.      Among the lessons learned from PARL I, ICR mentions that ownership by multiple
                                                         the
stakeholders has been and will continue to be a key component for the success o f the reform
program. Ensuringownership at the highest levels o f government and at the technical levels i s
essential for increasing commitment to the project development objectives and facilitating
implementation. Involvingother stakeholders indiscussions o f the reformprogramwould also be
useful, particularly with regard to the wage bill. The Bank can play a role as a "technical
resource" and help buildthis ownership. Reforms requiringinter-ministerial coordination move
slowly; thus attention needs to be placed on how to strengthen coordination.




                                                    18

69.     The ICR recognizes that the Bank's analytical work and technical assistance was
essential in assisting the Government design the reform program. Continuing to support the
program through the P-ESW i s therefore important, but must be tailored appropriately and
flexibly to demands. The Bank's P-ESW program played a key role inhelpingMorocco prepare
and internalize the necessary reforms.        This program provided in-depth analysis and
benchmarking, which eventually proved useful in the design of the program in 2004. It i s
expected that in subsequentyears the P-ESW will continue to provide knowledge transfer suitable
to the reformprogram, as requestedby the authorities.

            FIDUCIARY INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTS
                        AND                                    WITH GOVERNMENT

70;     The proposed loan will follow the Bank's simplified disbursement procedures for
development policy operations.       The approved loan will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and will not be linked to any specific
purchases, and no procurement requirements will be needed. As Morocco has not been under
IMFprogram for several years, no safeguardassessment ofthe Central Bankhasbeenundertaken
by the IMF. The World Bank knowledge of the Central Bank fiduciary capacity was compiled
during the 2003 CFAA discussions with the Treasury of the Kingdom on the treasury single
account management and the debt accounting and reporting systems by the Central Bank.
Treasury appeared satisfied with the Central Bank performance and did not raise any serious
concerns to call for a specific assessment. Against thisbackground, once the loan i s approvedby
the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the loan in the amount o f US$120 million
equivalent will be deposited by IBRDinan account designated bythe Borrower and acceptable to
the World Bank at the Central Bank of Morocco at the request of the Borrower. If the proceeds
of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement,
IBRDwill require the Borrower to promptly uponnotice refundan amount equal to the amount of
saidpayment to IBRD. Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

71.      The Loan's administration will be the responsibility of the MFP. Coordination and
monitoring o f the implementation of the reform will be supported by the Inter-ministerial
Steering Committee for the administrative reform. This Committee was created in early 2003 by
a decision of the Prime Minister.

                              COORDINATION WITH OTHER DONORS

72.      At the request of Government, this operationis beingpreparedjointly with the European
Commission and the AfDB. PARI., Iwas developed jointly with the EU, which granted a
structural adjustment grant o f 79 million to be disbursed over the program's period in four
tranches. The AfDB separately prepared a structural adjustment loan of about 100 million units
of account, based on the same program matrix. The loan went to the Board in December 2004
and was disbursed inNovember 2005. Both donors plan to continue their support o f the reform
program in close cooperation with the Bank. The matrix negotiated in March 2004 serves both
the Bank and the EUas the guide for supervisiono f the reformprogram, for technical assistance,
and for policy dialogue.

73.      The PARL IICR has stressed, among lessons for future operations, that donor
coordination plays a major role in program success, and the Bank should make great efforts to
preserve this unified dialogue. The Bank's lending operation and the European Commission
 Structural Adjustment Grants, and the AfDB support of the Moroccan Government, are based on
the same programmatic framework. This has benefited the client by building credibility for the
reforms, but also by focusing the attention and expertise from multilateral donors on a complex



                                                19

program o f reform. For the Bank and donors it has helped to mitigate the risk o f this type of
reformand has reduced the supervisory burden on eachdonor.

74.     IMF staff are generally comfortable with the macro-framework underlying the proposed
operation. In addition, inthe context of the Article IV, the IMF has advocated, together with the
Bank, that strengthening fiscal sustainability inthe mediumterm i s apriority and that, in order to
achieve this, regaining control of the public payroll through a streamlined civil service i s needed.
Annex V provides a summary of article N consultations with Morocco.

                                       BENEFITSAND RISKS

75.     Benefits. The major benefit o f the operation is the improvement of the effectiveness o f
public resources management. By addressing some of the main constraints affecting the
effectiveness of public service delivery, the PARL program will contribute to private sector
development and to improving the living standards of the population. By contributing to keeping
the wage bill under control, the programwill help ensure macroeconomic stability.

76.     Risks. The main expected riski s that the objective set for payroll as apercentage o f GDP
in2008 will not bereached. So far, Government hasmanagedto control numbers of employees
by banning additional hiring since 1996, despite pressure from sectors and trade unions, but has
not been inthe position to avoid massive promotions leading to wage bill increase. This risk i s
being mitigated by the ongoing reform program, which changes promotion regulation and
modifies the remuneration system. Another risk i s that the implementation o f the reforms would
be stalled, as was the case in the past, because of opposition from interest groups. The risk i s
mitigated by the political coordination put in place by the Cabinet to implement reforms, lead
regular dialogue with trade unions and by the strategic policy dialogue pursued between
Moroccan authorities and the Bank. Along with key partners, an extensive supervision of the
implementation o f the reforms by the Bank, together with the knowledge sharing and technical
assistance entailedby a continuation of the P-ESW support, will help mitigate bothrisks.

 1.Z-L'amilioration de I'efficaciti de I'administration dans la gestion des
 ressources humaines.

          Le gouvernement du Royaume du Maroc considkre que la rkforme
 administrative passe par la confirmation du rSle stratkgigue de la gestion des
 ressources humaines en tant que pilier de toute la dynamique du changement
 prkconisk. A cet effet, les actions prksentkes ci-aprbs et rkaliskes par le
 gouvernement visent h diffuser une nouvelle culture de gestion desdites ressources
  baske sur le mkrite et la performance, I'amklioration du rendement de la fonction
  publique et la maitrise de la masse salariale :

  a/ La modernisation de la gestion des ressources humaines h travers:

          -I'institution de mkthodes modernes de gestion prkvisionnelle des
  ressources humaines bastes sur I'adoption de rkfkrentiels des emplois et des
  compktences (REC) permettant I'identif ication au sein de chaque dkpartement
  ministkriel des emplois, la description des activitks et taches y affkrentes et la
  dkfinition et la classification des compktences requises pour les occuper. Ainsi,
  lesdits rkfkrentiels permettront dassurer une meilleure adkquation entre les

                                                                                ANNEX 1
                                                                             Page 4 of I O


                                            4
ressources humaines et les besoins en personnel           et   de    favoriser   leur
redkploiement. bans ce cadre, les dkpartements chargks de I'Equipement et de
I'Agriculture ont finalisk leurs rkfkrentiels des emplois et des compktences,et les
dkpartements des Finances et de la Modernisation des Secteurs Publics ont entamt
les travaux des REC les concernant.

         Par ailleurs et afin de faciliter la prise en compte des rksultats des REC, la
simplification et I'harmonisation des statuts particuliers de la fonction publique
sont nkcessaires. A ce titre, trois projets de dtcrets permettant la fusion de 22
statuts ont ttk prtparts:

         - le renforcement de la mobilitt des ressources humaines h travers la mise
en Oeuvre des dispositions prtvues dans kprojet de loi, modifiant et complttant le
statut gtntral de la fonction publique adoptk par le conseil des ministres, qui
 consistent h instituer de nouvelles proctdures incitatives au redkploiement pour
 assurer une meilleure rtpartition spatiale et sectorielle des effectifs et la
 simplification des prockdures de dttachement et de mise h disposition.

 b-Le renforcement de la qualification des ressources humainesh travers :

         -1'adoption du dtcret relatif h la formation continue permettant la mise en
 euvre dune politique cohtrente en la matikre qui repose sur une strathie globale
 et des schkmas directeurs devant &tre ktablis par les ministkres d partir de
 I'ttude des besoins en formation de leurs personnels, Ainsi, la formation continue
 des cadres et agents de I'Etat permettra de combler les tcarts relevts par les
 rkftrentiels des emplois et des compbtences,de favoriser la mobilitt fonctionnelle,
 de faciliter les promotions et de contribuer h la diffusion de la culture de gestion
 axte sur les rksultats;

          -1'adoption des principes de mtrite et de la comptitence comme critkres de
  base pour la promotion des fonctionnaires. Ainsi, le dtcret instituant le nouveau
  systkme dtvaluation tend h tvaluer la performance des fonctionnaires sur la base
  de critkres objectifs prkdkfinis (grille de notation sur 20 points au lieu de 3
  points) et I'organisation dentretiens une fois au moins tous les deux ans.
  Concernant le nouveau Systkme de promotion, le dtcret approuvk en conseil des
  ministres tend h concilier la motivation des agents et I'amtlioration de I'efficacitt
  du service public. La principale novation en la matikre consiste h priviltgier la
  promotion au mtrite par I'institution dexamens daptitudes professionnelles et par
  la prise en compte de la note d'tvaluation de la performance des agents. La
  nouveautd rkside tgalement dans I'institution de quotas annuels de 22% (11%
  examen et 11%au choix) calculks sur la base des promouvables. Cette mesure va
  permettre d'assurer davantage de fluiditt dans la promotion du personnel
  remplissant les conditions requises et ddviter le recours b des op&rations de
  promotion exceptionnelles qui aggravent le poids de la massesalariale.

                                                                               Page 5 of1 0

c/ La rnaTtrise de la masse salariale :

         La maitrise de I'kvolution de la masse salariale constitue I'une des priorit&
du gouvernement, le but ktant de rkduire son poids par rapport au PIB, de
renf orcer l'kpargne budgktaire et de dkgager ainsi suff isamment de ressources
pour financer les dkpenses dinvestissement public. A cet effet les maures
suivantes ont ktk rkaliskes :

         -la mise en oeuvre avec succks de I'opkration de dkpart volontaire des
fonctionnaires civils de I'Etat qui a bknkficik b prbs de 38.800 agents et cadres et
qui s'est traduite notamment par la rkduction du poids de la masse salariale par
rapport au PIB de 13% en 2005 h 12% en 2006. Les postes budgktaires lib&&
suite h cette opkration ont kt6 supprimks par la loi de finances pour I'annke 2006
renforcant ainsi la mesure dkjh prise, relative h la suppression des postes
budgktaires devenus vacants suite au dkpart de leurs titulaires h la retraite pour
limite d'age;

          -la limitation des recrutements dans la fonction publique au strict besoin
 nkcessaire des secteurs prioritaires ayant engagk des programmes de rkforme. A
 cet effet, les crkations des postes budgktaires seront ktablies principalement par
 rkfkrence au nombre des postes libkrks suite au dkpart de leur titulaire h la
 retraite pour limite d8ge et seront timitkes au cours des annkes 2007 et 2008 h
 7.000 postes par an. Lesdits recrutements concerneront en prioritk le personnel
 dencadrement h haut potentiel et s'effectueront dans le respect des principes de
 transparence et dkgalitk des chances des candidats postulant aux concours pour
 I'accks aux emplois publics. En outre, la possibilitk sera ouverte pour conclure des
 contrats de recrutement afin de permettre h I'administration de rdaliser des
 projets nkcessitant une expertise particulikre. Enfin, les emplois dans les kchelles
 1 h 4 seront progressivement rksorbks par I'interdiction de tout nouveau
 recrutement dans ces catkgories et celles affkrentes au personnel occasionnel et
 assimilk.

a- I'amtlioration de la programmation budgttaire pluriannuelle:

          La commission interministirielle chargee dktablir le cadre mkthodologique
 d'ktablissement du CDMT poursuivra ses travaux devant aboutir au ddbut de
 I'annke 2006 11 I'klaboration dun manuel prksentant la dkmarche mkthodologique, les
 modalitks et le calendrier de prdparation du CDMT. Au cours de ladite annke
 quatre    dkpartements ministkriels       pilotes (Education    Nationale, Habitat,
 Equipement et Santk) prtpareront leurs CDMT devant &re utilisks pour mettre au

 ktabli par le Ministkre des Finances et de la Privatisation h I'occasion de la
 prkparation du projet de loi de finances pour I'annke 2007.

          Aprks kvaluotion de cette opkration h la fin de I'annke 2006, les
 dispositions seront prises par le gouvernement pour assurer la gknkralisation de la
 prkparation des CDMT par I'ensemble des dkpartements ministkriels dks I'annke

de contrats pluriannuels glissants fixant les objectifs qui leur sont assignks, les
moyens mis h leur disposition ainsi que les rksultats attendus mesurks par des
indicateurs de performance.

c- le renforcement des capacitb d'kvaluation e t daudit des performances :

          La mise en ceuvre de la gestion budgttaire axke sur les resultats requiert
de rkorienter le contrdle de la dkpense publique vers I'kvaluation et I'audit de
I'efficacitC et I'eff icience des rtalisations et de renforcer les capacitds des
administrations publiques en matikre de contrale de gestion. A cet effet, les
 efforts seront poursuivis pour I'allCgement du contrdle a priori et le dkveloppement
 des capacitCs daudit de performance sur I'ensemble de la chaine de contrdle.

           bans ce cadre, un manuel d'audit de performance adapt6 au contexte de
 I'Administration marocaine sera Clabork et fera I'objet dactions de formation au
 prof it des Inspections Gdnkrales de quatorze Ministkres pilotes leur permettant
 d b 2006 avec I'appui de I'Inspection GknCrale des Finances dkvaluer I'efficacitk et
 I'eff icience de la gestion des ressources budgdtaires misesh leur disposition. Cette
 opkration bdntficiera en 2007 h 6 autres dkpartements ministkriels et sera

2.2- L'amilioration de I'eff icaciti de I'administration dam la gestion des
ressources humaines.

        Le gouvernement du Royaume du Maroc considhre que la modernisation et
I'amdlioration de I'efficience de I'administration constituent I'un des piliers de la
dynamique de rkforme engagde h cet effet laquelle rdforme sera poursuivie en vue
d'amtliorer les rapports avec les usagers par le ddveloppement de I'administration
de proximitk rendant des services de qualitk, renfoyant I'kthique et la
transparence dans ses interventions et faisant appel aux nouvelles technologies de
I'information. Aussi et afin de renforcer le rendement de I'administration, les
efforts de mise h niveau de la gestion des ressources humaines seront poursuivis h
travers la rationalisation de leur utilisation, le renforcement de leur qualification
 professionnelle et I'amdlioration de systkme de rdmunkration et de promotion.

 a/-La rationalisation de I'utilisation des ressources humaines de la fonction
 pub1ique:

         I I s'agit dinstituer une nouvelle politique de gestion prkvisionnelle des
 ressources humaines baske sur la gkndralisation progressive des rdfkrentiels des
 emplois et des compdtences devant couvrir en 2006 les ministkres des Finances et
 de la Privatisation et de la Modernisation des Secteurs Publics et dtendue en 2007
 h d'autres ddpartements de manikre h couvrir 80% des effectifs de la fonction
 publique civile. Lesdits rkfkrentiels serviront ainsi h assurer une meilleure
 addquation entre les profils des effectifs et les besoins des dkpartements
 ministkriels et favoriser le redkploiement du personnel de I'Etat.

          En outre, I'dlaboration des REC permettra la classification des emplois
  dans une nomenclature commune dont le lancement des travaux, par le Ministkre
  charge de la Modernisation des Secteurs Publics, aura lieu en 2006.

          Par ailleurs, et dans le but de renforcer la mobilitd des fonctionnaires et
  de rdpondre aux besoinsde I'administration, iIest prQvu au titre de I'annde 2006:

          - I'adoption des dkcrets portant application des dispositions du projet de
  loi modifiant et complktant le statut gknkral de la fonction publique et qui
  concernent notamment le redkploiement et la mise h disposition;
          - le lancement des travaux pour la crdation d'une banque de donndes au

' niveau du Ministkre de la Modernisation des Secteurs Publics afin douvrir une
  bourse des emplois permettant le rapprochement entre les besoins exprimds par
  les ministkres et les demandes 6manant des personnels h redkployer.

dkploiernent progressif du nouveau systbme de Gestion Intkgrke du Personnel de
I'Etat (GIPE).

b/ Le renforcement de la qualification des ressources humoines :

          Afin d'accroitre la performance des cadres et agents de I'Etat, iI sera
procede h la mise en ceuvre dks 2006 de la nouvelle politique de formation continue
visant h renforcer progressivement les moyens budgktaires mis h cet effet b la
disposition des ministtres et h instituer les schkmas directeurs de formation
continue pour renforcer et adapter les capacitks et les connaissances
professionnelles des fonctionnaires aux besoins et mutations des administrations
publiqueset favoriser leur mobilitk.

           Par ailleurs, et afin de doter I'administration de certains profils
 spkcifiques dans le respect des impkratifs de maTtrise de la masse salariale, il est
 envisage, au titre de I'annCe 2006, d'adopter le dkcret d'application relatif au
 recrutement par contrat tel que prkvu par le projet de loi modifiant et complktant
 le statut gknkral de la fonction publique.

 c) L'amtlioration de I'efficacitt du systime de rCmun6ration et divaluation:

           Uktude sur le nouveau systkme de remuneration dont les termes de
  rkfkrence ont ktk finalisks et I'appel doffres y affkrent sera lanck en 2006,
  devra permettre d'intkgrer la quasi-totalitk du rkgime indemnitaire dans le
  traitement de base et dklaborer ensuite sur la base des rksultats des travaux
  d'klaboration des rkfkrentiels des emplois et des compktences un nouveau systkme
  de rkmunkration fondk sur les principes d'kquitk et de transparence et favorisant
  la fixation des rhmunkrations en tenant compte de la complexitk des emplois et du
  mkrite.

           Concernant la mise en Oeuvre du nouveau systkme d'kvaluation, objet du
  dkcret adoptk h cet effet, iI est prkvu en 2006 d'ktablir une circulaire sur les
  prockdures d'kvaluation, d'tlaborer un guide mkthodologique et d'assurer la
  formation    des responsables ministtriels     concernes par      I'kvaluation des
  fonctionnaires.

Subject: Letter o f Development Policy onpublic administrationreform strategy

Reference: My letter No. 2541/E of April 30,2004

Mr.President,

IhavethehonortoreiteratehereinthetermsofmyletterofApril30,2004,outliningthepublic
administration reform strategy, one of the priorities of the Government o f the Kingdom of
Morocco, as well as the measures adopted to ensure its implementation with technical and
financial assistance from the World Bank, the European Union, and the Ahcan Development
Bank.

Thisreformstrategy, undertaken inanational and international context characterized inparticular
by the globalization of trade, competition among economies, an increase in pressing social
development needs, and scant budgetary resources, i s aimed at improving the performance o f the
administration while ensuring macroeconomic framework sustainability, improvingthe quality of
services provided to users and enterprises, and creating a favorable environment for investment
andpromotion o fprivate sector employment.

Against this backdrop, the public administration reform strategy revolves around the following
three objectives:

    -    Modernizing and enhancing the administration efficiency through improving multiyear
         budget planning arrangements, adopting a new budget management approach based on
         results, performance, and accountability, and building capacity to evaluate and monitor
         performance.

    -    Strengthening and developing the decentralization and de-concentration (administrative
         decentralization) process inorder to bring management closer to the people by assigning
         greater responsibility to managers at the local levels.

    -    Improving human resources management in order to make these resources a vector for
         enhancing government effectiveness through the promotion o f a management culture
         based on merit and performance, and enhancing staff profiles by implementing suitable
         recruitment policies and in-service training while focusing on controlling the public
         payroll.

Taking into account the noteworthy progress made as a result o f implementing the different
measures recommended by this strategy, efforts will be continued with a view to strengthening
this progress through structural and institutional measures that allow for reinforcement of
macroeconomic framework sustainability, improved performance in the areas o f budget and

                                                                                       ANNEX 1
                                                                                     Page2 of 8

human resources management, and continuation of work aimed at reducing the public payroll as a
percentage of gross domestic product.

I. Summaryofthemainpublicadministrationreformmeasures

The measures and actions taken are detailed below along the following lines:

         1.1 Improvegovernmentalefficiency inbudgetresourcesmanagementby:

    -  Improving multiyear budget programming through the implementation of a medium-term
       expenditure framework (MTEF) that will allow for consistency between sectoral policies
       and the objective o f a sustainable macroeconomic framework, a controlled budget deficit
       and improved resource allocations based on priorities identified by the Government and
       expected performance.        In this regard, an Interministerial Committee has been
       established, with responsibility for determining the methodology for the formulation and
       implementation o f the MTEF in relation to the preparation schedule for the budget law.
       This committee begun work in2005 based on terms o freference establishedby the Pnme
       Minister.

    -  Establishing a new budget approach based on results and performance and based on
       budget flexibility, contracts between central administrations and their respective branch
       offices, and the forging o f partnerships with local governments, civil society, and the
       private sector.

       This new approach, oriented toward the establishment o f program budgets, seeks to
       empower managers through the streamlining o f budget procedures while making them
       accountable for achieving predefined objectives, measured by performance indicators,
        and the provision of reports on progress achieved through budget allocations used. This
       approach was implemented in late 2005 in 14 ministerial departments managing close to
       40 percent o f the investmentbudget.

    -   Strengthening administrative de-concentration through the adoption by the Government
        o f the decree providing for the transfer of responsibilities, within the framework o f de-
        concentration master plans, to branch offices, so that every kindof decision i s attributed
        at the level best suited to meeting actual needs, with a view to ensuring more effective
        interventions.

    -   Adapting public expenditure control to the new budget management approach based on
        results and performance. Inthis context, a study on public expenditure control has been
        launched with the aim o f streamlining control procedures and reducing their cost,
        introducing greater fluidity and flexibility into the control function, and designing a
        control system orientedtoward the evaluation o fperformance and results.
    -   Finalizing design and technical studies on development of an integrated budget
        management system (Gestion Integre'e des Dkpenses, GID) and starting work to
        implement it. This system, which will connect all parties involved inpublic expenditure,
        will facilitate the     streamlining    and   simplification   of budget programming,
        implementation and appropriation control procedures, and ensure consistency at all times
        between the accounts o f the different players involved, thereby allowing for the
        preparation o f draft budget execution laws within the required deadlines. Inthis regard, a

                                                                                        ANNEX I
                                                                                      Page 3 of 8

       unit in charge o f the preparation and gradual deployment o f the GID system between
       2006 and 2010 has been established within the Ministry o f Finance andPrivatization.

        1.2 Improve governmental efficiency inhuman resources management

In the view of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco, administrative reform entails
confirmation of the strategic role o f human resources management inorder to serve as essential to
the dynamics of targeted changes. Consequently, the'actions outlined below and conducted by
the Government are aimed at establishing a new culture for the management o f these resources
based on merit and performance, upgrading the profile of civil service staff, and controlling o f
wage bill:

       a. Modernizing human resources management through:

    -  Introduction o f modem planning tools for human resources management through the
       adoption of strategic staffing plans for job positions and shlls (rbfbrentiels des emplois et
       des compdtences,REC), allowing for the identification in each ministerial department o f
       job positions, description o f the corresponding activities and tasks, and identification and
       classification o f the skills required to fill in such positions. These RECs will thus ensure
       better matching o f human resources with personnel needs and will facilitate personnel
       redeployment. In this context, the Ministries o f Public works and Agnculture have
       finalized their RECs; the Ministries o f Finance and Public Sectors Modernization have
       started the relevant REC-relatedwork;

       Inaddition and inorder to make it easier to take these RECsresults into account, specific
       status o f civil servants will have to be simplified and harmonized. Inthis regard, three
       decrees facilitating the merger o f 22 statutes have been drafted;

    -  Greater human resources mobility through the implementation o f the draft law modifying
       and complementing the General Statute o f Civil Service, draft adopted by the Council o f
       Ministers. The law creates new procedures encouraging redeployment to ensure better
        geographic and sectoral distribution o f staff, and the simplification o f secondment and
       mobility procedures.

        b. Strengthening humanresources skills through:
    -   Adoption o f the in-service training decree allowing for implementing a consistent policy
        to the underlying the overall strategy and master plans to be prepared by the ministries,
       based on a review o f the training needs o f their personnel. In-service training of staff and
        managers will therefore allow for filling gaps identified through the RECs, foster
        mobility, facilitate promotions, and help establish a results-based management culture;

    -   Adoption of the principles o fmerit and competence as the basic criteria for the promotion
        o fpublic employees. Conversely, the decree establishing the new evaluation system aims
        at evaluating the performance o f civil servants on the basis o f predefined objective
        criteria (grading system out o f 20 instead o f three points) and conducting interviews at
        least once every two years.       With regard to the new promotion system, the decree
        approved by the Council o f Ministers aims at motivating managers and enhancing the
        effectiveness o f the public service. The main innovation is the priority given to merit-
        basedpromotion by introducing professional skills tests and talung into account the grade
        o f the performance evaluation of employees.               This innovation also entails the

                                                                                         ANNEX I
                                                                                       Page 4 of 8

       introduction of annual quotas o f 22 percent (11 percent through testing and 11 percent
       usingperformance grade), calculated on the basis of the pool of individuals eligible for
       promotion. This approach will ensure greater flexibility than the current system inplace,
       which is characterized by the lack o f promotion opportunities for employees who meet
       promotion criteria, a situation that leads to special promotion procedures which, defacto,
        end up increasing wage bill weight.

        c.  Controllingthe payroll

Controlling the payroll i s one o f the Government's priorities.      The goal i s to reduce its
percentage of gross domestic product, increase budget savings and thus free adequate
resources to finance public investment expenditure. To that end, the following measures have
been taken:

   -    Successful implementation o f the Early Retirement Program (ERP) for civil servants
        which benefited to approximately 38,800 employees and managers, and resulted, in
        particular, in a reduction inthe public payroll to GDP ratio from 13 percent in 2005 to12
        percent in 2006. The budget positions freed up as a result were abolished in the 2006
        budget law, thus reinforcing the elimination o f budget positions vacated by persons who
        hadreached mandatoryretirement age.

    -   The limitation o f civil service recruitment to those positions strictly necessary to priority
        sectors having begun reform programs. To this end, budget positions will be created
        mostly in reference to budget positions freed by employees leaving the service because
        they reached mandatory retirement age, within the ceiling o f 7,000 positions per year.
        Priority will be given to the recruitment o f managerial staff offering high potential, with
        guarantees o f transparency and equal opportunity being provided to all candidates
        competing for public office. Furthermore, employment contracts will be possible, in
        order to allow government to implement projects requiring special expertise. Finally,
        positions at levels 1 to 4 will be gradually reduced through attrition, and any new
        recruitment in these categories as well as temporary and similar personnel will be
        prohibited.

11.     Main measures adopted for implementation of public administration reform
        strategy

The Government intends to strengthen and continue efforts to modernize the administration and
establish the new management culture based on merit and performance by adopting measures
orientedtoward:

    -   Improvingthe effectiveness o f governmentalmanagement ofbudgetary resources;

    -   Improvingthe effectiveness o f governmentalmanagement o f humanresources;

    -   Controlling the public payroll.

                                                                                      Page 5 of 8

         2.1 Improving the effectiveness of the government's management of budgetary
             resources

This activity involves strengthening and implementing the new multiyear budget programming
arrangements, extending the new management culture based on results and performance to all
government, strengthening administrative de-concentration, and enhancing efficiency and
transparency inthe execution and control of public expenditure.

        a.       Improving multiyear budget programming

The Interministerial Committee responsible for designing the MTEF methodology will continue
its work, to culminate in early 2006 with the preparation o f a manual describing the
methodological approach, procedures, and timetable for the MTEF preparation. In 2006, four
pilot Ministries (Education, Housing, Infrastructure, and Health) will prepare a MTEF, to be used
to determine their 2007 budget. Also, the medium term fiscal framework (TOFE) for the
2007-2009 period will be drawn up by the MFP at the time of preparation o f the 2007 draft
budgetlaw.

After evaluating this operation inend-2006, measureswill be taken by the Government to ensure
the preparationo fMTEFsby all Ministries starting in2007.

        b.       Generalization of the new budget approach based on results and
                 performance

The effort to ensure the general application of budget management based on results and
performance will be pursuedlargely through:

    -   The application in2006 of the budget flexibility to six additional Ministries, a measure
        that will bring the portion o f the investment budget covered by this arrangement to 60
        percent. Also, inlate 2006, an evaluation will be done o f the results o f this arrangement
        with a view to its application in 2007 to all ministries, and its possible extension to a
        greater level o f aggregation o fbudget items.

    -   Given that the consequenceo f this new approach will be the strengthening o f contractual
        arrangements between central administrations and their respective branch offices, the
        administrative de-concentration effort will focus on the designing and implementation of
        de-concentration master plans with respect to four ministries in 2006, with a view to get
        master plans in to all Ministries by 2008. The goal is to assign greater responsibility to
        local managers through the establishment o f rolling multiyear contracts setting forth the
        goals assigned to them, the resources provided, and expected outcomes measured by
        performance indicators.

        c.       Reinforcing performanceevaluation and audit capacities

The implementation o fresults-based management calls for the reorientationo fpublic expenditure
control toward the evaluation and audit o f the effectiveness and efficiency o f activities and the
strengthening of the capacity o f public administrations in the area o f management controls. To
this end, work will be done on the streamlining of ex-ante of control procedures and building
capacity to audit the performanceo f the entire chain o f control.

                                                                                        ANNEX I
                                                                                      Page 6 of 8

Inthisregard, aperformance auditmanualadaptedtothe context oftheMoroccanadministration
will bepreparedin2006, with training beingprovided to the General InspectionOffices of the 14
pilot ministries, thereby enabling them, that same year, to evaluate their efficiency and
effectiveness in managing the budgetary resources provided to them, with the assistance of the
General Inspector of Finance. In2007, this operation will be conducted in six other ministerial
departments and will be extended to the public administration as a whole in 2008, which will
evaluate their activities against performance indicators.

In2006, the recommendations of the study on controlling the regularity of public expenditure
with a view to the adoption of the new budget management system based on results and
performance will also be implemented, through a proposed new control systemfacilitating greater
efficiency o f the current system, reducing control costs, and making managers accountable.

At the same time, the program to develop and deploy the integrated government expenditure
management (GID) system will be continued and accelerated through the establishment in 2006
of the exchange platform allowing for the fluid movement of operations between the different
players involved with public expenditure. Implementation of the final version o f this system,
configured in such a way as to benefit all public expenditure players, i s expected to take place in
early 2010.

         2.2 Improving the effectiveness of the government's humanresources management

The Government of the Kingdom of Morocco regards administrative reform, in terms o f
modernization and improved efficiency, as one of the catalysts for the reform undertaken. This
reform will be pursued with a view to improving relations with users by bringing the
administration closer to the people so as to provide them with quality services, improve ethical
conduct and transparency inits activities, and use of new information technologies. Inaddition,
and with a view to enhancing the performance o f the public administration, efforts will be made
to upgrade humanresources management through the rationalizationo f their use, strengthening o f
their professional expertise, and improvingthe remunerationandpromotion system.

         a. Rationalizingthe use of humanresources inthe civil service

This activity establishes a new planning policy in human resources management based on the
gradual extension of RECs to the MFP and the MMSP in 2006, and to additional Ministries in
2007, in order to reach 80 percent o f civil service. These RECs will thus be used to ensure
greater compatibility between the staff profiles and the needs o f Ministries and will be helpful
withthe redeployment of State employees.

Moreover, FECs will allow for a newjob classification for all public administration, which will
belaunched bythe MMSP in2006.

Besides, and inorder to enhance mobility opportunities for civil servants and meet administrative
needs, in2006 it i s planned to:
     -   Adopt by-laws to implement the draft law modifying and complementing the General
         Statute o f Civil Service, notably redeployment and reassignment;

     -   Launch works to create a database at MMSPinorder to establish ajob exchange roster to
         facilitate matching the needs indicated by Ministries with requests from personnel aslung
         for redeployment.

                                                                                        ANNEXI
                                                                                      Page 7 of 8


Besides, between 2006 and 2008, an integrated personnel management system (systkme de
gestion intCgrCe du personnel de l'Etat, GIPE) will be progressively deployed.

        b. Strengtheninghumanresourcesskills

Inorder to enhance,the efficiency oftheperformance ofgovernment managersandemployees, a
new policy for in-service training will be implementedin 2006. Its objective will be the gradual
increase inthe budget resources available to Ministries and the establishment of master plans for
in-service training so as to strengthen and adapt the professional capacity and knowledge of civil
servantsto the needs and changes ofpublic administration and facilitate their mobility.

Besides, and in order to provide public administration with specific professional skills, yet within
the constraints of wage bill control, it is planned to adopt a by law to implement contract
employment as stipulated by the draft law modifying and complementing the General Statute o f
Civil Service.

         c.  Improvingthe efficiency of the remunerationandevaluationsystem

The study on the new remuneration system, the terms o f reference of which have been finalized
and for which biddingi s to be launched early in2006, should facilitate the integration of virtually
the entire bonus system into base salaries, followed by the preparation, based on the results o f the
RECs, o f a new remuneration system based on the principles of equity and transparency and
encourages consideration ofjob complexity and meritwhen determiningremuneration.

As for the implementation of the new evaluation system, for which a decree has been adopted, a
circular i s expected to be issued in 2006 on evaluation procedures, along with a related a
methodological guide and the provision of training for the relevant ministerial officials on the
evaluation o fpublic employees and the identification o f training needs, inorder to upgrade slulls.

         2.3 Controllingwage billevolution

The implementation o f the above mentioned structural measures aimed at improving human
resources management, strengthening the efficiency o f the remuneration and promotion system,
and limitingthe establishment ofbudgetpositions for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to 7000 per year
inMinistries whichwill have launchedreformprograms, withthe objective ofreducingthe wage
bill share of GDP to close to 11.5 percent by end-2009. To this end, vacant budget positions will
be erased at the end o f each fiscal year by Ministries and rationalization o f budget positions
management will continue to bepursued.

III. Arrangements for steering and monitoring the public administration reform
         strategy

The PrimeMinister has assignedresponsibility for steering and monitoring strategic reform o f the
public administration to a special Interministerial Committee chairedby the Minister Delegate to
the Prime Ministerfor Economic and General Affairs.

This committee, which includes representatives o f Ministries responsible for Modernization o f
the Public Sectors, Public works, Agriculture, Interior, Health, and Finance, will coordinate and
ensure monitoring and evaluating o f implementation o f outlined measures and make

                                                                                    ANNEX I
                                                                                  Page 8 of 8

recommendations aiming at maximizing their impact, with a view to making the public
administration a true catalyst for competitiveness.

Moreover, in order to ensure regular monitoring o f public administration reform measures,
representatives will be appointed from each Ministry,MMSP, Economic and General Affairs, and
MFP to conduct a periodic assessment o f the progress and to prepare progress reports for
submissionto the above mentionedcommittee.

Mindful o f the need to build a consensus around the objectives o f this reform and its
implementation modalities, the Governmenthas formulated a communications strategy inorder to
foster acceptance by the various partners involved, specifically public service users and social
partners.

Thank you, Mr. President, for your support to the implementation o f this important reform
program o f the Moroccanpublic administration, and best regards.

                                     Reformof the Public Administration
                       PreliminaryEvaluation of the Early RetirementProgram

1.        The Government of Morocco has launcheda broad public administrationreform (PAR)
in 2004. The Early Retirement Program(ERP) is one o f its most important components with the main
objectives of retrenching and streamlining the civil personnel and controlling the wage bill. The ERP
originally aimed at downsizing the Central Government by some 35,000 civil servants over a 3-4 year
period, o f which 5,000 in 2004. Less than 1,000 civil servants retired that year due to the insufficient
incentives o f the package offered8 and the constricted targeted population to the lower rank levels,
between 1 and 9, out of the existing 12 levelsg. The Budget L a w 2005 improved the incentive package
and extended the targeted population to all the civil servants o f the Central Government, with the
exception of those leaving on normal retirement in2005. The salient features o f the package include:

     0     Severance payments representing a month and half salary for each worked year, with a ceiling
           of 36 months for rank levels 6 andabove;"

     0    Tax exempt status to severance payments;

     0    A pension benefit calculated on the basis of 2 percent o f gross salary (GS) for each worked
          year effective on the date o f retirement until the normal retirement age", and 2.5 percent o f
           GS thereafter.


The composition of the retirees

2.         As of September 2005, some 38,500 civil servants have been authorizedto retire out of
some 52,500 applicants. The ERP has succeeded beyond expectations with more than the targeted
number ofcivil personnel retiring inone year. The number o f retirees represents about 8 percent ofthe
500,000 Central Government's civil servants.
                                                                         Figure-1:Rankdistribution(inpercent)
3.         The      first   results collected draw
important          preliminary         conclusions.        As
expected, most o f the retirees are high-ranking
staff belonging to the levels 10 and above. They
account for more than 53 percent o f the retirees,
while medium and lower levels represent 39 and 8
percent, respectively. Thus, the rank structure of
the retirees does not match that o f total civil
servants (Figure-1). The expected re-profiling o f
civil servants away from the less skilled to the
more skilled ones hasjust beenpartiallyhlfilled.                                    -Total   ciMl semnli---Retirees

  Initially the ERP targeted civil servants between the ranks 1 to 9. The incentive package included a severance payment
amounting to one month of salary for each worked year with a 30-year ceiling for servants ranked 6 to 9, and a life pension
basedon a 2 percent o f salary for eachworked year.
 MoroccanAdministration rank structure spans from rank 1, the less skilled servant, to 12, the most skilled one. The ranks 1
to 4 are mostly composedof clerical and support servants; ranks 5 to 9 are mostly composed o f skilled secretaries, technical
personnel andprimary schoolteachers;ranks 10to 12 are composedo f managerialstaff and senior technicians, secondary and
university professors, physicians, engineersand the like.

4.       In terms of sectoral distribution, almost half of the high ranked personnel (13,000) were
school teachers (primary and secondary). In view o f the past failure to carry out efficient
reallocation processes to fill the existing and new human resources gaps, mainly in favor o f the rural
areas, the impact o f this relatively highnumber o f teacher's retirements on the good functioning o f the
education sector has yet to be assessed.                      Figure-2: Age distribution of retirees and Central
                                                                    Government civil personnel (in percent)

5.       The age structure o f the retirees reflects
the nature o f the incentives offered. Almost 95
percent are aged 45 years and above, with a notable           30
concentration (42 percent) in the age group 50-54.
This is mostly explained by the fact this age group

6.       By gender, women represent 35 percent                    Figure-3: Seniority (years of service) structure
of the total retirees and men 65 percent,                                                  (inpercent)

reflecting the structure o f total civil servants,
where 34 percent are women.               Most o f the
women retired- about 56 percent- belong to the                30

rank levels 1 to 9, while only 42 percent of men              25


pertain to this rank bracket. The corresponding               20

shares for total civil servants are 71 and 65 percent.        10
These results hint to the fact that the incentives o f         5

the ERP mostly favored the highranked personnel,
women andmen alike.

7.       The above results point out that the
typical retiree is a high ranked civil servant, aged 50-54, and with more than 28 years o f
working-time.       Most o f the ERP beneficiaries with such profile are likely to have been playing a
central role in directing and supervising managerial, technical, and teaching activities. Initially, the
departure o f this personnel profile might negatively affect the functioning o f the civil Administration
 and service delivery, but in the medium term, this will be offset by a younger and efficient staff re-
 allocated, a new generation o f civil servants, supported by focused training sessions that will overhaul
the operational capacities o f civil servants takingover the freed responsibility positions.

 The impact of theERP on the Budget and thePension Fund

 Savings

 8.      The fiscal savings o f the ERPwill be earned on the following expenditure categories: the
wage bill, the contribution to the Pension Fund (CMR), and the contribution to the Health
 Insurance Funds (CNOPS and other small sectoral Funds). It should be underlined that the full
 impact of the ERP will benefit the Budget starting in2006, while only less than half (0.45 percent) of
 the savings will benefit to the 2005 Budget as estimated by the distribution o f the retirees with respect
 of the date o f their effective retirement. The results relatedto the savings are summarized inTable 1.

                                                                                              ANNEX IIl
                                                                                             Page 3 of 5

     i. Savingson the wage bill

9.       To evaluate the impact on the wage bill, average salaries by rank levels and length o f service
of the retirees have been used.        These have been calculated by the Ministry o f Public Sector
Modernization (MMSP) using individual information included in the forms the applicants had to fill
out and submit to them. The results are summarized in Table 4. They show that the average gross
salary of the retirees is about MAD 123.4 thousand per year, and that total salary distributed to the
38,500 retirees was about MAD 4.8 billion or 1 percent o f 2005 GDP. This i s what the Budget will
permanently save on the wage bill starting in2006 forward, assuming no rehiring takes place. But the
budget Law 2006 under discussion inthe Parliament is creating some 5000 new public positions more
than the number to fill the positions freed by normal retirements. The impact o f the rehiring decision
on the Budget will be small, however, estimated at less than 0.1 percent o f GDP.

      ii. Savings on the employer'scontribution to the Pension Fund

10.      The employer contribution rate for the Pension Fundbenefiting civil servants i s 9 percent o f
gross salary. This rate will be increased to 10 percent starting in 2006, following the decision to raise
employer and employee's contribution to the Pension Fund by 1 percentage point each year over the
period 2004-06. The savings for 2005 is then calculated to amount to MAD 192.4 million, or 0.04 o f
GDP, andMAD475.1 millionthereafter, or 0.1 percent o f GDP.

      iii. Savings on the contribution to the Health Insurance Fund

11.      The Budget contributes the equivalent o f 2 percentage points o f Gross Salary to the Health
Insurance covering civil servants. This rate will be increased to 2.5 percent starting in 2006 as the
Compulsory Health Insurance Scheme (AMO) is implemented. The savings will amount to 0.01
percent o f GDP in2005 and 0.03 percent thereafter.

Fiscal Losses

12.       The three fiscal losses related to the ERP are: the one-off severance payments, foregone
personal taxes on salaries of the retirees, and the additional payments to the Pension Fund. The
latter will incur additional service of the early pensions to the retirees before they reach the normal age
o f retirement and the repayment o f accumulated employees' contribution who are not entitled to a
pension. Table-2 summarizes the gross outlays o fthe ERP.

       iv, Severancepayments

13.       Average outlays have been estimated using the parameters o f the package o f the ERP on the
data about the number and average salaries of the retirees, distributedby rank levels and length of
service (Tabled). The outcome shows that the one offpayment will amount to almost MAD 10billion
or 2.1 percent o fGDP.

       v. Personal Tax

14.       The Budget will lose the Personal Taxes it was collecting on the retirees' wages. However, it
will collect new Personal Taxes on the pensions the retirees will be receiving from the Pension Fund.
The difference between the two collected amounts representsthe net loss for the Budget.The rates that
apply to the income brackets, along the exonerated amount'*, have been used. The exercise takes
account o f the fact that some o f the retirees are not entitled to benefit from pensions because they do
not have the required length-of-service criteria: 15 years for women and 21 years for men. The partial
impact on the Budget 2005 applies. The result of the exercise depicts a net loss o f about 0.15 percent
o f GDP.

       vi. Additional outlays of the PensionFund.

15.       The Pension Fundwill incur additional outlays resulting from the ERP.The additional outlays
will be progressively fading away to their extinction after 30 years, as the retirees reach their
respective normal retirement age, which i s 60 years for most o f them and 65 for a few corps, such as
university professors. The exercise carried out used the retirees' age distribution with their average
pensions, distinguishing between the two normal age retirement groups. The exercise used the 2001
ILO survival data for Morocco.Table-5 gives the results o f the exercise. It shows that total nominal
additional pension will amount to 2.8 percent o f 2005 GDP. Their present value calculatedbased on a
discount rate o f 7 percent will correspond to 2.2 percent o f 2005 GDP. The authorities have indicated
that the Budget will support the Pension Fundby paying a lump sum amount in four installments of
MAD2 billioneachstartingin2006. Finally, the Pensionwill incuranother type ofoutlays bypaying-
back inone installmentthe accumulated employees' contribution for retirees not entitled to a pension.
These amount to 0.04 percent of GDP (MAD 196 million) in2005.

on pensions) and less the contribution to the Social Security Funds. The rates and the corresponding income brackets are: 0

Programwill amount to 0.6 percentof 2005 GDP per year startingin 2006 (Table 3). Depending
on the additional contribution to the Pension Fund, it will take about 3-4 years for the Budget to
recover the initial net outlays made in 2005, which amount to 1.7 percent o f GDP. It i s underlinedthat
these savings do not take into account the efficiency and effectiveness gains from the program.

discussions o f general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The
staff report for the Article IV consultation with Morocco may be made available at a later stage ifthe authorities


On August 29, 2005, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Morocco.1

Background

Morocco has achieved macroeconomic stability since the early 1990s. Inflation has remained low
anchored by the exchange rate peg and thanks to a prudent monetary policy. The external current
account has been in surplus since 2001 and external reserves increased to a comfortable level.
However, fiscal deficits have remained large and the authorities have used part o f the privatization
receipts to finance increasedexpenditures.

Growth has been volatile and insufficient to significantly reduce poverty and unemployment, Growth
averaged three percent over the last decade. It has been volatile because o f the dependency o f
agriculture to rainfalls, and recurrent droughts contribute to increasing poverty in rural areas. The
unemployment rate remains high, particularly in urban areas. Although the growth o f the
nonagricultural sector has become more resilient to agricultural output shocks, it i s insufficient to
significantly reduce unemployment.

Morocco continues to implement its broad based structural reform agenda. Large state-owned
enterprises have been privatized and remaining public enterprises are beingrestructured or prepared
for privatization. Inthe area o f trade liberalization, the implementation o f the association agreement
with the European Union, Morocco's main trading partner, is proceeding as scheduled. Trade
agreements were signed with the United States, Turkey, Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt to complement the
association agreement with the European Union. Most Favored Nation tariffs were reduced to a
maximumof 10percent for goods freely traded withthe European Union. The financial sector isbeing
strengthened. The imminent promulgation o f a new central bank and banking laws will further
enhance the autonomy o f the central bank and its supervisory power. A new labor code has been
approved and is expected to improve labor relations and flexibility in the labor market. The

  Under Article IVof the IMF's Articles o f Agreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.
A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. Onreturn to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board,
summarizesthe views o f Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

                                                                                             Page 2 of 5


government is pursuingits efforts to fight poverty, improve social conditions, and enhance the rights
of the female population. The impact of these reforms on Morocco's growth rates should be observed
inthe mediumterm.

In 2004, macroeconomic and financial conditions remained stable. While the overall GDP growth
slowed down to 4.2 percent on account of a decline in growth in the primary sector, nonagricultural
GDP growth picked up because of a dynamic tertiary sector and a recovery in mining and energy.
Inflation remained below 2 percent. The current account was in surplus, and external reserves
increased further and covered about ten months imports of goods and services as well as the public
andpubliclyguaranteed external debt.

The fiscal deficit (including Hassan I1 Fund and excluding privatization receipts) declined by 0.4
percentage points to 4.9 percent o f GDP, reflecting good revenue performance. However, some
budgetary policies did not support fiscal consolidation. Expenditures were higher than envisaged
because o f increases in: (i)investment following acceleration in project execution; (ii) wage bill
                                                                                             the
following new salary increases; and (iii) subsidies because the food subsidy reformwas postponed and
the petroleumprice adjustment was not fully implemented.The authorities were able to prevent further
expenditure increases related to the El-Hoceima earthquake and a locust invasion by reallocating
budgetary appropriations. Public debt declined to 66 percent of GDP because privatization receipts
helped finance the deficit.

The unfavorable agricultural campaign is expected to affect macroeconomic conditions in 2005. The
overall GDP growth rate is projected at about 1percent. The current account is likely to register a
small deficit partly because of a high level o f imports o f food products and higher oil bill.
Nonetheless, the overall balance of payments is expected to remain in surplus. The fiscal deficit
(excluding privatization revenue but including spendingby Hassan I1Fund) i s expected to increase to
about 5.5 percent of GDP (but to decline to 4.5 percent o f GDP, excluding one-off factors) despite
continued favorable revenue performance. Expenditures will increase reflecting the repercussions on
wage payments o f the 2004 wage negotiations, the voluntary retirement program, the new universal
health insurance program, the delay o f the food subsidy reform, and the partial adjustment in May and
August o f domestic petroleumprices. Large privatization receipts will help contain the debt to GDP
ratio at about 70 percent, despite the issuance o f debt to cover old pension fimd arrears (2.4 percent o f
GDP).

Executive BoardAssessment

 Executive Directors commended the Moroccan authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability
 and for continuing to implement their structural reform agenda in 2004. Inflation remained low,
nonagricultural output growth accelerated, and foreign exchange reserves increased further. Good
 revenue performance contributed to the narrowing o f the fiscal deficit and the debt-to-GDP ratio
 declined. Considerable progress has been made in the implementation o f structural reforms, most
 importantly, those related to trade liberalization, the financial sector, public enterprises, andthe labor
 market.

 Despite these achievements, Directors noted that growth continues to be volatile and insufficient to
 significantly reduce unemployment and poverty. To these ends, they agreed that Morocco needs to
 achieve sustained high rates o f growth in non agricultural output. In the context o f Morocco's
 increasing integration into the world economy, they considered accelerated structural reforms and
 fiscal consolidation essential elements o f a high growth strategy. They, therefore, welcomed the
 authorities' resolve to move expeditiously with their remaining structural reformagenda ina context o f
 continued macroeconomic stability andfiscal consolidation.

 Although the current fiscal stance and debt level do not pose a risk to macroeconomic stability inthe
 short term, Directors considered that current policies, if maintained, could reduce the authorities'

                                                                                               ANNEX   v
                                                                                             Page 3 of 5


ability to absorb unfavorable shocks, which could constrain growth. They, therefore, welcomed the
authorities' targeted reduction of the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. They
agreed that the achievement of this objective and its compatibility with a high-growth strategy would
require a reform of the tax system that would widen the tax base and allow a reduction in tax rates, a
decline in the wage-bill-to-GDP ratio, an overhaul o f the food subsidy program, and the
implementation o fthe petroleumprice adjustment mechanism.

Directors welcomed the authorities' plan to implement a mediumterm budget framework to enhance
the efficiency o f fiscal policies. They supported the authorities' efforts to initiate a tax reform,
particularly o f the Value Added Tax, and to present a tax expenditure report with the 2006 budget to
raise awareness about the need to improve the efficiency o f the tax system. They encouraged the
authorities to move expeditiously on a broad-basedtax policy andtax administration reform. Directors
welcomed the authorities' decision to continue their no net new hiring policy, implement a modem
humanresource managementand remuneration systemanda voluntary retirement/departure program,
and pointed to the importance of controlling salary adjustments and bonuses. Directors welcomed the
increased emphasis on social development, including through improved access to education,
healthcare, housing andbasic infrastructure andrural development, to be financed within the medium-
term budget objectives. They also greeted the recent recognition o f old pension fund arrears, and
supported the authorities' efforts at adopting and implementing a comprehensive plan to put the
pensionsystemon a sound footing.

Directors agreed that the Moroccan authorities have made commendable progress in liberalizing the
economy. The recently signed free trade agreements with the United States, Turkey and regional
partners will help attract foreign direct investment and boost Morocco's growth and export
performances. However, to fully exploit the benefits o f trade integration, Directors urged the
authorities to simplify the tariff structure, further reduce tariffs, and eliminate variable tariff rates in
parallel with the reform o f the food subsidy system while providing targeted support to vulnerable
groups. They noted that liberalization 'measures in the area of telecommunications contributed to the
current dynamism o f the sector and those related to air transportation have positively impacted              ,
tourism. They encouraged the authorities intheir efforts to liberalize other sectors o f the economy.

Directors urged the authorities to fully implement the new labor code, which should help clarify
employer/employee relationships, and to acceleratejudicial reforms, which should enhance investors'
confidence. Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation o f the remaining
measures needed to improve the business environment. Inparticular, they noted the need to improve
 governance and transparency. Directors called for caution in the provision o f exemptions or special
 incentives infavor of specific sectors as ameasureto foster investment.

 Directors welcomed the authorities' continued efforts to strengthen the financial sector and implement
the recommendations o f the Financial Sector Assessment Program. The promulgation o f the new
 central bank and bankinglaws will further enhancethe autonomy andsupervisory power o f the central
bank. Directors noted the progress made in the restructuring of the three weak state-owned banks.
They urged the authorities to accelerate the implementation o f the measures requiredto bring these
banks to compliance with prudential regulations as soon as possible. Directors encouraged the
 authorities to continue addressing the remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system, including the
highlevel of non performing loans, andto remove the structural constraints inorder to enhance the
 availability and reduce the cost o f credit to small-and-medium-size enterprises, which represent the
 core o f Morocco's enterprise sector. They commended the adoption o f a billto combat the financing o f
 terrorism, andlooked forward to action on anti-money launderinglegislation.

 Directors noted that the current peg o f the dirham has served the economy well and contributed to
 keeping inflation low, and that there are no signs o f an exchange rate misalignment. Giventhe
 increasing integration of the Moroccan economy into the rest o f the world, they noted that a gradual
 transition to a flexible exchange rate regime would be advisable. They welcomed the authorities'

openness to consider the desirability o f alternative exchange rate regimes taking into account the
characteristics of the Moroccan economy.

Directors commended the authorities' efforts to improve the statistical database. In particular, they
noted the progress made toward meeting the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS), and
encouraged the authorities to implement the agreed action plan to enable Morocco to subscribe to the
SDDS inthe coming months.
