MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SHANDONG PROVINCIAL HIGUVAY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan and
credit for the People's Republic of China is submitted for approval. The
*        proposed loan for US$60.0 million would be for 20 years maturity, including
5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable iuterest rate. The proposed
credit of SDR 38.8 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) would be issued on
standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity. The proposed loan and credit
would help finance the expansion and improvement of the highway network in
Shandong Province.
2.       Backaround.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed by
the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are evident
in all modes.  The most serious transport need is for dramatically expanded
road capacity, especially in rural areas, where increased agricultural and
small-scale industrial production have created an urgent demand for better
farm-to-market transport services. Road transport will also face a growing
share of the demand for passenger transportation from the increasingly mobile
population. In the railway subsector, the network capacity has severely
hampered delivery of energy supplies (i.e. coal), and even with recently
initiated investments in rail line electrification and new line construction,
it will take several years to alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas
and coastal cities. China also needs to substantially expand its port and
waterway facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth and container handling capacity. China's Seventh Five-
Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes all these sectoral needs. By the end of the
plan period, freight traffic is projected to be 452 higher than in 1995, and
passenger traffic 602 higher, with a disproportionately greater share of the
increase falling on road transport. To meet these needs, substantial
investments are envisioned, especially in highway network expansion, new rail
lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing lines, and more berths
at coastal ports.  The Plan also proposes to secure efficiency gains in
transportation from operational improvements; these include the development of
integrated transportation networks, particularly for coal transportation and
the import/export trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Plan envisions significant institutional changes in the
sector, including an extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises and delegating authority to
local management.  The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives
for development of the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with
financial and technical assistance. Four railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA,
2540-CHA, 2678-CHA, and Credit 1680-CHA and Loan 2968-CRA) are assisting with
the expansion of capacity on key routes and the manufacture of electric
locomotives, passenger coaches, and signalling equipment. Four earlier port
projects (Loans/Credits 2207-CHA, 2689-CII, 290i-CRA/Credit 1975-CHA, and
2877-CIA/Credit 1845-CIA) and two additi sal projects approved in



-2-
December 1988 vill effect improvements at Tianjir. Shanghai, Huangpu, Dalian,
Ningbo (Loan 3006-CIA), and Xiamen (Loan 3007-Cl.. Ports. The five Bank
Group-financed highway projects in China (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA, Loan
2811-CHA/Credit 1792-CQA, Loan 2951-CIAlCredit 1917-CIA, Loan 2952-CHA, and
Credit 1984-CMA) involve the construction and improvement of national and
rural roads ard construction of the first expressway in China.
3.      'While all the transport modes in China are in urgent need of
expansion and modernization, road transport presents the most difficult
challenge. Road freight traffic has been increasing at about 172 per annum
from 1980 to 1986, mainly due to the burgeoning market economy, and passenger
traffic is growing at over 122 p.a. Road congestion was already a serious
problem in the early 19808, and near major cities it has now grown worse.
Increased road capacity is urgently needed. Furthermore, of the approximately
962,000 km of roads in 1986, only some 22,000 km or 232 have asphaltic or
concrete pavement. These pavements are generally of poor quality; most have
exceeded their design life and are deteriorating rapidly with the increasing
traffic. Accordingly, the highway mode is receiving increased attention under
the Seventh Five-Year Plan (S mY). The SFYP for the highway subsector is to
upgrade at least 80,000 km of existing roads, and to construct about 60,000 km
of new roads, of which 1,580 km would be Expressway or of Class I standard.
4.       The main objectives for highway development in the 19809 are to
provide adequate capacity in the heavily congested corridors, to upgrade and
improve the existing network, and to expand the network in remote rural areas.
The proposed 319 km Jinan-Qingdao Road is part of the plan for high standard
road investment in Shandong Province. The proposed program for evaluation and
strengthening the paved roads in Jining Prefecturate of the province serves
the objective of upgrading and improving the existing poor quality and low
standard paved road network. There is also an urgent need in the province for
more modern techniques in the planning, design, construction, and maintenance
of roads.
S.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank Group supports the
government's objectives and initiatives for development of the transport
sector with both financial and techbical assistance to remove the transport
bottlenecks impeding economic growth. The strategy for the Bank Group's
involvement in the highway subsector is to meet the most urgent needs of road
network expansion and to support a program of studies on key policy issues.
The Bank Group's involvement in the highway subsector, particularly in terms
of policy, institutional and technical matters under the first five projects,
aims at helping to modernize the subsector by bringing Bank Group experience
to bear on the problems and by expediting the introduction of advanced
technology to solve them. Ongoing studies in these projects cover important
problems related to roads financing, road safety, road congestion, and the
methodology for evaluating existing road pavements. The propostd project,
besides helping to alleviate congestion on this most congested corridor of
Shandong Province, would continue the Bank Group's support in these matters
and encompass new tasks related to road pavement strengthening and planning.

6.       Project Obiectives.  The existing roads between Jinan and Qingdao are
heavily congested. The proposed project would provide a high-capacity, high-
standard highway in this important corridor between the capital of Shandong
Province and one of the main ports in China. The project would also address
the following specific policy, institutional, and technological objectivess
(a) improving road planning techniques; (b) evaluatation of e6lsting paved
roads and Vreparation of a pavement strengthening and maintenance management
program; (c) development of institutional capacity for supervising the
construction of civil works; (d) carrying out staff training;
(e) strengthening of highway research; and (f) improving road safety.
7.       Project Description.  The Shandong Provincial Transport Department
(SPTD) would be responsible for carrying out the project under the overall
supervision of the Shandong Provincial Government and HOC. The project
components are: (a) construction of a 319 km four-lane divided highway between
Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province and Qingdao, one of the major ports of
China; (b) consulting services to assist SPTD in construction supervision and
help train SPTD staff in supervising and maintaining quality control over
highway construction; (c) specialized equipment and technical assistance to
evaluate about 560 km of existing road pavements and prepare a pavement
strengthening and maintenance management program; (d) equipment and expertise
to set up a computerized road data bank to improve road planning; (e) road
maintenance, traffic monitoring, and communications equipment; (f) research
equipment for the Central Road Laboratory; (g) training of SPTD staff; and (h)
road safety improvements.
S.       Schedule A shows the estimated project costs and financing plan.
Schedule B shows procurement methods and estimated disbursements. Retroactive
financing of up to $4.5 million for expenditures made after July 8, 1988 would
be permitted. Schedules C and D show a timetable for project processing and
statement of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and the IFC operations for China,
respectively. A map showing the Shandong Provincial Transport Network and the
Jinan-Qingdao Highway is attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7602-CIA, is
being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
Shandong Province on the followings (a) terms of reference for the
supervision of construction, a pavement evaluation study and development of a
road data bank; (b) the type and amount of road maintenance, traffic
monitoring, and communication equipment to be procured under the project;
(c) the type and amount of equipment for the road pavement strengthening
program and the Provincial Central Road Laboratory to be procured under the
project; (d) the scope, timing, and cost of the proposed training program for
SPTD staff; (e) the scope and timing of the road safety program); (f) an
implementation schedule for the project; and (g) a sample survey would be
carried out by SPTD to determine the impact of resettlement on the families
dislocated.



-4-
10.      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shandong Province
thats (a) the account for project-related expenditures would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank Group and audit reports would be
sent to the Bank Group for review within six months of the close of each
fiscal year of the Borrower; (b) it would carry out the resettlement under the
Project in accordance with a plan agreed with the Bank Group; and (c) the
level of toll charges would not exceed 302 of the vehicle operating cost
savings for the Jinan-Qingdao highway, and that surh savings would be
calculated in a manner agreed with the Bank Group.
11.      Risks.  There are -o major risks foreseen with the project.
Consultants, financed by the United States under its Trade Development Program
(TDP), have reviewed the project design and cost estimates and nave helped
prepare bid documents. Thorough field surveys and subsurface explorations
have been carried out, and adequate and suitable materials will be available
for road construction. The risk of delays in cmpleting the highway would be
minimized by providing consultant services for supervision and by training
local construction supervisory engineers.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association and I
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.

Bank/IDA financed projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
bi As credits are denominated in SDRD (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and
the SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount
greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
