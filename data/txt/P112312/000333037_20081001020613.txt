                      Zontribution to CPS
                      rhe proposed Programmatic Development Loan is intended to support the fiscal and
                      nstitutional development policy aspects o f the Guatemala Country Partnership Strategy
                      :FY09-12), which was presented to the World Bank Executive Board for discussion on
                      September 23, 2008.       The new CPS program envisions supporting policy areas as
                      lescribed inthis DPL, but also investment operations in key areas including, education,
                      health and nutrition, rural infrastructure and disaster risk mitigation, many of which
                      ouild on the ongoing portfolio of interventions in these areas. This loan focuses on the
                      main policy objectives o f the government's development plan within the CPS including:
                      i)fiscalreformto expand fiscalspacefor priorityspendingandinvestment, ii)increased
                      financial market stability and deepening, iii)enhanced governance and transparency, iv)
                      strengthenedpublic fmancial management and procurement, v) improved execution and
                      targeting o f social spending, and vi) improved investment climate by simplifying tax and
                      customs administration. The analytical basis draws on findings set forth in the CEM,
                      PER, Poverty Assessment, the regional and Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment
                      and FSAP update. Public financial management and procurement measuresare based on
                      the findings o fthe CFAA and CPAR.

                      There are three primary risks associated with the proposed programmatic DPL series:
                      political, natural disaster, and economic risks. These risks and the ways they are being
                      mitigated include:

                           Political:   Political deadlock may arise, stalling progress on the policy reforms
                           supported by the DPL. In particular, reforms to increase tax collections to fund
                           priority spending have historically been, and continue to be contentious. T h i s
                           concern could be amplified if growth begins to slow significantly inthe context o f
                           the global economic downturn.         Mitigation: The risk is minimized by the
                           Government's consultative approach to reform implementation and thefacilitation
                           of dialogue on fiscal action among country stakeholders (with WBIsupport).        The
                           operation is also being coordinated with the budget cycle to increase legislative
                           engagement.
                           Natural Disasters: Guatemala is highly vulnerable to multiple natural disaster
R i s k s and Risk         risks-floods,   hurricanes and earthquakes-that     pose a significant direct threat to
Mitigation:                economic growth and poverty reduction, as well as indirect threat by redirecting
                           government resources away from long-run development plans. Mitigation: The CPS
                           program supports government efforts to update and validate the National Program
                           for Disaster Mitigation and Response. A planned CAT-DDO (FY09) would support
                            implementation of comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures and, in the event
                            of a disaster, give the Government access to bridge financing while it mobilizes
                           funds fiom other sources for disaster recovery. In addition, an FY08 non-lending
                            Technical Assistance program, the Development of Scientific Information to
                            Promote the Municipal Planning to Reduce Disaster Risks, has been taken up by
                            Global Facilityfor Disaster Reduction and Recovery grants.
                            Economic: U.S. and global deceleration, risingenergy and food prices, slowdown in
                            foreign investment and lower remittance growth may slow or reverse progress on
                            reforms and poverty reduction actions. Mitigation: Ongoing macro-monitoring and
                            country dialogue to adjust operation ifcritical risks emerge. The operation includes
                            specific actions to manage and respond tofinancial vulnerabilities.

                                   I.COUNTRYCONTEXT

1.      With a multi-ethnic population of about 13 million and a per-capita GNI of about
$2,610, Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. While a source of cultural
strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala's ethnic diversity has also unfortunately been
accompanied by a pattern of conflict and exclusion since colonial times. Inthe latter halfof the
20th century, long-standing socio-political and economic tensions sparked a debilitating 36-year
civil war, which ended in 1996 with the signing of a set of Peace Accords between government
andguerrilla leaders, following protractednegotiations.

2.      Guatemala has made considerable development progress since the signing of the
Peace Accords in 1996. Particularly, improvements have been made inconsolidatingpeace and
building democratic institutions. The process of consolidating democratic institutions was
strengthened most recently with the peaceful transition to the new government of Alvaro Colom
of the Uni6n Nacional de la Esperanza (UNE) party in January 2008, following the
administration o f Oscar Berger o f the Gran Alianza Nacional (GANA) party. While UNE won
the largest numbero f congressional seats (51 out o f I%), of a simple majority has made
                                                          the lack
the new administration's focus on social cohesion and building strategic alliances particularly
relevant.   Building a broad consensus is important for the successful implementation of its
ambitious development planinpromotinginclusive growth and reducingpoverty andinequality.

3.      Despite progress on consolidating democratic institutions, poverty and inequality
remain high and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low compared to other
countries of similar income levels. Poverty declined from 56 to 51 percent between2000 and
2006, while extreme poverty has remained roughly unchanged at about 15 percent. Much of the
extreme poverty i s among the rural indigenous, with chronic malnutrition o f children in this
group running as high as 69 percent. Important impediments to gains in reducing poverty and
inequality are the lack of consistent andbroad-basedgrowth as well as programs that specifically
target the poor. This, inturn, dependsnot only on improving the attractivenessof the country for
both domestic and foreign investment, but also on the fiscal and institutional means to execute
efficient and well targeted socialprograms andpublic investment. Relyingexclusivelyongrowth
to cut poverty by half by 2015 would require an average annual per capita growth rate of 2.4
percent, a goal that Guatemalahas infrequently achieved.*

4.      The Colom administration has highlighted its commitment to making growth m o r e
inclusive to address the country's high levels of poverty and inequality. The government has
placed particular emphasis on policy reforms inthe areas o f enhancing growth and productivity,
governance, transparency, reducing risk and expanding fiscal revenues and opportunities for the
poor by providing basic services (education, healthcare, nutrition, etc).   It aims thereby to
address deep pockets of poverty in the country, particularly in the rural areas, where recent
improvements in overall economic growth have not made significant inroads. Crime and

violence are also recognized as serious economic and social problems and new challenges have
arisen, particularly high food and oil prices and the slowdown of the global economy, which
have temperedeconomic activity andincome growth amongthe poor.

  11. ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND RECENT MACROECONOMICPERFORMANCE

A. Growth and Stability


5.       Economic growth has been relatively stable compared to the rest of Latin America.
Since 1960, annual per capita real GDP growth in Guatemala has averaged about 1.4 percent,
nearly the same as Latin America's rate as a whole, but the country's growth volatility was less
than half the regional average.2 Much of Guatemala's relative stability can be attributed to
prudent macroeconomic policies that have kept inflation and public debt manageable, while
avoidingfiscal imbalances that haveplaguedmucho f the region.

6.       Sound macroeconomic management has allowed Guatemala to capitalize on
favorable external conditions in recent years. Despite Guatemala's susceptibility to natural
disasters (e.g. Hurricane Stan in2005), financial market shocks (e.g., the successful resolution of
two commercial banks in2006-2007), and terms o f trade shocks (e.g., the coffee crisis in2003-
2004), the economy grew 4.2 percent on average from 2004 to 2007, reaching 5.7 percent in
2007, its highest growth inthree decades. Reforms to improve the investment climate and reduce
borrowing costs contributed to accelerating private consumption and investment. Onthe external
front, high inflows o f wage remittances and favorable external conditions helped create strong
demand for Guatemala's exports and stable balance o fpayments financing.

7.       TOaccelerate broad-based growth, Guatemala wishes to improve the investment
climate for business, increase educational attainment and make progress on the
governance, transparency and security. A challenge in meeting these goals will be to expand
fiscal space to support priority public investment and social spending. Since the 1996 Peace
Accords, Guatemala's target has been to raise tax revenues to 13.2 percent o f GDP? Despite
significant improvements in tax administration, including the passage of an Anti-Tax Evasion
Law in2006, political opposition and unfavorable constitutional court rulings on taxes have kept
tax collections as a share of GDP relatively flat and below the Peace Accords target!
Guatemala's light tax burden, which at slightly over 12 percent i s among the lowest in the
region, does not provide sufficient fiscal space to address social needs.


B. Investment Climate, Trade and Finance
8.       Since 2003, Guatemala has achieved substantial progress in improving its
investment climate. While Guatemala still faces challenges in terms o f investment climate, in
2006 and 2007 Guatemala was among the top reformers worldwide, and perceptions of the
business environment have improved ~ubstantially.~New free trade agreements have been, or

are being, negotiated, including DR-CAFTA, which became effective in 2006. FDIincreased
more than threefold since 2004. Guatemala's sovereign risk ratings also improved (ie., S&P 's,
BB w/positive outlook; Fitch, BB+ w/stable outlook; and Moody's, Ba2 w/positive outlook).
Still, challenges remain, and the 2008 Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment highlights
corruption, energy supplies and crime as the greatest obstacles faced bybusiness (see Box 1).


                 Box 1. 2008 GuatemalaInvestment ClimateAssessment(ICA) Findings
The second Investment Climate Assessment for Guatemala was completed in2008 based on 2007 survey data and
allows for a comparison with 2004 data. The survey interviewed more than 500 firms from the manufacturing,
services and construction sectors.

Since 2003, Guatemala made substantial progress in improving its business climate, but there is room for
improvement, especially compared to its competitors. Firms still report comption as their number one obstacle,
but only 61 percent of firms did so in2007 versus 81 percent of firms in 2004. Perceptions of macroeconomic
instability, informal competition, and accessto finance also improved. Only electricity, transport and access to land
deteriorated since 2003. In fact, electricity was the second major obstacle in 2007, while perception of crime
improved substantially (from 80 to 37 percent). However, crime affects firms differently depending on their size,
region o f operation, and exporter status. Small firms suffer the most, and Guatemala continues to suffer more from
crime than comparator countries. As for electricity, the I C A highlights that access to reliable electricity supply has
become a major concern for firms. Inthe last three years, the frequency of power outages has increased, and there
have beenproblems satisfying peak demand.



9.        Initial indications are that DR-CAFTA and other free trade initiatives have helped
to boost trade, but extending these benefits to the poor will require a broad-based
development agenda (See Box 2). Since DR-CAFTA came into effect, exports and imports
have grown more rapidly than in previous years, but it is still too early to determine whether
these gains can be attributed solely to the free trade agreement or to other favorable external
demand factors. Global experience suggests that the extra growth and poverty reduction that
Guatemala extracts from its fiee trade initiatives will largely depend on the efficiency and
competitiveness o f its economy. Competitiveness reflects many factors, including labor force
education and flexibility, reliability o f energy sources, good transportation linkages within the
country, port facilities, andthe capacity of the legal andjudicial system to enforce contracts and
facilitate business activity, among others.

10.       Financial sector legal and regulatory reforms implemented since 2000 have
improved banks' solvency and resilience to market volatility, but much remains to be
completed and lack of access to finance remains a major issue for the financial sector. The
strengthening o f the financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework and practices in
Guatemala has helped to reduce the risk of a systemic banking crisis and avoid associated high
social costs. In fact, international experience shows that financial crises entail large fiscal costs
that crowd out social spending with dramatic effects on poverty. However, the recent failure of
two banks, although successfully resolved, pointed to remaining vulnerabilities in the sector,
specially the existence o f unsupervised intermediation. This experience has prompted the
financial authorities to strengthen the regulation o f financial conglomerates and accelerate the
transition from a compliance based supervision approach to a risk-based consolidated
supervision approach. The strengthening of banks and increasing profitability are important for
financial stability, but they are also important to enable banks to increase lending. W h i l e
domestic credit to the private sector increased from around 20 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 30.1

percent in 2007, these figures remain low compared to the Central American average (i.e., 47
percent) and interest rate spreads are also relatively high. The problem i s especially serious for
smaller firms, whose access to credit is even more restricted. Currently, a wide range of mostly
non-regulated financial entities service clients that cannot access the banking system. In this
context, a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework would help reduce risk and deepen the
development of the financial system. Enhanced consolidated banking supervision, portfolio risk
analysis, the implementation o f the Movable Guarantees Law, simplified accounting rules and
governance practices for business, a comprehensive credit information system and more efficient
procedures for execution o f collateral would improve the stability and access to credit for
business.


                                              BOX2. DR-CAFTA
The DominicanRepublic - Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) became effective inGuatemala
on July 1, 2006. More than providing new incentives, DR-CAFTA offered more permanent access to the U.S.
market compared to that of the 1993 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Under DR-CAFTA, tariffs on about 80
percent of US exports to Central America were eliminated, and the rest will be phased out over the next decade.
US trade barriers also fell, but because most products already entered the U S market under CBI preferences, the
effect o f their removal was modest.

Though it is too early to measure direct trade effects in terms o f productivity, job creation, and contributions to
economic growth, preliminary trade data show an estimated 21 percent increase in exports and a 13 percent
increase in imports in 2007 compared to 2006. It is unclear whether t h s is due to the impact o f the free trade
agreement, per se, or general growth in foreign demand and the domestic economy. Inany case, DR-CAFTA has
reinforced a longstanding trend o f growing trade with the United States and intra-regional trade with Central
America.

A simulation model developed by the Bank o f Guatemala suggests that 0.62 points was added to the GDP in2006
for the twelve months that DR-CAFTA had been in effect. Another important short term impact has been a
contribution to increased foreign direct investment (FDI), which has been growing since 2002. Policymakers have
high expectations for DR-CAFTA as a means o f attracting investment and improving regional economic
integration. Again, a Bank of Guatemala model suggests that without DR-CAFTA, foreign direct investment would
have been almost 60 percent lower in2006.

Though the causes are not clear, investment in various sectors o f the economy has shifted. Investors seem to be
moving out of maquizas (clothing manufacturing's share o f new FDI dropped from 52.2 percent in 2005 to 45.6
percent in June of 2007) and other manufacturing and into services such as call centers and business processing.
These changes have labor dislocation effects, with implications for education, technical training, and infrastructure
investments.



C.Governance andTransparency


11.       Despite government efforts in recent years to improve governance and strengthen
institutions,public perceptionsof governanceremainlow. Among World Bank governance
indicators, regulatory quality and voice and accountability showed some improvement, but the
rule of law remains one of the most important challenges as it falls well below averages for Latin
America and countries with similar income. Inan effort to fight impunityinthe country, in2007
Congress approved the creation of the International Commission against Impunity.The United

12.      Guatemala made steady progress in recent years in transparency. T h e
implementation of the integrated financial management system (SIAF), which was built upon a
good normative framework and a modern technological platform, contributed to efficiency in
financial transactions and the production of timely, transparent information o n most government
finances (See Box 3). Moreover, Guatemala's Transparency and Anti-corruption Agenda is one
o f the new Government's mainpriorities, which i s being led by the Vice President along with the
Minister of Finance, who i s leading efforts on fiscal transparency.

                            Box 3. Progresson PublicFinancialManagement

  After more than a decade of continuous work inmodernizing and reforming core elements of public
  sector institutions and systems, Guatemala i s now one o f the leading countries inthe implementation
  o f Public Financial Management (PFM) reform. Implementation o f integrated financial management
  system SIAF and public procurement system GUATECOMPRAS constitute the main elements of a
  more effective and transparent public administration. Most notable achievements reached thus far
  include:

      The SIAF system is now considered one of the best regionalpractices in automated public
      financial management.The system was upgraded to operate under web-based technology and i s
      now fully operational in all central government agencies and most of the decentralized entities,
      and furthermore covers approximately 300 executing-level units. It includes most of the public
      financial management functions

      New financial management proceduresand systems were successfully implemented in all
      municipalities.A new framework for municipal financial management S I A F M U N I has allowed
      for a more efficient and transparent model. New municipal financial management procedures and
      systems are gradually being implemented inall municipal governments inGuatemala.

      The e-procurement application GUATECOMPRAS is now operating and registering all
      centralgovernment agencies' transactions and is gradually beingexpanded to decentralized
      entities and municipalities. Although the applicationhas yet to support online transactions (such
      as electronic bidding or electronic purchasing), this system has successfully promoted higher
      degrees of transparency inthe public procurement practices evidenced by improvements inusers'
      perceptions and a recent award granted by the private sector association inGuatemala.

      An automatic and fully integrated payroll system is being implemented throughout all
      central government agencies, includingthe health and education sectors. Nearly all central
      government employees are now paid through the banking system and an updated database of
      public sector employees hasbeendeveloped andintegrated withthe SIAF system.

      An automatedworkflow systemto support the Comptroller GeneralOffice's audit processes
      has been developed and is under implementation. Although not completely operational and
       subject to further evaluations, the government audit system (SAG) is supporting the corebusiness
      processes o fthe Comptroller's Office.

D. RecentEconomicDevelopmentsand GrowthOutlook


13.     After a period of stable and declining inflation, prices in Guatemala have seen an
uptick, driven in large measure by the high internationalprices of food and oil. Year-on-
year headline inflation increased from 5.3 percent in mid 2007 to 14.2 percent in July 2008.
Perhaps more womsome, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) has tracked closely
headline inflation and increased markedly from about 5 percent in mid 2007 to 12.3 percent in
July 2008. Survey-based inflation expectations for end-2008 have also been on the rise inrecent
months. This reversal on the inflation front has been mainly drivenby the evolution of oil and
food prices (internationally, oil prices increased by 47 percent and food prices rose by 60 in
2007), and also by domestic demandpressures (credit to the private sector has been increasing at
27 percent on average over 2006-2007.

14.     Food price inflation accelerated from slightly below eight percent in mid-2007 to
19.4 percentinJuly 2008. As inother countries, the poor are beinghit hardby inflationof food
prices, given that food tends to represent a larger share o f consumption among the poor (54
percent for those below the poverty line and 37 percent in the CPI basket). Infact, inJuly 2008
the effective inflation rate for the Guatemalan poor, considering a typically consumed basket of
goods, was about 1.4 percentage points above the officially measured inflation rate. The
Government is working to partially compensate for the negative terms o f trade shock (which has
been one of the strongest inthe region) through various measures, includinglower import duties
and taxes on food, accelerated rural development strategies, and increased payments under a new
conditional cash transfer program, which will partially mitigate the rise in food and
transportation prices.   At the same time, the government has pursued tighter monetary policy,
raising interest rates a half a percentage point in July to 7.25 percent. The Central Bank i s
attempting to provide a careful balance between sufficiently raising policy interest rates to stem
inflationary expectations and inertia, and, at the same time, not raising rates too severely to cause
a policy-induced liquidity crunch and economic slowdown.

15.     Guatemala'sexternal position remained stable over the past few years. The current
account deficit  stabilized at five percent o f GDP, and private capital inflows and remittances
permitted the accumulation o f international reserves to a comfortable level: about four months of
imports of goods and services. For 2008, the external deficit is projected to deteriorate to 5.5
percent of GDP because o fhighoil prices, declining thereafter to about 5.1 percent at the end of
2012, as oil imports moderate and exports and remittances continue growing (see Table 1 on
Guatemala's macroeconomic outlook).

16.     Guatemala's fiscal deficit and public debt to GDP are among the lowest in Latin
America. From 2004 to 2007, the deficit o f the Central Government averaged 1.7 percent of
GDP, and public debt o f the non-financial public sector remained less than 23 percent of GDP
(of which about 13 percent is external debt). As shown in Table 1, the overall fiscal deficit rose
to about 2 percent o f GDP in2007 andis expected to remain at about that same levelin2008 and
2009. Adjusting for the global economic slowdown, this represents a modest fiscal tightening.
To address Guatemala's social needs and expand critical programs, fiscal resources will need to
grow.    A modest fiscal reform program i s thus on the agenda to promote prudent fiscal
management and cover additional planned spending. The reform i s designed to cover revenue
losses (0.7 percent o f GDP) associated with the expiration o f a temporary minimum corporate
income tax in 2008, and provide fiscal space for additional social spending. By the end of the


                                                   6

administration, the net additional collection i s estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP to meet the Peace
Accords target of 13.2 percent of GDP.

17.      Growth is slowing to sustainable levels after a robust pace in recent years. Growthis
expected to moderate to 4.6 percent in 2008 from 5.7 percent in2007 owing to sluggish global
economic activity, particularlyinthe UnitedStates, softer growth inremittance inflows, andhigh
food andoil prices. Export growth slowed to 13.5 percent inMay 2008 from 32.4 percentinM a y
2007, and growth in remittances, a major component o f income for the poor, dropped to 8.5
percent in July 2008 from 14.6 percent in July 2007. Capital inflows have also shown signs of
slowing as global financial markets have experienced greater volatility. InJune 2008, the (year-
on-year) index of economic activity rose 4.2 percent, well below the 6.8 percent averageincrease
in2007. Inflation is also expectedto moderate during 2009, mainly from stabilization of food
andoil prices andthe effects of a monetary tighteningpolicy, whichbeganinmid-2007. Month
to monthinflationhad already shown adecline from 1.63 percent inJune to 1.25 percent inJuly.

18.      The outlook for growth over the next four years period is broadly positive. Through
2012, real GDP growth is expectedto average about 4.5 percent, less than the rates since 2005,
but higherthan the rate observed over from 2000-2005. Growth i s expected to b e supportedby a
recovery inglobal and domestic demand and increased trade and foreign investment under DR-
CAFTA, other free trade agreements, and enhancedregional integration. Domestic and foreign
direct investment are expected to rise owing to greater business confidence, improved
transparency and public sector governance, rural productivity gains, and a rebound inthe prices
o f traditional and non-traditional exports. Economic growth is projected to exceed population
growth by about two percent over the medium-term, continuing the trend of positive per capita
income gains since 2004.

                                                 DEVLEOPMENT


  19.     The Colom administration has focused its efforts on increasing growth and reducing
 poverty and inequality while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Government plan is
 built on eight fundamental principles (prioritizing the poor, gender equality, investing in
 children, multiculturalism, ethics, environmental conservation, citizen participation, and respect
 for human rights) that cut across four development themes: (i)Solidarity; (ii)Governance; (E)
 Productivity; and (iv) Regionalism. Furthermore, it places particular emphasis on expanding
 the fiscal space to finance the implementation o f its plan as well as on improving transparency
 and efficiency in the public sector. The government's development themes are presented in Box
 4, and the key issues relevant to fiscal and institutional development are discussed within these
 themes subsequently.
1Box 4. Government Development Themes                                                                                 I
 I.Solidarity
     1. Social Development (includes rural development, education, health and nutrition):                    Generate
          employment, reduce poverty and ensure access to basic inffastructure and services, in keeping with the
          Peace Accords Agenda, the Agenda Nacional Compartida (National Shared Agenda) and the Millennium
          Development Goals. These objectives are to be reached through an integrated approach, which includes
          among others: actions to increase productivity and generate employment, expanding fiscal space, SME
          development, and increasingthe effectiveness of social spending through a targeted CCT program.

     2.   Municipal Development: Promote democratic principles and processes at the local level by strengthening
          the role of the municipality in development and service provision through measures that facilitate citizen
          participation at the local level and that increase municipal capacity.
 II.Governance
     1. Security andRuleof Law: Consolidate rule oflaw andprovide citizen security. Strengthenconstitutional
          rights, fight corruption (for example, by providing citizens with the means and protection needed to
          denounce corrupt actions), strengthen institutions that provide citizen security and the penal system,
          support violence preventionprograms, etc.

     2.   Democratic Development: Promote the democratic development model by strengthening the role of the
          state. Promote a true pluralistic political culture by strengthening representative democracy and supporting
         the modernization of the party system, while increasing decentralization o fpolitical processes. Promote the
         rights and development o f indigenous populations.

     3. Legislative Policy: Enhanced legislativeprocessesto provide security and citizen wellbeing. Actions under
         this area include capacity development for Congress, increasing transparency and informing civil society
         about legislative activity (especially inthe social sphere).
 111.Productivity
     1. Economic Development: Deepen and enhance conditions for sustainable economic growth that translate



                                                              8

         into fair economic development, job creation, higher salaries, and reduced poverty and inequality. Policies
         inthis area includetourism and SMEdevelopment, infrastructure, and agricultural modernization.

     2.  Risk Management and Natural Disaster Prevention: Mitigate and reduce human losses and physical
         damage originating from risks associated with natural disasters and, thus, create the conditions for
         sustainable development. A step to achieve this objective i s the implementation of an effective Natural
         Disaster Mitigation and Management Strategy.
 IV. Regionalism
     1. RegionalIntegration: Develop aproactive, creative and autonomous foreignpolicy to positionGuatemala
         inaleadership positionwithintheregionandpromote ajoint effort inareas ofcommonregionalinterests
         such as environment, energy, banking, customs and security.

 20.     As outlined above, the government's multi-faceted development program contains a
 broad array of measures to combat poverty and inequality in Guatemala, including policy
 reforms and investments ininfi-astructure, social programs, and actions to mitigate the impact of
 natural disasters, among others. The elements of the government's program described below
 highlightthe key fiscal and institutional challenges the country faces and policy measures the
 government is pursuing. These are key development challenges for Guatemala andthe focus the
 programmatic DPL series.


 A. Priority Spending for Reducing Poverty and Inequality: Enhanced Monitoring and
 Evaluationand MaintainingFiscal Space
 21.     A key focus of the government's first development theme, solidarity, includes
 reducing poverty and inequality through a conditional cash transfer program. The CCT
 program targets the most vulnerable by providing cash incentives to poor families to take
 advantage of health and educational opportunities, as well as income to meet basic needs. In
 March 2008, the Government launched the pilot phase of the CCT program, Mi FamiZia
 Progresa, in five municipalities, and the program will be extended to reach 125 cities to benefit
 about 200,000 families. As o f August 2008, Mi Familia Progresa Program is being implemented
 in 14municipalities benefitingmore than36,700 families. Dependingonthe numberofchildren
 and the grades in which they attend school beneficiary families could receive up to Q350 per
 month (about $50) on the condition that their children regularly attend school and visit health
 centers. The program is expected to cost around $180 million annually. Ensuring effective
 implementation, fiscal sustainability and the supply o f related services will be its main
 challenges. The Government o f Guatemala requested support from the World Bank andthe IDB
 on the CCT program's design, including mechanisms to enhance monitoring, evaluation, and
 transparency, and support to help address supply side issues in coordination with the projects in
 health and education.

 22.     Reaching the expected impact of Mi Familia Progresa requires strong mechanisms
 for monitoring and evaluation o f the program.                        As in any new program, ongoing
 improvements to execution and efficiency are necessary as implementation experience is gained
 and the impact o f the program on poverty i s evaluated. Consequently, factors that will determine
 the program's success include: (i)appropriate mechanisms to select t h e most vulnerable
 population; (ii)adequacy o f health, nutrition and education sewices in the geographic areas of
 intervention; (iii)   adequate monitoring of co-responsibilities to ensure that families are using


                                                         9

available services; (iv) institutional and implementation arrangements, and (v) control and
accountability mechanisms and tools to improve transparency in managing funds. The
Government of Guatemala i s aware o f these challenges and, on a pilot basis, has designed and
begunimplementationo f a transparent monitoring and evaluation mechanism for the Mi Familia
Progresa program including the use o fproxy means test inthe selection ofbeneficiaries living in
municipalities. The government i s also drafting a plan, with the assistance of IDB, for an
external evaluation o fthe program's impact.

23.    TOmeet priority social spending and investment goals, the Colom government
drafted a fiscal reform program during its first months. Recognizing the political factors
constraining a deep and far-reaching program, the current economic slowdown and the
expiration of the temporary tax onbusiness income (IETAAP) in2008, authorities are pursuing a
modest but important fiscal reform. Consensus on tax reform has remained an elusive goal in
Guatemala, with only minimal success in recent years. Within this context, a new draft fiscal
modernization reform proposal has been developed by the multi-sectoral Fiscal Dialogue Group,
a technical-working group created in 2006 under the auspices o f the National Commission for
the PeaceAccords.

24.      The Colom government has consulted with a wide array country stakeholders to
build consensus and presented a fiscal reform proposal to the Congress on August 11,2008.
Originally intended as a single stage reform, but then divided into two phases to facilitate
consensus and congressional approval, the Government's proposed reform includes actions to
reduce tax evasion, improve the customs legal framework and enforcement, and increase tax
collections (see Table 2 for details). The first phase includes two components: (i)                       provisions for
the modernization o f the tax system (including the vehicle tax regimeand tax administration) and
customs, and (ii) transitional tax on business income, called the "Solidarity Tax" (Impuesto
                      a
Solidaridad, ISo), that will replace the IETAAP (Impuesto Extraordinario de Apoyo a los
Acuerdos de Paz, a temporary income tax on businesses). Both components are expectedto be
approved in 2008 and become effective by January 2009, providing a gross increase in tax
revenues o f about 1.0 percent of GDP through increasing the tax base and reducing tax evasion.
Tax revenues are expected to reach 12.5 percent o f GDP for 2009. The second phase includes a
new income tax proposal that is expected to be submittedto Congressinearly 2009 andbecome
effective by January 2010. Once the second phase income tax proposal i s implemented, the
Solidarity Tax will expire. The administration's goal i s to improve the tax system's efficiency
and fairness as well as reach the Peace Accord target for tax collections of 13.2 percent of GDP
beforethe end o f its term in2012.


B. Promoting Financial Market Stability and Deepening
25.      Complementing policies for poverty reduction are financial sector reformsto reduce
the economy's vulnerability to external and internal shocks and improve access to finance.
Guatemala has continued to strengthen the country's financial sector, preserving systemic
integrity and stability and improvingaccessto finance indicators. Inpart with assistancefrom the
Bank, the IMF and the IDB, since 2001 Guatemala has modernized the financial sector legal and
institutional framework. An anti money laundering law was enactedin December 2001 aimed at
strengthening prevention and detection o f money laundering activities and a package o f four
basic financial laws was a proved by Congress approved in 2002 and subsequent measures
                                    g
against terrorism financing. Progress has been made in strengthening consolidated supervision

6This package included Banking and Financial Groups Law, a Central Bank Law, a Banking Supervision Law, and
a Monetary Law. The Intendencia de Verificacion Especial (Intelligence Unit,N E ) has been active since December
2001, as part of the Superintendency of Banks, in strengthening the AML activities inGuatemala. Savingsand credit
cooperatives were obliged to report since November 2002, while lotteries, raffles etc have been included since
December 2007. Since 2005 the Law includes the prevention o f the terrorism financing. IVE has implemented new
forms of reporting under the "Know Your Customer" rules, cash operations equal or higher than US$lO,OOO, and



                                                           11

 as well as putting in place better risk-managementpractices by financial institutions, to enable
better access to finance. Inthe aftermath o f the failure of two banks in late 2006 and early 2007,
 systemic stability has been preserved and progress has been made in addressing some of the
vulnerabilities that had led to these failures, especially related to the existence of unsupervised
intermediation. Bank prudential and profitability indicators have improved, while the ratio of
private sector credit to GDP rose to 30.4 percent in2007 (26.8 percent in2006), one measure of
 access to finance.

26.       Crucial actions have been taken to improve the supervision of financial
conglomeratesincludingimplementationof recommendationsemerging from the failure of
two banks in late 2006/ 2007, while others are in progress. To implement the new risk-based
supervision approach, a new manual on risk-based and consolidated supervision is being
implemented (supported by IDB-FOMIN funding and Bank technical support), in line with
recommendations from thejoint IMF-WB FSAP Update 2005-2006. The new manual allows the
 SIB to evaluate and follow up the financial and non-financial risks that apply to the supervised
entities before they affect their financial and operative situation and prevent them from meeting
prudential n o m s and regulations. Based on the risk profiles (liquidity, interest rate, credit,
operational and market risks) of the supervised institutions, the SIB can determine the level of
supervision and the strategies that need to be applied commensurate with their vulnerabilities or
exposure level. At least two o f these risk profiles are being implemented with the new manual
and will be completed shortly inat least three o f the largest financial groups. The SIB expects to
complete the supervision o f all the risk profiles for all the financial groups intwo to three years.
Also, a new unit has been established inthe SIB to undertake supervision o n a "horizontal" basis
(i.e. across different financial groups, compared to the "vertical" supervision within financial
groups). The horizontal risk analysis will begin with one risk profile for the 100 largest
borrowers in the system. The new unit is also responsible for the risk mapping analysis of
financial groups that started in 2007.' The SIB has also extended prudential rules, including on
credit risk limits, to offshore banks.

27.       There have been continued actions to modernize the regulatory framework for
deepening financial markets and modernizationof the paymentssystem. These include the
standardization of the Central Bank's (Banguat) debt instruments and regular issuance to help
develop an interest rate yield curve, A stable yield curve will help to reduce interest rates and
guide the market to accurately judge risk and price debt instruments. Also, banks and financial
institutions are now required to report to Banguat financial terms o f trading operations related to
certificates o f deposit (CDs) and Government bonds, and this information i s consolidated and
published in Banguat's internet site to enhance transparency and the development of secondary

suspicious transactions, while it has also introduced customs declarations forms. During2002 to 2007, 80 criminal
complaints were presented to the Public Prosecutor on money laundering offences. In July 2004, FATF excluded
Guatemala from its list o fnon-cooperative countries, following an in-situvisit to the Superintendency of Banks. WE
participates in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), o f which it held the vice-presidency in the
period 2005-2006 and the presidency in2006-2007; the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE); the
Organization of American States (OAS); and the Egmont Group o fFinancial Intelligence Units, whichhas requested
to host its next Working Group meeting in Guatemala in March 2009. Currently, N E has signed MOUs on AML
information exchange with 35 countries through the Egmont Group.

7. Risk mapping of financial groups assesses the risk o f capital becoming ineffective due to concentrated lending
above regulatory l i m i t s and the potential effects on the solvency due to the inclusion or withdrawal of related
entities.



                                                            12

securities markets. Progress related to the payments systems continued to take place, including
regulatory changes for reducing operational risks o f the electronic clearing house for checks
(ACH, ttCamarade CompensacibnBancaria") an electronic network for financial transactions-
inajoint effort by Banguatand the Stock Exchange-and         regulations for the automated clearing
house (Cumara de Compensacibn Automatizadu, CCA), to be managed and operated by the
Bank Association and i s expected to follow the international standards for ACH.

28.     Legislationis beingproposedto strengthenthe financialsector further andbroaden
access to credit. Several laws to broaden access to credit have been approved or the bills are
under discussion in Congress. The Secured Transactions L a w was approved in October 2007,
and the Insurance Bill has passed the second o f three discussions in Congress. The financial
authorities are in the process o f revising some articles o f the Banking and Financial
Conglomerates Law that deal with the expansion o f banking activities. The authorities are also
working on a Capital Markets Bill that would strengthen the regulation and supervision o f the
stock exchange, establish licensing standards for the intermediaries, strengthen corporate
governance for licensed companies, andprovide the regulator with broad disciplinarypowers.
29.      The government's commitment to continue its financial sector reform program is
particularlyimportantbecause of the impactthat new externalchallenges may haveon the
financialsector. These challenges, including the ongoing food price crisis, increasing oil costs,
and the reduction inremittances growth as the U.S. economy slows, are producing a decline in
real incomes for the majority of the population. This situation could negatively affect the banks'
portfolios and thus increase the risk to financial sector stability, potentially creating contingent
fiscal liabilities, at a time in which the government is facing unanticipated fiscal pressures
resulting from its response to the external challenges.


C. StrengthenedGovernanceandTransparency


30.      The government's second developmenttheme, governance,focuses on strengthening
institutions and enhancing transparency. The Government is pursuing several related
activities: a) Congressional approval and implementation of a freedom o f information act to
enhance public sector transparency; b) the creation o f a specialized office in the Ministry of
Finance to facilitate access to fiscal information, and guarantee transparent use of public
resources; c) the strengthening o f the regulatory framework to better control and enhance the
transparency o f trust funds; and d) the strengthening o f the Comptroller General office to
facilitate processing o f citizen claims and allegations on misuse of public funds and fraud cases.
For many years governance-related indicators have ranked low in Guatemala Weak rule o f law
and insufficient efforts to combat corruption have been perceived as the most important
challenges for the country, while there is recognition that the Government has advanced in
improving government effectiveness and simplifying regulations to facilitate business work. T h e
present administration has identified this as one o f its top priorities and has from the beginning
announced the implementation o f comprehensive actions to tackle the governance issue in the
country. The Vice-president has convened a participatory commission including specialized
NGOs and donors was convened to provide support in this area and an action plan was put
together identifying specific measures to be implemented in the short term.         As part o f this
agenda, the Ministryo fFinance is leading the efforts to enhance fiscal transparency.




                                                  13

31.     Complementing these efforts are advances on the public financial management
modernization agenda. Guatemala has advanced significantly in the implementation of its
public financial management (PFM) modernization agenda. For the past decade and with direct
support from the Bank and other donors, the Government has successfully developed the
integrated financial management system (SIAF) and procurement system (GUATECOMPRAS)
to regulate and support management o f budget and accounting processes as well as to guarantee
transparency o f public procurement activities. Within this same framework, the government has
also expanded the coverage of both SIAF and GUATECOMPRAS to municipalities and has
developed modern instrumentsto facilitate public sector management roles inlocal governments.

32.     Currently, all central government expendituresare fully controlled by SIAF and it
i s mandatory that all procurement processes for public purchases above Q30,000 (about
$4,050) are published in GUATECOMPRAS. Moreover, nearly all the municipalities have
implemented customized versions o fPFM systems and are hlly integrated to the national budget
process. Both financial and procurement management systems in Guatemala are considered best
practice and are being replicated inother countries inthe region.

33.     On the basis of its successful track record, the Government is now planning
advances in both financial management and procurement by creating more sophisticated
instruments and procedures and by consolidating and institutionalizing progress within
line functions of the Ministry of Finance. Actions planned include: a) full transferring of
systems operation and upgrading responsibilities to line functions inthe Ministry o f Finance for
continuing progress on public financial management after the formal conclusion of the SIAF
project; b) the development and further implementation o f a multi-annual and result-based
budgeting framework on the basis o f the existing SIAF; and c) the development and
implementation o f web-based procurement transactions to increase hrther efficiency and full
transparency o f public procurement operations. The Ministry o f Finance has expanded the e-
procurement System Guutecomprus with a new module (Guutecompras Express), that makes
publicly available detailed information (includingunit prices) on executed Government contracts
(contrutos ubiertos) for large-quantity regularly purchased goods (i.e. vehicles, office supplies,
etc.).


D. SustainableGrowthandProductivity


34.     The government's development theme of productivity focuses on growth by
stimulating domestic and foreign investment, supporting tourism and mediumand small
size enterprises, and enhancing opportunities to export goods and services. To reduce
business costs, reduce customs processing times, and increase compliance with the tax and
customs rules, the government is simplifying rules and enhancing information systems. T h e tax
administration (SAT) is adapting its information systems to support new tax reforms fully. The
information systems and procedures for VAT withholding will be adapted to include importers
and major local distributors. In addition, an internet service portal will b e implemented and
distributed to voluntary taxpayers to improve income tax withholding. Finally, the new
information system will allow for greater control inthe collection o ftaxes. On the organizational
side, SAT will implement a unit for control o f worldwide income, price transfers, and rules for
capitalization, relatively modem concepts intax legislation.




                                                14

35.    The SAT will continue with its plans to promote the use of electronic invoices to
modernize procedures and enhance transparency. It is expected that the use of electronic
invoices will reduce the cost of filing and records maintenance. Inorder to simplify and reduce
the transactions costs for taxpayers, SAT will implement an Integrated Tax Current Account
system for the 300 largest taxpayers after the consolidation into a single data base of their tax
records. For the small and mediumsize enterprises (SMEs), the SAT will implementaninternet-
basedportal to ease tax compliance. As a first step, the SAT will designand begindistribution of
a tax accounting software application 2009, on a pilot basis. Finally, the SAT will implement an
alternative application to BANCASAT for submitting VAT and income tax declarations through
the internet by August 2011. This system will not require a contract for use as does
BANCASAT, a proprietaryproduct ofthe bankingsystem.

36.     The new administration is prioritizing actions to reduce customs processing time
and speed trade. On customs modernization by August 2010, the SAT will implement its
Customs Management System(SAQB'E) on cargo management and on the release and clearance
o f importedexported goods and merchandise intransit, inat least six major customs entrypoints.
In addition, by August 2011, SAT will have expanded its Customs Management System
(SAQB'E) on cargo management and on the release and clearance of imported/exported goods
and merchandise intransit, in at least 10 of the major customs. As a means to harmonize the
national customs legal framework with international and regional norms, the government has
proposed legal refoms to complement the international customs framework, including the
CddigoAduanero Uniforme Centroamericano (CAUCA) and its rules (RECAUCA) as well as
measuresto strengthen enforcement.


                                 IV.THE PROPOSEDLOAN


A.      Link to the CountryPartnershipStrategy and LoanDesign

37.     The proposedDPL series comprises three operations intendedto support the fiscal
and institutional development policy aspects of the Guatemala Country Partnership
Strategy FYO9-12), which was presented to the World Bank Executive Board for discussion on
September 23, 2008. The Guatemala CPS i s aligned with the government's development plan
and supports the government's commitment to make growth more inclusive and to address the
country's high levels o f poverty and inequality. It proposes a total lending envelope o f $970
million over the fiscal years 2009-2011, of which $470 million would be investment lending and
a CAT DDO operation to manage the risk o f natural disasters. The remaining $500 million
would be inthe form of budget support through a three part programmatic DPL series o f which
DPL Iis the first operation ($200 million in FY09, $200 million in FY10, and $100 million in
FY11). The CPS also provides for reimbursable technical assistance, including support for
design of the CCT program, and the possibility of coordinated IBRD and IFC operations in
energyand tourism and ruraldevelopment.

38.     The design of the DPL series is closely aligned with the Government's own
priorities, its detailed sectoral plans and draws on the Bank's analyses o f key issues and
desirable policy directions through the country and regional analytical work, including: the
Guatemala Poverty Assessment, CEM, Central America and Guatemala ICAs, DR-CAFTA

study, PER, FSAP, CFAA and CPAR.                 Within this framework, it focuses on policy and
institutional aspects related to inclusive growth and poverty reduction that are most amenable to
support via a program o f single-tranche loans. The DPL series i s also designed to complement,
from a policy and institutional standpoint, the investment lending program within the CPS. This
includes ongoing investment lending for the SIAF and Financial Sector projects, as well as n e w
operations supporting Expanding Opportunities for the Poor and Enhancing Productivity. Table
3 below outlines the CPS program objectives and selected areas of action. Bolded items in this
table are areas supported under the DPL programmatic series. Also, Table 4 outlines the DPL
program outcomes and illustrates the close congruence between program outcomes andkey CPS
outcomes. The Government's policy actions to be supported by the programmatic series are
outlined inthe policy matrix inAnnex 1.

 39.      The focus of this first loan of the DPL series is on the strategy and design of policies
 and legislative reforms to be undertaken during the new Colom Administration. The
 emphasis on promoting fiscal space for priority spending, governance and transparency of public
 expenditures, improved execution targeting o f social spending and sustainable gowth and
 productivity recognizes three critical and interrelated development challenges inGuatemala.
         First, the need for increased targeted social spending and investment to improve
         growth and reduce poverty and inequality. As mentioned earlier, analytical work
         suggests that while economic growth i s critical, focusing on this solely i s unlikely to be
         sufficient to achieve the country's medium-term poverty reduction targets.
         Second, the importance of fiscal transparency and greater fiscal space to fund
         increased targeted social expenditures. Government revenues are modest compared to
         other similar income countries and in order to maintain Guatemala's solid fiscal stance
         and expand social programs, further deepeningo f fiscal reforms is key. Nonetheless, the
         tax reform agenda is politically controversial and subject to the decisions of the
         Constitutional Court (CC).            The Government's consultative approach to reform
         implementation and the facilitation o f dialogue on fiscal actions among country
         stakeholders should help to inform the population on the economic trade-offs. In doing
         so, it i s attempting to build a focus on social needs, their costs and the revenue
         requirements o f meeting them, while also pursuing complementary fiscal actions, mainly
         to enhance control and transparency inthe use o fpublic finances.
         And third, the criticality of governance, transparency, and monitoring and
         evaluation of social spending to generate confidence and political support for
         reforms and help to ensure that increased spending is executed efficiently. While
        many stakeholders in Guatemala recognize that there is a need to expand social spending



                                                         18

         and investment, there are relevant concerns that such spending be efficient and w e l l
         monitored. The Bank has been working with the government and other institutions,
         including the Instituto Centroamericano de Estudios Fiscales (ICEFI, a local think-tank
         specialized on fiscal policy issues), to help provide information for an informed debate on
         fiscal policy challenges inGuatemala.


 40.     The DPL series is underpinned by the substantial body of analytical work carried
 out by the Bank in partnership with the Government of Guatemala (See Box 5), the design
 o f key prior actions, triggers and indicators for DPL Isupports progress in each o f the above
 three main areas. The primary analytical underpinnings, policy objectives, and development
 constraints indentified are highly relevant to the country and have informed the design o f the
 DPLprogrammatic work.

B.      Lessons Learned From the Prior Broad-Based Growth DPL Series

41.     The Guatemala CAS (FYO5-08) Completion Report (NO9) concluded that "The
move towards programmatic DPL lending proved successful." While results insome areas o f
DPL support were less than expected, particularly in the area of fiscal reform and increased
social spending, the report found that the implementation o f the programmatic lending series
(three DPL operations) contributed towards many CAS outcomes. First, these operations helped
maintain continuous country dialogue and provided technical support around key priorities.
Second, as part of DPL activities, the Bank informed the international community on progress on
stabilizing the economy and Peace Accords goals that remain areas of international interest.
Lastly, the DPL served as a conduit for two-way communication between the government and
international community on the country's development strategy andprogress on policy reforms.

42.     It was also concluded that, if amenable to the Government, the DPL structure
should be continued. The report recommended that the positive DPL experience indicated
retaining this instrument with a manageable agenda to avoid program overload. The focus on key
priorities should be kept infurther operations and be complementedby support to improve public
project evaluation in line with ongoing efforts to introduce results-based budgeting. The
importance o f coordinating DPL budget support operations with the presentation o f the national
budgetto Congress was also noted as important for enhancing internal dialog o n Bank supported
government policies.

43.     These lessons have shaped the design of Fiscal and Institutional DPL series. First,
program components have been kept to a manageable number and have focused on government
priorities, including results-based budgeting. Second, the DPL i s supporting government actions
in developing a broad consensus on critical reform areas, particularly in the highly contentious
area o f fiscal reform.      Finally, the DPL series will continue to be coordinated with the




                                                       20

Government's budget submissionto Congress, and, as such, supportedpolicies will be discussed
openly to increase legislative engagement.

C. Fiduciary Aspects

44.    The 2007 Update of the Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFMCPAR) indicates
that the fiduciary environment in Guatemala is                    adequate, as evidenced by the
improvements in the public expenditure management systems made over the previous
decade and the actions being taken by the government to continue to increase
transparency. While challenges remain, the current administration is moving ahead to
strengthen its public fiduciary control framework further and has shown strong commitment to
tackling fiduciary issues in many key areas identified by the Country Fiduciary Assessment.
Drawing from this ongoing effort, certain key actions and selective milestones inthe context of
the DPL program have been identified to help track the public financial management reform
progress. The latter, in turn, are largely supported by the Bank-financed Third Integrated
Financial Management Additional Financial Project under implementation. The foreign
exchange control environment o f the Central Bank i s adequate and, subsequent to the IMF
Assessment Report (2002), external auditing is now in place and international foreign currency
reserves are managedaccording to prudent international practice.

D.     LoanAdministration

45.    The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account o f the central bank
(BANGUAT) denominated in U S dollars.' BANGUAT will immediately credit the disbursed
amounts to the Ministry of Finance Treasury Single Account ("common fund"), thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of this funds transfer, the Ministry
will accordingly provide theBankwith a written confirmation.


E.     Monitoring and EvaluationArrangements
46.    The Ministry of Finance will play the primary role in coordinating monitoring and
evaluation of program implementation. The government and the Bank will take advantage o f
several important data sources to assess progresso fthe DPL, including:


    0  Central andnonfinancial public sectorbudgetmonitoring from the Ministry ofFinance

    0  NationalInstitutefor Statistics reports and annual tracking surveys

8. In the context of the latest IMF central bank safeguards assessment, an action plan has been agreed with
BANGUAT. Moreover, BANGUAT is a participant in the Bank's Reserves Advisory and Management Program
(RAMP).

Box 6. Good Practice Principleson Conditionality
Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

The operation was developed within the objectives o f the 1996PeaceAccords andthe Colom's development plan,
which establishes clear priorities developed through wide consultation with stakeholders and broader civil society.
The priority legislative agenda is developed in consultation with the Congressional leadership on an ongoing
basis. Bank support focuses on promoting enhanced capacity and fiscal space for increased public spending in
priority sectors, improving public governance, transparency and expenditure management, and promoting
sustainable growth and productivity. These focus areas have all benefited frombroad political support. The DPL
series is strongly underpinned by prior analytical and fiduciary work, including the Poverty Assessment (2008),
Investment Climate Assessment (2008), Country Economic Memorandum (2005), Public Expenditure Review
Update (2007), the regional DR-CAFTA study (2005), CFAAKPAR Update (2007) and Financial Sector
Assessment ProgramUpdate (2007).

Principle 2: Agree upfront with thegovernment and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The Bank's support i s summarized ina brief and focused policy matrix. Currently, only the Bank, and the IDB
are providing budget support to Guatemala. These institutions draw on the country's development plan, thereby
ensuring coordination among them and consistency of support. They have also supported enhanced public
financial management, progress insocial sector expenditures, and improved competitiveness.

Principle3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

Inaddition to supporting the government's development of its integrated financial management system(SIAF)
and e-procurement system, the Bank i s also providing support for capacity building activities to evaluate
government information, increase transparency, and build public sector accountability.       The Bank has been
working closely with the government and donor groups (e.g., Grupo de Dialogo (G-13), which includes the main
bilateral donors as well as the WB, IDB, UN, IMF and European Union) on enhancing governance, as well as
supportkg various dialogues on social auditing with a range o f civil society organizations. Guatemala was
selected as a C-GAC (Country-Governance and Anti-Corruption) pilot country, and the Bank is providing full
support to this agenda.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set ofprior actions (6). They addresskey development policies including
actions inpromoting fiscal and institutional development to enhance growth and reduce poverty and inequality.

Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive topredictable andperformance-based financial
support
As agreed with the government, this programmatic DPL series consists o f three single-tranche operations, timed
to the country's budget cycle, with each operation evaluated and monitored for results.          Monitoring and
evaluation of the program will take place within the government's own processes. Subject to satisfactory overall
program implementation, this process allows for a predictable release o f the tranche during each fiscal year,
allowing incorporation o f financing into the subsequent year's budget. The policy matrix contains a range of
outcome indicators (9),which are assessed as part o f the operation implementation and are closely linked to the
supportedpolicy actions.

F.       Consultation, Distributionaland EnvironmentalAspects
47.      The DPL series has been developed within the framework of the country's
development plan and the CPS, which was widely consulted and disseminated within the
country. Specific laws, institutional reforms and programmatic actions supported by the loan
series were also discussed widely with different groups, including civil society organizations, the
private sector and the research and academic community. In particular, the government has
consulted intensively with country stakeholders, including members of Congress, on fiscal
reformproposals-including        participation inlocalpublic fora.'

48.      The Bank is also providing ongoing support for civil society activities to help build
capacity to evaluate government information, increase transparency, and build public
sector accountability. The Bank has been working closely with the government and donor
groups (e.g., Grupo de Dialogo (G-13), which includes the mainbilateral donors as well as the
WB, IDB, UN and European Union) on enhancing governance, as well as supporting various
dialogues on social auditing with a range o f civil society organizations including: Coalicion por
la Transparencia (a group of CSOs engaged in social auditing in Guatemala including Accion
Ciudadana (the national chapter o f Transparency International), CIEN (a domestic think tank),
and the Guatemala Chamber o f Commerce. Guatemala was selected as a C-GAC (Country-
Governance and Anti-Corruption) pilot country, and the Bank i s providing full support to this
agenda. In addition, the World Bank Institute (WBI) is supporting a regional initiative to
strengthen social auditing in Central America, which is being supported by the DPL team as
complement to other consultation activities. This initiative intends not just to share the
experiences, but to build a regional network formed by national civil society groups involved
with public expenditure monitoring as a way to strengthen the groups' work in their respective
countries.      The WBI i s also supporting training and hands-on technical assistance on
implementation o fperformance-based budgetingand medium-termexpenditure framework at the
national and municipal levels. The Bank and IDB are coordinating support for monitoring and
evaluation of the Mi Familia Progresa CCT program, as well as tax administration support. The
Bankis also is continuingto work closely withthe IMFonmacroeconomic monitoring, financial
sector stability issues, andtax administration reforms.

49.      The actions supported by this DPL are not expected to have significant adverse
distributionalimpact. To the extent that the measures supportedby the DPL series will play a
role in Government's ability to enhance social spending levels, their impact on income
distribution, particularly for the indigenous and rural poor, is expected to be positive. This i s
confirmed by public expenditure incidence analysis undertaken in the context o f the Poverty
Assessment which indicates that public social expenditures (Peace Accords definition) are
generally pro-poor. Likewise, the distributive impact of fiscal reforms supported by the DPL
series is expectedto be mildlyprogressive.

50.      The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to entail
likely significant impacts on the environment, forests or other naturalresources. However,
to the extent that measures supportedby the DPL program are successful, over time, inattracting

American Institute o f Fiscal Studies) on the fiscal challenges o f Guatemala and experiences of neighboring
countries.

new investment (including in infrastructure), there will be a need to strengthen Guatemala's
national institutional capacity to identify and address environmental policy and regulatory issues.
With this inmind, a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) was undertaken in2005-2006(Box
7) and discussed with the Government. The CEA provides cost effective recommendations for
closing gaps in institutional capacity for environmental regulation. A s a first step, the CEA
conclusions and recommendations helped to prepare the ground to obtain approval o f the
National Environmental Policy (Politica de Conservacion, Proteccion y Mejoramiento del
Ambiente y 10s Recursos Naturales).                  The government is continuing to update its National
Environmental Policy and expects to undertake a Strategic Environmental Analysis with Bank
support.


Box 7. Guatemala CountryEnvironmentalAnalysis-Findings and New Developments
Guatemala has made important efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability o f the country's development program
through the systematic attention to environmental issues. This approach was strengthened under the recent Central
American Presidents' Summit on climate change (May 2008), which set principles for the sustainable development
agenda in the region. Despite some institutional and legal improvements, Guatemala still faces considerable
environmental challenges, including: (a) over-exploitation o f water resources; (b) water pollution; (c) deforestation; (d)
soil and land degradation; and (e) vulnerability to natural disasters. Giventhe new opportunities facing the country with
the signing o f DR-CAFTA and the proposed scaling-up o f infrastructure investments, there is a need to accelerate the
consolidation o f institutional and organizational tasks in Guatemala. Under the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources' (MARN) leadership, the new administration is focusing its environmental agenda in four areas: (a)
ecological debt, (b) environmental justice, (c) natural freedom, and (d) bioethics.

The CEA report concluded that if MARN concentrates on its core functions, such as the planning and application of
environmental policy and enforcement o f environmental regulation, while workmg in coordination with other
environmental agencies, ministries, and municipalities, most o f these challenges can be met in a short period of time
with minor adjustments to the existing framework o f environmental management. Three important issues that need to
be addressedare: (a) the establishment o fa cohesive andcoordinatedenvironmental framework, (b) animprovement in
the effectiveness and efficiency o f the Environmental Impact Assessment system (EIA), while introducing the use o f
other tools (Le. Strategic Environmental Analysis); and finally (c) promotion o f compliance with environmental law.

Since the broad dissemination o f the CEA, positive developments have occurred in the previous and current
administration, including: (a) the approval o f the National Environmental Policy by the cabinet and the President (that
i s currently in implementationand subject to expand its scope); (b) the initial supplementary allocation of Q5 million to
MARN in the previous administration and the pledge o f additional QlO million for 2009; (c) the expansion and
consolidation of initiatives, such as environmental laboratories with two mobile units (the use of these vehicles can be
expanded, with a possible fiuther expansion to the rest of the Central American region); (d) establishment of a donor
roundtable on environmental issues led by MARN, which is seeking to prioritize and harmonize environmental
initiatives, guided in part by the priorities established in the CEA; and (e) the establishment of an environmental and
social cabinet with the participation o f the civil society, and the private andpublic sectors. At the institutional level, the
GoG is evaluating the possibility o f consolidating the Meteorology Institute (INSIVUMEH) and the National
Geographic Institute (IGN) with MARN.


The CEA report also emphasizes the need to provide a more flexible and efficient regulation, that will nevertheless
provide strong incentives for polluters to change their behavior (the GoG is focusing its efforts on working with private
sector-managed mining companies (gold, coal) and hydroelectric plants). Market-based instruments, such as pollution
taxeslcharges, could be introduced in a gradual manner, pending the implementation of a reasonable and acceptable
monitoring and enforcement mechanism. The right incentives would also include engaging civil society by improving
information andpublic participation mechanisms. Inthe long term, deeper reforms to the legal framework for water and
transparency are needed, but require longer periods o f maturation, consensus building, negotiations, and ultimately,
congressional approval.

G.      Risks


51.     Sustainability of the program is         subject to three main risks during the
implementation of the DPL series: (i)        political risks, given the polarized electorate, (ii)
exogenous shocks related to natural disasters, and (iii) macroeconomic risks due to the U.S. and
global deceleration, rising energy and food prices, a slowdown in foreign investment and wage
remittances growth. These are described below.

52.     Political risk i s inherent in Guatemala, where there continues to be deep fissures
within society, the electorate is polarized, and the Government lacks a simple majority in
Congress. While UNE won the largest number o f congressional seats (51 out of 158), the lack
of a simple majority makes passage o f deep reforms challenging. This poses a risk for the DPL
program implementation. The new administration's focus on social cohesion and building
strategic alliances is especially pertinent in this context as developing a broad consensus is
important for the successful implementation of an ambitions developmentplan.

53.     Especially controversial is the tax reform agenda, particularly the new income tax
proposal which is highly contested and subject to the decisions of the Constitutional Court
(CC). The Government's consultative approachto reformimplementation and the facilitation o f
dialogue on fiscal actions among country stakeholders should help to mitigate this risk. It is also
attempting to address the issue through shifting the focus o f the public dialogue to social needs,
their costs and the revenue requirements of meeting them, while also pursuing complimentary
fiscal actions, mainly to enhance control andtransparency inthe use ofpublic finances. Political
as well as social tensions also arise in other controversial areas includingregional integration,
promotion of increased private participation in infrastructure, and rural development, all o f
which are crucial to accelerating growth, reducing poverty, and are part o f the Government's
agenda. The Bank is engaged in promoting dialogue with all relevant stakeholders o n the
development challenges o f the country, including the taxation issue, as a means to facilitate an
informed debate on Guatemala's development needs. Moreover, the DPL Ii s beingprepared for
the Government's September 2008 budget submission to Congress, and, as such, supported
policies will bediscussed openly to increase legislative engagement.

54.     Besides political risks, Guatemala is also susceptible to external risks deriving from
natural disasters. As with the other Central American countries, Guatemalais highlyvulnerable
to multiple natural disaster risks-floods,  hurricanes and earthquakes-that     pose a significant
direct threat to economic growth and poverty reduction, as well as indirect threat by
unanticipated spending for emergency assistance and reconstruction, thereby affecting
achievement o f established development goals inthe short term. Experiencewith Tropical Storm
Stan shows, however, that fiscal discipline has been a high priority for the country even in the
face o f an emergency. Providing additional support to Government measures, the Bank i s
supporting efforts to update and validate the National Program for Disaster Mitigation and
Response. A plannedCatastrophic Risk DifferedDraw-Down operation (CAT-DDO, FY09) will
also provide contingent financing, accompanied by implementation of comprehensive disaster
risk reduction measures. A non-lending technical assistance program, the Development o f
Scientific Information to Promote the Municipal Planningto ReduceDisaster Risks inFY08, has
been continued through the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery grants.



                                                25

55.    The main macro-economic risks derive from the U.S. and global deceleration, rising
energy and food prices, a slowdown in foreign investment and lower remittance growth.
Rising food and oil prices have had a significant impact on the poor (as the household budget
share dedicated food and transportation i s relatively high). Higher prices, combined with the
slowing in growth o f wage remittances due to the U.S. economic slowdown, have deepened the
adverse economic situation for the poor. The government has shown strong commitment to
mitigate these risks though the implementation o f the conditional cash transfers program and a
rural development agenda to improve income prospects for the poorest. These risks should also
be mitigated by the Bank's ongoing macro-monitoring and country dialogue to adjust the
program if critical issues emerge. Bank supported programs, including the country's CCT
program and analytical work on developing sustainable energy market are specifically designed
to manage and respond to these economic vulnerabilities.

56.     Guatemala's public debt ratio of GDP remains one o f the lowest in Latin America and
among countries with similar income levels, reflecting a historical tradition o f conservative debt
management. Nonetheless, a mid-tern debt sustainability analysis becomes relevant within the
preparation o f the First Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loan as
Guatemala expects to increase its IF1borrowing..                                      The debt sustainability analysis was prepared
under the keymacroeconomic assumptionspresented inTable A2.1 and estimated disbursement o f
US$575millionwithin the US$960 millionCPS FY09-12" envelope as well as budget support for
US$ 600 million estimated to beprovidedbyIDB for the same time period.

57.      Under relatively conservative macroeconomic assumptions, the results of the debt
analysis show that all external vulnerability indicators would remain within prudent ratios.
Public external debt stabilizes at 17.7% o f GDP in201211,while total debt service as percentage of
exports of GNFS decreases from 7.6 percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent in 2012.                                              Furthermore, as
expected within the new CPS FY09-12, borrowing from the Bank as a share of total debt
outstanding (TDO) increases from 13.4percent in 2008 to 13.7 percent in 2012, although I B R D ' s
debt service as percentage of exports o f GNFS remains at 1.5 percent on average during 2008-
2012. The share o f JBRDportfolio inGuatemala increases from 0.9 percent in2008 to 1.3percent

   IBox A2.1 The IMF andDebt SustainabilityinGuatemala
    In its latest Article IV consultation report of June 4, 2008, the IMF finds that Guatemala's external and
    public debt outlook i s sustainable, even under alternative negative shock scenarios for the underlying
    macroeconomic variables. The baseline scenario estimates that total public debt would decrease to 21.5
    percent of GDP by 2012 from 22.3 percent in 2007, well within the country's capacity to service its debt.
    While total public debt is expected to decrease slightly, Guatemala's total external debt i s projected to
    slightly increase, from 25.2 to 30.3 percent o f GDP over the same period, but remains relatively modest and
    serviceable. Finally, public external debt is projected to fall from 13.0 percent of GDP in 2007 to 11.4
    percent in2012, consistent the government's objectives.

    A scenario with key variables at their historical averages (real GDP growth, real interest rate andprimary

Ms.PamelaCox
Vice Presidentfor the LatinAmerica
andCaribbeanRegion
WorldBank
Washington, D.C.
UnitedStatesofAmerica



Dear Ms.Cox:

The Government o f Guatemala, headed by Mr. Alvaro Colom Caballeros, has established, as one
o f its key goals, the promotion o f sustainable and equitable economic development that meets the
needs o f the entire population, in particular persons living in extreme poverty. In that regard, the
commitment of the current administration focuses on moving forward with achievement o f the
Peace Agreements andthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

To that end, the Government is implementing a plan based on the following four strategic
programs: (i)solidarity; (ii)  governance; (iii)productivity; and (iv) regional issues. To meet these
challenges, and in the context o f fiscal sustainability, the current administration i s committed to
working simultaneously on two fronts: (a) boosting the tax yield; and (b) achieving efficiency in
public expenditure execution.

In addition, the Government is committed to strengthening budgetaryprocesses with a View to
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness o f public institutions, so that they can meet current and
future demand for the services they provide in such a way as to cover care to the most vulnerable
(social budget protection), while increasing investment by targeting priority projects and programs,
with the aim of enhancing efficiency and the impact o fthese projects andprograms on care currently
provided, andworking towardtheir scaling up.

The assistance strategy agreed upon between the Government o f the Republic of Guatemala and the
World Bank includes, among other things, support for implementation o f the Government's plan by
granting three Fiscal Policy and Institutional Development Programmatic Loans for the 2009-201 1
period, the first o f which is expected to be disbursed in 2009 and will be aimed at supporting the
Government o f Guatemala's efforts to implement and institutionalize policies that facilitate higher
growth, improved governance, poverty reduction, deepening o f financial markets, and enhanced
efficiency inpublic expenditureas well as transparency inpublic sectormanagement.




                                                  41

I. PromotingMacroeconomic Stability and Expanding the Fiscal Space for Priority
Programs

In2007, Guatemalan economic activity was impactedby the sharp increase in global prices of oil,
corn, and wheat, which are used inbiofuel production. In addition, the problems plaguing the U.S.
economy, spawned by difficulties in the housing market, fanned expectations of a slowdown and
even recession inthe UnitedStates, Guatemala's maintrading partner.

The difficult international context notwithstanding, the Guatemalan economy grew inrealterms by
5.7 percent, maintaining the trend seen in recent years. This growth was fueled, respectively, by
robust exports and private consumption tied to higher prices for the main traditional exports and
the income generated by family remittances.

The overall consumer price index rose by 8.75 percent, exceeding the rate set by the monetary
authorities for 2007. Despite the uptick ininflation, the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies
made it possible to maintain the elements underpinning sound management of aggregate demand,
thereby preservingthe economic stability enjoyedby Guatemala inrecent years.

One key objective o f the Government's current program has been adherence to a disciplined and
orderly approach to public finance which, while contributing to development and poverty reduction
inthe country, staves offthreats to macroeconomic stability linkedto high and unsustainable fiscal
deficits. As a result o f the prudent management o f fiscal policy and the application o f sound
monetary policy, the fiscal deficit stood at 1.5 percent in 2007. Net tax revenue stood at 431,543.3
millionin2007, exceeding the 2006 figure by Q4,305.2 million (15.8 percent), while actualcollection
exceededthe annual target by42,342.7 million(8 percent).

Inits bidto continue boosting tax collection, the Government submitted to the Congress of the
Republic draft provisions entitled "Supplementary Provisions for the Modernization of the
Customs and Indirect Taxation System," with a view to reinstatingthe principles and commitments
o f the Fiscal Agreement, in order to pave the way for achievement o f the Peace Accords and
Millennium Development Goals.

The draft provisions include, in one legislative document, the following tax regulations: Title I,
which establishes a specific tax on the initial registration o f automobiles; Title 11, which establishes
provisions applicable to the national customs system; Title 111, which amends Decree 27-92 of the
Congress o f the Republic - Law on Value Added Taxes; Title IVYwhich amends Decree20-2006 o f
the Congress o f the Republic - Legal Provisions for Strengthening the Tax Administration; Title V,
which amends the Law on Taxation o f the Movement o f Land, Maritime, and Aerial Vehicles -
Decree 70-94 o f the Congress o f the Republic; Title VI, which contains amendments to the Tax Code
-Decree6-81 oftheCongressoftheRepublic; andTitleVIl, whichsets forththe final, transitory,
andrepeal provisions, as well as thosepertainingto entry into force.

In addition, in order to finance the economic and social programs necessary for the country's
development, the Ministry o f Public Finance also submitted legislative provisions to the Congress o f
the Republic for the imposition o f the "solidarity tax," to remain in effect untilpassageby Congress
o f the draft income tax law, includedinthe second phase of this Government's fiscal modernization
process.




                                                   42

Inthe financial sphere and inline with the financial reforms beingpromoted, the Office of the
Superintendent of Banks has, within its organizational structure, an office responsible for the
supervision of financial groups.   This office is composed o f three departments that have the
technical expertise suited to the profiles of the member entities o f these groups, as well as a
department responsible for the global assessment o f the banking system.

The supervision fbnctions assigned to the Office o f the Superintendent o f Banks for 2008 include
assessment of the banking system's main debtors, with a view to determining the level of credit
risk assumed by the creditor entities supervised and whether this risk i s properly measured [and]
managed.

Furthermore, the four main bankso f the system are implementing a new supervisionsystem this year,
outlined inthe Risk-based Supervision Manual, which is expected to be completed inFebruary 2009.
Inthis regard,two ofthe risk assessmentprofilescontained inthis manualhave alreadybeenapplied,
andwork onfive otherprofiles is currentlyunderway. They willbe appliedbetween September 2008
andFebruary2009.

Intheareaofprudentialregulationsapplicabletooffshore entities, theOfficeofthe Superintendent of
Banks has implemented the regulations pertaining to credit limits and capital adequacy, as well as
provisions on the periodic reporting o f financial information, which can be used to manage credit
risk. These regulations are set forth in Decisions Nos. JM-191-2007 and JM-200-2007 o f the
Monetary Board, andinAgreement 14-2007 ofthe Office o f the Superintendent of Banks.



11. GovernanceandTransparency

The Government of Guatemala has continued to implement measures aimed at improving
efficiency and transparency in the use o f public funds, primarily in the area o f accountability, in
order to help strengthen social auditing.   Among the main actions initiated is, in particular, the
establishment of the Vice-Ministry for Fiscal Transparency and Assessment [Viceministerio de
Transparencia Fiscal y Evaluacidn VMTFE] in the Ministry of Public Finance, through
Government Agreement No.98-2008. The primary function o f this vice-ministry will b e to
guarantee free access by citizens to fiscal and financial information, and promote reforms and
innovations in public finance laws and regulations, which will contribute to transparency and
anticomption efforts.

To this end, an actionplanhas beendeveloped for the new vice-ministry to be implementedimmediately
(August 2008 to February 2009). The central themes of this plan are: (a) public access to information;
(b) aregulatory framework for transparency; and(c) traininginfiscal andbudgettransparency.

This vice-ministry will provide support to improve the electronic and technological resources to
grant single-window access to information. It will also assess public expenditure and fiscal policy
execution, andwill promote transparency inpublicmanagement, procurement, andcontracting.

Inthe area of government procurement, the Government is continuing to make significant strides
using the GUATECOMPRAS system, creating GUATECOMPRAS EXPRESS, a new window

processes. In addition to promoting transparency, this system focuses on ensuring more rapid and
efficient procurement, with particular emphasis on open contracts. This system i s utilized for all
procurement inexcess o f Q30,000.00 entailing the use o fpublic resources.

Transparency, efficiency, the promotion o f small andmedium-sized enterprises, andthe strengthening
of e-government and e-trade processesare the mainbenefits o fthis newplatform.

In addition to generating greater competition among bidders, which results in better prices and
higherquality products, the aforementioned platform has helped to enhance transparency inpublic
procurement and contracting management, and to increase the number o fparticipants.

Lastly, under the draft law submitted to the Congress o f the Republic, which approves the State
income and expenditure budget for 2009, the Ministry o f Public Finance has introduced specific
regulations for more effective and transparent budget execution. The obligation to register projects
executed under agreements has been bolstered, and executing agencies for trust funds are still
required to register contracts that they conclude, in addition to the requisite reports that must be
submitted to the General Accounting Office.


111. ExpandingOpportunitiesto VulnerableGroups

In order to implement the aforementioned solidarity program, the Government established a
coordination mechanism known as the Social Cohesion Council, which was designed to achieve
the following specific objectives: (i)increase the impact o f social investment; (ii)    establish a
management process for the State budget and the participating programs, with emphasis on results-
based management; (iii)    establish priorities from a geographical (municipalities with the highest
levels of extreme poverty) and programmatic (programs that are more cost-effective) standpoint;
(iv) oversee the Government's social investments ina transparent manner; (v) design programs and
innovative tools for social management; (vi) establish specialization mechanisms for social funds;
and (vii) achieve the Millennium Development Goals (maternal and infant mortality, poverty,
extreme poverty, and illiteracy).

Inorder to achieve the aforementioned objectives, the Government is implementinga Conditional
Cash Transfer Program (CCTP) called "Mi Familia Prugresa" [My family progresses -
MIFAPRO],which is the result, on one hand, of the urgent need to improve the education, health,
and nutrition indicators for Guatemalan children, and the favorable assessments that several
CCTPs in Latin America have received with respect to their ability to improve said indicators, on
the other. The highlevel o fpriority accorded to the CCTPhas prompted a clarion call for actionby
the ministries and participating entities, and a request to step up the pace of its implementation.
This Program will be comprehensive in nature and will be executed in municipalities and towns
with high levels of poverty and vulnerability, with the poverty map being used to identify these
areas. The first phase of the program targets up to 45 priority municipalities, and i s expected to
cover a total of 125 of the 333 municipalities in the country, with a view to improving and
expanding education, health, andnutrition services.

Based on the foregoing, and on an experimental basis, the Government began implementing a
Comprehensive Integrated Beneficiary Selection System [Sisternu Integrado de Seleccibn de
BeneJiciarios] and the accompanying Beneficiary Selection Index to identify families living in
abject poverty in the municipalities deemed priorities by the Government for the period 2008-
2012.



                                                   44

The system includes the identification of eligible families, which are those with girls or boys
between the ages of 0 and 15, or with pregnant or breastfeeding mothers. It also uses a Proxy
Means Test to identify households living in extreme poverty, which i s based on the consumption
aggregate of families surveyed during the 2006 ENCOVI. These variables can b e classified into
household and head o f household characteristics under four specific categories: (i)    access to basic
services and housing conditions; (ii)    ownership o f property; (iii) capital of the household
                                                                        human
head; and (iv) the demographic characteristics o f the household identified.

Means tests, which are usedto identify families, are conducted to ensure that most of the resources
reach the extreme poor (coverage of the target population). The portions o f the resources that do
not reach the extreme poor are referred to as program "leakages" (inclusion or exclusion errors). In
other words, the means tests are used to reduce resource "leakages" and maximize coverage of the
target population.




IV. SustainableGrowth and Productivity

The Government of Guatemala is confident that the opening up o f more and better markets will
yield benefits only ifthe country continues to improve the investment andbusiness climate, and is
equipped with adequate infrastructure to achieve this objective.

One key objective of the Government's program is adherence to a disciplined and orderly approach
to public finance which, while contributing to development and poverty reduction in the country,
staves o f f threats to macroeconomic stability linked to high and unsustainable fiscal deficits. T o
this end, the Government has endeavored to generate additional fiscal resources to finance a
significant increase inpublic investments, and inparticular, social expenditure.

Inkeepingwith the measures adopted, andwith a view to generatingmoreresources, the Office of
the Superintendent o f Tax Administration [Superintendencia de Administracidn Tributaria SAT]
recently developed a software package for income tax withholding, which facilitates compliance
with the relevanttax obligations.

This software entails the use of an electronic form to fill inthe data on the sworn income tax statement,
which salaried employees must submit to their employer. This allows businessesto generateanautomatic
and electronic Annual Sworn Statement of Reconciliation of Deductions made for Salaried Employees
[Declaracidn Jurada Anual de Conciliacidn de Retenciones a Empleados en relaciBn de Dependencia]
(SAT-107 Form) andthe Annual ReconciliationofDeductionsmade for SalariedEmployees [Conciliacibn
Anual deRetencionesPracticadasa Empleados en Relacidn de Dependencia] (SAT-108Form). U s e of
this software also provides documentaryproof ofincome tax deductions madeby businesses for salaried
employeesandother taxpayers domiciled inthe country (Form SAT-106), andbased onthe relevantdata,
generates areportthat facilitates completion ofthe Sworn Statement andReceipt o fMonthlyPayments of
IncomeTax Deductions [DeclaracidnJurada y Recibo de Pago Mensual de RetenciBn del ISR] (SAT-
105 Form).




                                                   45

It bears notingthat one of the advantages o f this application software is that taxpayers can either use
the BancaSAT system to electronically submit the aforementioned forms, or print them to submit
hardcopies to the SAT offices andagencies.



111. Conclusion

As can be noted, the Government of Guatemala is firmly committed to promoting and implementing
actions required to achieve greater sustained economic development and increased productive
investment, with priority being accorded to health, education, and social coverage, and to enhancing
transparency and efficiency inpublic expenditure management, with a view to boosting the country's
economic development andimprovingthe standardofthe living o fthe Guatemalan people, particularly
the most vulnerable groups.

It is against this backdrop that financial support fiom the World Bank through the First Fiscal
Policy and Institutional Development Programmatic Loan amounting to US$200 million has
become particularly important, and is in keeping with the financing strategy of the country's
general budget.

We thank the World Bank for its continued support.

On May 19, 2005, the Exeaibve Board of the Intematronal Monetary Fund (IMF) cancluded the A h d e I V
consultation wth Guatemala.A
Background
Macroeconomicdevelopments have been broadly pwtive since the last Arhck N consultation, anchored
by prudent macroeconomic polrcies. Despite tensions inthe financial sector in late 2006 and early 2007,
macroeconomicstabiltty has been maintained, and growth has risen substantialfy abovehistorical
averages, to 5.2 percent in 1006and 5.7 percent in 1007. Despite the rising oil import bill, the current
account remafnedat 5 percent of GDP, thanks to continuedgrowth of exports and remittances. The
overall surplus of the balanceof payments has permitted the accumulation of tnternational reserves,
which remain equivalent to about 4 months of importsand 100percent of publrc external debt. Inflation
mse to 8% percent in 2007, due to both bargeexternat price shocks (oil and food) and domestic demand
pressures.
The fiscal position remains solid, with the central government deficit contained and the public debt,
estimated at about 22 percent of GDP in 2007, among the lowest in the region. The central government
deficit declinedonly slrghtiy to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2007 despite a substantial imease in revenues,
mainly due to spending on infrastructure in excessof approved budget cerlings. To avoidthe
reoccurrenceof these overruns, measures have been taken to improve the control of budget execubon.
Revenueperformance has been strong, especially as a result of tax administration reforms introduced
in 2006, yielding a b u t 0.7 percentof GDP in additionalrevenues in 2007.
Higheroil and food prices, explaining about 3 percentage porntsof headline inflatronin 2007, contributed
to the rise of inflation abovethe central bank objective in 2007. However, domesticdemand pressures,
includingdue to high credit growth, still pewst. An early response OF monetarypoiicy to containthem
was constrained by tensions in the banking sector in late 2006 and early 2007, but since then the central
bank has increased gradually the policy interest rate to 6.75 percent by end-March2008.
The structure of the Guatemalan banking system has undergone important changes. Two bank failures in
late 2006 and early 2007 were resolved quickly and effectivety, and in the aftermath, the sy5te;m has
consolidatedthrough a wave of mergers and aquistions. Mirroring developments in other countries in
the region, international bankshave also increased their presence in the country. The authorrties have
taken measuresto improve financial sector regulation and supervision, rncludingthrough better
monitoringof bank Iquidity, implementing risk-based superviston, and issutng new regulations, including
on credit concentration ltmits and fiquidity requirements for offshore banks, and rules for the
appointment of external auditors.

in 2007, substantial impr-ocenientsin tau admrnrstration, and continued efforts to promote growth and
regionaleconomic integiatton. While near-term prospects remain favorable overall, there are downside
risks from a sharper deceleiation of the U.S. economy, qwen strong economic linkages through trade,
rernrttances, and financial flows. In additron, inflation risks remain ttlted to the upsrde, given the increase
in international food and fuel prices.
Directorswelmmed the authonties' focus on improving Guatemala's resilience to shocks and sustaining
high growth fates to reduce poverty. This will require further strengthening of banking regulation and
supervision, raising tax revenue and key pm-poor expenditures, and continuingefforts to improve the
business environment and lower inflation.
Directors noted that the !ow level of public debt has been a key strength of Guatemala's macroeconomic
policres. The recent strong revenue performance provides an oppoituntty to address social and
infrastructure needs wtthoutpqardiang debt sustainabrhty. 5lrectOrS supported recent initiatwes to
strengthenthe social safety net and to protect the p r from the impact of higher food prices. They saw
scope for automattc stabilizersto work in the event of a Larger-than-expectedeconomic slowdown. They
concurredwith the authonties' pianto secure contingent external finanung, if needed, to avold crowding
out private sector credit and drawing down government deposits at the central bank. Directors supported
the authorities' intention to submit a revenueenhancing tax reform to congress to achieve the objectives
of the 1996 Peace Accords. Higher revenues should be directed to strengtheningsocial policies, publtc
security, and infrastructure. Directors called for continuedefforts to improvethe transparency and
efficiency of publtc spending.
Directors noted that high food and oil prices were a major factor behind the increasein inflation in 2007,
and that continurng external inflation pressuresare complicatingthe conduct OF monetary poltcy. They
welcomed the Increaseinthe plicy interest rate, and noted that, white downside nskswarrant a dose
mltonng of developments, further monetary tightening may be needed to avoid semnd-round effects
of external inflation and to anchor inflationexpectationsat a low level. To increase monetary policy
effectivenessand strengthen the credibility OF the inflation targeting framework, most Directors
recommendedthat the authorities allow greater exchange rate flexibility. This would atso tower
stenlization costs, reduce incentivesfor dolianzatton, and help the economy adlust more smoothly to
changes in global and domestic conditions. A few Directors, however, advised caution in revising
exchange rate policy, noting the significantpass-throughof exchange rate movements to the domestic
economy. A number of Directors suppsttedthe authorities' request for Fund technical assistance in
developingthe secondary market for governmentdebt, which will strengthen the monetary policy
transmtssron mechanism.
Directorsobserved that Guatemala's current account is projected to be sustainable over the medium
term, and that the appreciation of the realeffective exchange rate has beenbroadly consfstent with
fundamentals. While the strong export growth in recent years suggeststhat competitiveness has been
maintarned, the authonties should eonhnue pursuingproductivity-enhanung reforms to boczst long-term
growth,
Directorscommended the authonties for thear effective resolution of two bank farlures m 2006 and 2007.
Actions are needed to strengthen the bankingsystem's prudential and legalframework and addfess
remainingvulnerabilittes, includingthe increasingdoltanzationof loans. Directors welmrned the recent
progress made to irnplemwit nsk-basedsupervisionand the plan to refarm the banking law in 2foO8.
These should be acmmpanied by addrtionaleffortsto enhancethe bank resolutron Framework, better
ring-fence offshore banks, and eliminate legal constraints to effective bankingsupervision. Directors
emphasized that burlding larger capitalcushions, increasing loan-loss provisioning, and dosely
monitoring credit concentration iiithe banking sector will increasethe financtal system's resiiience to
adverse econmic shocks.
Directorswelcomed the progressmade in improving macmeconornicstatisticsand emuraged the
authonttesto continue with therr efforts, especiallywith respectto the quarterly GDP figures,
consolidated public sector statistics, and measurement of balance of paymentsflows,
