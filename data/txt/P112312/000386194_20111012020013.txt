1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

Guatemala has the largest economy in Central America but is plagued by very high rates
of poverty and inequality. Compared to other middle-income countries, social indicators
in Guatemala are low, particularly among the geographically and economically
marginalized rural indigenous population. The institutional environment was hampered
by decades of civil war, which contributed to weak governance and transparency and
constrained the economic participation of large segments of the population. Crafting and
implementing sound public policies proved difficult in this restive environment, in turn
inhibiting broad-based and sustained economic and social development.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Since the signing of the 1996 Peace Accords, the country has begun to make headway,
focusing on social needs and building democratic institutions. The peaceful transition to
a new government in January 2008 is a clear illustration of progress to-date.
Nevertheless, serious challenges remain. The series of Programmatic Fiscal and
Institutional Development Policy Loans was initiated in 2008 during this period of
political transition, but also at a time of great economic uncertainty with the emergence
of the global financial crisis and subsequent growth slow-down. At appraisal,
Guatemala’s economy was growing at a robust 6.3 percent (2007), following several
years of steady growth rates of 3-5 percent. This sustained economic performance –
despite consecutive negative shocks in terms of natural disasters, commodity price
fluctuations and a domestic banking crisis and bail-out – reflects a prudent macro policy
stance. Guatemala’s modest fiscal deficits (2-3 percent of GDP), relatively stable current
account deficit (historically around 5 percent of GDP) and low levels of external debt
(less than 25 percent of GDP) helped the economy to weather these shocks (see Table 1
below).

In the period leading up to appraisal, Guatemala focused its trade policy on increased
regional and global integration, with the signing of DR-CAFTA (which came into effect
in 2006). These efforts were complemented by some improvement in the investment
climate, although corruption and crime remain significant obstacles. Nevertheless,
Guatemalan competitiveness seems to have improved, reflected by a large inflow of FDI
during this period. Government accountability and transparency have also improved due
to ongoing efforts to consolidate public financial management reforms through the
integrated financial management system (SIAF) and a new public procurement system
(GUATECOMPRAS). But perceptions of corruption and weak rule of law continue to
plague day-to-day decision making and transactions.

Prior to appraisal, financial sector soundness saw concrete improvement, but supervision
continued to fall short in some areas. Legal and regulatory reforms in 2002 contributed
to improve banking sector solvency and resilience to market volatility. These reforms
also contributed to designing an effective bank resolution framework, which led to the
successful resolution of two significant banks (Bancafé and Banco del Comercio) in
2006-2007. However, as noted in the 2006 FSAP update, further strengthening of
                                            1
financial supervision was needed, in particular on the supervision of financial
conglomerates which accounted for over 80 percent of total regulated financial system
assets. With regard to access to finance, although domestic credit to private sector firms
increased from around 20 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30 percent in 2007, this figure was
low compared to the Central American average of 47 percent. Access to finance was
particularly troublesome for small firms which had lower or no collateral and were
serviced by non bank and mostly non regulated entities.

Despite considerable progress across the policy spectrum and positive real per capita
growth rates, institutional and development outcomes in Guatemala continue to signal the
need for further reform. The Colom administration, which came to power in January
                                                   2
2008, committed to a program addressing poverty and inequality through increasing
growth, creating fiscal space through fiscal reform and better monitoring and evaluation
to target needy sectors while maintaining macroeconomic stability, and improving
governance and transparency at the central and local levels to raise accountability and
improve service delivery. The Bank has much to offer in these technical areas, and the
Government requested both financial and technical support from the Bank through the
Programmatic DPL series in order to help them address this development agenda. The
Bank team preparing the DPL series judged the macroeconomic policy framework to be
prudent and the outlook for sustainable growth positive. The resulting DPLs were
designed to complement the broad objectives identified in the Country Partnership
Strategy.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall Program Development Objectives for both loans and the associated key
performance indicators (outcomes expected for end-2010) are as follows:

I. Promote macroeconomic stability and financial sector deepening and maintain fiscal
space for priority spending
       i.     Central Government fiscal deficit does not exceed 2.8 percent of GDP in
              2010 as priority social spending increases
       ii.    fiscal reforms mitigate the crisis impact so that Central Government tax
              collections do not fall below 10.4 percent of GDP in 2010
       iii.   consolidated supervision completed in at least half of financial groups by
              assets and regular supervision completed for all 4 risk profiles under the
              new risk manual
       iv.    regular debt issuance by MoF starting in the second half of 2008
       v.     three percent increase in financing volume generated by use of garantías
              mobiliarias
II. Improve governance and transparency of public financial management and
expenditures
       vi.    MoF and Auditor General’s Office use the annual audits and monthly
              financial reports of at least 90 percent of public trust funds to improve their
              oversight, management and efficiency
       vii.   specialized offices to facilitate access to public information established in at
              least 30 percent of Central Government agencies
       viii. results indicators developed for at least 50 percent of Central Government
              expenditures to introduce a results-informed budget framework
III. Strengthen the effectiveness of the Mi Familia Progresa Conditional Cash Transfer
Program through improved execution and targeting
       ix.    co-responsibilities verified for at least 50 percent of CCT beneficiaries, half
              of which are extreme poor, based on a monitoring and evaluation
              framework
IV. Promote sustainable growth and productivity
       x.     tax declarations submitted via the internet have increased by 3 percent
              relative to 2007 baseline


                                              3
      xi.    customs clearance times for exports and imports have declined by 5 percent
             compared to 2007

V. The first DPL had an intermediate objective to meet the fiscal and financial needs
during a period of economic slowdown (namely 2008-9).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The series of programmatic DPLs was originally designed to comprise 3 operations to
span fiscal years 2009-2011, but the onset of a severe economic crisis during appraisal of
the second operation led the Bank management to revise the series to two operations,
shorten the timeline by 12 months, and enlarge the total DPL lending package to US$550
million to address evolving economic situation (an increase from the originally allocated
US$500 million over three operations). The rationale for this change stemmed from the
dire impact of the global crisis on tax revenues. The Government adjusted its reform
program to reflect accelerated actions in some areas, namely to increase private sector
access to finance and address financial sector stability, and ensure that social
expenditures were protected and that recent reductions in poverty rates were not reversed.
Other actions relating to tax reform were deferred to the post-crisis period and thus fell
outside the scope of the DPLs. No changes in the development objectives resulted,
however, and the key indicator values in the 2nd DPL were defined to reflect weaker
fiscal performance during 2009 (i.e., a less ambitious target for the fiscal deficit) and the
shortened time-frame for expected outcomes which advanced from end-2011 to end-2010.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The original policy areas supported by the first and second DPLs were:

I. Promote macroeconomic stability and financial sector deepening and maintain fiscal
space for priority spending

Specific measures designed to promote macroeconomic stability are centered on fiscal
reforms and modernizing tax administration methods in order to increase tax revenues
above their very low base level. This in turn helps to create the fiscal space necessary for
priority spending in social sectors. Measures to deepen the financial sector include
extending banking supervision by risk category to capture financial conglomerates,
extending prudential regulations to off-shore banks, and creating a moveable assets
registry to facilitate credit access for firms lacking fixed capital. Additional measures
relate to standardizing the Central Bank’s short-term debt issuance.

II. Improve governance and transparency of public financial management and
expenditures

Policy measures to increase transparency include the strengthening and/or creation of
institutional structures to promote public accountability and reduce corruption, and the
passage and implementation of an Access to Public Information law. New measures aim
at increasing scrutiny and control over public trust funds, as well as strengthening the
                                             4
public financial management and procurement systems for central and local government
entities.

III. Strengthen the effectiveness of the Mi Familia Progresa Conditional Cash Transfer
Program through improved execution and targeting

The Government’s main program for expanding opportunities for vulnerable groups is Mi
Familia Progresa, and measures to improve its effectiveness focus on better targeting and
execution as the program is rolled out across the country.

IV. Promote sustainable growth and productivity

Measures for promoting growth and productivity have some overlap with the preceding
thematic areas, given the correlation between economic growth and macroeconomic
stability and labor productivity, inter alia. Additional complementary measures focus on
the business environment by accelerating customs clearance and reducing tax reporting
requirements through more efficient electronic processes.

The broad range of policies supported by the DPLs stems from the goal to support the
Country Partnership Strategy pillars. The DPLs were in effect the primary Bank
instrument for dialogue with the Government.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

In light of the country context and developments since the design of the 1st and 2nd DPLs,
the project has proved to be a flexible instrument that helped the Government implement
its reform program and achieve or make substantial progress toward other policy
objectives, albeit with varying degrees of success. The policy actions were designed to
align with the Government’s program within a timeframe that was judged to maximize
the potential for success. This timeframe could not anticipate important exogenous
shocks to the political and economic environments, however.

The World Bank Board approved the two DPL operations on time (October 2008 and
July 2009). Effectiveness delays of 5 months resulted from delays in Congressional
approval, but with no negative impact on implementation. Both operations were single-
tranche, such that prior actions triggered disbursement. Appropriate sequencing of prior
actions allowed for measurable progress in implementation. All prior actions were met.

Two main adjustments were made to the original structure of the DPL series during
implementation. As mentioned above, the series was originally designed to comprise
three operations, but this was truncated to two operations in the context of the economic
crisis, and outcome indicators were adjusted accordingly to accommodate the shorter
time-frame (i.e., the third operation would have closed later in the CPS cycle rather than
the December 2010 closing date of the 2nd and final DPL). Secondly, the economic
slowdown in the second half of 2008 and beginning of 2009 and the associated credit



                                            5
crunch signaled the need to stimulate credit availability; as a result, measures were added
to the policy matrix to ease credit access for micro- and SMEs.

The following section provides a summary of prior actions and a brief description of the
policy measures supported by the two DPLs.

Policy Measures Supported by the 1st and 2nd DPLs:

Fiscal reform and tax administration comprise the first main policy areas supported by
the DPLs. Guatemala has long suffered from low revenue collection rates as a share of
GDP, greatly restraining the Government’s capacity to deliver effective services. A two-
pronged strategy was adopted to remedy this weakness. The first focused on
modernizing tax administration by streamlining and digitizing tax declarations and
fostering their use through user-friendly software and training. Government began to
require electronic submissions of income tax withholding for firms, and upgraded its
administrative systems to perform electronic cross-checks between VAT declarations and
income tax submissions to reduce tax evasion. Reforms were also undertaken in the area
of customs administration with the introduction of a new Customs Management System
(SAQB’E) to modernize and digitize customs clearance processes in line with
international practices. The second part of the strategy targeted tax reform, namely by
introducing a new gross revenue tax (ISO) on businesses to replace the expired IETAAP,
a temporary tax. The new ISO would be transitional by covering the revenue gap until
passage of a new tax law revising both business profit tax rates and taxes on distribution
of profits as well as measures to broaden the tax base and simplify the personal income
tax regime (phase two of the proposed fiscal reform).

In terms of financial market stabilization and deepening, the DPLs supported
Government efforts to extend prudential rules to offshore banks, and helped strengthen
supervision of financial conglomerates by moving to risk-based and consolidated
supervision, a multi-year strategy that the Bank has supported through the Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (closed in March 2007) and the subsequent Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Loan (closed in June 2009). The 2nd DPL also supported the
elaboration and adoption of the Movable Assets Law (garantías mobiliarias) and
establishment of the registry as an instrument to increase access to finance by micro,
small and medium size companies which often lack real estate collateral to obtain
financing. In addition, the DPLs supported Central Bank standardization of debt
instruments and regular issuance through weekly auctions coordinated with the Ministry
of Finance in order to foster the development of an interest rate yield curve as a step
towards secondary debt market development.

The Government’s program places strong emphasis on improving governance and
increasing transparency, the third main policy area supported by the DPLs. The policy
actions to achieve these goals include monthly financial reporting and annual external
audits of public trust funds for use by the MoF and the Auditor General, and the passage
and implementation of an Access to Public Information law. Measures to strengthen
public financial management have been ongoing for several years; the 1st and 2nd DPLs
specifically supported a system to make all Government procurement information
publicly available, and establish an e-procurement system for electronic competitive
bidding on large Government contracts. The MoF committed to finance, operate and
upgrade the financial management (SIAF) and procurement (Guatecompras) systems.
The DPLs also supported the implementation of results-informed budgeting in Central
Government entities.

                                            7
In 2008, the Government launched, on a pilot basis, a conditional cash transfer program
called Mi Familia Progresa. Bank support – both through the 1st and 2nd DPLs and the
Expanding Opportunities: CCT Institutional Establishment investment loan currently
awaiting implementation – has assisted implementation of a transparent monitoring and
evaluation system of the CCT program to allow verification of eligibility, i.e., verifying
that beneficiaries have met the necessary health and education attendance conditions.
External evaluations of the program’s design, risks, management, and effectiveness are
part of the assistance provided to the Government to ensure that benefits reach the
targeted population through efficient and financially sustainable execution as the program
is extended throughout the country.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Implementation of the 1st and 2nd DPLs was very much affected by the economic and
political environment, with both positive and negative implications. The 2008
inauguration of President Colom represented a shift from prior administrations in that it
was Guatemala’s first centre-left government in over fifty years, elected with the broad
support of rural and indigenous populations. The new Government’s program focused on
(i) reducing poverty and inequality, (ii) better fiscal management to meet priority social
spending and investment, (iii) improved governance and transparency, and (iv) promoting
sustainable growth and productivity. By aligning its policy support with the new
Government’s pro-reform agenda, the Bank was able to help articulate and contribute
positively to pro-poor, pro-development policies. And because the 1st DPL coincided
with the beginning of President Colom’s term, the Bank – along with many pro-reform
constituencies in Guatemala – linked its policy agenda to the campaign’s reformist
platform that could be implemented with the election mandate. It was widely believed
that by expending the necessary political capital early in his term, President Colom and
his team could initiate significant and lasting reforms. The CCT program was
successfully launched, but the ambitious fiscal reform package – which had been
developed with broad consultation including private sector input and support – lost
momentum.

Numerous factors are to blame. There was a major shift in political party allegiances in
Congress within months of the election which undermined the President’s legislative
support. The global economic slowdown began to bite in Guatemala as growth rates fell
sharply; the idea of paying higher taxes became increasingly unpopular among business
owners. And in 2009 a political crisis erupted that attracted international attention to
Guatemala’s weak institutions and fueled the perception that the Government was simply
conducting business as usual rather than promoting real improvements in transparency.
As support for the Government waned, the private sector withdrew its support for fiscal
reform and the Government focused its energies on the rapid implementation of the CCT
program. Although this was successful on many fronts, benefiting hundreds of thousands
of families, it attracted criticism from some political opponents that the CCT program
was increasingly being used as a vehicle to buy the rural vote. Whereas political factors
undermined progress in certain policy areas, it facilitated the passage of a tide-changing
Access to Public Information Law in part because of the new demand for increased
transparency and public accountability.
                                             8
The political challenges reflect a combination of exogenous and endogenous factors. On
the one hand, the Government demonstrated a strong commitment to the agreed policy
agenda and prior actions, in some areas reflecting a consensus approach with broad
support from international financial institutions and civil society organizations. But as its
domestic support base slipped, the Government retreated from more aggressive fiscal
reform – in part because it would counteract the needed fiscal stimulus at the height of
the economic crisis.

Three types of risk were identified during preparation of the 1st and 2nd DPLs, all of
which proved to be relevant during the 30-month life of the operations. Mitigation
measures were only partly successful in addressing political risk, but were largely
effective in addressing other risks.
     Political risk is always significant in Guatemala, but particularly for President
        Colom’s ruling UNE party, which never secured a majority in Congress and in
        fact has lost congressional support.1 To mitigate the risks to its reform agenda,
        the Government pursued wide consultation with stakeholders on fiscal reforms.
        Whereas this strategy paid off for Phase 1 of the fiscal reform package, it was
        insufficient to overcome the growing opposition that was gaining momentum.
     The impact of the global economic downturn was another risk to the
        Government’s program as Guatemala tried to climb out of economic crisis.
        Although growth started to recover in 2010, the external environment remained
        unstable as commodity price shocks and lower remittances threatened the fragile
        recovery. Fiscal revenues continued to suffer, but the international financial
        institutions helped to fill the financing gap, in addition to the regular issuance of
        and sustained demand for domestic debt. The Government did not need to access
        liquidity available under a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF.
        The CCT program helped to mitigate the impact on the poor.
     Guatemala is susceptible to natural disasters, and 2010 saw its share of external
        shocks: landslides, a volcanic eruption, Tropical Storm Agatha, and a large sink
        hole in the capital, resulting in loss of life and property. In April 2009, the Bank
        approved a Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down operation to provide
        contingent financing following a natural disaster, which it drew on after a series
        of natural disasters due to hurricanes and flooding.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Nine out of the eleven outcome indicators defined in the policy matrix are easily
measured indications of progress toward the Program Development Objectives. For
some of these outcome indicators, however, factors other than the policy measures of the
DPLs may have contributed, such that outcomes are not uniquely attributable to the two
DPLs. For instance, tax reforms and tax administration improvements will affect the


1
         UNE won 51 out of a total 158 congressional seats in the 2007 elections, but currently holds 40
seats.


                                                     9
fiscal deficit, which is easily measured and monitored due to readily available data. But
other factors may also explain higher spending or lower revenues such as exogenous
shocks that slowed economic activity, thus reducing VAT collections and import duties,
inter alia. Despite these measurement difficulties, the fiscal deficit is nevertheless
indicative of the impact of fiscal reforms.

The DPL is confined to short-term measures due to its short time-horizon, but M&E
arrangements are meant to assess achievement of long-term objectives. This timing
inconsistency raises issues for selecting appropriate outcome indicators as measures of
progress toward long-term development objectives. For instance, increasing transparency
through a new Access to Public Information Law is an important step, but the real impact
on transparency may take time to emerge. In the DPL time-frame, however, progress is
monitored by measuring the number of Government agencies that have opened public
information offices within 18 months.

In another example, the customs administration reform was essential for updating
Guatemala’s systems to international standards, and met its goals of facilitating and
accelerating customs clearance procedures within 18 months. But the reform was also
expected to reduce corruption. Focusing on digitizing systems does not address one of
the fundamental drivers behind much corruption, namely the presence of customs
officials and their personal interaction with traders. Without addressing the roles of
customs personnel within the new context of electronic processing, the positive impact of
reform – which includes reduced opportunities for corruption – will be limited until these
underlying impediments are addressed.

M&E utilization has been more positive in other components of the DPLs. With respect
to results indicators in the budgeting process, although they are in the early stages, it
appears that these monitoring indicators are indeed being used to develop the new results-
informed budget framework. And in terms of the tax administration improvements, the
Tax Administration Superintendency has calculated the additional revenue gained
through modernization, controls and cross-checking measures and its contribution to
overall revenue collections.

One indicator that poses measurement difficulties relates to the oversight of public trust
funds. The policy action requires monthly financial reports and annual external audits as
tools to improve transparency, but the outcome indicator requires a measure of their use
by the MoF and the Auditor General to improve trust fund management and efficiency,
requiring a subjective assessment. The preparation of financial reports and audits are
crucial and certainly helped shed light on the operations of these public trust funds, but it
is unreasonable to assume that the availability of these reports will automatically result in
limits on the discretionary use of trust funds.

The other indicator that poses measurement problems relates to the targeting of the CCT
program. Verifying co-responsibilities is inherent to the benefit disbursement procedures,
and confirming this will become easier with electronic monitoring that is currently being
implemented. But the data necessary to calculate the share of beneficiaries that are

                                             10
extreme poor do not currently exist. This evaluation will be feasible only after the new
living standards survey is completed (a new survey expected to be launched in the
coming months).

The data requirements for the defined outcome indicators were manageable (with the
exceptions cited above) and M&E has been for the most part carried out, not only by the
Bank in its supervision functions, but also by various partners. For example, the media
has played a significant role in monitoring transparency by mining the publicly available
data in Guatecompras; by calling attention to outliers such as large expenditures or
examples of nepotism, the media draws attention to and thus fosters debate around
government transparency and accountability issues. Civil society groups play a central
role in monitoring the implementation of the Access to Public Information Law; in
particular, Acción Ciudadana tracks the ways in which Central Government entities
respond to requests for information, and publish an index ranking agencies’ performance
with respect to transparency measures. In this way, the DPLs leveraged additional
oversight by other entities.

The real challenge – for the DPLs as for all Bank operations – lies in stimulating the
effective use of monitoring data to inform decision-making and resource allocation. The
example of Access to Public Information offices illustrates this difficulty. The
development objective behind this policy action was to increase transparency as well as
to create the demand for greater accountability and efficiency in public spending by
service users. There is a high demand for transparency and accountability among the
Guatemalan public, but weak political parties, tentative civil society networks and
factions across various indigenous groups lead to a coordination failure. The remaining
challenge is how to catalyze this broad-based demand for transparency in order to create
change.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

There are no new DPLs planned within the current CPS. The Bank can continue to
support the Government’s reform program through technical or analytical assistance,
however, and the forthcoming Public Expenditure Review will be a useful tool to help the
Government further deepen and institutionalize public financial management reform, tax
reform, and the effectiveness of social spending, particularly through the CCT program.
With respect to the latter, disseminating Bank and other donor-prepared evaluations of
Mi Familia Progresa in terms of its costs and benefits could provide the impetus for
further strengthening the program (e.g., through better targeting), generating broad
political support and securing adequate dedicated public resources to finance it in future.
The timing of the Bank’s analytical input would be most effective if it could contribute to
the political debate surrounding the Presidential election cycle (first-round elections will
take place in September 2011).

Another aspect of the operation that could benefit from follow-up relates to customs
reform and redefining the role of customs officials in order to further reduce corruption
and accelerate customs clearance times. Ongoing monitoring through the Bank’s Doing


                                            11
Business Indicators based on investment climate surveys will help to track developments
in this area.

In terms of consolidated banking supervision, although all the key profiles for risk-based
supervision have been completed and applied to all financial groups, the unfinished
agenda relates to supervision of economic conglomerates, which may de facto control
financial institutions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objectives of the programmatic DPL series remain highly relevant
today in the context of the ongoing challenges facing Guatemala. These objectives were
fully aligned with the Government’s development priorities as articulated in the August
2008 Country Partnership Strategy Report, namely to (i) enhance economic fundamentals,
(ii) sustain growth and productivity, and (iii) expand opportunities for vulnerable groups.
Each of the policy areas supported by the 1st and 2nd DPLs falls under these three over-
arching objectives.

The operations’ design was consistent with the stated program development objectives,
and the DPLs’ implementation proved to make an important contribution toward
implementing the Government’s program. Numerous counterparts in Guatemala noted
the vital role that the Bank’s development policy lending plays, not so much in setting the
Government’s priorities, but rather in helping the Government achieve its priorities. The
policies reflected in the 1st and 2nd DPL prior actions were measures already identified by
the Government as essential to their strategy; incorporating them into the framework of a
DPL was effective in accelerating their implementation and helped the Government
remain focused on its medium-term objectives and the near-term measures needed to
reach them.

Although the number of components in the DPL matrix is large, they represent a sound
and consistent framework with a strategically appropriate and achievable scope. Because
the DPLs were the Bank’s main instrument for country dialogue, it was important to
cover the range of relevant policy areas rather than focusing more narrowly. As
mentioned above, a DPL is confined to short-term measures due to its short time-horizon.
But some reforms require more long-term input. When assessing the DPLs’ outcomes,
therefore, it is important to acknowledge when expected results are unrealistic within the
given time-frame.

The Bank demonstrated its responsiveness to the changing economic environment by
revising policy actions to address specific challenges stemming from the economic crisis.
The Bank also restructured its support to accommodate the Government’s greater
financing needs, increasing the loan size of the 2nd DPL and eliminating the planned 3rd
DPL in order to consolidate support at a critical time. The Bank’s response was mirrored
by greater financial support from the IMF and IDB as well. By enlarging the overall

                                            12
programmatic DPL lending package to US$550 million and accelerating the
disbursement schedule, Bank support helped the Government to meet the demands of the
economic crisis and ensure that social expenditures were protected despite a sharp decline
in tax revenues. The DPL series also responded to the need to help mobilize credit to
micro- and SMEs because of the negative effect of the global economic downturn and
credit crunch on the Guatemalan economy and, in particular, firms’ access to credit. The
scope of the 2nd DPL was expanded to support the creation of a Movable Assets Registry
under which firms can use movable assets as collateral when borrowing.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

I. Promote macroeconomic stability and financial sector deepening and maintain fiscal
space for priority spending

The series of programmatic DPLs helped to promote macroeconomic stability through
the direct provision of budget financing to maintain fiscal space for priority spending
areas, but also by assisting fiscal modernization to increase revenue collections and
reduce tax evasion. The improved tax administration system now requires electronic
submission of business withholding taxes. The shift to the digital format vastly improved
accuracy and efficiency, and allows cross-checking among the profit tax, VAT and the
ISO tax regimes and the associated exemptions, as well as performing other controls.
The combined impact of these administrative control measures added 0.3 percent of GDP
to fiscal revenues in 2010. The implementation of the transitional Solidarity tax to
replace the IETAAP also maintained revenues (equivalent to over 1 percent of GDP),
which helped the Government to meet the revised targeted tax revenue outcome indicator
for 2010 (total tax revenues were 10.5 percent of GDP).

Even though the fiscal target was eased under the 2nd DPL to account for the crisis-
induced fall in revenues, and despite the shift in policy measures away from the
envisaged tax increases (inappropriate during a downturn because it would counteract
expansionary policies) to more immediate tax administration measures, the Government
still missed the 2010 target deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP. The DPLs’ accommodative
stance and the revenue gains from anti-evasion efforts proved insufficient to offset the
effects of the crisis, as the fiscal deficit reached 3.3 percent of GDP.

With respect to promoting financial sector stability and deepening, consolidated
supervision has been implemented in 9 of the 11 financial groups licensed by the Banking
Superintendency as of April 2011, and all four key profiles for risk-based supervision
(institutional, financial, risk, and control environment) have been completed and applied
to all financial groups, surpassing the outcome indicator. The Banking Superintendency
is in the process of finalizing a single matrix for consolidated risk-based supervision and
determining one overall risk rating for each financial group (initially the work on risk-
based and consolidated supervision started in parallel with two different manuals that are
being merged).

Central Bank efforts to standardize issuance of short-term debt reflects some progress
toward financial market deepening, consistent with the targeted outcome indicators.
                                            13
However, weaknesses remain which limit the deepening of bond markets in line with
longer-term objectives. For example, banks are exempt from a tax on government bond
transactions, which has concentrated 90 percent of domestic public debt holdings in four
banks, thus limiting broader private sector participation.

The registry of movable assets had a directly positive effect on financial market
development by increasing the amount of credit in the economy.2 Although total credit
stagnated in 2009-2010 under the global credit crisis, the registry increased the amount of
movable guarantees so that the share of credit guaranteed by movable collateral reached
4.1 percent of total credit as of December 2010, from a base of zero in 2008, exceeding
the outcome target.

II. Improve governance and transparency of public financial management and
expenditures

The step of institutionalizing the Government’s commitment to greater transparency by
creating the Vice Ministry for Fiscal Transparency and Evaluation provided an important
signal. But this commitment was made more credible by the adoption of the Access to
Public Information Law, which empowers citizens to hold Government accountable for
its use of public resources. Specialized offices have been created in 85 percent of Central
Government agencies to facilitate access to public information, exceeding the outcome
indicator.

This success contrasts with the continued challenge of making more transparent the
operations of public trust funds to facilitate greater efficiency and accountability. The
policy measures supported by the DPLs introduced monthly financial reporting and
annual external audits of trust funds. Whereas this represents a significant improvement
relative to 2008 when no financial oversight was performed, external audits are not
available for all trust funds, and it is not possible to judge whether the reports are being
used to improve their management. Government commitment to transparency would
have been more credible if, for example, the operations of publicly funded trust funds had
not expanded so much during the lifetime of the operations without concomitant legal
reforms to regulate their use. Whereas trust fund oversight was strengthened with the
support of the DPLs, their continued use has not been curbed, implying that progress vis-
à-vis the development objective has been limited.

In terms of strengthening the public financial management and procurement systems, the
MoF launched an internal reorganization to absorb, operate and upgrade SIAF and
Guatecompras, but they have yet to fund the absorption of current staffing levels financed
until now by external sources. Whereas Guatecompras has to a degree increased


2
          To isolate the impact of the registry, we measure the market share of credit supported by the
registry in total credit. We proxy the amount of credit supported by the registry by the amount of collateral
registered. Since the registry does not measure collateral by type of borrower (i.e., small vs. large) we
measure the effect on total credit.


                                                     14
transparency through recording Government purchases on a public website, assessments
of the effectiveness of Guatecompras show that only a small percentage of direct
contracting occurs through Guatecompras Express, implying minimal success in
expanding the use of competitive bidding. Moreover, a large share of public contracting
still occurs through pre-existing contracts, public trust funds and NGO purchases, iner
alia, which are exempt from the procurement rules.

Real progress is being made, however, on the results-informed budgeting system.
Results indicators have been developed for three-quarters of all Ministries, representing
97 percent of Central Government expenditure, nearly double the outcome target.

The reality is that transparency in Guatemala has been very low but in recent years the
Government has taken steps to improve it. On balance, the DPL measures helped to
improve transparency, albeit only moderately.

III. Strengthen the effectiveness of the Mi Familia Progresa Conditional Cash Transfer
Program through improved execution and targeting

The policy actions supported by the 1st and 2nd DPLs had a very positive impact on the
CCT program’s targeting and transparency, primarily through the introduction of proxy
means testing to identify eligible beneficiaries. The procedures for verifying co-
responsibilities of beneficiaries (i.e., confirming school and health check attendance) are
well established, and will soon be greatly improved through the use of scanning
technology to digitize verification. The Mi Familia Progresa program was extended into
more than 270 municipalities to reach over 900,000 families in a very short period of
time. This rapid expansion raises questions about execution effectiveness, but the
program’s simple design (e.g., flat benefit levels distributed to family units) and likely
modest leakages (due to very high poverty rates in rural areas) mitigates these concerns.
The Government confirmed that co-responsibilities are being verified for all recipients
through a network of local representatives, double the outcome indicator target of 50
percent. It is not feasible to verify the exact proportion of extreme poor, however, due to
lack of updated survey data on household living standards (a new survey will be launched
in the coming months).

IV. Promote sustainable growth and productivity

The tax modernization measures supported by the DPLs – in particular the development
and distribution of software for web-based business tax withholding – has directly
contributed to higher productivity by reducing the amount of time required to make tax
declarations, and at the same time improving accuracy and reducing evasion through
cross-checks. The share of firms submitting tax declarations electronically has risen from
34 percent in 2007 to 42 percent in 2010, surpassing the targeted 37 percent.

Exporting and importing firms’ productivity has also been stimulated by the new
Customs Management System, SAQB’E, which has been implemented in 15 ports (out of
18 in total). By digitizing the customs clearance documentation requirements, clearance

                                            15
times for imports fell from 19 to 17 days (a 10 percent drop) and export clearance times
fell from 18 to 17 days (a 5 percent decline), meeting the outcome target. There remains
room for further improvement, however, as opportunities for corruption continue to be
present.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating reflects two criteria for measuring success: the extent to
which target outcome indicators were met, and the extent to which program development
objectives were achieved. As stated previously, most outcome indicators were met, with
only minor shortcomings (and with respect to the fiscal deficit, these were largely
exogenous). Progress toward certain development outcomes was more problematic,
however, reflected by moderate shortcomings in implementation. In particular,
qualitative progress towards better governance and transparency in public financial
management and expenditures was below expectations relating to public procurement and
trust fund oversight. The overall outcome rating is therefore moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

This operation addresses poverty and welfare both indirectly – through more efficient use
of public resources – and directly – through measures to improve social safety net
targeting. There have been no new measures of poverty since the inception of the 1st
DPL, but the CCT program has rapidly increased its scope, currently providing income
support to approximately one-third of the population. Whereas the net impact on primary
enrollment may be very small, there is some evidence to suggest that the program is
helping to keep students enrolled in school longer, and there are almost certainly gains in
physical health for beneficiary families. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that rural
women are benefiting through increased empowerment. Otherwise, gender issues are
mainstreamed rather than being targeted specifically.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The programmatic DPL series has a strong focus on institutional development, with a
majority of its measures aimed at strengthening Government’s institutional capacity. For
example, modernizing tax administration and streamlining its processes not only
increases revenues and spreads the tax burden more equitably, but also helps to increase
confidence in the Government and legitimize its tax and spending functions. The
Banking Superintendency has been highly successful in upgrading its supervision
capacity by establishing more thorough criteria for overseeing the banking sector.
Further capacity building needs to focus on extending supervision to the
conglomerates/economic groups which may control the financial groups and include non-
financial companies that may create risks to financial entities. Guatecompras, in contrast,
has not achieved the goal of transparency and competition in Government contracting,
implying the need for deeper institutional reform. Nevertheless, the system provides the

                                              16
framework for increased transparency and competitiveness in the future through on-line
bidding capability and publication of data.

Regarding the registry for movable assets, the first two years have been successful in
terms of development, but additional measures to increase its efficiency and effective
targeting of SMEs will be essential to strengthen institutional capacity further. Planned
measures include a recently launched communications campaign to market itself to small
businesses and financial institutions that usually service small businesses, such as
cooperatives, and making the registration process available on-line. With respect to the
CCT program, the targeting and program execution procedures have been strengthened,
and should improve further with the planned electronic verification platform and the
forthcoming household survey to provide a new proxy means test for identifying eligible
households and in particular the extreme poor.

The operations’ long-term development goals aim at strengthening more far-reaching
institutions such as the rule of law and transparency. The Access to Public Information
Law provides a real impetus to civil society groups to mobilize pressure to hold
Government accountable and make more efficient use of public resources. And although
the public trust fund operations remain somewhat obscure, they are at least on the radar
screen and a majority is being monitored on an ex-post basis, the first step in recognizing
the scope of the problem and the incentive challenges in trying to address it.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is substantial and stems from
many sources.

The program objective to promote macroeconomic stability and enhance fiscal space for
priority spending depends on both external and internal factors. The Guatemalan
economy is vulnerable to negative exogenous shocks in the global economic environment,
affecting trade and domestic demand, which in turn affects available public financing.
Whereas the Government’s prudent macroeconomic policies will help to mitigate these
effects, the impact of the recent economic crisis demonstrates that macro balances remain
vulnerable. Natural disasters represent another source of risk that threatens the
macroeconomic environment. Internal factors that present the largest risks derive from
the political environment and Government ownership. Fiscal reform efforts have stalled
in the past, and the currently rancorous political climate and the upcoming Presidential
elections have complicated meaningful policy debate and any potential consensus-
building.

Although important gains have been made in improving the governance and transparency
of public financial management and expenditures, with key systems in place to facilitate
open and efficient management, the political will at the leadership level to embrace these
processes and embed the concept of transparency into the institutional fabric depends
upon the management teams in key ministries to implement transparency initiatives. But


                                            17
the degree to which these teams can achieve a lasting impact is hindered by the frequent
personnel changes that characterize Guatemalan politics. The Access to Public
Information Law and the creation of information offices in most ministries can help to
mitigate backtracking in this arena, but the demand for public information is relatively
low and civil society networks are weak. Long-term outcomes will depend on
stakeholder ownership in terms of political will on the inside and citizen demand on the
outside, both difficult factors to manage.

The Mi Familia Progresa Conditional Cash Transfer Program is well established
throughout much of the country and execution and targeting continues to improve. It has
been financed through ad-hoc budget sources until now, pulling budget from other line
items to fund the Mi Familia Progresa Trust Fund. The program has broad support across
the political spectrum, but its precarious financing situation and high cost (accounting for
2 percent of the budget) present a negative risk to its future operation. The probability of
the program being cut is low, but there is a small probability that targeting will suffer due
to weak governance. On the other hand, given that the program is geographically
concentrated in areas of very high poverty, total leakage is likely to be small.

Improvements in the business environment have contributed to Guatemalan firms’
productivity and their ability to compete in global markets. The customs clearance
process is a fundamental component of the trading environment, and the new electronic
system has successfully reduced the administrative burden on importing and exporting
firms. Nevertheless, corruption remains an issue. Technical solutions can help to further
automate the clearance process, but a lasting positive outcome will only emerge when
person-to-person interface with customs officials is minimized.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The programmatic DPL series was prepared in close consultation with the Government
and stakeholders such as civil society groups and international donors. The policy
measures were identified on the basis of extensive analytical work and in coordination
with reforms being supported by other donors in order to maximize the development
impact and at the same time provide complementary and therefore reinforcing
mechanisms of support, constituting a strategic approach. The operation was conceived
to help the new Colom administration achieve an ambitious program of public sector
reforms and strengthen public institutions in a way that also increased transparency. The
other key structural elements of the Guatemalan economy that needed to be addressed by
the DPLs were poverty and social inclusion, and growth and productivity. The Bank
team designed the operations specifically to address the institutional environment with a
view to strengthening institutional capacity in a sustainable way.

The Bank demonstrated a high degree of flexibility in adapting the DPL parameters –
both policies and financing structure – to a changing country context. Whereas overall
                                             18
development objectives did not change, the policy actions to achieve them in a climate of
macroeconomic and fiscal crisis needed to be revised. Furthermore, additional budget
support was needed to fill the financing gap, and the Bank, in conjunction with the IMF
and the IDB, were able to meet these new demands.

The operations were prepared with a full appreciation and articulation of the risks to
program outcomes, and included mitigation measures to address these risks (some more
successfully than others). The overall implementation and M&E arrangements were
broadly effective, although a few of the monitoring and evaluation criteria proved
problematic in terms of measurement. Recall, for example, that it is not feasible to verify
the exact proportion of extreme poor in the CCT program due to the lack of updated
survey data on household living standards. Another indicator that is difficult to measure
because it requires a subjective assessment relates to the oversight of public trust funds.
The indicator seeks to measure the use of monthly financial reports and annual external
audits by the MoF and the Auditor General to improve trust fund management and
efficiency. The discussion above also acknowledges a degree of disconnect between the
short-term outcome indicators and the long-term development objectives.

Some components of the policy matrix sought to embed the reforms by implementing
them across agencies, thereby fostering inter-agency cooperation. But effective
cooperation is difficult in the best of times, even with the best intentions. The DPLs have
indeed resulted in increased cooperation, such as between the MoF and the Central Bank
in issuing public debt, but if the objective is better coordination, then an explicit incentive
mechanism may be more effective in encouraging it.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned above, the operations’ design emphasized monitoring and evaluation of the
reforms, both implicitly and explicitly. Because the operations formed a programmatic
series, sequencing the two operations enforced close supervision in that preparation of the
2nd DPL was contingent on the results of the 1st DPL. Explicit attention to supervision is
reflected not only in the target indicators but also was demonstrated by the Bank’s
responsiveness to changing country circumstances and the Government’s request to alter
the structure and magnitude of the loan.

The ISR prepared following the closing of the 2nd DPL was very candid and thorough in
its performance assessments.




                                              19
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Both quality at entry and quality of supervision were satisfactory, making the overall
Bank performance rating satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance3
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The operation was designed to align fully with the Country Partnership Strategy and the
incoming Government’s objectives. The Government’s program resulted from a
consultative process, including particular consultation with the private sector on fiscal
reform. Government ownership and commitment was strong from the outset. The
difficult political environment and resulting failure of the originally proposed fiscal
reform package led the Government to scale back its reform proposal. Nevertheless,
significant progress was achieved, primarily through tax administration improvements
which not only raised tax revenue and reduced evasion, but also built institutional
capacity.

The macroeconomic environment in which the 1st DPL was prepared was characterized
by strong growth and sound macro balances. The global financial crisis and economic
slowdown began to drag down Guatemalan growth in 2008 and 2009, with significant
implications for Government service provision (tax revenues fell sharply) and poverty
(remittances suffered a significant decline), which in turn helped to shape the 2nd DPL.
The Government maintained its prudent macroeconomic policy stance.

There have been moderate obstacles on the transparency front, in particular relating to
Guatecompras and public trust funds. The Guatecompras system has indeed increased
transparency through recording Government purchases on a public website, but efforts to
expand the use of competitive bidding have stalled; only a small share of purchases
eligible for direct contracting occurs through Guatecompras Express. Moreover, pre-
existing contracts that can be renewed automatically do not need to be processed through
Guatecompras. Public trust funds also fall outside Government procurement rules. This
was the rationale behind increasing transparency through the introduction of monthly
monitoring and annual external audits of trust funds. Some audits remain to be
completed, and it is unclear whether the monitoring reports are being used to improve
trust fund management and efficiency. The Government has met its commitment to
establish information offices in a majority of Central Government agencies.

                                                 20
Borrower performance has also been satisfactory vis-à-vis financial sector outcomes.
The registry for movable assets has made a strong impact in its two years of existence,
and the Banking Superintendency has consistently expanded risk-based supervision and
consolidated supervision. Mi Familia Progresa remains the Government’s flagship
program, reflected by its rapid expansion and consistently high profile. The Government
has been receptive to external advice on implementation and has sought timely resolution
of implementation obstacles.

The Government has met most of the targeted outcomes, demonstrating drive for results
except in the areas of governance and transparency in public financial management and
expenditures, where results were below expectations. Overall, Government performance
merits a moderately satisfactory rating.

6. Lessons Learned

The implementation challenges relating to the fiscal reform component of the 1st and 2nd
DPLs illustrate the difficulties of achieving program objectives that depend on legislative
approval, particularly in the area of tax reform. Repeated attempts to increase revenue
collections through raising tax rates and expanding the tax base have failed in the past,
and continue to face stiff opposition. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge the
intrinsic difficulty of implementing redistributive tax reform in a highly unequal society
and within a short time horizon. The experience of the 1st and 2nd DPLs implies that the
Bank could be more modest in its expectations, and could foster support for reform by
identifying and helping build constituencies with shared interests or who stand to gain
from reform. Another related lesson that can be drawn from the DPLs is that although
the planned fiscal reforms would have generated significant revenues, measures to
improve tax administration can also generate large revenue gains, and are politically
more palatable. In Guatemala, introducing tax controls and modernizing tax systems not
only increased efficiency but had a big pay-off through reducing evasion.

Another lesson that can be derived from the operation relates to the policy measures on
increasing the transparency of public trust funds. The stated objective was to increase
transparency in the hope that eventually this would create pressure to increase oversight
and efficiency. But this result has yet to come to fruition. The real objective was to
ensure that all public resources are spent in a transparent way consistent with
Government priorities in order to minimize leakages. Although audits can potentially
help in this regard, they do not address the underlying reasons for continued and
expanding use of public trust funds (such as prohibitive procurement rules, for example).
Designing policies that take into account these deeper impediments will have a greater
impact.

Despite uneven progress in increasing transparency and accountability, even modest
advances can have a significant impact, especially when starting from a very low level.
For example, the passage of the Access to Public Information Law overcame initial
opposition precisely because of corruption scandals, which drew the ire of the public and
thus provided the impetus for the law to pass. In a similar vein, even though the

                                            21
application of Guatecompras has been imperfect, it has provided access to information on
unfair contracting practices that, once made public, generated support for greater
transparency.

Success in strengthening the supervision of the financial sector was not achieved simply
through the policies supported by the 1st and 2nd DPLs, but rather as a result of a larger
program of Bank support that has been sustained over time. The implementation of
consolidated supervision is a long-term process reflecting the importance of financial
groups in the financial system. As highlighted in the CPS, complex institutional issues
may require support across various instruments and over an extended period of time.
This complementarity of short-term and long-term support underscores the inherent
limitations of DPLs to achieve long-term development goals because of the timing
inconsistency between program development objectives and the short-term policy
interventions designed to achieve them and, because of the short timeframe of DPLs, the
short-term outcome indicators used to assess progress. For example, real progress in
transparency of Government purchases takes years of reform effort at the institutional
level; it is unreasonable to expect results as a consequence of short-term policy
interventions. This timing paradox complicates program design and makes the selection
of appropriate outcome indicators particularly challenging.

The final lesson drawn from the implementation experience of the DPLs stems from the
request to increase financing in the 2nd DPL in order to address the demands of the
economic crisis. The DPL provided a lot of flexibility in a moment of need. Specifically,
the Bank’s flexible response helped to support pro-cyclical fiscal policy by enabling the
Government to continue to function and at the same time protect priority spending.
Whereas this is not a fundamental objective of development policy lending – which by
definition focuses on long-term structural issues – it nevertheless was effective in this
case by sustaining progress in the long-term reform agenda in the face of negative shocks.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

[The following comments were translated from Spanish.]

Initially, the series of DPLs proposed in the Country Partnership Strategy with the World
Bank comprised 3 operations for a total amount of US$500.0 million. However, only 2
operations were signed and disbursed. The DPL series satisfactorily achieved the
objective of contributing to the main policy objectives of the Government through: 1)
support for strengthening governance, transparency and monitoring and evaluation of
major public expenditure and investment; and 2) supporting macroeconomic stability and
greater fiscal space for priority expenditures.

      The series of Fiscal DPLs was partially successful. While in some areas
       supported by the DPL series the results were successful (strengthening tax
       administration, strengthening the administration and supervision of the financial
       sector, governance and transparency, improving the investment climate), the
       results were not very encouraging in the area of fiscal reform (increased public
       spending and modernizing public financing), due to the fact that a series of
       reforms pushed by the Government at the end of 2008 was not approved.

      This series of DPL operations helped to maintain a continuous dialogue
       between the country and the Bank. The DPL series served as a two-way
       communication channel between the Government’s administration, the Bank and
       the international community on progress in the country’s development strategy
       and in the reform policies being encouraged.

      The resources of the 1st and 2nd DPLs were used to tend to budgetary
       requirements. In this sense, they financed various actions in the sectors listed in
       the following table.

      Non-approval of the Fiscal Reform Initiative presented to Congress made it
       difficult to manage and negotiate a third Fiscal DPL. At the end of August
       2010, the World Bank informed the Government that the actions and reforms
       proposed for a 3rd DPL were insufficiently substantive to cover such an operation.
       Moreover, it indicated that the total level of budget support granted to Guatemala
       had reached US$550.0 million in the last two years. In this regard, the World
       Bank – conscious of the additional costs the Government must incur to cover
       reconstruction needs – proposed financing under an emergency loan in the
       amount of US$100.0 million for Education and Health (currently in Congress
       pending approval).
