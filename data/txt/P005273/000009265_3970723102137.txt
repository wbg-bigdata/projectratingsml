HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Beneficiaries:           The Urban Development Department (UDD) of the Amman
Municipality and the Housing Bank (BB).
Amount:                   US$28 million equivalent.
Terms:                    15 years, including 3 years of grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:         The Borrower would onlend $12.5 million of the
proposed loan to the BB for items whose costs are
recoverable from property sales. The maturity and
grace period for the onlent funds would be the same
as under the Bank loan (15 and 3 years, respectively);
the interest rate would be fixed at the rate in
effect at the time of loan signing. The remainder
would be made available to the UDD as -a grant for
social facilities whose costs are non-recoverable
from project beneficiaries. The Government would
bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Project Description:     The project is part of the Government's long-term
program to provide shelter for poorer urban
dwellers. It aims at improving the living conditions
of low-income people in the Amman region by providing
shelter at affordable prices without subsidy to
ensure the project's replicability; encouraging sound
growth patterns through stimulating urban development
in appropriate locations and at lower infrastructure
cost than under traditional practice; and
strengthening institutional capacities in Jordan to
undertake low-income shelter and urbanization
projects. The project includes the following major
components: (a) upgrading two low-income squatter
settlements that house about 4,200 people;
(b) servicing land in four sites for about
3,400 plots with initial occupancy by about 24,000
people; and (c) providing technical assistance to the
UDD for project design, p-oject planning and
supervision, studies -nd advice on management and
financial issues. The project would benefit a
substantial portion of the population of Greater
Amman, a quarter of whom fall below the poverty
threshold, and provide for shelter at lower economic
costs than existing alternatives. The principal
project risk concerns uncertain marketability of
plots in times of econom!ic slowdown. The project,
however, includes features to minimize the risk.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Setting
1.01     Jordan-L' is a highly urbanized country.  Following three decades of
high population growth and massive immigration, about 70 percent of its 2.6
million population live in urban areas of 5,000 people or more. By the year
2000, Jordan's urban population is expected to increase by some 2 million.
Unemployment is an increasing problem, since the labor force is rising at
about 6% per annum while domestic and external demands for Jordanian labor are
weakening. Given its scarcity of natural resources, limited arable land and
water and small domestic market, Jordan's future economic growth and
employment must depend upon export-based manufactures and services.  In an era
of expected slower economic growth, the development and management of
efficient and cost-effective services and infrastructure in urban areas to
support these activities, as well as to improve the welfare of a rapidly
increasing urban population, are crucial challenges facing Jordan.
1.02     Jordan's population is highly concentrated.  Seventy percent of its
urban population lives within 30 kilometers of the capital, Amman. Amman's
population of 750,000 accounts for almost 60% of the Amzwn region urban
population (Map 1). This area produces most of the country's services and
manufacturing industrial output. While the Government is taking active
measures to stimulate growth in other areas, the Amman region is expected to
accommodate most population growth for the remainder of this century and to
continue its role as the main engine for Jordan's economic development. With
the very rapid increase in the Amnan region's population, lack of low-cost
housing and proliferation of slums have emerged as pressing problems.  Up to
26 percent of households in the Amman urban region have incomes below the
Bank-defined urban poverty threshold of JD 140 per month. The most rapid
population growth in the Anman region is occurring outside Amman municipality,
typically in new areas with low land costs, but with high costs of
infrastructural services. Given limited budgets, many areas, especially those
inhabited by the poor, are inadequately served. The prospect of low and
uncertain economic growth implies a continuing need for the Government to be
concerned with providing services for less fortunate citizens.
B. Institutional Framework
1.03     Several government corporations or authorities provide services or
coordinate local functions, including, most notably, the Cities and Villages
Development Bank (CVDB), which lends to local governments, the Water Authority
of Jordan (WAJ), which is responsible for water production and distribution
and sewerage works, and the Jordan Electric Power Company (JEPCO), responsible
for electricity distribution. In the field of housing, the government-owned
Jordan Housing Corporation (JHC) develops housing for public sector employees
and housing cooperatives. The Housing Bank (HB), a mixed public-private
1/ Data in the text that follows refer to the East Bank of Jordan.



-2-
sector institution which operates on a commercial basis, was established in
1974 to help mobilize private savings to finance housing construction and has
grown into the main savings insitution in Jordan. Local governments have an
essential role to play, especially in transport, roads, solid waste
management, land use planning, health controls, provision of markets, a
variety of licensing functions and, in some areas, investments in schools and
health centers. Urban administration in Jordan comes under about 135
municipalities and 300 villages which report to the Ministry of Municipalities
and Rural Affairs and the Environment (MMRAE). The Municipality of Amman (AM)
has a unique political status: the Lord Mayor has ministerial rank, and its
budget is approved by the Prime Minister rather than the MMRAE, and the
Municipality (rather than MMRAE) is responsible for planning standards within
the AM boundaries.
1.04     There are several weaknesses in the provision of local services,
including a multiplicity of institutions, overcentralization of authority
within specific organizations, and personnel policies and levels of
remuneration which make it difficult to attract and retain qualified staff.
Local government management, planning, and finance are generally weak.
Municipalities are unable to prepare and implement investment programs to meet
the requirements of a rapidly increasing urban population. Better planning
and coordination of public investments in different sectors at the regional as
veil as city level will become increasingly important in avoiding waste and
encouraging efficient patterns of urban development. A general problem in
providing services has been urban sprawl, and in Greater Amman population
density has actually been decreasing for this reason. The result is
overinvestment in infrastructure networks. Sprawl has arisen due to weak
planning controls, low taxes on land, and subsidized provision of services,
all of which reduce incentives to develop land in serviced areas. Given the
vital economic role of the Amnan region, and the increasing scale and
complexity of services, special attention is required to strengthening
planning there.
C. Shelter
1.05     Most housing in Jordan is provided by the private sector, and
consists of one to three storey detached buildings. In the lower and middle
income areas, there is usually provision for vertical or horizontal extension,
and families tend to extend their houses as their family circumstances demand
and their incomes permit. Around 11 percent of the urban population live in
official refugee camps administered by the United Nations Relief and Works
Administration (UNRWA). Some 7 percent live in low-income squatter
settlements, many comprising overflows from nearby refugee camps, which are
characterized by illegal tenures and serious deficiencies in infrastructural
and social services. Squatting on government lands on the urban fringe of
Amman, while a relatively new phenomenon not yet involving many people, has
been increasing in recent years. A low degree of direct cost recovery from
beneficiaries for infrastructure, together with limited resources available
for infrastructure investments, implies that poorer neighborhoods tend to
suffer more service deficiencies than richer ones.



-3-
1.06     Substantial resources have been mobilized for housing investment,
which, fuelled by workers remittances, has considerably exceeded plan targets
and in 1976-1980 came to about 6 percent of GNP. The current Five-Year Plan
(1981-85) allocates $825 million or 8.8 percent of public sector investment
for public housing, as well as significant amounts for other urban services
such as water, sewerage, and electricity. The crux of the shelter problem is
not a shortage of housing overall, but its high cost, which forces poorer
families to live in overcrowded conditions. Occupancy in the squatter areas
is estimated at over four persons per room, compared with a national average
of about 2.6. One reason is that land and building costs have risen faster
than incomes in the last decade. Second, although the Jordan landlord and
tenant legislation gives freedom to landlords in setting rents on new
buildings, it contains no provision for rent increases, and tenants have
complete security of tenure, with the result that some landlords prefer to
keep apartments vacant for long periods rather than lease them. The main
cause, however, of the problem for low-income people is excessively costly
building and planning standards including, most notably, minimum plot sizes of
300m2 (which are unaffordable to poorer persons). The cheapest private
sector accommodations for sale with financing require monthly mortgage
payments of upwards of JD 100 (US$250) per month (unaffordable to families in
the lower two-thirds of the Amman region income distribution).
1.07     The Government's basic response in the past to the high housing
construction cost problem has been to establish heavily subsidized housing
funds (those for the military, police and teachers provide zero interest rate
loans) and to encourage construction and sale of housing by the Jordan Housing
Corporation (JEC) with rates of interest to beneficiaries of about 8Zk'.
The 1Q81-1985 Development Plan stressed the expansion of housing for lower-
and middle-income groups and proposed that the JHC produce approximately one
quarter of new housing, an increase in its output from 1,500 to 4,000 units
per year. This strategy has not met the demand for low-income shelter since
the cheapest JHC housing is in the form of apartments of over 80.2, and
monthly payments range between JD 74 and JD 110 (US$185 and $275), requiring a
monthly income of at least JD 250 (US$625), making JEC housing unaffordable to
families in the lower half of the Amman income distribution. The Government
is now, with UDPl, innovating an alternative approach that involves less
initial accommodation on individual plots of land but with room for
progressive construction by households, cross-subsidization between sales at
market prices, and sales to target group beneficiaries, and provision of the
full range of social and infrastructural facilities required for sound urban
development.
D. Sectoral Policy Actions
1.08     The Bank's Urban Sector Review (No. 3965-JO, dated June 22, 1983)
identified a number of key policy issues requiring priority attention. These
included: (i) reviewing the organization and staffing of institutions
concerned with urban management; (ii) strengthening Amman Municipality's
organization, staffing and finances; (iii) establishing effective Amman region

20 years as charged by JHC.

planning machinery; (iv) incorporating spatial planning considerations into
Ministry of Planning (MOP) procedures; (v) encouraging more cost-effective and
economic development patterns by, inter alia, increasing land taxes and
improving control over the public domain; (vi) developing a country-wide
housing policy and allocating institutional responsibility for its monitoring
and implementation; and (vii) developing appropriate mechanisms to provide
shelter (infrastructure and housing) to lower-income groups who are
underserved by existing practice.
1.09     The Government is cognizant of these issues and has been moving
effectively to address them. The Municipality of Amman is in the process of
improving management of its engineering services, investment programming, and
financial planning. Planning for the Greater Amman Metropolitan Region is
receiving attention by a working party chaired by the Lord Mayor of Amman,
which, with the assistance of consultants, is studying the institutional
changes required to establish effective planning machinery and is preparing
master plans and investment plans for the region for the 1986-1990 Five Year
Plan. The incorporation of spatial planning considerations has been addressed
on a national level through the recent establishment in MOP of a regional
planning section. A major enumeration of social and economic facilities in
all parts of Jordan is now underway with technical assistance from USAID, and
the next Five Year Plan is expected to incorporate a much stronger regional
component. Regarding rent controls, rental ceilings on properties occupied
before 1975 were allowed to increase in 1983 up to estimated 1975 levels for
fiscal reasons. Since rents on new properties have stabilized in the last few
years, rent controls are a less significant factor in inefficient allocation
of the housing stock than previously.
1.10     To facilitate developing a housing policy, funds for carrying out a
housing strategy study were included under UDPl. The government subsequently
decided to use grant funds for this study and experts financed by USAID and UN
Habitat will supplement an in-house MOP team. Assurances were secured at
negotiations that the study would be completed by December 31, 1986, at which
time Government would discuss its findings with the Bank. The Government has
also taken some steps to encourage more economic development patterns by
revaluing land for taxation purposes. Through UDP1 and the proposed project,
the Government is experimenting with more cost-effective low-income shelter.
E. Bank Group Role in the Sector
1.11     Bank Group assistance has been responsive to the problems created by
rapid urbanization. Extensive economic and sector work has been carried out,
as well as project financing related to urban development in Jordan. Recent
studies include the above cited Urban Sector Review, the Water Sector Report
(Report No. 4699, June 1984), and a regional development study. Based on
discussions of these reports, the Bank's strategy in the sector includes
assistance to improve main urban service levels (water, sewerage, solid



-5-
waste management, urban transportation); increasing the supply of serviced
land; improving physical and development planning in Anman and other urban
centers where most future development will occur; and strengthening the
capacity of local governments to plan, implement, and manage the functions for
which they are responsible.
1.12     In support of the above strategy, a "three-track" lending approach is
currently being followed, i.e. (i) water and sewerage projects; (ii) shelter
projects and (iii) municipal projects. Seven water and sewerage projects have
been undertaken in urban areas. The Cities and Villages Development Bank
(CVDB) loan ($10 million, Loan No. 1826-JO, 1980) has the objective of
building up the capacity of local governments to provide services for their
populations. A second loan to CVDB is being appraised. The Amman Transport
and Municipal Development Project ($30 million, Loan No. 2334-JO, 1983) aims
to help Amman Municipality ameliorate traffic problems, upgrade the capacity
of the relevant municipal departments to plan and execute works (including
maintenance and operation functions), upgrade solid waste management, and to
commence systematic investment programming.
l.13     The first Bank-financed Urban Development Project (UDPl, US$21
million, Loan No. 1893-JO, 1980) is addressing the need for cost-effective,
low-cost housing in the Amman region. The project is upgrading four slum
areas with about 1,400 families, and servicing about 2,800 new residential
plots in the Amman region. About 2,130 of the plots are to be sold to
families in the lower 402 of the income distribution, who are unserved by
other official housing programs and who constitute the target group for the
project. UDPI extends beyond narrowly defined shelter to provide both sites
and services and upgrading areas with appropriate educational, health, and
community facilities.  The project is being executed by the Urban Development
Department (UDD), which was set up in Amman Municipality expressly for this
purpose; funds for all shelter components pass through the HB, which also has
responsibility for all mortgage and building loans to individual project
beneficiaries. The project includes vocational and commercial training for
the urban poor by the Vocational Training Corporation, with special emphasis
on increasing female participation in the labor force.  A scheme to promote
employment opportunities through loans by the Industrial Development Bank to
small-scale and handicraft enterprises in the project areas will start when
sites are occupied.
1.14     UDP1 was delayed for more than a year for redesign following a
Government decision to increase plot size by 50 percent and minimum road
widths by 200 percent over appraised standards. This required reducing the
number of plots from 5,000 to 2,800, and extending the target group from
families below the 33rd percentile, as initially agreed, to families below the
40th percentile. Following this change, however, implementation of UDP1 has
proceeded efficiently and on schedule. The upgrading component of UDPI is now
almost completed. There have been over 12,000 applications for plots in new
sites, and occupation of plots is now taking place and should be complete by
mid-1986. Project delays and the appreciation of the US dollar have caused
slower disbursements than anticipated at appraisal. UDP1 is, however,



-6-
expected to achieve its main goals of upgrading low-income settlements, giving
their inhabitants tenure, providing affordable shelter to many lower-income
groups without subsidy, and improving the standard of public services in
poorer neighborhoods.
1.15     The proposed Second Urban Development project would build upon the
experience and skills developed under UDPI in designing, implementing and
marketing a new type of shelter project. It would incorporate several
modifications in design standards to reflect lessons learned in the first
project, including larger areas in community centers, a greater variety of
plot sizes to respond to demands, and less construction of hour,ing
superstructures by UDD in the light of the strong demand by muny beneficiaries
for serviced land on which to build their own houses. FutuLe operations might
address shelter problems outside the Amman region, and also possibly shift to
an approach in which funds would be provided for investment in subprojects
meeting previously agreed criteria, with less emphasis ou Bank appraisal of
individual components.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01     The project objectives would be to:
(a)  improve shelter for low-income people in the Amman region without
Government subsidy;
(b)  encourage sound spatial patterns by stimulating urban growth in
appropriate locations at lower infrastructure costs than under
traditional practice; and
(c)  strengthen institutional capacities in Jordan to undertake low-income
shelter and urbanization projects.
B. Main Features
2.02     The project would:
a.   upgrade conditions in two settlements with about 610 families (4,200
people) through regularization of land tenure, provision of water and
sewerage, paved streets and footpaths, community centers and schools,
social buildings (clinics, community and women's training centers),
and development of infill commercial and residential plots;
b.   service land in four sites for about 3,420 plots and initial
occupancy by about 3,570 families (24,000 people), of which about
2,755 families would be in the 10th to 40th income percentiles. The
new sites would include plots for commercial development and
workshops for small enterprises, and the full range of social and
community facilities.



-7--
c.  provide training and advisory services to assist the Urban
Development Department CUDD) to implement the project and to carry
out studies relevant to future operations.
C. Detailed Description
Upgrading Schemes
2.03     This project would upgrade the low-income squatter settlements on
government land at Emir Hassan (a population of 1,700 on 2.8 ha) and Jebel
Emir Ali (a population of 2,500 on 18.5 ha). See Map 2 for location of the
sites. These sites were selected because (a) they suffer major deficiencies
in several public services, (b) they require significant investments in the
type of coordinated and cost-effective solutions which the UDD can provide,
(c) other programs are not underway in those sites, and (d) there is agreement
on the best future use for them. The project would improve road access,
internal roads, footpaths, water and sewerage, and construct community and
vocational training centers at each site. At Jebel Emir Ali, the project
would also provide electricity (the site is now partly served by private
generators) and a health clinic. The Emir Hassan site is in the fully
developed, built-up area of ifarka, and has a population density of about 615
persons per hectrre. With installation of services and grant of tenure to
residents, there may be some further upward extension of existing buildings,
and the ultimate population density may rise to over 700 persons per hectare-
Densities are much lower at Jebel Emir Ali (135Iha) and about 141 infill plots
will be developed there for commercial use and for sale for residential use to
members of the 10th to 40th percentile target group. The standard of existing
houses is adequate. The project would, however, include loans to existing
residents to expand their houses, and to purchasers of infill plots at Jebel
Emir Ali for new house construction. The costs of land and infrastructure
would be recovered in the prices charged to existing and new residents.
Further details are given in Table II-I and Annex 1.
Sites and Services
2.04     The project would service four new sites, two at Ruseifa, one each at
Naqab and Um Nowarah (Map 2), with infrastructure, social facilities and some
housing to accommodate an initial population of about 24,000 and an ultimate
population, after eight to twelve years, of about 45,600.
2.05     The sites were selected following a major effort to identify areas
suitably located with respect to present and future employment opportunities
and existing or planned trunk infrastructures, and which had topography
suitable for shelter development. All sites are near existing or programmed
trunk roads, water and sewer lines, and the project includes provision for
connections to them (and, in the case of Ruseifa, for communal septic tanks,
should there be any delay in installation of trunk sewers). Access to jobs
has been an important criterion of site selection. The Ruseifa site is on the
Amman-Zarqa axis near a variety of light industries, and offers convenient
access to the rapidly growing high income residential areas of West Amman via
the Yajouze Road, which is also the area with the most ra2idly expanding
spontaneous illegal settlements in the Anuza' region.  Naqab is near Marka and
next to the Amman-Zarqa motorway; Um Nowarah is within five km of the rapidly

growing light industrial and repair activities on the Inner Ring Road in
southeast Amman and the developing Amman-Sabab corridor. Public transport
(via shared taxis and a public bus company) works fairly efficiently in
Amman. Once initial households are in residence, the sites should be well
served. The Amman area is very hilly but all sites have slopes of 20% or
Less. An attempt was made to identify government-owned sites, but only the
Ruseifa sites were acceptable; other publicly owned parcels were too remote
from employment opportunities or trunk infrastructures to be viable. Hence
two sites (comprising 73.7 ha out of a total of 109.9 ha) are on private
land. Site sizes were implied by (a) the objective of accommodating around
one half of the growth of families in the 10th to 40th percentiles in UDP
sites, (b) the need to disperse sites in the region, and (c) indivisibilities
implied by the population required to justify new schools.
2.06     The sites would be furnished with a full complement of social
services. Ten new schools and expansions of two schools constructed under
UDPI at Ruseifa at the primary, preparatory and secondary levels for boys and
girls would be constructed according to design standards developed under Bank
education projects in Jordan.  Four women's training centers would be
established, and as in UDPI, administered by the Vocational Training
Corporation (VTC). Health clinics would be built on each new site except
Ruseifa (which would be served by the UDPI Ruseifa site clinic and a hospital
being constructed on a neighboring plot).  This provision reflects the new
standards recently agreed in connection with the proposed Jordan Primary
Health Care Project. Community centers to be used for day-care programs,
literacy courses, seminars, discussion groups, etc., would be built at each
site. Their design has been modified based on the experience gained under
UDP1. Emergency service centers would be provided to meet the need for safety
and security on the UDP2 and nearby UDPI sites. They would consist of garage
space for two fire-fightiog vehicles, two ambulances, and one four-wheel drive
vehicle and accommodation above the garage for fire and ambulance personnel.
2.07    About 601 of the land destined for private ownership would be sold
below cost to persons in the target group. The subsidy would be covered by
surpluses from the sale at market prices of about 341 of the land for
residential purposes, and about 61 for commercial purposes. Major features of
the property sales component include:
(a)  development of a wide range of plot sizes for target group
beneficiaries (from 112.5 m2 to 200 mz) compared with the uniform
UDP1 150 m2 plot size, and the minimum 300 mz allowed under
existing regulations in other parts of the Anman region;
(b)  sale of the larger beneficiary plots (200 m2) to two or more
families;
(c)  UDD would construct housing on up to 45S of beneficiary plots
(compared with 77S in UDPl), and greater reliance would be placed on
informal sector construction commissioned by beneficiary households
(with expected cost savings on the order of 30% compared with
construction by large contractors); and



-10-
(d)  inclusion in each UDD built house of a kitchen and bathroom, as well
as one or two rooms. This feature reflects experience of UDP1 in
which core houses without bathroom or kitchen were less attractive
than either serviced lots, or lots with two-room core houses.
2.08     To encourage larger private-sector developers, parts of the areas
(including 2 ha in Um Nowarah) would be sold at market prices to developers
who then would be responsible for further subdivision, construction, and sale
of houses and/or apartments to households. There also would be small shopping
centers in Nowarah and Ruseifa that could be developed by private operators
for sale or rental to commercial and small industrial firms.
2.09     There are considerable variations in land use and facility provision
on the different sites related to the circumstances of each site (see Part F
of Table II-1). Further details on the components of the new sites, provision
of plots and design standards, are given in Annex I.
Technical Assistance, Training and Studies
2.10     The project includes provision of 90 mm of technical assistance for
advice on inhouse design (about 34 mm), project planning and management (24
mm), and economic and financial issues (32 mm); 60 mm for design of community
facilities, 225 mm for supervision of works, and 135 mm for studies.  Further
details on technical assistance are given at Annex 1 and Annex 8(A).  In
addition to on-the-job training to be provided by UDD's advisors, the project
includes a provision of JD 36,000 for training in Jordan and abroad.
2.11     The project would include four studies:  (a) feasibility and design
studies for a third UDP would be carried out by consultants with in-house
support, (b) surveys and feasibility studies for redevelopment of the
100-150 ha of worked-out quarries (which currently constitute a barrier to
development on the southern and eastern edges of Amman Municipality) would be
carried out by consultants; (c) a feasibility study for a program of land
tenure regularizatiion and upgrading the remaining squatter areas in Amnan
would be prepared by the UDD, with the assistance of its in-house advisors;
and (d) a study of means to increase employment opportunities for women living
on UDP sites would be carried out by UDD. In each case, the relevant agencies
would discuss the results of the study with the World Bank. Terms of
reference for the studies are set out in Annex 8.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Costs
3.01     Total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at JD 35.4
million (US$88.5 million). Summary cost estimates are shown in Table III-1.
Details are provided in Annex 2. Baseline costs are based on advanced
preliminary engineering designs and checked against unit prices from tenders
recently received for projects of a similar nature and adjusted to reflect
anticipated prices in April 1985.

3.02    Foreign exchange costs of civil works were estimated on the basis of
cost analyses of specific components as follows: site preparation - 35%,
roads - 541. water - 67%. sewerage - 43%, drainage - 40%, electricity - 75%,
footpaths - 40%, and buildings - 451, for an average for all civil works of
47%. Foreign costs of equipment and furnishings vere based on experience
under UDP1 and amounted to 901 for equipment for social buildings (mostly



-12-
imported), 601 for furnishings (largely locally produced), and 801 for
equipment for project management (to be purchased mainly through local
shopping), for an average of 801. Professional services for design and
supervision are estimated to have foreign content-of 53Z and 331,
respectively, and to average 361, and the foreign cost of technical assistance
advice was estimated at 751. These percentages were based on recent man-month
rates for local and foreign consultants. There would be about 210 expatriate
man-months and 300 man-months of local consultants included in professional
services and technical assistance. Foreign cost of training is estimated at
751. Project management operating costs were estimated to have a foreign cost
of 101 (comprising indirect foreign costs of fuel, utilities, and building
depreciation). Overall foreign exchange cost amounts to JD 13.2 million
(US$32.9 million) or to 37S of total project cost.
3.03     Physical contingencies average 7% on total baseline costs.  Price
contingencies on the foreign component have been calculated on the basis of
forecasts of international inflation at 51 for 1985, 7.51 for 1986, and 81 for
1987 to 1990. Price contingencies on domestic costs have been calculated at
5 in 1985, 61 in 1986, and 72 per anntm in later years. Price contingencies
represent about 17S of baseline costs plus physical contingencies, and total
contingencies amount to about 201 of total project costs. Indirect taxes come
to about 2.3X of total costs.
3.04     The costs for upgrading and sites and services include JD 0.82
(US$2.1) million for design and supervision by consultants. Costs of
technical assistance, advisory and consultant services for project management,
training and studies under the project amount to JD 0.81 (US$2.0) million.
Management expenses of JD 1.1 (US $2.6) million cover the costs of salaries
and other operating costs of the Urban Development Department attributed to
this project.
B. Project Finances
3.05     Investment costs have been divided into three parts for purposes of
financing: (a) public sector costs of community facilities (schools, health
centers, etc.) and policy studies, (b) land, infrastructures and housing which
costs would be recovered from sales of property, and (c) building loans which
would be extended to target-group beneficiaries by the Housing Bank (RB).
Tables III-2 and III-3 summarize the proposed financing arrangements, which
are further described below.
3.06     Investments in the first two categories would be made by the UDD,
using Goiw'rnment grants for the items in part (a), of which the local part and
technical assistance and training (JD 7.8 or US$19.5 million) would come from
the budget, and the remainder would be covered by the World Bank loan (JD 6.2
or US$15.5 million). JD 0.2 (US$.5) million of the domestic contribution
would be in the form of Government land for public purposes. The Government
would receive about JD 0.9 million (US$2.25 million) from sale of property for
resale to private owners, so the net cash Government contribution for public-
sector components would be JD 7.6 million (US$19.0 millioa). The Government
would finance any overruns on public-sector components.

in the table above, interest during construction on the World Bank loan of JD 2.2
(US$5.5) million, and repayment of the World Bank loan of JD 1.9 (US$4.75)
million. The latter two items would be recovered from proceeds of cash sales and
beneficiaries down payments in the amount of JD 1.9 (US$4.75) million and with
respect to social facilities, by Government grants of JD 2.2 (US$5.5) million.
3.07     With reference to items in part (b), the UDD would be funded by (i) cash
sales, (ii) loans from the Housing Bank (HB), and (iii) profits from UDPI. The
Government would on-lend to BB that part of the Bank loan for items whose costs are to
be recovered from property sales, with the Government absorbing all exchange and
interest-rate risk. The Government also would ensure finance from its own or donor
sources for the technical assistance services included in part (b) (about JD 0.25
million). These costs would be recovered from beneficiaries. It would be decided
later whether the Government would be reimbursed for them, or whether the amounts
recovered would be held in the Low Income Housing Revolving Fund (LIHRF, see para
5.11).  HB would finance overruns on items whose costs are recoverable from property
sales. Execution of a loan agreement between the Government, the Municipality and HB,

3.08     The Bank loan to the Government of JD 11.2 (US$28.0) million would
cover all foreign costs of civil works, equipment and consultancy services for
design and supervision, and indirect foreign costs of project management. The
Government would finance advisory and training services (foreign cost
estimated at US$1.8 million including contingencies) from its own or bilateral
sources. Bank finance for building loans is not included since these loans
will be disbursed late in the project, largely following the 3-year grace
period on Bank loans to Jordan. Coverage by the Bank loan would be 85 percent
of total project foreign exchange costs.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Status of Proiect Preparation
4.01     Feasibility studies and preliminary engineering designs at 1:2500
scale for 80% of all infrastructure works were contained in the feasibility
study, and sketch plans for the remainder were available at appraisal.
Preparation of final designs for these works would be carried out in-house by
UDD staff and the technical assistance advisors to be engaged under the
project. Consultants would prepare designs for social buildings. The MMRAE
has already approved the plans for the first new site (Ruseifa 2A) and the AM
has approved plans for Emir Hassan, so that no delays are expected due to lack
of agreement on standards. Final designs and bidding documents for all
first-year works would be ready by mid-1985. Acquisition procedures for all
lands have commenced. Acquisition of the privately-owned land should not
cause implementation delays, since the initial construction would be on
Government land, and UDD has developed experience during UDPI in acquiring
private land.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.02     Project implementation would take about 5 years, and the expected
completion date, including the maintenance and guarantee period, would be
December 31, 1990. Completion of property sales would occur in 1990. Further
details on the implementation schedule are given in Annex 5.
C. Procurement
4.03     Local competitive bidding procedures are generally consistent with
the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the project. Annex 9
lists several local bidding practices on which clarifications were secured at
negotiations, at which time it was confirmed that these points would be taken
into account and that all procurement would be carried out in accordance with
Bank procurement guidelines.
4.04     Procurement arrangements are suimuarized in Table IV-l.
4.05     Works:  Civil works bidding packages of US$2.5 million or more would
be procured through ICB, and all bidding packages for civil works estimated to
cost US$2.0 million or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation. Four civil works contracts for the development of
the sites ard services schemes aggregating US$28.7 million would he procured
by ICB. Civil works contracts for community buildings (schools, emergency

centers, health clinics, conmmnity centers and womens' training centers) in
the sites and services schemes would be grouped whenever possible into
contracts valued at US$2.5 million or more and would be procured through. ICB.
The contract for the extension of the schools included in the Ruseifa A
component would be negotiated with the contractor who is currently completing
the schools in Ruseifa under UDP1. This extension is estimated to cost US$0.5
million. Due to their size and nature, the upgrading schemes' contracts would
be unlikely to interest foreign bidders, and the four contracts for the
upgrading schemes (aggregating US$3.1 million) would be procured by LCB.
The above arrangements would result in prior Bank review of about 10 contracts
accounting for about 90% of the total estimated value of civil work contracts
for the project. The remaining contracts would be subject to post-review by
the Bank after contract award.
4.06     Goods including equipment, vehicles, tools, machinery, furniture and
fixtures for community buildings would be grouped into seven bidding packages
valued at US $150,000 or more and would be procured through ICB. A margin of
preference equal to 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of imported goods or actual
custom duties and import taxes, whichever is lesser, would be allowed for
domestic manufacturers. Contracts for miscellaneous tools and furniture and
equipment valued at less than US$150,000 (and aggregating no more than
US$650,000) would be procured through LCB, or for items of less than US$50,000
by obtaining price quotations from at least three suppliers.
4.07     Professional services and technical assistance would be procured from
firms and individuals with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank according to the implementation schedule in Annex 7. Services for
design and supervision to be financed with proceeds of the loan would be
procured according to Bank guidelines.
4.08     Land costing approximately JD 6.3 (US$15.8) million would be acquired
by UDD from private owners through direct negotiation or expropriation for
Emir Hassan, Naqab and Um Nowara. The remaining land (45% of the total) is in
Government ownership and would be transferred to UDD at an estimated cost of
JD 1.1 (US$2.8) million. Value of land for social purposes comes to JD 1.4
(US$3.5) million.
D. Disbursements
4.09     Based on the implementation schedule of Annex 5, disbursements would
be made over 6 years, which is consistent with experience of previous Bank
loans in Jordan. There would be provision for US$100,000 retroactive finance
for expenditures made between April 30, 1985, and the date of loan signature
on the extension of the schools at Ruseifa. The loan closing date would be
June 30, 1991.
4.10     The proposed loan would be disbursed on the following basis:
(i) 50% of total expenditures for civil works contracts;



-18-
(ii) 1002 of foreign expenditures, 100l of local expenditures
(ex-factory) and 702 of other local expenditures for furniture,
tools and equipment; and
(iii) 100Z of foreign expenditures for professional services.
4.11 An agreement was reached at negotiations to establish a special account
in foreign currency with respect to items on which the Bank would disburse to
avoid future funding difficulties. The special account would be in an amount
of US$0.6 million (about three-months' expected disbursements in the early
project years), and would be replenished on the basis of regular withdrawal
applications. Applications for replenishments would be supported by
documentation on expenditures from the account acceptable to the Bank, which
would include statements of expenditure for contracts with a value of
US$10,000 or less.
E. Reports, Accounts and Audit
4.12 The UDD has maintained adequate project accounts of UDP1 expenditures.
Accounting formats for project receipts in a form that facilitates analysis of
performance are being utilized. The UDD would prepare quarterly progress
reports and project accounts, including the special account (para 4.11), for
submission to the Bank not later than one month after the end of each
quarter. The form and content of these reports would be broadly similar to
the reports under UDP1, and would incorporate information regarding status of
the LIBRF, special funds, and project-related activities of HB. Costs of
items financed on a grant basis would be separately identified from costs
which would be recovered through property sales. The HB would prepare
quarterly reports showing the status of all its operations relating to UDP1
and the proposed project, with special emphasis on the status of mortgage and
building loans, disbursements and repayments by site for incorporation in UDD
reports.
4.13 Annual reports, including financial statements for the project, examined
by auditors acceptable to the Bank, would be submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the end of the financial year. The financial
statements, In addition to showing the financial results and status of the
UDD, LIHRF and HB's UDD operations as a whole, would provide sufficient
details to enable separate identification of the financial affairs of UDP1 and
the proposed project. The auditors would examine reimbursement claim forms as
well as withdrawals made from the special account against statements of
expeuditure. Auditors' reports would be accompanied by a management letter
which would review the adequacy and operation of the accounting and financial
systems. The HB would also submit to the Bank within six months of the end of
its financial year-end financial statements examined by auditors acceptable to
the Bank.



-19-
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.14 Basic monitoring and evaluation would be carried out through the
quarterly reports to be prepared by the Government. UDD has recently
appointed a monitoring officer whose main task is to improve content and
timeliness of reports to the Director and, as a by-product, external reports.
The need to review the outcomes of UDPl and this project in the preparation of
further shelter projects would provide a strong incentive for monitoring
project results and drawing lessons for future operations. At project
completion, special surveys would be carried out of families and businesses
resident in each site developed under both projects to evaluate the extent to
which the progressive development anticipated under these projects has
actually occurred. The Government also would prepare and submit to the Bank a
Project Completion Report summarizing the experiences gained during
implementation and the extent to which project objectives were achieved.
G. Supervision Requirements
4.15 Bank supervision of the project would require up to 75 man-weeks over
the 5-year period of implementation. Supervision efforts by Bank staff and
consultants would be concentrated in the first 3 years to facilitate a good
start and timely execution of project components. Supervision teams would
variously include an engineer/planner, an economist and a financial analyst.
Fifteen man-weeks are estimated in FY86, FY87, and FY88, 10 man-weeks in each
of the subsequent 2 fiscal years, and 10 man-weeks for preparation of the
project completion report during FY90.
V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MAMAGEMENT
A. Responsibilities for Project Implementation and Operation
5.01 The roles and responsibilities of project agencies would be similar to
the arrangements for UDP 1. These arrangements evolved in the course of
project execution, as experience was gained with different aspects of
implementation. Annex 6D set:s out responsibilities for project execution in
detail.
B. Organization, Management and Finances of Project-Related Agencies
Urban Development Department
5.02 The UDD would be responsible for design and execution of all project
facilities, marketing and beneficiary selection, and coordination of the
various agencies responsible for providing services to the sites. The
organization of UDD has evolved during UDPI, and now comprises five divisions,
respectively, concerned with Community Development, Engineering, Estate
Management, Finance and Administration (Annex 6B). UDD staff now number 109
persons, and this is anticipated to increase to 135 during project execution.
With the exception of the Director-General, all staff are on contract terms.
This provides a useful element of flexibility for an operation that in many
important respects is commercial.



-20-
5.03 The public-sector pay scales that UDD can afford are not competitive for
attracting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced staff with relevant
skills on a permanent basis. Agreement was secured at negotiations that the
UDD would be adequately staffed at all times in terms of numbers and personnel
qualifications. Technical assistance also will play an important part. UDD
made effective use of its technical assistance under UDP1, initially for
direct operational support but increasingly for advising and training staff.
As a result of these efforts, the UDD qualitatively is able to handle most
technical design and supervision tasks in-house, although the scale of
operations requires that outside consultants continue to be retained for
designing community buildings and for supervision work, and that UDD have some
senior advisors to help with management of in-house design work. The UDD also
has developed substantial competency in the social survey and community
development aspects of its work; however, more remains to be done in the areas
of internal coordination, property marketing, and financial management. In
the medium term, technical assistance would be essential for ensuring adequate
UDD performance in these areas, hence engagement of the technical assistance
to provide management advisory services to the UDD (TORs at Annex 8A) would be
a condition for loan effectiveness.
5.04 UDD has taken advantage of training opportunities for required skills
(e.g., in community development, use of micro-computers, local government
finance, etc.). High staff turnover can be expected to continue, however, and
systematic training will be essential for maintaining UDD's capacity to
perform its functions. While a modest provision for overseas training has
been included in the project, UDD also will make use of local institutions and
in-house training. A draft training program including plans to make more use
of local institutions was discussed at negotiations. To ensure continuity in
operating practice, and as an aid in staff training, the UDD would prepare
operational manuals covering all aspects of its operations on an agreed
schedule (Annex 7).
5.05 The UDD was established as a quasi-autonomous department of Amman
Municipality, specifically to implement UDPl. Its finances flow directly from
the Ministry of Planning and the Housing Bank, outside regular municipal
channels. The success of the UDD has been due in no small measure to this
financial autonomy, combined with the competence of UDD staff and the support
by successive Lord Mayors of Amman. The UDD's status may need to -hange,
however, if it were to undertake suelter projects outside the Amman region, as
is now being suggested by Government. This issue will be explored by the
Housing Strategy Study (para 1.10). The Government confirmed at negotiations
that it would keep the Bank informed of its current views on UDD's status.
5.06 Table V-1 shows forecasts of UDD's finarces with respect to costs of and
receipts from property sales under the project. The surplus from the project
to UDD would total 7.4. of costs. Detailed annual cash flow forecasts for the
period, when all loan repayments under the project are complete, are shown in
Annex 3, Tables 4 (for grant elements) and 5 (for property sales components).

L' Low Income Housing Revolving Fund.
Housin& Bank
5.07     In addition to extending construction finance to UDD, the Housing
Bank would be responsible for making mortgage and building loans to
beneficiaries. The Housing Bank has demonstrated that it has the
organizational capability to carry out these tasks. Although the HB has been
successful in raising additional funds from depositors, its profitability has
been mediocre, not least because of poorly performing equity investments and
the need to lend to JHC at low rates. The decline in economic growth in the
Middle East, and lower growth in Jordan's GNP, may also be expected to moderate
the increases in HBs deposits (especially from expatriate Jordanians) and in
demand for loans. Nevertheless, the EB in the past has shown itself to be
resourceful in meeting challenges, and this should continue. (Further details
on the HEB's general organization and finances are given in Annex 6C.)
5.08      The financial arrangements for the project have been designed witth a
view to making housing affordable to the low income target groups while making
maximum use of regular HB procedures (to ensure economy of operation) and



-22-
ensuring that HB can expect a return on its resources employed (to motivate
continued participation by HB in shelter provision for the low-income
population).-L' HB would make construction loans to the UDD at the 8.5%
interest rate it charges for individual loans.-.  HEB would also provide
mortgage loans and building loans to target group beneficiaries in the new
sites and to owners of plots in the upgrading areas for a period of up to 18
years at an interest rate of 8.5%.
5.09      The HB would use funds from five sources to finance its participation
in the project: (a) its own resources, (b) the Social Security Corporation
(SSC), (c) deposits of the LIHRF heLd at HB, (d) the proceeds of the proposed
loan, and (e) the Central Bank (CB).  The cost of EB's own resources is
estimated at 7.1%.3' The SSC loan of JD 1.3 (US$3.3) million would bear
interest at 8.5%. The SSC contribution was estimated as the amount required if
the HB's own funds contribution were to be kept to JD 10 (US$25) million, as
desired by HBE and if all property sales were delayed one year and UDP1
generated no profits for reinvestment in the proposed project. Interest on
LIERR deposits has been assumed at 6% for the forecasts. The proposed Baak
loan is assumed to carry interest of 9.3%, and to be repayable in 15 years,
including 3 years of grace.-' The Central Rank refinancing would be used to
ensure HEB's spread and has been assumed to amount to 25% of the HB's own
resources reinvested in the project and to carry an interest rate of 4.5%. On
the base case, these financial arrangements imply that the maximum amount of
its own funds the HB would invest in the project would be JD 5.7 (Us$14.2)
million in 1987/88, or about 1.2% of its total assets at that time. Shortfalls
in receipts or in reinvestible profits from UDP1 would require a larger HB
allocation. The detailed analysis in Annex 3 demonstrates that the HB would
recover all cos,s of its participation in the project including the costs of
administering mortgage and building loans (estimated at 5% of repayments), and
make a surplus from the project.
1/ The main departure from regular HB procedures in the proposed project is
that RB would lend up _ 90% of the purchase price of upgraded or new
sites, including land, whereas the loan percentage for individual loans is
normally kept below 75% of costs, excluding land.
2/ This rate is charged on loans of under JD 7,000 to families who will occupy
their houses and whose houses are 100 m7 or less. Other rates charged
range from 4.5% on loans to the Jordan Housing Corporation to 11-13%
(including commission) to comercial borrowers or to individuals for large
housing loans.
31 HB pays 5% to individual savings depositors plus a lottery of about 0.25%
equivalent, and higher rates (up to 8.75%) on domestic deposits by
commercial lenders. Additional costs include the cost of the lottery for
savers, the cost of non-interest bearing required deposit reserves, and the
costs of securing and administering deposits (see Annex 3 for more
details). HB pays 4.5% on Central Bank funds on-lent to JEC.
4/ The maximum amount of outstanding HB liabilities to the Bank from UDPl and
the proposed project is estimated at JD 5.7 million in 1987, which would
amount to about 1.3% of total HB assets at that time.



-23-
5.10     Assurances were recei-7ed during negotiations that the RB and the
Government annually would review the appropriateness of project interest rates
in the light of the general level of interest rates in Jordan, the demand for
loans, and the cost of HB's funds, and discuss those reviews and any actions
proposed arising from them with the Bank. It was also agreed that project
interest rates would allow a reasonable spread to BB of about 1.3% (over the
cost of funds, including interest and deposit administration). The amount of
the spread would fluctuate somewhat as the mix of funds employed varied over
time.
Low Income Housing Revolving Fund (LIHRF)
5.11     The Low Income Housing Revolving Fund (LIHRF) was foreseen at the
time of UDPI ac a mechanism to ensure that profits generated from land sales
under UDP1 would be reinvested in low-income shelter projects. Because of the
delays associated with the redesign of UDP1, the operating rules of the LIERF
had not been finalized by the time of the appraisal of this project. Following
appraisal, however, the Government established a management committee for the
LIHRF comprising the Director-General of the UDD, and representatives of the
MOP, MOF, and HB. At negotiations, the Government presented a draft statement
of objectives and operational guidelines. The basic objectives of the LIERF
are (a) to hold surpluses from Urban Development Projects, and (b) to finance
defaults by HB borrowers under Urban Development Projects. The LIHRF would be
managed by the UDD according to budgets and policies approved by the
management committee. The committee also would be responsible for determining
when there is a surplus for transfer from UDD to the LIHRF. Adoption of the
LIHRF objectives and guidelines satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition
for project effectiveness.
5.12     One major LIHRF revenue source would be the default premium of 5% of
repayments by beneficiaries of HB mortgage and building loans. LIERF would be
responsible for defraying actual defaults up to the amount of this fund. From
the beneficiary point of view, the default premium would add another 0.74% to
the HB interest rate, making the effective rate 9.24%. This is above the
rates charged to the beneficiaries of Government housing programs (para 1.07),
and of Social Security Corporation (SSC) individual mortgage loans (6%). With
Jordanian inflation in 1984 at 4.5%, and forecast at 5% per annum in 1985, 6%
in 1986 and 7% in following years, this interest rate is expected to remain
positive in real terms. The 5% default provision is conservative. HB's
arrears record is excellent (fewer than 0.1% of loans in arrears in 1983).
Since the HRB is using identical arrangements regarding guarantors,
verification of borrowers income, etc., in the UDP projects, as in its regular
lending activities, repayment performance should be similar. The exception
concerns bite upgrading, where there is less opportunity for RB to reject
beneficiaries. As of December 1984, however, only four borrowers out of the
177 families making payments on completed UDPI upgraded sites were in arrears.
Vocational Training Corporation
5.13     The Vocational Training Corporation (VTC) provides short courses for
skill upgradinig and initial training in semi-skilled occupations for new
employees, as well as longer-term apprenticeship training combining three days
of on-the-job training per week with three days of instruction. Apprentice-
ship training has been provided for more than six years, and the VTC now has
about 6,000 trainees, of which about 1,500 are enrolled in short courses,



-24-
and 4,500 are in apprenticeships.  The design of training programs for UDP1 is
proving to be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry and of UDD
beneficiaries, and successful performance is therefore expected in this
project.
VI. COST RECOVERY, MARKETING, ADD AFFORDABILITY
A. Cost Recovery
6.01      Table VI-i shows those items whose costs would be recovered from
property sales, and those recovered through normal taxation or tariff
arrangements. Agreement on these arrangements was confirmed at negotiations.
These are similar to the arrangements under UDPl. Recovery through property
sales is discussed below (paras 6.03 and 6.04). The arrangements for recovery
of watez, sewerage, and electricity costs through normal tariffs have been
found to be satisfactory under Bank operations dealing with those sectors.
Assurances were secured at negotiations that UDD and buyers of plots would not
be subject to any fees or charges intended to recover costs that already have
been included in plot prices.
B. Market Considerations
6.02      Project success hinges heavily upon realizing adequate surpluses
from sales of residential and commercial properties at market prices to
cross-subsidize shelter for the low-income target group. Hence, the state of
the Anmman property market, and UDD's skill in marketing its property, will
strongly influence project success. The importance of marketing is underlined
by the size of the UDD program. Over the 1985-1990 period, when all new
accommodation from UDPl and UDP2 will come on stream, new UDP sites are
forecast to accommodate over one-half of the increase in target group families
in the Amman region, and about 17X of the total regional population increase.
By 1990, about 4X of the total Amman region population will be living in sites
upgraded or developed under UDP1 or this project. (Annex 10, Table 5.)
6.03      The Amman property market, which is heavily influenced by the flow
of workers' remittances, has been dampened by the decline in oil prices and
investments in the Middle East. In these difficult circumstances, favorable
prospects for property sales under the project are predicated on the offer of
a unique product affordable to large market segments unserved by existing
private or public programs. Almost 80Z of the new sites would be affordable
to families below the 40th percentile, whereas ownership is not affordable
under other legal schemes to families in the lower half of the income
distribution (paras 1.06 and 1.07). This is possible because the UDP schemes
enable people to buy smaller plots than is possible elsewhere, and because
they provide less than half as many square meters of housing initially as the
other schemes. UDP sites are also attractive since they provide access to a
larger range of infrastructural and social services than most other new areas
accessible to low-income people (para 7.03). These advantages underly the
large interest in UDPI resident'ial plots (12,000 applicants within two months
for 2,130 plots for members of the target group; all "market price" plots in
the first phase of Marka sold at prices above the levels required for cost



-25-
recovery). Demand for commercial plots in UDPI has also been high. Forecast
prices for commercial plots in the pro?osed project, at 3D25-27.5m2, are
significantly lower than the JD 30-35m applicable in other low-income areas.

-26-
6.04    Marketing to date has received less attention by UDD management than
physical design and implementation activities. This partly has been due to
the large market interest, and partly to reluctance for a public organization
to adopt an active and flexible marketing approach, in contrast to the more
staid administrative approach felt appropriate for allocating public
property. A strong marketing effort will be required to ensure that the
project achieves its financial and cost-recovery objectives once initial
demand backlogs are cleared. Understanding was secured at negotiations that
UDD would be given maximum flexibility in marketing techniques, including
using property auctions and estate agents, as appropriate, consistent with its
overall objective of providing shelter for low-income groups without subsidy.
To ensure cost recovery and rapid development of UDP sites, UDD promptly would
seek to dispose of developed land. As an additional mechanism to keep costs
and standards in line with affordable prices, UDD would make a complete
financial and affordability analysis of each site on the basis of the latest
information on market demand and incomes after final engineering cost
estimates became available and before issuing tenders. This reanalysis would
be submitted for Bank review together with draft tender documents.
C. Affordability
6.05    The target group for new sites would comprise families of Jordanian
nationals in the 10th to 40th percentiles of the income distribution. The
Government also wishes to confine the target group to families that have been
resident in the Amman region for the previous 5 years so as not to give undue
encouragement to migration to the capital region. For purposes of assessing
the affordability of plots, it has been assumed that target group families
would be willing and able to pay up to 33% of their monthly incomes on shelter
costs (including utilities and mortgage payments) plus a cash down payment of
1OZ of the plot cost. This criterion is more onerous than the criterion used
under UDPI (housing expenses under 25% of income, 52 down payment). It has
been adopted because (a) about 48 percent of applicants for UDP1 plots have
monthly rental payments and utilities charges of over 30X of their incomes,
(b) people are generally willing to pay more for ownership than tenancy
(partly because inflation can be expected to erode the share of income going
to housing over time), and (c) many applicants for UDPL plots have offered
larger than the minimnm required down payments.
6.06    Plot sizes and houses on cross-subsidized plots have been designed so
as to ensure that plot supply ranked by cost is more or less proportional to
the numbers of families in each percentile of the target group.-L (see
Table VI-2). Agreement was confirmed at negotiations that this criterion on
11 More specifically, all units targetted to beneficiaries would be
affordable to families at the 40th percentile, at least five-sixths of
units would be affordable to families at the 35th percentile, two-thirds
to families at the 30th, one-half to families at the 25th, one-third to
families at the 20th, and at least one-sixth to families at the 15th, and
some units would be affordable to families at the 10th percentile.

the definition of affordability in para 6.05, would be observed when final
plans are made, and that plots in receipt of cross-subsidy would be allocated
to families in these percentiles. If, however, beneficiaries in the target
group request UDD to build housing that would be unnffordable according to the
above criteria, UDD could fulfill such requests if the concerned beneficiaries
first advanced cash payments equal to the regular down payment plus the cost
of the additional prov-sion.  This is desirable to introduce an element of
flexibility in UDD marketing operations, and also to encourage marketing
activities well before construction is complete to minimize interest costs.
By the same token, beneficiary families could purchase plots that would be
"unaffordable' by the above criterion if they increased their down payments so
that monthly payments were affordable. Understanding on these points were
confirmed at negotiations. Further details on affordability calculations and
income criteria are set out in Annex 10.
6.07     In the case of upgrading sites, the monthly mortgage payment to
recover average cost of land and services per plot would come to 15-20S of
median monthly family income, depending on the site. Since there is
substantial multiple-family occupancy, in Emir Hassan in particular, the
payments required per family for acquisition of tenure and installation of
services would be less than this in most cases. Final prices would be
determined on the basis of final designs, taking into account the sizes of
individual plots, the numbers of families residing on them, and opportunities
for cross-subsidy.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. General
7.01     The project would assist the Government of Jordan to provide
affordable shelter, without subsidy, to low-income groups who have been poorly
served by other programs, if at all. As such, the project would increase the



-28-
welfare of a substantial p.oportion of the population, and would do this at
lower economic cost than exicting alternatives. The project would encourage
large amounts of private investment. The value of equity finance used by
householders to construct their own houses, and investments in commercial
properties, none of which would pass through the accounts of project agencies,
is estimated at JD 35 million (1984 prices) within the first three years of
occupancy by householders, and at JD 45 million within 8-12 years.
B. Economic Justification
7.02     Two types of economic analysis have been performed:  first, the cost
of the urbanization pattern represented by UDP-type projects has been
assessed, as compared with the cost of more conventional approaches; second,
economic benefits, costs and the resulting economic rates of return of the
project have been estimated.
7.03     In the absence of UDP-type projects, the principal shelter
alternative for handling increases in households in the target group would be
to rent or buy apartments in D-zone areas, i.e, areas zoned for development of
apartments on plots of over 300m%, typically with fewer services initially
installed than in UDP sites. Because UDP-type projects are expected to reach
their ultimate population densities in 8-12 years, instead of 20 or more years
for D-zone areas, because of more efficient layouts, and because families
secure pubLic services from the beginning rather than having to invest in high
cost private sanitation facilities or purchase water from water sellers
iuitally, UDP-type projects entail much lower land costs, and similar or lower
infrastructure costs (including cost of capital) per family per year. Hence,
UDP-type projects promise savings in urbanization costs, to say nothing of the
unquantifiable gains from more adequate social facilities.
7.04     The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is estimated at
14X, with ERRs for the upgrading and the sites and services components
estimated at 29% and 14%, respectively (Table VII-1). Benefits were estimated
using imputed rental values for beneficiary housing, sales receipts for
residential and commercial plots sold at market prices, and increase in market
value of plots in upgraded areas. Costs included site development, on-site
and off-site infrastructure, on-plot housing construction, and maintenance and
operation of buildings and infrastructure (at 3% of capital costs). Taxes
were excluded from costs and Government land was valued at market prices. No
further adjustments were made to financial costs to arrive at estimates of
economic costs. Although land and rental values are attributable in part to
the proximity of social services,I' the costs of social services were
excluded from the base estimate, since the comparative areas from which prices
were estimated are typically less well served with social facilities than UDP
sites. Inclusion of the costs of social facilities - but without adjusting
for the large non-quantified benefits - would reduce the ERR to 82. A delay
1/ It should be noted, however, that increases in land and rental values due
to the provision of social infrastructure give extremely conservative
estimates of the true benefits of such facilities.

in benefits by one year would reduce the ERR to 12S. Returns from the
upgrading components are more sensitive to benefit delays than sites and
services, since the benefits are measured as an increase in value at one time
rather than a rental over 30 years. Benefits and cost streams include rental
values and costs of expAnsions in housing on the new sites. The importance of
such progressive development is indicated by the decline in ERR on the new
sites from 14% to 9X if there is no housing expansion build-up after year 4
(measured from the date of first occupancy on each site). ERRs are robust
with respect to changes in costs, which would have to be raised by about 29X
to reduce the ERR to 10. Detailed cost-benefit streams and assumptions
underlying the rate-of-return calculations are given in Annex 11.
C. Poverty Impacts
7.05     About one third of initial residents of new sites and about 60X of
beneficiaries of upgrading sites fall within the 26% of the
househe'.ds in the Amman urban region having monthly incomes below the bank
defined urban poverty threshold (para 1.04 and Annex 11). It is estimated
that about 4% of the poverty-group residents of the region would benefit
directly from the project; over one-quarter of the estimated increase in poor
families would live in the project areas. Over 801 of residents in the
upgrading areas and in the new sites would have incomes that place them in the
lower half of the income distribution. The project would have additional
benefits for low-income people by stimulating lower rents than would occur
without the project.

D. Project Risks
7.07     The principal risks facing this project are:
a.  Uncertain marketability of plots in a time of economic slowdown.  To
deal with this risk, heavy emphasis has been placed on ensuring
affordable standards, on monitoring the performance of the UDD in
undertaking a major real estate sales effort, on technical assistance
in estate management, and on establishing a financing scheme with
sufficient flexibility to accommodate possible delays in sales of
commercial properties.
b.   The ability of the UDD, as a public sector organization, to continue
to manage UDD's multi-faceted operations and to continue to innovate
as UDD's rapid growth phase ends, remains uncertain. The greater
emphasis placed on training in this project than in UDPI, and
continued substantial use of technical assistance, are designed to
reduce this risk.
VIII. ASSURANCES, AGREEMENTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     Agreements were confirmed during negotiations on the following:
(a) the National Housing Strategy Study would be completed by December
31, 1986, and Government to discuss housing policy with the Bank
(para 1.10).
(b) Government would discuss the results of special studies with the Bank
(para 2.11 and Annex 7).
(c)  Government would finance any cost over-runs in public sector
components (para 3.06).
(d)  establishment of the special accounts (para 4.11).
(e) UDD would submit quarterly reports, UDD and HB would submit audited
annual accounts on the project and the LIHRF, auditors would prepare
management letters, and Government would prepare a PCR (para
4.12-4.14).
(f) UDD would be adequately staffed (para 5.03).
(g) Government would ensure that HB secured a reasonable spread on funds
lent to the project, and Government and HB would review project
related interest rates annually and discuss required and proposed
actions with the Bank (para 5.10).
(h) UDD and beneficiaries would not be double-charged for any
infrastructural connections the costs of which are included in plot
prices (para 6.01).



-31-
(i) prices would be set so as to recover all costs (para 6.01) and
revised market and affordability analyses would be prepared on the
basis of final engineering costs and submitted for Bank review with
draft tender documents(para 6.04).
(j) UDD would be granted maximum flexibility in marketing so as to
achieve aims of serving target group and securing cost recovery, and
would seek to sell property promptly (para 6.04).
(k) beneficiary plots on new sites would be affordable to, and allocated
to, persons in the 10th to 40th percentiles roughly in proportion to
their numbers; affordability would be based on no more than one-third
of income for mortgage and utilities charges and 102 down payments,
with the exception that UDD could provide beneficiary plots that are
unaffordable according to the basic criterion if the families
concerned pay the additional costs as part of their down payment
(para 6.06).
8.02     Conditions for Effectiveness
(a) engagement of technical assistance for management advisory services
(para 5.03).
(b) formal adoption of objectives and operational guidelines (para 5.11).
(c) execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government,
HB, and the Municipality including undertaking by HB to finance cost
overruns on items whose costs are recovered in property sales
(para 3.07).
8.03     Recommendation
Subject to reaching agreement on the above points, the project is
suitable for US $28.0 million Bank finance on standard terms (15
years with 3 jears of grace), of which US$0.1 million would be
retroactive (para 4.09).

JORDAN
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS
1.0 Proiect Sites
1.1 Jebel Emir Ali: The site of 18.5 ha lies on government-owned land
some two kilometers to the east of Ruseifa within the m.nicipal boundaries and
to the north of the Zarqa/Amman highway. The settlement is well located with
respect to main roads, public transport and centers of employment. The site
is on a slope which steepens severely on its lower side where it drains to a
wadi. There are around 273 residential and 16 non-residential plots, occupied
by 306 (population of 2,504) households. There is room for another 115
residential plots and 26 non-residential plots which will be developed and
sold by the project. Building standards are reasonable, but the project would
correct severe deficiencies in interral access roads and circulation, social
services, water supplies, sewerage and electricity.
1.2 Emir Hassan: This government-owned site of 2.8 ha is reached from
the eastern end of the main commercial street of Marka.  The site is well
located with respect to roads, public transport, social services and
employment opportunities. There are some 305 households (population 1,720)
living on 146 plots. On plot building standards are adequate, but water and
electricity supplies are not available to all households, internal roads and
footpaths are unpaved and badly eroded by rainwater and household effluent,
and sewerage is lackinig. The project would install proper water supply,
sewerage, electricity and roads and footpaths.
1.3 Ruseifa 2A and 2B: The site comprises about 38 ha of a large area of
Government land and is located north of the Yajouz Road between the
Municipalities of Zarqa and Ruseifa. It adjoins the UDPI Ruseifa site which
forms the southern boundary of the site. To the north and east, a dirt road
and vacant Government land forms the boundaries, while the Health Ministry
will build a hospital to the west. The project area spreads over two ridges
with 152-20% slopes to a major wadi running between the two sections of site.
Water will be brought to the site from the main supply along Yajouz road and
via a 0 150 mm main from the water storage reservoir on the UDPI Ruseifa
site. Waste water from the site will eventually be disposed of by gravity
into the Zarqa-Ruseifa interceptor along the major wadi. Since the completion
date of the sewerage scheme is as yet uncertain, communal septic tanks are
proposed initially with the effluent percolating into seepage ditches along
the main wadi. Slopes are adequate to shed surface water away from the
development during the rainy season and due to its topographical



- 33 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 20
characteristics, the site would require no provision of storm water drainage.
Electricity will be supplied from two an site 550 KVA substations to be linked
with the high voltage supply on to the adjoining Health Ministry land. Access
to the site will be via a 12 m width paved road through the western end of the
UDPI site and in the future, from a 30 m right of way and 3/4 km long road to
be constructed by the Government along the northwestern boundary of UDPI to
connect all housing developments in the area to the Yajouz Road.
1.4 Nagab: The site is located at the junction of the Eastern Bypass
with the Zarqa Highway about 1 km north of UDPI Marka site and west of the
upper-Marka Jordan Housing Corporation (JHC) housing project. It is bounded
on the north by the end of the "phosphate lake" and Schneller Refugee Camp,
the JHC housing scheme to the east, and the Zarqa Highway to the southeast and
existing developments to the southwest and west. The site generally slopes in
a southwest to northeast direction to wadis northeast and east, with most of
the site on slopes of about 12% gradient. The area is accessible from the
Zarqa Highway via an existing road provided for a neighboring factory and
surrounding subdivisions. Water will be brought to the site from the
0 200 mm main along the Zarqa Highway, costs for which have been included
in the project. The site will eventually be connected to the new East Marka
Interceptor (scheduled for completion 1987/1988) which will run along the wadi
on the eastern part of the development. If it appears that the schedule will
not be maintained, waste water from the site will be disposed of by means of
four communal septic tanks. Gradients are adequate to shed surface water
during the rainy season to the wadis northeast and east and into the phosphate
lake. The area can also be serviced by electricity from the substations
already constructed in adjoining subdivisions.
1.5 Nowarah: T'he site covers about 50 hectares of privately-owned land
and is located in the southeastern sector of the Greater Amman Region,
adjacent to the southeastern boundary of the UDPI Quweismeh site,
approximately 5 km from Amman town center. Slopes reach up to 20% gradient at
the two high points on the site, but gradually decrease to gentle slopes of
10% to the north and 5% in the eastern part. The site is accessible from the
Yarmouk Road, via a 1.7 km length dirt track which passes under the viaduct of
the Hejaz Railway. This track will be upgraded to form the main distributor
road through the site (30 meter right of way graded with 12 meter wide initial
base course and two seal coats) and to connect the proposed scheme with
Yarmouk Road. A 0 200 mm pressure main will be needed to supply water
from the existing 0 300 mm main of the Quweismeh Municipality water system
located about 1.5 km from the edge of the site. Waste water from the site
will be drained by gravity (0 300 mm, 1.5 km length outfall sewer) into
the Amman-Wadi Um Er Rimiam interceptor along Yarmouk Road. Construction of
this gravity sewer will also benefit the southeastern sector of the UDPI
Quweismeh site by eliminating the need for a pumping station to serve this
area. Electricity to all users and for street lighting will be provided by

ANNEX I
Page 3 of 20
means of three 500 kva substations which will be linked by two 1.8 km long
underground cable to the power supply source on Yarmouk Road. The slopes to
the north and east are adequate to drain storm water from the site towards the
main interceptor culvert along the Yarmouk Road. However, an open lined
channel along the main distributor and a limited storm water drainage system
within the residential areas are required to prevent possible flooding of the
low lying areas due to the large runoff from the catchment area within and
beyond the project boundaries.
2.0 Site Planning PrinciPles
Annex 1, Table 1 sunmarizes the principal planning standards of this
project, and compares them with the standards of UDPI and of current
regulations applicable to other areas.
The design of new sites is based on a hierarchy of roads serving
residential neighbourhoods which are approximately 2.75 hectares. These have
a central open space providing play area, parking and turning. The perimeter
roads to the neighbourhoods are a minimum of 10 m reservation and the internal
access roads are 8.Om wide. To provide a two way reticulation for services
and pedestrian movement 2.5 m footpaths or steps connect the parallel roads at
irregular intervals. A maximum of four of the lowest price plots are served
by these footpaths in a few locations but generally the plots have road
frontage.
Parking is based on 0.1 spaces per household mostly on the road and
is based on projections Of car ownership in the 1980 Amman Region
Transportation Study Report.
Market plots A, B and C will be located on main routes and the
position adjusted within each neighbourhood to suit the route planning.
3.0 Design Brief - New Sites
3.1 Site Planning
-    All housing plots will have direct access to a surfaced footpath
or road.
-    Housing plots not to exceed four in number on any one footpath.
-    Cul-de-sac/parking areas to serve areas within 1)0m radius.
-    Open space to be not less than 6m2 per plot and distributed

3.5 Engineering Design Criteria
3.5.1 Sanitary Sewer Systems
A gravity sewerage system will be provided for all sites with
individual house connections to ensure the collection and disposal of all
waste water. Sewers will be laid under roads and footpaths to facilitate
maintenance, and gradients will be such as to prevent depositing of solids in
sever pipes.
-    Pipe diameters will be a minimum of 200mm for sewers, and 150m 
for house connections.
-    Pipes will be laid at a minimum core 90cm although this cover
will have to be increased under roads to 120cm.
-    Slopes will be sufficient to provide 0.7m/s velocity in the
sewer when flowing full. A minimum of 2% slope will be provided
for house connections and 0.6 - 1% slope for lateral sewers of
200mm diameter.
-    The system will be designed for a maximum velocity of 3.0m/s
with special provisions for energy dissipation at manholes or
for the protection of pipes against erosion.
-    Effluent volumes will be based on the assumption that 80% of the
net water consumption will discharge into the sewers.



- 41 -
ANNEX 1
Page 10 of 20
-    The system will generally be designed for the following peak
flow factors: (where possible the capacity shall be such to
meet 3.00 x the average daily flow)
Peak hourly flow = 2.00 x the average hourly flow
Peak daily flow = 1.50 x the average daily flow
-    Manholes will be located at all changes in grade or alignment
and at a maximum spacing of lOOm. Manholes for deep sewers over
150cm and for sewers 300mm diameter will be of 90cm diameter
precast reinforced concrete. These barrel sectioned units will
be set on cast in place concrete foundations. Manholes for
shallow sewers less than 150cm deep will be of 60cm diameter
cast in place concrete or precast rings. Covers and frames will
be of medium duty gray cast iron for street and footpath
installations. Cast iron manhole steps will only be provided
for manholes over 1.20m deep.
-    Communal septic tanks and seepage ditches will be installed
where a municipal sewer connection is not possible, or as a
temporary measure where sewers are awaited. Infiltration of the
effluent to the soil will be permitted, or in areas where this
proves impossible, trucks would have to transfer the sewage to a
suitable municipal disposal poirt.
3.5.2 Water Supply Systems
A water distribution system using a range of ductile iron and
galvanized pipes between'dia 200mm and dia 25mm will be designed for each new
scheme. House connections will be piped via individual meters to storage
tanks and connection for hydrants will be located at appropriate points on
each site as a safety measure.
-    Design Period - the principal system components will be designed
to satisfy the needs of the area served for 20 years into the
future.
-    Pressure Range - the distribution system will furnish the
necessary flow of water to all points in the system at the
pressure necessary to satisfy requirements for each customer
with a minimum of lOm and a maximum of 70m head at the highest
point. If this is impossible, a different pressure zone will be
made with pressure reducing valves.



- 42 -
ANNEX 1
Page 11 of 20
Water pipes will be laid at a minimum vertical separation of
50cm from sewer pipes, or on opposite sides of the road right of
way.
The system will be designed for the following peak factors:
Peak hourly demand = 1.25 x average hourly demand
Peak daily demand = 1.50 x average daily demand
A one m3 roof water tank will be provided for units to be
built by UDD.
Water consumption is assessed at 100 lcd (This includes 202 for
system losses putting the net consumption at 80 lcd).
The distribution network will be arranged in loops.
Intersectior.. between feeder mains and branch mains will be
valved to minimize the effect of system failures.
-The minimum diameter of main line pipes will be 50m, and that
for house services will be 18 mm.
Ductile iron pipes will be used for all main feeders with l00mm
diameter and above while galvanized pipes will be used for all
distribution mains and house services.
3.5.3 Superstructure Designs
-    The ACI design code will be used.
-    Reinforcement will be ordinary mild steel
fy = 280 N/mm2
fs = 50% fy or 140 N/rm2
-    Concrete will have the following performance: C28 will be 17.5
N.mm2 after 2 days.
-    Hollow core concrete blocks will be used except where bearing
capacity requires solid.
-    Partition walls will be 10cm concrete blocks.
-    Roof slabs will be reinforced concrete of appropriate thickness
and capable of being used as a floor slab when buildings expand
to 2 or 3 storeys.

400 kgmz).
3.5.4 Roads and Footpaths
Roads type A and B construction will be full-width base course
finished with asphalt paving between curbs. Sidewalks to have compacted base
course suitable for subsequent surfacing.
Roads Type C and D construction will be full-width base course
between curbs with seal coat and chipping over area of carriage way for
upgrading by Municipalities to asphalt surface after two years.  Sidewalks
have compacted base course suitable for subsequent surfacing.
All rights of way are to accommnodate underground sewers, water mains,
telephone services and over-head electrical distribution.

4. Provision of Social Buildings
4.1      The social buildings to be provided under the project, and square
meters in each, are listed in Annex I, Table 4.
4.2      The provision of schools, which constitute the majority of social
facilities, has been estimated on the basis of standards established by the
Ministry of Education. The most important standard has been that sufficient
schools will be constructed to allow single shift operation for the initial
population of each site, leaving the option for double shifting or school
expansion as population builds up.

Due to site characteristics, no new schools will be built on the Ruseifa
2A site. Instead, UDP1 Ruseifa schools will be enlarged to Primary +
Preparatory + Secondary level to meet initial provision requirements (the UDPI
Ruseifa boys school will be extended by 1,441 mz and the girls school by
1,410 mZ), to accommodate the initial build up on a double shifting basis.
The costs of this are included under Ruseifa ZA. The remaining school rooms
required will be constructed in the Ruseifa 2B site (see para 4.6 below).

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1. Project Revenue Forecasts
1.1      Sales forecasts bave been made on the assumption that social and
market housing plots will be sold three months following the physical
completion date (Annex 5). A larger delay factor is incorporated in the case
of coznmercial land to take account of the fact that developers may wait for
evidence of settlements before risking their capital, but all commercial land
is sold within 15 months of physical completiou. Table 1 shows number of
potential plots and square meters of commercial land sold, by type, site, and
year.
1.2      Appraisal date average prices per site were escalated by the same
inflation rates as applied to domestic costs. Table 2 shows sale prices in
December 1984 prices, and the inflation factors applied.
1.3      The following selling methods have been assumed:
(i) Social housing: 5% of sales for cash, 95X of sales by way of
mortgage loan for which a 10% downpayment is required, and
monthly repayment of mortgage loans over 16 years at 8.5% p.a.
Repayments were increased by 5% as a default provision.
(ii) Market housing: all sales for cash.
(iii) Commercial land: all sales for cash.
2. Proiect Costs
2.1      Table 3 analyzes annual costs recovered from property sales versus
those items financed by Government grants, according to the following
allocations:

Item                             Allocation Basis Between Grant
Elements and Elements Recover-
able from Property Sales
(a)  social facilities (and associated          - all grants
design costs)
(b)  off site infrastructure                    - all grants
(c)  on plot development                        - all sales
(d) building loans                              - all sales
Ce)  land                                    I - allocation to grant in propor-
tion to land area for
Cf) site peparation                          J   social vs. other land use.
(g) on site infrastructure
- roads over lOm2                     - one half grant, and the
other half as (e) and (f)
- other                               -as (e) and (f)
Ch)  supervision                               - in proportion to allocation of
all civil works costs before
supervision.
Ci) management (including internal design)    - in proportion to all costs
before management.
(j) interest during construction               - all interest paid by UDD on
loans to RB is recoverable.
3. Finance Flows:
3.1     The main text (paras 3.05-3.08 and 5.06-5.12) describes the structure
of the financial arrangements. Details regarding the financial flows
assumptions are given below:
(a) UDD pays interest at 8.5% to HB.
(b)  LIHRF contributes JD 250,000 in each of 1986/7 and 1987/8 from
profits on UDPI.
(b) Cost of HB's "own resources" = 6.45%, made up of cost of own
funds at 7.1S (75% of HB own resources), and cost of Central



- 69 -
AMNEX 3
Page 3 of 12
Bank funds at 4.52 interest (equal to 252 of RB own resources).
Estimated cost of RB's own funds includes interest (5.32), cost
of savers' lottery (0.32), allowance for non-interest bearing
reserves on deposits (0.5X), and administrative and promotional
costs associated with raising deposits (1.02).
(d) The RB loan to UDD is drawn down and repaid like an overdraft.
(e) HB Administration costs on mortgage and building loans are
estimated at 52 of repayments (net of default provision) i.e.,
they are equal to the default provision.
(f) Any LIHERF balances are reinvested in UDP activities by HB, which
would pay 62 interest on LIERF deposits.
(g) Social Security Corporation Loan carries interest of 8.52, and
is repaid over 13 years including 3 years' grace, in equal
annual installments of principal.  Disbursements of SSC loan
were made so as to ensure that the RB contribution in the case
with delayed sales was not larger than JD 10 million.
(h) The World Bank loan disbursements were calculated as 502 of
Civil Works, 80% of equipment, and 33.45S of supervision in
respect of recoverable items, and 39.28% in respect of
supervision for grant items.
[i) Government grants cover domestic cost of social _^cilities and
foreign costs of training and technical assistance related to
those facilities. Costs of all technical assistance allocated
to recoverable items are recovered from UDD by HB.
4. Results
4.1      Tables 4, 5 and 6 set out the base case financial flows for the
social components, the UDD (in respect of property sales), and Housing Bank
(including construction finance, building loans, and mortgage loans),
respectively. On the base forecast, there is a surplus for UDD of about 8.22
over investment costs and of 7.42 over all costs, including interest during
construction. The negative cumulative deficit/payment to LIuRE shown in the
fourth to last row of Table 5 during the early construction period is the
amount of UDD overdrafts to handle interest during construction.



- 70 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 12
4.2      The last row of Table 6 indicates that the RB can expect to recover
all its costs and earn a cumulative surplus of JD 2. million on UDP2 by the
time the last loan is repaid. The spread enjoyed by RB in any year depends on
the mix of funds used. In the base forecast, the sp_-ead starts as 2.0, then
falls to 1.7, 1.1, and 0.9 before rising to 1.1 in the last year of project
execution. It rises thereafter as the Bank is repaid in advance of mortgage
and building loans.
4.3      The "sales delayed case" referred to in the text, which assumes that
investment proceeds on schedule, that all sales are delayed one year, and that
there is no profit from UDPI for reinvestment in UDP2, implies a profit on UDD
operations of 5.1Z of investment costs (and 4.4Z of all costs) (since
inflation at 7S per year in sales prices is less than the interest of 8.52
payable on larger construction loans). Although this unfavorable scenario
would not eliminate the financial viability of the project, it would reduce
resources available for reinvestment in UDP3. In addition, the HB would only
break even over the project period.

JORDAN
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
ORGANIZATION A _INANCING OF THE HOUSING BANK
1.       The Housing Bank of Jordan, a mixed public-private sector institution
operated on a commercial basis with a paid-in capital of JD 12 million (US$30
million), was established by Housing Bank Law No. 4 of 1974 to mobilize
savings from the public to finance the coDstruction of housing for individuals
in all categories, with the emphasis on the low-to middle-income group. It
also lends to housing cooperatives, housing funds, and other housing entities
and takes equity participation in construction related industries and real
estate development projects. The organization of the Bank is given in Table 1
of this Annex. By the end of 1983, the HB had a staff of 981 persons, of whom
205 were university graduates. The Bank maintains an active training program
in its own training center and uses facilities in other Jordanian institutions.
2.       Tables 2 and 3 summarize the Bank's balance sheet and income
statement during the past 5 years and 9 months to September 30, 1984, and
forecasts prepared by HEB for the period up to 1989. Table 4 shows changes in
financial position over the period, and Table 5 sets out various indicators of
past and projected performance. The Housing Bank has grown into the main
savings institution in the country. Its rapid growth has been due to (a) tax
exemption for interest on deposits (private banks pay 45%); (b) government
guarantee of all deposits; and (c) its aggressive savings mobilization
program. Although the RB pays lower interest than several of its competitors
(5% interest versus 6-1/2%), its deposits have grown very rapidly, due to a
lottery scheme (cost equivalent about 0.25% interest), widespread branches (65
by the end of 1983) including mobile ones in remote rural areas, late opening
hours, and active advertising. The Bank's future growth is expected to be
lower than in the past, since the scope for further market penetration is
limited (at the end of 1983 the Bank had 289,000 deposit accounts, compared
with around 370,000 households in the country), and due to lower growth
expected in the region. One notable feature of recent growth has been the
increase in advances from the Central Bank largely associated with increasing
loans to JHC and with refinancing part of HB participations in various
syndicated loans (para 4).
3. In 1983, return on total assets was 7.8%, interest was 4.81, administration
and overheads 2%, and net income 1X. Net income came to 9% of net worth in
that year, and paid half of this in dividends. Low profit levels in 1983 were
due to (a) rapid expansion of new branches, (b) substantial equity investments

not yet generating income and (c) requirements for HB to invest its own
resources in low or negative return housing schemes and equity investments.
Profits started to pick up in the first 9 months of 1984 as income started
coming in from real estate investments.
4.       To maintain and increase its prcfitability levels, the Housing Bank
is successfully encouraging its customers to take commercial (interest of
9-13X, including comhissions) rather than individual (8 1/2S) loans. The HEB
hds also extended its financing to activities with fairly tenuous connections
to housing (e.g. syndicated loans to Royal Jordanian Airways, a major hotel
company, and the Phosphate Mines Company, and loans to government for purchase
of Embassies abroad). Nevertheless, the HB continues to fiunace housing
cooperatives, JHC, and, importantly, private sector real estate finance
companies which are starting to supply houses with mortgage finance to the
upper ends of the market.  Support for low-income groups will be increasingly
through UDP-type programs.

JORDAN - SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DRAFT OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE
UDD ADVISORY SERVICES 1985-1988
1.   Background
1.1       The Urban Development Department (UDD) of the Municipality of Amman
(AM) is in the course of implementing a First Urban Development Project (UDPI,
to be completed by the end of 1986) and is commencing detail design of a
Second Urban Development Project (UDP2) to be implemented between 1985-1990.
The project is expected to be funded by the Government of Jordan, the Housing
Bank, the Social Security Corporation and the World Bank. UDP2 includes
construction and marketing of low-cost new housing development schemes for
low-income families in four sites, two slum improvement schemes, training for
UDD staff and several policy studies. The UDD, established in 1980, now has a
staff of about 109 persons and this is expected to increase to about 135 in
1985 in order to manage both UDPl and UDP2. In the course of UDP2, the UDD is
expected to become a national organization, and to be given an important role
in implementing Government housing policies. This will be defined following
completion of the National Housing Strategy Study, to be carried out in
1985/86.
1.2       During the life of UDD, the agency has had a number of technical
advisers in such fields as architecture, urban planning, social development,
engineering, accountancy, financial and housing management and institutional
planning. These inputs, together with training courses and programmes, have
assisted UDD's divisions - Engineering, Population Affairs, Finance, Estates
Management and Administration - in undertaking the many tasks involved in the
design and implementation of UDPl. The existing technical assistance
consultants to UDP1 (Holcrow Fox and Associates and Jouzy and Partners) have
assisted UDD in the design of UDP2, and have been retained until mid-1985 both
to assist UDD in the detailed engineering design and production of tender
documents for the first UDP2 schemes at North Ruseifa (sites and services) and
Emir Hassan (upgrading), and to continue to advise on UDP1 to that time. The
UDD wishes to engage an international consultancy firm to provide advisory
services in project design and management, starting in the second half of 1985.
2.   Objectives
2.1       The objectives of the consultancy are to:
(a)  Assist the UDD engineering division to (a) prepare designs in house
for UDP2, (b) supervise consultants designing social buildings,
(c) manage tendering procedures, and (d) supervise construction
contract execution;

and implementation of UDP2, identification of possible future operations, and
carrying out studies under the project.
3.2       The consultants will oversee the drafting of the operational manuals
for UDD functions (the List of manuals and dates is annexed).
3.3       At least six times per year, the consultants will organize a two
hour seminar to cover the performance of some aspect of UDD operations in the
preceding year in terms of relationships among objectives, progress, and work
remaining. The seminars will cover problems of methodology and techniques.
To the maximum extent possible, topics will be introduced by UDD staff.
3.4       The consultants will also mount at least two one-day workshops
during the course of the consultancy on each of the following topics:
(a) site identification and design;
(b) feasibility analysis of upgrading and sites and services projects
(including affordability, financial and economic analyses);
(c) monitoring all aspects of project execution (including integration
of physical and financial monitoring and feedback into marketing
activities) to ensure project viability in a context of changing
events; and
(d) marketing (to target group beneficiaries as well as other
individuals and private sector developers).

JORDAN SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STUDY TO PREPARE A THIRD URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DRAFT OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE
1. Background
1.1      The Urban Development Department (UDD) of Amman Municipality has
designed and is implementing the First and Second Urban Development Projects
(O P1 and UDP2). Finance and administration of the mortgage and building
loans components of the projects are being undertaken by the Jordan Housing
Bank. Other finance has come from the Government (for the public sector
infrastructures and social services), the Social Security Corporation, and the
World Bank. UDPI and UDP2 are designed to provide shelter for low-income
families on a full cost recovery basis in the Anman region. They have
innovated and secured market acceptance of design standards which are more
affordable than previous standards, and are making possible a better standard
of living for low-income persons than was previously possible. The last new
housing units to be provided under UDP2 will be occupied in early 1990.
1.2      The Government now wishes to formulate a follow-up program to UDP1
and UDP2 which would: (a) provide more low-income shelter in an efficient
fashion in the A-man region; (b) develop low-income shelter projects in other
parts of Jordan; and (c) maximize the role of the private sector in provision
of low-income shelter through providing appropriate legislative,
administrative and financial measures to enable the private sector to adopt
standards and procedures innovated by the UDD. (More details to be provided
when UDD has been made a national organization, and when the Gover sent has
taken decisions on the National Housing Strategy Study).
2. Obiectives
2.1      The main objectives of the study are to:
(a) identify, and assess the feasibility of, a program of policies and
investments to meet the demand for low-income shelter during the
period 1990-1993 inclusive;
(b) make detailed designs and implementation plans, including assistance
with drafting relevant legislation and regulations. -

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AMMAN QUARRIES STUDY
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
1. Introduction
1.1 Amnan has expanded eastwards and southwards beyond a series of
quarries, now largely worked out and abandoned, which cover a substantial
area, particularly along the Jerusalem Road, the link from Jerusalem Road to
Wahdat, the Yarmouk Road and in the corridors linking eastwards to Nowarah.
Substantial investment by Government is taking place in the road systems, low
cost housing, and support infrastructure of this area. The old quarries
remain unsightly, sometimes dangerous and unstable. They are unrealized
assets, often in good potential commercial or industrial development
locations. The quarries and adjacent spoil areas cover some 100-150 hectares,
and may have a real estate value of JD 10-20 million. The Municipality of
Amman intends to engage consultants to examine the feasibility of a land
reclamation and redevelopment programme for these areas.
2. Objectives
2.1  The objectives of the Study are to:
(a)  identify development alternatives for the quarries; and
(b) to prepare full feasibility studies for alternatives which appear to
be viable, in a form suitable for securing finance from Jordanian or
international sources.
3. Scope of Work
3.1 The following scope of services is divided in two phases.
Phase 1 (4 months)
3.2. The surveying and mapping at scale of 1/1000 of all quarries within
the study corridors in terms of levels, geological and soil
conditions, use, stability, boundaries, adjacent uses, and ownership
and leases (extending into phase 2).
3.3 A survey of owners, operators and other bodies as appropriate in
order to determine the restraints to more beneficial use.

ANNEX 8C
Page 2 of 3
3.4 Identification cf alternative uses for each quarry, together with
preliminary assessment of their financial, economic, and technical
feasibility, and recommendation on a program for the quarries, in
terms of preferred alternatives and phasing. These analyses shall
include an evaluation of demand for land in these areas, as well as
engineering studies. Recommended schemes should all involve at least
full cost recovery in real terms using market rates of interest, with
no net drains on the Government or municipal budgets. The cost
estimates shall include the full costs of making good the areas (wall
stabilization, clearance, terracing, and grading of floor and spoil
areas, removal and disposal of out-worn structures, plant, machinery,
etc.), as well as costs for access roads, service connections and
landscaping works.  Recommendations should be made on provisions for
immediate security or control required, and compensation and
demolitions policy.
3.5 The analysis should include an examination of the tenure, legal, and
institutional problems and possibilities involved in achieving the
re-use of the quarries. This examination must encompass the private
as well as governmental sector, make irnstitutional proposals for
consideration, and encompass policy initiatives as well as physical
proposals.
3.6 An interim report which covers items 3.2-3.5 and proposes a costed
programme of action, with suggested priorities.
Phase 2 (7 months)
3.7 Following Government review of the Phase 1 report, and decision on
the program, the consultants will provide detailed proposals for the
first phase of the programme. These will include:
(a) preliminary engineering, landscape, and planning designs and
drawings for each scheme within the first phase programme;
(b) full cost estimates for the first phase including separate
estimates of foreign, local and tax elements and physical and
price contingencies in a form suitable for review by
international financial agencies;
(c) a programie of works including recommendations on scheduling of
bidding and construction;
(d) institutional and legal proposals for project implementation.
(e) the consultants' design brief for detailed engineering design
and tender documents production;

4. Resource Input
4.1 An estimated 75 man months will be required (the initial contract
will involve a fixed price for Phase 1; the amount for Phase 2 will be
determined on the basis of man-month rates agreed initially, plus a negotiated
agreement on phase 2 man-month requirements at the conclusion of Phase I).

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STUDY ON AMMAN SQUATTER AREA UPGRADING PROGRAM
1. Background
1.1      There are several areas in the Amman Region with inadequate services
which are potentially suitable for upgrading and tenure regularisation in
order to improve services for poorer elements of the population, to regularize
development patterns, and to improve the municipal tax base (Table 1).  With
one or two exceptions, these sites are not suitable for the full range of
upgrading activities carried out under the first and Second Urban Development
Projects.  Nevertheless, there would be gains from pursuing tenure regulari-
zation and completion of services in a more orderly fashion than is likely
under existing arrangements.  In some cases, relocation and redevelopment may
be the most efficient medium term solution. To the extent possible, it would
be desirable for private owners to upgrade settlements on private land with
minimum public sector intervention. UDD will carry out an in-house study,
with assistance of its advisors, to develop a program to deal with these areas.
2. Obiectives
2.1      To prepare a program for upgrading those areas in the Amman region
which are still subject to squatting or illegal tenure, including design,
investment, institutional and financial aspects of the program.
3. Scope of Study
3.1      The study would review and update existing data on the location,
size, tenure, population, and services available in the existing squatter
areas, together with existing plans for their improvement.
3.2      An initial assessment will be made of the feasibility of upgrading
these areas, and preliminary recommendations made regarding the scope of works
which should be carried out (by the public and/or the private sector) in each
area, including recomnendations on areas for which no action is proposed. The
analysis should take account of (a) likely costs, (b) benefits, and (c) the
opportunity to secure cooperation of the owners. Opportunities to achieve
full cost recovery from beneficiaries and landowners will be a major criterion
in assessing feasibility.
3.3      The study will examine the staffing, administrative and budgetary
requirements to manage the program, and make recommendations regarding
staffing, institutional responsibilities and financing. Every effort will be
made to define a programme which is self-financing (including recovering costs
of administrative staff from beneficiaries).

4. Resources
4.1      The study will be carried out during 1986 by a team comprising staff
from each TDD department and the advisors.  Total manmonths required are
estimated at 10. (The manpower input may increase if it is decided to have
UDD review upgrading requirements in municipalities outside the Amman region.)

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STUDY ON ENHANCING WOMEN'S PRODUCTIVITY
OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE
1. BackRround
1.1      One objective of urban projects is to improve productivity of women
resident on UDP sites. This may be done through removing some of the
constraints to their employment by providing training, reducing the diffi-
culties associated with travel and improving the convenience of other
services, such as water supply and health facilities.  Additional factors
affecting women's employment may include the lack of alternative child-care
arrangements and cultural opposition to women in some fields of work.
1.2      It is necessary to assess the importance of different constraints in
refining programs to deal with women's productivity. For example, if
child-care is a major constraint to work outside the home, ways to overcome
this constraint need to be explored. If working outside the home is difficult
for cultural reasons, income-earning opportunities appropriate for pursuit at
home, or in centers or informal women's groups, need to be identified. Credit
and knowledge inputs need to be assessed. The market for handicrafts and
items for local use (e.g., commercial enterprises serving the community), the
availability of jobs in industry or offices, skill requirements for these jobs
and existing training programs all need to be taken into consideration.
2. Objectives
2.0      The objectives of the study would be:
(i) to identify the opportunities for increasing the productivity of
women's activities (including the identification of new areas of
activity), both inside and outside the home, with particular
emphasis on income-generation, by identifying constraints and
means for overcoming them; and
(ii) to design programs that can be put into effect in the context of
UDP operations within the implementation period of UDP2.
3. Scope:
3.1      Identify possible employment opportunities for women through review
of existing surveys on employment, education and training, government manpower
policies, etc. This would include the investigation of gaps in employment or
i



- 107 -
ANNEK 8E
Page 2 of 3
in skills because of migration of males out of the country. Identify
constraints to credit and information by reviewing existing programs and
policies (advertising, collateral requirements, etc.).
3.2      Structured survey interviews with beneficiary women, including
representative samples of Ci) female heads of households, (ii) older women,
(iii) girls of secondary school age, (iv) single women, (v) married women
engaged in various types of income-generating activities, and (vi) married
women not engaged in such an activity. The surveys would seek information in
the following areas:
(a) attitudes towards employment and income-earning (for themselves
and other women),
(b) their existing income earning activities,
(c) their access (or per_< ved access) to credit,
(d) their aspirations for employment,
(e) their perceived constraints in termc of type of job, work hours,
transportation, child-care, societal norms, etc., and
(f) their perceived needs for (i) increased practical skills to
improve or diversify their work outside the market-place (i.e.,
food preparation, home construction, decoration or repair,
furniture-making, sewing, etc.); (ii) additional formal
education (literacy, nnmeracy, other technical courses, etc.);
and (iii) marketable skills.
3.3      Assess the market for the desired skills through interviews with
people involved in training and education, with planners, and with potential
employers; identify possible markets for handicrafts through interviews with
wholesalers and retailers; and assess the potential for small businesses or
groups of such businesses witbin the comnimnity (bakeries, retailing of
groceries, stationery, etc.).
3.4      Propose appropriate training and support programs (the formation of
co-operatives or other groups as appropriate, access to information, credit,
child-care, etc.) identified by the above reviews.
3.5      Following decisions on programs, prepare detailed proposals for
implementation including staffing, costs and financing, agency
responsibilities, etc.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ANALYSIS OF AFFORDABILItY
1.    Income Distribution
1.1   Table 1 shows the Amman income distribution. based on the survey carried
out in 1979 for the Amnan Region Transportation Study, and updated to December
1984 prices by the cost of living index. This procedure makes no provision
for increases in real incomes over the period, or changes in the distribution
of incomes, and so probably tends to understate rather than overstate incomes
of persons at the lower income levels. The table also shows the distributions
of incomes of families in the two UDP2 upgrading sites according to household
surveys carried out in comnection with the project feasibility study. Tne
income estimates should be treated with some caution. It has been noted that
income collected in surveys of potential UDP1 beneficiaries are often somewhat
lower than those given by the same beneficiaries at the time they apply for
loans. It is also the case that many households are able to gather resources
from other family members or to make use of savings (often accumulated during
temporary labor abroad) so they can make larger than minimum doynpayments and
in fact afford more expensive accommodation than implied by their income alone.

2.    New Sites
2.1   Table 2 shows the beneficiary plots by site and type, together with the
affordability calculations. (The plot types are more fully described in
Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3). Cross subsidy (column 5) is the same percentage of
unit cost (column 4) (which includes cost of land, infrastructure, and
U4D-built provision) plus building loan (column 9) for each plot type.  For
purposes of the affordability calculation, costs have been estimated at
December 1984 prices including physical contingencies and interest during
construction.  Sale price (column 7) equals plot price plus subsidy.  Down
payments (column 8) are 0l of plot price. The building loan and building
material loan amounts (column 9) represent the cost to beneficiaries of either
contracting housing construction, or purchasing materials and constructing
themselves.  Labor is estimated to account for 45Z of construction cost in
these calculations. The cost of using small contractors is estimated at 70X
of the cost of UDD-built construction of similar facilities. The monthly loan
repayment (column 10) is the equal monthly installment to retire the price of
plot less deposit, plus building loan, over 18 years at 8.5S interest, plus a
5% provision for default. Other monthly charges (column 11) are water and
electricity charges. Column 13 shows the minimum monthly income required to
afford the option shown, if shelter charges are 331 of monthly income. Column
14 shows the percentile to which these required incomes correspond. Table 3
shows the plots ranked in order of affordability (text para 6.05).
3.    Upgrading Sites
3.1   Assessing the affordability of upgrading projects is complicated by the
existence of multiple family and renter households and the fact that each
plot, and the situation of each family, is unique. In Emir Hassan, 114 out of
305 households were all male, basically foreign worker tenants. Overall,
there were over two households per plot. In Jebel Emir Ali, there were 306
households occupying 273 plots. Accurate assessment of affordability to
individual families will only be possible once detailed surveys have been done
of individual plot areas, and arrangements for tenure transfer have been
worked out taking account of the preferences and situation of the occupants of
each plot. The figures available at this stage are, however, sufficient to
conclude that viable schemes can be implemented. Specifically, costs were
estimated in the same way as for new sites, owners were assumed to pay a price
equal to average cost per plot (financing 901 of costs at 8.51 interest over
18 years), and monthly charges were compared with monthly family incomes.
Table 4 shows that the average monthly repayment (including 5% default
provision) would come to about 151 of median family income in Emir Hassan, and
191 in Jebel Emir Ali, and to 331 and 411 respectively of family incomes at
the 10th percentiles in those two communities. This approach is conservative,
since in most cases more than one family will contribute to costs (directly or

from market sales in the case of Jebel Emir Ali. It should also be noted that
there will be considerable differentiation of plot prices depending upon plot

JORDAN SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUAT1ON
1. Costs and Benefits of UDD Development Pattern
1.1 For purposes of assessing the economic efficiency of the UDP pattern of
development, the feasibility study for the proposed project included a
comparison of the costs of urbanizing new land in the D-zones, which are the
lowest cost developments legally allowed and hence the most competitive with
UDP for low-income occupants, and the costs of urbanizing land following UDP
standards (Annex 12, Document A4, Appendix B). The major differences between
D-zones and UDP sites include: (a) the minimum legal plot size in D-zones is
300mz as compared with-UDD sites where plot sizes (in UDP2) range down to
112.5 m2; (b) D-zones are in fact developed to max-mize areas for sale,
minimizing areas for public services and circulation. In the two D-zones
surveyed for this study, 752 and 80% respectively of land was devoted to
residential use, 252 and 172 to circulation, and 0 and 22 to public use. A
typical UDP scheme has 50-65S residential, 25-351 for open space and
circulation, and 15-25S for public use and up to 10 for commercial and
workshop use; and (c) although ultimate numbers of housing units per hectare
are similar in the two types of development, and numbers of households
increase over time in both types of development due to progressive
construction, the buildup is slower in D-zones since (i) they lack the initial
UDP sales effort and attractiveness arising from availability of services and
(ii) it takes longer for low-income households to complete development (for
renters, other fAmily members) on a plot of 300-400 square meters as
contrasted with under half that area on a UDP site. In D-zones, initial
households normally purchase water from water sellers, and install septic
tanks, and have poor access to transport infrastructure, schools, and other
social facilities; these def.ciencies only disappear as densities increase.
1.2.     The basic assumptions underlying the comparison were based on:
(a) an analysis of development patterns and costs in two D-zone areas with
similar locations relative to main population centers as the UDD sites, and
(b) forecasts of the buildup of population in UDD sites together with costs
estimated for the proposed project. The family buildup estimates are as
follows:

1.4      The lower cost of land in the UDD case is due entirely to the quicker
development of UDD sites. Infrastructure costs are comparable in spite of
earlier provision under UDD due largely to the fast population build up, and
to the installation from the beginning of public facilities with no initial
reliance on higb cost individual facilities.
2.      Estimates of Economic Rates of Return
2.1     The estimates underlying the economic rates of return are set out
below. Tables 2 and 3 show samples of the streams of benefits, costs and net
benefits for the sites and services and upgrading respectively. Other flows
are in the project file.
2.2     Basic Assumptions
1. Price level: December, 1984
2. Land values:
(a) Costs to UDP are entered into the financial forecasts-
(b) Land prices are used for costs (price without the project) and,
where appropriate (see paras 2.4.1(a) and 2.4.2(a) below), for
benefits (price with the project). These estimates are
su-marized in the table.
3.  Horizon:  30 years
4.   Scrap value:  none
1/ For purposes of comparability, identical costs of raw land were assumed.
(JD 6 per gross MH).  The net:gross ratio was assumed at 75S for UDP and
802 for D-zone, hence prices on a net basis were JD 7.5 per square meter
for D Zones and JD 8 per square meter for UD?.
21 In addition to public infrastructures, includes costs of site preparation,
privately provided septic tanks, water from tankers and electricity from
generators (at an extra cost of JD 8 and 4 per month, respectively, over
regular tariffs) in the case of D-zone development up to the date at which
public services are provided. (Roads are installed in years 2 and 5 after
initial occupancy in the inner and outer suburbs, respectively, access
roads in years 8 and 20, sewerage in years 4 and 8, and water and
electricity in year 3.)

2.3      Cost Estimates
1.   Economic Costs: Apart from land, financial costs. including physical
contingencies, and excluding estimated taxes and interest during
construction, were estimated to equal equal economic costs- Housing
construction costs financed with owner's equity were added to costs
financed by the project.
2.   Maintenance Costs:  3f  of initial cost of infrastructures and social
facilities. This imparts a conservative bias to the forecast to the
extent that operating costs are in fact recovered out of
taxes/charges not included or reflected in land rents/prices.
3.   Allocation of joint infrastructure costs between recoverable and
grant elements was done on the basis of the land areas devoted to
each.
4.   SuPervision Costs:  were allocated among recoverable/grant components
on the basis of investment costs excluding costs of land.
5.   Allocation of Manatement Costs:  Total management costs were
allocated among sites on the basis of the total investment costs in
each site and then distributed over the years in proportion to costs
of each site; management costs were further allocated between
recoverable and grant items in individual sites on the basis of the
total cost of each.

2.4.    Benefits Estimates
1.  Upgrading areas:
(a) price of land with the project (para 2.2.2.(b) above)



-122-
ANNEX 11
Page 6 of 10
(b)     Utilities Cost Savings:  an additional benefit would accrue
from replacement of private water sellers (expenditure of JD
10 per household per month) and electricity sellers
(expenditure of JD 8 per household per month) by public
services (with monthly household costs of JD 2 for water and
JD 3 for electricity in Jebel Emir Ali). Of the saving to
consumers of JD 13 per month, JD 8 is estimated to represent
cost saving, and is included in benefits for this site.
2. Sites and Services:
(a) Target Growp Plots: rental per room (excluding bath and
kitchen) of JD 20/per month. This estimate was based on
observed rentals of JD 10 to JD 30 per room for low income
housing let since 1978. Numbers of rooms were assumed to be
built up approximately as household buildup (see para 1.2 of
this Annex).
(b) Other plots: market price with the project (para 2.2.2(b))
above)
3. poverty Estimates
3.1      The poverty level was estimated as follows:
GNiP 1983                                    JD 1848.0 million
Population 1983                                     2.5 million
GNP per capita:                               JD 739.0
GNP 1984: (Real GNP up 4S; prices up 4.5X)  JD 2008.0 million
Population                                          2.6 million
GNP per capita in 1984                       JD 772.0
GNP per capita in 1984 December, 1984
(Prices up, say, 21)                       = JD 788
3.2      Urban poverty level defined as 25Z more than rural level defined as
25S of GNP per capita, i.e., 31.251 of GNP per capita = 3D 246.25 or JD 1675
per family per annum, or JD 140 per family, per month. This is a high
estimate of the poverty level, since the GNP figure includes remittances of
workers who are absent for more than one year, and which should therefore be
included in transfers rather than factor income. A sound basis for making the
adjustment is not, however, available.

3.3      The percentage of families in poverty is drawn froa the survey for
Aanan region income distribution in Table 1 of Annex 10 above. To the extent
that families at the bottom of the income distribution enjoyed increases in
real incomes over this period, the number of the poor is overstated for this
reason as well.
