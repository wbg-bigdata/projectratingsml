                         pupils. As of today, the target has been exceeded (99 percent versus 70 percent of schools receiving installments). Thanks to the rehabilitation of 17 kms of urban roads in Kinshasa
                         (works under Lots 1 and 2 ), more than 640,000 people living in isolated neighborhoods were provided with access to all-season roads. A third lot of 22kms is underway. Under the
                         urban roads component, it is likely that the target will be met (40 km of urban roads rehabilitated). With regards to the malaria component, the number of people benefiting from bed
                         nets is 1,090,000 compared to a goal of 1,010,000; the target is therefore exceeded (65 percent versus 60 percent of children under five sleeping under bed net).
