                         Significant results have been achieved on the ground.
                         Rehabilitation of urban roads: About 25 km of roads in Kinshasa have been rehabilitated allowing 640,000 people living in isolated neighborhoods to have access to all-season roads.

                         10.8 km of urban roads rehabilitated have resulted in a better flow of traffic and allowed up to 62,000 inhabitants to have access to all-season urban roads. Besides, populations living
                         in the neighborhoods targeted by the urban road program are no longer subject to flooding, a key issue these were facing before the works. Works for 13 km of roads are ongoing
                         and are expected to be completed by the end of April.
                         Support to Education: Significant results have already been achieved under the project: 26,141 schools received payments for select recurrent, non-salary expenditures (“frais de

                         fonctionnement? and “frais d’intervention ponctuelle?) for an amount of US$ 45 million; this has positively impacted the learning conditions of over 13 million pupils.
                         Malaria reduction: The number of people benefiting from bed nets in Kinshasa is 1,090,000 compared to a goal of 1,010,000, exceeding the original target (65 percent versus 60
                         percent of children under five sleeping under bed net). Some 2,800,000 bed nets have been distributed in the Bandundu province benefiting more than 5 million people.
                         Water and sanitation: Works to expand the distribution network from the recently-rehabilitated Lukaya water treatment plant (in the Western part of Kinshasa) have been completed
                         and will enable 150,000 people living in low-income Kinshasa neighborhoods to have access to safe water, once the network starts functioning.
                         The disbursement rate is at 90 percent for the initial project and at 48 percent for the additional financing (mainly due to the fact that the school operating expenditures have not yet
                         been paid).
