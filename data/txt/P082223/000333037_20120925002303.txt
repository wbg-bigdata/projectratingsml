2.      The project continues to implement well and is likely to achieve its Project
Development Objective (PDO). Progress toward achievement of PDO is currently rated
as satisfactory and the overall Implementation Progress is rated as moderately
satisfactory. All project activities are likely to be completed prior to the Loan closing date
of December 31, 2012. The Additional Financing portion of the loan has disbursed 54
percent, with an additional withdrawal application for EURO 0.3 million being
                                                  3
processed. The most complex International Competitive Bidding (ICB) tenders for the
procurement of three information systems have now been committed with contracts
signed in May 2012. The systems are expected to be fully functional in October 2012.

3.      The Ministry of Health has introduced several primary health care reforms,
supported by the Montenegro Health System Improvement Project. These reforms have
included the introduction of a “Chosen Doctor? model where primary care patients are
registered with a particular primary physician, who acts as a gatekeeper to reduce over-
reliance on specialists and hospital care. Family medicine trainings and a specialization
have been introduced, and at the same time, the financing of primary care doctors has
changed from salaried to a combination of capitation and fee-for-service. At the
secondary and tertiary levels, the project is supporting the implementation of several
instruments and tools to improve performance and efficiency, including a new basic
package of services based on the epidemiological profile of Montenegro and the
introduction of a Health Technology Assessment and cost benefit analysis to update the
clinical guidelines. In addition, the sector is piloting a DRG (diagnosis related group)
payment system to change from current historic budgets of hospitals to an output-based
financing system.

4.     At the request of the Minister of Finance by letter of September 14, 2012, the
proposed reallocation is necessary to complete the reconstruction of the Primary Health
Center (PHC) in Bijelo Polje. The original value of this contract amounted to EURO
2,679,328.39 to be financed as follows: IBRD Loan (EURO 1,000,000); Health Insurance
Fund of Montenegro (EURO 800,000.00); Directorate for Public Works of Montenegro
(EURO 555,000.00); and the Municipality of Bijelo Polje (EURO 324,328.40).

5.     However, additional works were needed during civil works execution. This was
mainly due to the reconstructive nature of the works on the facility built in 1957 as well
as to some deficiencies in the original architectural design. The structure of the cost
overruns under Category (2) of EUR 484,876.92 is the following: Additional works for:
(a) the continuation of the reconstruction of the facility for an amount of EURO
330,015.30; and (b) the deficiencies in the original architectural design for an amount of
EURO 154,861.62.

6.     The procurement plan cost estimation for some activities to be financed out of
Category (1) were higher than the final contracted values, therefore, this reallocation does
not entail cancellation of the originally planned activities. The reallocation does not
negatively impact the Project Development Objectives.
