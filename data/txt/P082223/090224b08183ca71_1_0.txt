                         The project is achieving its PDOs. 7 out of 10 PDO indicators were fully achieved (PDOs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9), 3 PDOs indicators were partially achieved (6, 8 and 10 - in the case of
                         indicator 10 the Public Health Institute will adjust the denominator to exclude children with residence outside Montenegro).
                         Ministry of Health stewardship of the health system improved and adopted: i) a Health Development Master Plan 2010-2013, and ii) a new Law on Record Keeping in Health adopted,
                         in addition the Law on Health Care and the Law on Health Insurance were amended. A new Strategy for Quality Assurance approved in Feb 2012 and 11 Clinical Protocols and

                         Guidelines being implemented. The health service delivery have improved increasing utilization, reducing waiting time and increasing patient satisfaction. and the expenditures in the
                         sector were stabilized.

                         The original credit disbursed 98 percent of Credit proceeds, while the Additional Financing portion of the loan has disbursed 54 percent, with 96 percent of the remaining balance of
                         the loan committed. Of these commitments, many activities are completed and the remaining activities will be completed by project closing.

                         With the support of Project activities, the Ministry of Health has introduced several primary health care reforms, supported by the Montenegro Health System Improvement Project.
                         These reforms have included the introduction of a “Chosen Doctor? model where primary care patients are registered with a particular primary physician, who acts as a gatekeeper to
                         reduce over-reliance on specialists and hospital care. The capacity building plan for the Medical faculty is completed and the Family Medicine additional specialization program is fully
                         implemented with the first cohort ready to get certified. Mentors and educators have been trained in additional specialization and the Medical Faculty already has the tools and
                         material to launch basic specialization. The new residents who are supposed to start residency (basic specialization) during school year 2012/13 school year are being enrolled.
                         At the same time, the financing of primary care doctors has changed from salaried to a combination of capitation and fee-for-service. During the original credit, 10 primary health care
                         centers (PHC) were rehabilitated and equipped and an additional PHC reconstructed in Bijelo Polje with the AF.

                         At the secondary and tertiary levels, the project has supported the implementation of several instruments and tools to improve performance and efficiency, including a new basic
                         package of services based on the epidemiological profile of Montenegro, the development of 10 new clinical guidelines, the implementation of a National Drug Agency and the
                         introduction of a Health Technology Assessment and cost benefit analysis to update the clinical guidelines. In addition, the sector is piloting a DRG (diagnosis related group) payment
                         system to change from current historic budgets of hospitals to an output-based financing system. The project also supported Hospital information system in 7 general hospitals, and
                         three IT system at the National Drug Agency, the Public Health Institute and the MoH.
                         In addition the Project supported the Secondary and Tertiary Care Reform Strategy, currently approved. This reform includes legislative framework for entering into public private
                         partnerships in health, allowing the Health Insurance Institute to fully implemented throughout the country contracts with private dentists, cardiologists, ophthalmologists, physical
                         medicine and rehabilitation, X-ray diagnostics, ultra sound diagnostics, fertility services, internal medicine, hyperbaric oxygen treatment, cervical cancer screening, opticians, and
