1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Montenegro Health System Improvement project was approved on June 8, 2004. The credit
was signed on June 11, 2004 and became effective on December 1, 2004. The US$15.2 million
equivalent of donor financing included US$7.0 million equivalent credit from IDA, US$0.82 million
grant from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), US$0.45 million grant from the
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD), and an Additional Financing (AF) of US$7.2
million equivalent loan from the IBRD.

2.      The Additional Financing (AF) to the Project, of Euro 5.10 Million (US$7.2 equivalent), was
approved in November 2009, with a closing date of December 31, 2012. The additional funds were to
scale-up project original activities to enhance its development impact.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

3.       Country and Sector background. At project appraisal in 2003, the Republic of Montenegro was
part of the constitutional union State of Serbia and Montenegro, established in February 2003, and later
dissolved in 2006. The effects of poor economic management, compounded by international sanctions
and conflict (between 1992-1996 and 1998-2000), which severely inhibited trade and investment in the
country, led to a sharp decline in economic conditions. However, since late 2000, progress in structural
reforms remains positive despite several domestic and external shocks. An extensive economic reform
agenda was adopted in 2003, resulting in visible progress and sustained recovery. The GDP was
estimated to have grown at 2 percent annually at the time of appraisal. Montenegro’s consolidated fiscal
deficit was cut from about 8 percent of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 5.2 percent in 2003.

4.       Main Health Sector Issues. Challenges faced by the health system in Montenegro were related
to key areas, such as health service delivery, financing, and governance. The existing public health
financing and delivery system was not financially sustainable due to high contribution rates on the payroll
and the existence of an informal sector, which resulted in: (i) difficult collection; (ii) inadequate budget
transfers for the uninsured; and (iii) a lack of the ability to adjust the benefit package to offset difficult
economic circumstances. The government’s capacity for policy development, planning, managing and
monitoring the health system were considerably weak, with deficient information systems. Major issues
also existed in service delivery, including limited access to and fragmented organization of primary health
care (PHC), as well as a lack of management and motivation of health sector staff.

5.      In 2003, the Montenegro’s Parliament approved the health sector strategy, which was part of the
government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). In addition, draft framework laws for health
protection and health insurance were prepared by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to underpin the health
reform strategy. The project was conceptualized based on key pillars of the health sector strategy, and
thus focused on supporting the government in developing priority areas of policy and regulation, building
capacity, improving quality, efficiency and access in PHC, and taking measurable steps towards achieving
financial sustainability in the health care system.

6.      Country Partnership Strategy and Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank was (and
remains) the main source of support for policy and system reform in the Montenegro health sector. At
appraisal, the Bank’s strategic program with Serbia and Montenegro was outlined in the 2001 (updated
2002) Transitional Support Strategy (TSS). The project was fully consistent with the goals made explicit
by the TSS. These goals included the alleviation of poverty and the development of human capital
through improved health status, by ensuring quality and effective health services at all levels. In addition,

                                                      1
the Bank conducted a Public Expenditure Institutional Review (PEIR) in 2002 and a Poverty Assessment
in 2003, which provided analytical input to project preparation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.       The objective of the Health System Improvement Project (HSIP) was to put in place the first
phase of steps necessary to reform the health system in the Republic of Montenegro, giving priority to
increasing capacity for policy, planning and regulation, stabilizing health financing, and improving PHC
service delivery. Specifically, the project would: (i) support measures to achieve financial sustainability
of the health care system by strengthening institutional capacity and information systems for health policy,
planning, regulation, and management in the MoH, Health Insurance Fund (HIF), and the Institute of
Public Health (IPH); (ii) improve quality, efficiency, and access to PHC services by investment in
training of staff, facilities and equipment, organizational reform, and financing of primary care beginning
in Podgorica and extending to outlying areas, and (iii) support a project management network (PMN) of
the MoH and a central Technical Service Unit (TSU) that would provide procurement and financial
management services.

8.      The wording of the Project Development Objective (PDO) was consistent throughout the main
text of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).
However, there is a slight difference between the main text and Annex 3 of the PAD, concerning:
“improving of services for elderly and people with long term mental illness and disabilities in primary
care?, which is a specific objective only mentioned in Annex 3 of the PAD.

9.      The PDO indicators were:

               Drug prices are reduced and agreed indicators of rational drug use are improved
               HIF deficit is reduced
               Waiting time (from arrival to consultation) in primary care is reduced
               Utilization rates and satisfaction for primary health care in Podgorica by Roma and
                Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are increased
               Gap between primary health care utilization of the poor and non-poor is reduced
               Immunization rates for DPT and measles are maintained or improved
               Utilization of day care services by the elderly is increased


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.      The PDO was not revised. However, the project’s Results Framework was revised during the
project formal restructuring (July 2007) and at the time of the Additional Financing (approved in
November 2009). The project restructuring formally removed the following outcome indicators: (i)
“utilization of day care services by the elderly is increased? and (ii) “the gap between PHC utilization of
the poor and non-poor is reduced?, considering them as non-consistent with the PDO and the project
activities, which were also revised as part of the restructuring. The AF added three new outcome
indicators (as described in detail in the datasheet), to reflect the impact of new activities introduced. In
addition, a number of intermediate outcome indicators were revised to better reflect the changes
introduced during project restructuring and AF, as well as to promote a more effective progress
monitoring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      Original project and AF investments were targeted to provide significant benefits to the whole
population of Montenegro (Roma included), through improvements in quality and utilization of PHC
services. In addition, the MoH and key health sector institutions were to benefit from project support in
strengthening their capacity to develop a sustainable performance-oriented health care system. The HIF,
specifically, was targeted to benefit from strengthened capacity in budget planning, expenditure and
revenue forecasting, as well as analyses and resource allocation. Both the HIF and the Montenegro Drug
Agency (MDA) were to benefit from the project through the receipt of quality control systems, and the
establishment of a transparent drug registration and pricing system. In addition, PHC services were to
benefit from interventions in infrastructure, IT systems, and substantial training of medical staff.

1.5 Original Components

12.     The Project consisted of the following three components:

13.      Component 1 - Support for health reform program (US$2.2 million): The objective of this
component was to support the government to identify best practices in health policy, financing, and selected
areas of service delivery. There were two subcomponents:

14.      Subcomponent 1. Health policy development and capacity building for the MoH, HIF, and IPH,
focusing on health finance, pharmaceutical regulation and expenditure management, planning and strategy
development, communications and public information to support reform, and monitoring and evaluation.
Priority would be given within these activities to aspects relevant to primary health care development,
development of the benefits package and provider payment policies, and efficiency improvement and
expenditure control. This sub-component would provide expert advice and train the MoH, HIF and IPH staff in
health finance, planning, and monitoring and evaluation.

15.      Subcomponent 1.2. Investments in health information systems to improve data collection, contracting,
monitoring and management of primary health care and related services. These investments would be consistent
with a longer term plan to develop integrated health information systems, and would build upon HIS development
already carried out in the HIF. Priority would be given to the informational needs of the MoH, HIF and IPH, as
well as to development of information systems for primary health care.

16.     Component 2 - Phased implementation of primary health care development, beginning in
Podgorica, and scaling up of aspects of the reform and development to other locations (US$6.6
million). The objective of this component was to support phased implementation of plans for the reform
and development of primary health care (developed under Component 1). The component was structured
under four subcomponents:

17.     Subcomponent 2.1 First phase of implementation in Podgorica, which would be used to develop
and refine the reform model before scaling up reforms to other parts of Montenegro. Key elements of the
reform model included: (i) patient choice of and registration with a primary care doctor and
reorganization of these "chosen doctors" into group practices; (ii) consolidation of specialized primary-
care-based services into a Primary Care Support Center (including diagnostics, day services for the
elderly and for people with chronic mental illness, specialized community-based clinics - including
tuberculosis dispensary, youth health, and mental health - and teaching facilities); (iii) implementation of
a new contract with these doctors to improve staff motivation based on a re-defined benefits package and
a new payments model; and (iv) streamlining of the organization of services to reduce waiting and
crowding and give medical staff more quality time with patients. These activities would be coordinated
with information systems development and with training of staff in evidence-based protocols of care.

                                                      3
This subcomponent would also finance civil works to carry out internal remodeling of existing primary
care facilities, to rationalize facilities, and improve the functional lay-out of buildings so as to support the
development of group practice.

18.      Subcomponent 2.2. Further development of primary health care policy, standards, and
implementation capacity, through technical assistance and training. This would cover support for: (i)
change management; (ii) development of measures to increase service quality through development of
clinical standards and guidelines, licensing and accreditation, and professional chambers and associations;
(iii) development of policies and strategies to improve patient relations and protect patients’ rights; and
(iv) development of human resource policies for primary health care.

19.      Subcomponent 2.3. Development of primary care specialization training and continuing
professional development. This would include development of a training center in the Podgorica linked to
the Medical Faculty; this is likely to develop a new professional specialization profile for primary health
care doctors, and specialized training for nurses in primary health care, as well as upgrading of the skills
of existing staff through continuing medical education.

20. Subcomponent 2.4. Support for phased scaling-up of implementation of the reforms piloted in
Podgorica to the rest of the country. The key areas to be scaled up first throughout the rest of Montenegro
would include: implementation of patient choice of and registration with a primary care doctor;
implementation of a new contract with these doctors based on a re-defined benefits package and a new
payments model.

21. Component 3 - Project management (US$ 1.0 million): The objective of this component was to ensure
a proper and efficient implementation of project activities. The MoH was defined as lead implementation
agency for the project. A Project Management Network (PMN) was established, led by a Project
Coordinator in the MoH. A central Technical Services Unit (TSU) was established under the Office of
the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for providing core procurement and financial management
services for all future Bank-financed projects. This component was comprised of subcomponent 3.1: the
operation of the PMN under the MOH; and subcomponent 3.2: the operation of the central TSU serving
the health project and other projects.

1.6 Revised Components

21.   See section 1.7.

1.7 Other significant changes

22.      Project Restructuring. The project went through a level II restructuring in July 2007. Project
restructuring, agreed between the MoH, other project stakeholders and the Bank team during the mid-term
review (MTR), had the same development objectives as the original project and was structured around the
same original three components: (i) support for the health reform program; (ii) phased implementation of
the PHC development; and (iii) project management and monitoring and evaluation.

23.       The new structure of the project reflected the following decisions: (i) to implement the first phase
of the PHC reform in Podgorica; (ii) the proposal to create a Primary Health Care Support Center in
Podgorica was dropped since the same planned activities were integrated into the existing PHC network;
(iii) reallocation of Credit proceeds, mainly to accommodate cost overruns in civil works for a number of
PHC centers; and (iv) the responsibility of leading activities in each component and subcomponent was
transferred from working groups to institutions in the Government of Montenegro.



                                                       4
24.    The revised project subcomponents reflected a more logical grouping of the activities financed by
the IDA Credit. Furthermore, all project documents, such as the Project Appraisal Document, the
Procurement Plan, and the Results Framework became programmatically and operationally consistent.

25.      The project’s Results Framework was revised during restructuring to promote a more effective
monitoring of progress towards PDO achievement, without changing the intended outcomes. There were
two outcome indicators, namely: (i) “utilization of day care services by the elderly is increased? and (ii)
“the gap between PHC utilization of the poor and non-poor is reduced?, and a number of intermediate
indicators which were dropped during the restructuring, since it was not expected to be impacted as a
result of the project activities. In addition, baseline values for all indicators were obtained and recorded,
and the parties responsible for the collection of monitoring data were identified.

26.      Additional Financing (AF) to the project (Euro 5.10 Million) was approved in November
2009, with a closing date of December 31, 2012. The additional funds were to support the expansion of
original activities -- deepening health reform through the development of institutional capacity and
policies in the areas of health financing, pharmaceutical policy, health policy and planning, as well as
providing further support to the phased implementation of the primary health care reform. In addition, the
project’s rating with respect to Environmental Safeguards was upgraded from Category C to B (as a result
of civil works for the rehabilitation of the Bijelo Polje health center.

27.      The AF supported the following project components:

28.      Component 1 - Support for the Health Reform Program. The AF supported three priority health
policy reforms (scale up and expansion of subcomponent 1.1). First, it would finance technical assistance
and training to support the development of a secondary and tertiary care health sector reform strategy.
The elements of this reform included plans and a normative framework for the health network; defining
the package of services financed by the state; defining an output-based (i.e. diagnostic related groups -
DRGs) payment mechanism and contracts between the providers and insurer; developing the priority
clinical guidelines to ensure effective and efficient delivery of state-financed services; and determining
models of public and private cooperation in the delivery of health services, including defining appropriate
models and proposing legislative solutions. Second, it would support further institutional capacity

                                                      5
building of the MDA, which is responsible for the regulation and oversight of the pharmaceutical sector,
through provision of technical assistance, training, and information systems. Third, the AF would finance
computer hardware and related equipment to establish the information system between hospitals and the
insurance fund (expansion of subcomponent 1.2). The provision of equipment was linked to the
development and operation of the software by the HIF through other funding sources.

29.      Component 2 - Phased Implementation of Primary Health Care Development. The AF would
provide technical assistance to support the MoH in monitoring and assessing the implementation of the
primary health care reform (expansion of subcomponent 2.2). It would provide further technical
assistance in establishing a Family Medicine specialization in the medical faculties (completion of
activity under subcomponent 2.3 due to financing gap). Also, the AF would support the nationwide
upgrade of primary health care services (scale up and expansion of subcomponent 2.4) through the
provision of re-training of doctors and nurses; medical equipment for the offices of the “chosen doctor?
and the diagnostic services in the Health Centers; and physical upgrade (rehabilitation and extension) of
the health center in Bijelo Polje (with co-financing from the HIF and the Bijelo Polje municipality).

30.      Component 3 - Project Management. The AF would continue to support the functioning of the
Project Management Network through the provision of technical assistance, training, and the operating
costs of the dedicated office (scale-up of Component 3.1), as well as the proportional cost of the staff and
                                                        2
operating costs of the TSU (scale-up of Component 3.2).


       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

31.        The ICR team rates design and quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory on the following basis:

32.      Financing Instrument. The project was financed from an IDA Credit of SDR 4.9 million
(US$7.0 million equivalent) and an IBRD Loan of Euro 5.1 (US$7.2 million equivalent), using a Specific
Investment Loan (SIL) instrument. In addition, the project benefited from a co-financing from the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) of US$0.82 million3 (TF055474), a PHRD4 grant
(TF052794) of US$0.45 million, and a government’s contribution of US$3.7 million. A SIL was
considered the most appropriate instrument based on the following: (i) an investment operation was
needed to complement the proposed Structural Adjustment Lending – SAC 2, which included health-
related conditionalities; and (ii) certain efficiency gains and quality improvements in primary health care
required re-design and equipping of facilities, as well as extensive staff training, which is uniquely and
most effectively accomplished through investment lending instruments.

    Total project costs as originally appraised, reallocated and proposed under the AF is presented in Annex 1.

 At project appraisal phase, agreement was reached on a co-financing from CIDA of US$ 0.57 million. However,
during project implementation, the Grant amount was increased to US$ 0.82 million. See section 7.b for more details.

    Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) fund

33.      Soundness of background analyses. The project was prepared by a large team of experts with
financial support from the PHRD fund. This was the first Bank-supported stand-alone project in the
health sector in Montenegro. Project preparation benefited significantly from the 2003 Operations
Evaluation Department OED study on a number of completed Bank-supported projects in the health
sector in the ECA region. In addition, the team carefully considered key analyses and priorities extracted
from the “Health Services Policy in the Republic of Montenegro up to Year 2020? (prepared by the
government in 2001), and the “Strategy for Health Care Development in Montenegro? (2003).

34.      Assessment of Project Design. A number of alternatives were considered during project
preparation. The first alternative was not having a project at all. However, there were strong
justifications for having an immediate investment in the health sector, including the fact that public
spending on health was a significant drain on scarce public resources, the lack of efficiency of the existing
public health provider network, as well as the strong demand from the government as a result of the high
priority they placed on health reform. A second alternative was proceeding with a small technical
assistance project that could support the implementation of the strategies under the second Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC 2). Yet, this alternative could not bring immediate visible results in the existing
delivery system which was characterized by low capital investment and capacity, and as such, it was also
dropped. Finally, the choice of an APL was also considered. However, the political climate of
Montenegro was too uncertain (considering the country had just recently obtained independence, as well
as the fact that they were considering the possibility of EU accession); hence the team did not proceed
with the APL option.

35.      Based on the existing government strategy for development of the health sector, a wide range of
issues were identified and discussed by the team during the design phase. However, the project was
designed to focus on the most critical issues, with a long-term outlook towards implementing the health
sector strategy. Specifically, project design addressed: (i) health financing challenges facing the sector,
based on the importance of financial sustainability and large inefficiencies in the existing health care
system; (ii) capacity building needed for ensuring long term effects of the sector reform; as well as (iii)
limited access to and fragmented organization of primary health care. Although consideration was given
to also support long-term care services for the elderly and disabled, as per the MoH’s request, the Bank
team concluded that this would add excessive complexity to the project, hence project support
concentrated only on the development of primary health care.

36.     Despite a careful assessment of health sector needs and a thorough preparation, project design
was somewhat complex and with a low degree of realism. The design missed the opportunity to put in
place a sound M&E system and overvalued the existing local capacity. For instance, lack of capacity,
unclear division of roles and responsibilities between the MoH, the IPH, and the HIF as well as issues
with functioning of the working groups established for each project component, proved to negatively
impact the project implementation schedule and placed the achievement of project outcomes at risk.

2.2 Implementation

37.      The ICR team rates overall implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The project was
successful in achieving most of its expected outcomes and delivering the outputs specified under the three
components. Although project start up suffered from certain delays, the initial phase of project
implementation was rated as Satisfactory for both Development Objective (DO) and Implementation
Progress (IP). Despite delays at the beginning, project implementation progressed relatively well; hence,
the rating was kept as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory in terms of DO and IP until the end of 2005.

38.    However, fourteen months after effectiveness the lack of implementation progress triggered
the decision to downgrade the ratings for project DO and IP to Moderately Unsatisfactory. The

                                                     7
project had committed only 11.8 percent and disbursed only 8.3 percent of the total credit of US$7.0
million equivalent. At that point, it was believed that a project restructuring and revision of
implementation arrangements would speed up the pace of implementation.

39.       Key factors that negatively influenced implementation progress at this stage, included: (i)
divisions between project stakeholders due to political tensions and the lack of clarity on redistribution of
roles and responsibilities between the regulatory bodies (MoH, IPH), the purchaser (HIF) and the
providers; (ii) existing arrangements adopted for project implementation (a network of working groups),
which created additional confusion and limited communication and cooperation among stakeholders; and
(iii) the diversity of activities and fragmentation of consultancies planned under Component 1 “Support
for health reform program? created an additional burden on the project team and thus further contributed
to the implementation lag.

40.      The situation remained unchanged until the end of 2006, while waiting for the results of the
legislative elections and government reshuffling.

41.      The Mid-Term Review (MTR), carried out in February 2007, was considered a turning
point for the project’s implementation progress. The MTR noted that the PDO of the original three
components, as well as overall project design, remained valid. However, a number of decisions were
made to improve implementation performance including: (i) revising some project subcomponents, in
order to reflect a more logical grouping of activities, (ii) proceeding with a reallocation of Credit proceeds
to reflect disconnects between the cost of civil works expected at appraisal and actual costs, (iii) focusing
the implementation of the first phase of PHC reforms only in Podgorica, (iv) transferring the
responsibility of implementing project activities from the working groups to government institutions; and
(v) revising the results framework to promote a more effective monitoring of progress towards PDO
attainment, including dropping two original outcome indicators – (i) “increased utilization of day care
services by the elderly? and (ii) “the gap between PHC utilization of the poor and non-poor is reduced? -
which were considered inconsistent with project design and its objectives.

42.      In addition, the MoH decided that financing of activities for improved services for the elderly (per
Part A of Schedule 2 of the DCA) should be dropped from the Credit and be initiated through the CIDA
Grant, via development of options for palliative care. Also, the decision was made to drop the
establishment of a primary care support center for Podgorica (as originally planned and referred to under
Schedule 4 of the DCA).

43.     These decisions led to a project level II restructuring in July 2007, through which the Bank
endorsed all the agreements reached during the project’s MTR. Following the restructuring, project
implementation showed good progress overall, leading to the upgrade of the DO and IP to Moderately
Satisfactory and, at a later stage, to Satisfactory.

44.    At the same time, the project was extended by 10 months from the original closing date until
December 31, 2009. The extension allowed for the completion of the rehabilitation of two health centers
in Podgorica, as well as a few technical assistance and training activities.

45.      While the project continued to perform satisfactorily, an additional financing (IBRD Loan)
was approved in November, 2009 in the amount of Euro 5.1 Million (US$7.2 Million equivalent).
The AF funding was provided to support the extension of a few project activities (as described under
section 1.7), and, to a lesser extent, cover cost over-runs of activities previously started under the original
project.



                                                      8
46.      AF implementation experienced certain delays due to the following factors: (i) lack of
government certainty on how to best address hospital sector efficiency reforms (i.e. how to focus on
financing tools, managerial autonomy, benchmarking and discrete restructuring of services rather than on
historical planning norms and standards of services), which significantly delayed contracting of technical
assistance in key related areas; and (ii) lack of clarity on requirements for the IT system for the Institute
of Public Health. However, regardless of certain implementation issues and delays, the overall
performance of the AF remained satisfactory.

47.      Despite implementation issues and delays, the project successfully completed its planned
activities. Key positive factors that influenced overall performance, included:

        (i)     Strong government commitment to reform the health sector. Despite relatively weak
                capacity, frequent staff changes and certain political tensions between different
                institutions involved in the project, the government has continuously displayed a long
                term strategic vision in the sector and commitment towards reforming the existing system.
        (ii)    Flexibility, within the original PDO, to address pressing implementation issues. Both the
                government and the Bank revealed flexibility during different project implementation
                stages, especially during the MTR (followed by first project restructuring in July 2007),
                and the AF (November, 2009).
        (iii)   Coordination with other international organizations. The project kept close coordination
                with other donors and international organizations. For example, during the AF
                implementation, the European Observatory for Health Systems was invited to support the
                TSU in procuring the IT system for the Institute of Public Health (IPH) through: (a)
                ensuring technical support for the development of the tender documentation; and (b)
                providing support to the IPH in defining its needs, which has proven crucial for the
                successful implementation of this activity. Also, the WHO provided significant support
                through their expertise, especially during the preparation of PHC standards and norms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

48.      Design. The results framework in the PAD proved to be ambitious for a number of targets, in
terms of monitoring and achieving them. No baseline data were defined at this stage, asking the related
government institutions to carry out this task by project effectiveness. An M&E plan was developed and
agreed with the counterparts, including specific instruments and responsible institutions for data
collection.

49.     Implementation. At the beginning of project implementation, M&E was relatively neglected.
No baseline data were in place until project restructuring (July, 2007), resulting in a lack of ability to
correctly monitor project achievements.

50.      A number of significant decisions were taken during the project’s MTR, and formally approved at
project restructuring. The results framework was intensely revised, to promote a more effective
monitoring of progress towards the attainment of PDO, and outcome and output indicators were refined.
Two of the project outcome indicators and a number of intermediate indicators were dropped (?increased
utilization of day care services by elderly? and “the gap between PHC utilization of the poor and non-
poor is reduced?) because their inclusion in the original results framework was considered inconsistent
with project design and PDO. Although these changes were made, the intended outcomes of the project
remained the same. In addition, an agreement was reached to hire a part-time M&E consultant to assist
with data collection and close monitoring of project implementation. The work of the consultant started
in November 2007, resulting in a significant improvement of the project’s M&E. In addition, a household


                                                     9
survey and public opinion survey was carried out in 2008 (supported by CIDA funding), to collect and
provide appropriate information, before the original project closing date of December 31, 2009.

51.      The AF (November, 2009) resulted in a second enhancement of the results framework, in order to
reflect the newly introduced activities. Three new outcome indicators were added, to reflect the impact of
newly introduced activities in the progress towards achievement of the PDO. Also, a few discrepancies
found with the baseline data were corrected. A second household survey and public opinion survey was
fielded (during the summer of 2011, with final results in 2012) to update the entire framework.

52.     In addition to the fact that the M&E system was initially neglected, its ownership was weak and
early reports were poor. However, the results framework and monitoring & reporting was significantly
improved by the project’s MTR and deemed adequate for the remaining project implementation period.

53.      Utilization. Besides monitoring internal project activities, the information collected after project
restructuring included not only data related to the project’s results framework, but also other important
data, which were used by the Bank and government (such as detailed data on quality, efficiency, and
access to primary healthcare, and utilization of health care at all levels, etc). Specifically, this proved to
be useful for the government while: (i) preparing the Master Plan of developing the health care system in
the country for the period 2010-2013; and (ii) adopting the strategy for secondary and tertiary health care
level reform, in July 2011.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
54.        The environmental category of the project at appraisal was “C?, as the project was not designed
to incur any major health or environmental impacts. The project supported physical rehabilitation of the
existing primary health care facilities in Podgorica, which included only minor modeling and renovation
activities. During the rehabilitation activities there were no hazardous wastes, and thus, there was no
need for special plans for waste removal. There were only construction wastes, dumped on an authorized
landfill, and managed by government waste management companies. In addition, reconstruction
activities were carried out in full compliance with national environmental requirements and based on
construction permits and urban planning documentation. During implementation of the original project,
the scope of works on one site exceeded the initial design by including a small construction of a health
center in Podgorica. However, an environmental safeguards assessment, carried out by the Bank team in
collaboration with the government, concluded that no environmental or social harm occurred during
construction and no subsequent mitigation measures were therefore found necessary.

55.     The AF introduced the upgrade of the environmental category to “B?, as a result of the
reconstruction of the Bijelo Polje health care center (added as part of the AF). The reconstruction
included the expansion of the existing facility; an extension was added and an additional floor was placed
on top of the existing facility. In addition, an agreement was reached to construct a small sewerage plant
close to the health center, which was successfully completed by AF closure. An Environmental
Assessment (EA) and a simple Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were prepared and implemented.
The EMP included also a monitoring plan with environmental indicators, monitoring and reporting
procedures, as well as institutional arrangements. Overall, no issues have been identified with the
implementation of the safeguards requirements. All the works have been consistent with standards and
environmental guidelines and safeguards compliance has been satisfactory, throughout the original project
and the AF. This was also confirmed during the visit of the ICR team to the Bijelo Polje health center
and a number of other rehabilitated primary care facilities in Podgorica.

56.     Procurement. Considering the limited number of World Bank supported projects in Montenegro,
the government established a central Technical Services Unit (TSU) initially under the General
Secretariat (Prime Minister’s Department) and later on under the Ministry of Finance (MoF), responsible

                                                     10
for carrying out procurement functions for all Bank-financed projects. The Health System Improvement
Project was the first one to work with these arrangements. While overall responsibility and decision-
making authority was handled by the MoH, the TSU was accountable for providing prompt support in
handling all procurement processes.

57.     Project implementation suffered from a number of procurement-related delays, mainly due to:

        (i)     Lack of good communication between the TSU and MoH (including all project
                beneficiaries). While the required Terms of Reference or Technical Specifications were
                prepared by project beneficiaries, the procurement process was handled by the TSU.
                This arrangement required strong collaboration and close communication between all
                involved parties, which was lacking during periods of project implementation, resulting
                in delayed procurement.
        (ii)    Lack of clarity on decision-making authorities. A Memorandum of Understanding was
                signed between the MoH and MoF (TSU), outlining their rights and responsibilities for
                project implementation. However, its implementation proved to be difficult, resulting in
                delays in procurement processes for a number of activities (i.e: the physical rehabilitation
                of health care facilities, development of the information system, and purchasing of
                medical equipment).
        (iii)   Frequent staff changes in the MoH, TSU and all related institutions created a somewhat
                fluid environment for carrying out a timely procurement process.

58.      However, overall the TSU had appropriate skills to successfully implement the project. Despite
delays, the original project and AF activities were successfully completed, thus procurement has been
rated as Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory throughout the project’s lifetime.

59.      Financial Management. Similarly, the TSU carried the financial management responsibilities in
a satisfactory way. Despite certain delays, caused by staff changes, overall the Unit had appropriate skills
and ability to manage the project financial management and disbursement issues. No issues in the area of
financial management have been identified. Quarterly financial reports were prepared and submitted in a
timely manner, providing reliable financial information. Appropriate controls and procedures were
instituted and described in the TSU operational manual since project inception. Financial statements were
regularly audited by independent auditors, resulting in unqualified opinions.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

60.      Transition Arrangements. The transitional arrangements put in place for future operations,
seems to be adequate. The government has significantly improved financial performance of the health
care system, by upgrading the legal framework and operations of the (HIF) and improving controls on
pharmaceutical costs. In addition, a number of positive developments have taken place in PHC,
including: (i) revising the PHC benefit package, (ii) introducing the concept of choosing the PHC doctor;
and (iii) expanding the PHC infrastructure; leading to increased patient satisfaction and PHC utilization
rates. While the government is strongly committed to sustaining achievements garnered to date, there is
clear scope and need for further improvements in sector performance. In order to clearly assess the
sustainability of the project’s achievements, it will be important that the government carry out an
evaluation. This evaluation can also contribute to start discussions between the government and the Bank
on future potential engagement.

61.     Follow-up project. The government, during the ICR mission, expressed its strong interest in a
follow-on project that will further support the on-going reforms. The Bank-Government of Montenegro
Partnership Strategy (FY11 – FY14), has highlighted the following key priority areas in going forward:

                                                    11
(i) strengthening quality assurance programs at the central and local levels; and (ii) improving
institutional capacity of the MoH, HIF and the MDA to enable their technical and managerial capacity to
scale-up ongoing reforms.

    3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

62.      The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is rated Substantial. Reforming the
health system, with specific focus on improving the access and quality of primary care services and its
financial sustainability, was a high priority for the government of Montenegro before the start of the
project and remains so at completion. The PDO was fully relevant to the priorities of the national health
sector strategy approved in 2003, as part of the overall Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The
explicit goals of the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) of June 2000 and subsequent TSS Update
covering FY04, included the development of human capital through improved health status by ensuring
quality and cost-effective health services at all levels. The project has firmly supported these goals,
improving primary health care service delivery, increasing capacity for policy planning and regulation,
and stabilizing health financing. In addition, the project has served to address key challenges in the health
sector reform, which clearly falls under one of the main pillars of the current Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) FY11-14. Achieving the full impact of these reforms will likely take a long time, hence
the project’s impact would remain relevant even for the future development of the sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

63.     The achievement of the PDOs is rated as Substantial. This evaluation is based on the
achievement of the outcome indicators (six out of ten outcome indicators are fully met, while the other
four are only partially met), according to administrative data from the MoH, HIF and IPH, and the results
from the household survey, conducted during July – August, 2012. It is also based on the analyses of the
accomplishment of project intermediate indicators and the contribution of project activities to the
achievement of the PDOs.

64.     Achievement of PDO1: Increasing capacity for policy, planning, and regulation. With
project support, capacity to develop a sustainable performance-oriented health care system has been
strengthened. The project led to successful achievement of the two key outcome indicators, associated
with this project objective. While these outcome indicators were introduced only as part of the AF, the
ICR evaluation is also based on the analyses on how project activities contributed to the overall
achievement of this objective.

65.     Ministry of Health stewardship of the health system improved as measured by increases of
health-related information and development of key health policies. The project was instrumental in
supporting the MoH developing key strategic documents for health care reform and the related legal
framework, providing the following impacts (over the original project life and AF):

    -   The Health Development Master Plan for 2010-2013 developed and adopted;
    -   Secondary and Tertiary health care strategy adopted by the government and published on the
        MoH website;
    -   New strategy for quality assurance produced and adopted in February, 2012;
    -   Decision on Network of Health institutions adopted;
    -   National plan for development of human resources in health, for the period 2012-2022, developed
        and adopted;

                                                     12
    -   Strategy for integrating private providers into the health system produced and approved,
        including a clear action plan and proposed revisions to the existing legal framework;
    -   Key laws, such as: (i) health care; (ii) health insurance; and (iii) record keeping were amended
        and adopted;
    -   The National Health Accounts produced (supported by CIDA funding).

66.      With the support of the project, a total of eleven clinical protocols and guidelines were developed
(ten of which were supported under the AF). The MoH has taken a very efficient approach to clinical
guidelines development by selecting the most frequent diseases and those that require more financial
resources. These two main groups account for around 70-80 percent of the variable costs of the health
sector. The clinical pathways did not only include guidelines for diagnosis and treatment, but also at what
level of the health network (primary, secondary or tertiary) patients should be receiving particular
diagnosis and treatments. For example, the clinical guidelines for prevention of cervical cancer not only
indicate the age group and frequency of screening, but also where the screening needs to be conducted (by
primary care doctor or specialists in the hospital). These definitions have a critical impact on access and
cost of services.

67.      Strengthening the capacity of the MDA to improve regulation and oversight of the
pharmaceutical sector (including the development of the Agency information system) led to the
preparation and adoption of two new laws (law on medical devices and the law on pharmaceuticals) and
33 related sub-laws, in accordance with EU regulations. Furthermore, the Agency is able to proceed with
the registration of new drugs, with help also provided by the Serbian Drug Agency.

68.      Although the development of information systems for the MoH, HIF and IPH, experienced
significant delays, it finally achieved its expected results on improving data collection, contracting,
monitoring, and management of primary health care and related services.

69.     The HIF increases its capacity to perform its functions of pooling health resources, better
allocating health resources, and contracting providers toward improved performance. The project
supported HIF capacity strengthening (through technical assistance, training, and the provision of the
information system), that led to the establishment of a system based on output models of health care
financing, consistent with the PDO. At project closure, all funds for health care services were pooled
through the HIF, as the sole purchaser. A new model of contracting and financing of PHC was
introduced: PHC operational based on capitation, while fee for services and adjustments for geographical
location. The HIF established a comprehensive information system operational with pharmacists and
PHC providers, which ensures monitoring and performance scheming.

70.     With project assistance, the HIF introduced the DRG system for hospitals (as part of the AF),
launching the necessary groundwork to shift the hospital payment system from historical budgets to the
"products" that a hospital provides. The country was also helped to learn from better practices of its
neighbors, particularly from Croatia, on the implementation of DRGs. All hospitals started DRG-based
reporting before project closure. Intensive training of around 300 hospital staff (including seven general
hospitals, two specialized hospitals, and the Clinical Center in Podgorica) and establishing an information
system for hospitals is expected to ensure a smooth implementation of this reform. However, due to some
delays, the project was not able to assist the HIF in completing the coding and grouping of diagnoses
appropriate for the country. It has been agreed that this task would be developed by HIF using its own
resources.

71.     In addition, the Basic Benefit Package (BBP) was developed, with close coordination between the
HIF and the IPH. Several working groups were organized (involving more than 50 specialists), which
assessed the existing profile of services delivered, defined services to be provided (based on

                                                    13
epidemiological profile and costing) and the methodology to be used, taking into account cost
effectiveness and cost benefit analyses. The BBP was developed based on approved clinical guidelines.

72.     Achievement of PDO2: Stabilizing Health Financing. Although the results framework
includes two outcome indicators linked to this PDO, there is no clear evidence to assess if health
financing has been stabilized as a result of project activities.

73.    HIF controls the increasing cost of nationally financed pharmaceuticals and medical materials.
The indicator has been revised as part of the AF, especially its expected target value. The revision was
made due to the effect of the economic crisis and frequent changes in the exchange rates for imported
drugs.

74.      By project closure, HIF’s share of expenditures on drugs was 20 percent (while the agreed target
was 18 percent). Meanwhile, the share of expenditures on medical materials was 28 percent (with a target
of 27.5 percent). Hence, the expected outcome on the HIF control over pharmaceuticals and medical
materials is mostly achieved. It is also important to note that despite the HIF’s efforts for reducing drug
prices, expanding the list of reimbursable drugs may have negatively affected the overall cost of drugs.

75.      HIF annual deficit reduced. The HIF suffered small deficits during the first years of project
implementation. However, by 2010 the institution became part of the State Treasury budget, hence
resulting in zero annual deficit. Since then, the HIF budget is no longer directly linked with HIF revenues.
There are a number of project-related activities that have positively influenced the stabilization of the
health financing system. With project support, significant progress was achieved in developing the HIF’s
managerial capacity on budget planning, expenditure and revenue forecasting as well as analyses and
resource allocation. Several workshops and study tours were organized to help strengthening the HIF
staff capacity. Technical assistance was provided to the HIF and the MDA, supporting them to
successfully complete the following: (i) implementing a transparent pricing and procurement system to
ensure cost containment; (ii) setting up a transparent drug registration system; (iii) implementing drug
information system in compliance with overall health MIS, for transferring utilization and financial
information from public and private pharmacies to the HIF and MDA; and (iv) setting up a quality control
system.

76.      Achievement of PDO3: Improving primary health care service delivery. With project
support, overall primary health care services in Montenegro have significantly improved. The project has
led to important achievements, in relation to the following key associated outcome indicators:

77.     Reduced waiting time (from arrival to consultation) in primary health care. This indicator was
successfully achieved. Relevant data are extracted from the HIF administrative data as well as two
surveys organized in 2008 and 2012. Waiting time in primary care services in Podgorica met its target of
having only 30 percent of population in the capital reporting a waiting time of 21 minutes. Meanwhile,
reporting for the whole area outside Podgorica has even exceeded the agreed target: with 34 percent of the
population (while the target was 53 percent) reporting a waiting time of 21 minutes.

78.     Increased duration of PHC consultations. Based on survey data, the indicator was partially
achieved. While only 50 percent of Podgorica patients (when the target was 70 percent) report a duration
of 11 minutes or more; 55 percent of patients outside Podgorica (with a target of 55 percent) report a
duration of 11 minutes. Hence the target has been fully met only for part of the PHC services, i.e. in areas
outside Podgorica.

79.    Increased utilization rates for primary health care for the general population (in Podgorica
and outside Podgorica) and the Roma. The indicator is fully achieved. Survey data show that 44

                                                    14
percent of the general population (from a target of 40 percent) used the services of a general practitioner
(GP). Meanwhile, majority of Roma adults (82 percent) have their own GP. Enrollment of Roma adults
have significantly improved, considering that in 2008 (when the baseline data were collected), only 41
percent of Roma adults were enrolled with a GP.

80.      Increased satisfaction for primary health care of the general population (in Podgorica and
outside of Podgorica) and specifically for the Roma. The indicator is only partially achieved.
Satisfaction with GP services has reached the targets for the population in Podgorica and at national level,
with 77 percent satisfied and 19 percent partially satisfied in Podgorica and 70 percent satisfied and 24
percent partially satisfied at national level. However, in Roma settlements only 82.1 percent (while the
target was 87.7 percent) declared that they were satisfied with the work of their GP doctor. Yet, this is a
relatively large percentage of satisfaction.

81.      Referral rates from PHC to hospitals is controlled. The indicator is fully achieved. Based on
the last survey and the administrative data, the proportion of visits referred to specialists’ care was 25.71
percent for 2011 and 22.18 percent for the first 9 months of 2012. While the proportion of visits referred
to hospitals was 1.82 percent for 2011 and 1.52 percent for the first 9 months of 2012.

82.      Maintain or improve immunization rates (%) for DPT and measles, following reform. The
indicator is only partially achieved. The main objective of this indicator was to maintain immunization
rates high throughout the introduction of Chosen Doctor. IPH data shows that the immunization for the
DPT (initial and follow-up) remained at 94.7 percent, while the target was 94 percent. Meanwhile,
immunization for the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), initial and follow-up) is kept at 90.7 percent, when
the target was 92 percent.

83.     The project met or exceeded most of the targets outlined in the results framework, especially in
reference to outputs and outcome indicators, thus it is deemed that the project was successful in
improving delivery of primary health care services.

84.      Primary health policy and standards. A number of documents defining PHC were produced and
approved, including: (i) PHC organization model; (ii) PHC norms and standards on human resources,
equipment, facilities, and services; and (iii) bylaws defining standards for teams of family physicians.
These documents were crucial for the overall reform at the PHC level. Project support in this area was
enhanced during the AF. A survey on cost and efficiency in primary health care centers was conducted
(during 2010-2011), followed by a study that analyzed the productivity and efficiency of all 18 PHC
centers in the country. The analyses provided by the study were taken over by the HIF (which continued
the work based on its own administrative data), and used for further improvements of the PHC standards.

85.     PHC Infrastructure Upgrade. The project supported the physical rehabilitation of eight out of
eighteen PHC centers at the national level, including the center of Bijelo Polje, with the AF. Due to
serious delays resulting from issues with cost overruns, three more centers (originally planned to be
financed with project support) were taken over and completed by the government. Also, ten PHC centers
were provided with required medical and non- medical equipment and with computer equipment. This
upgraded infrastructure proved to be crucial for implementing the reform at the PHC level, bringing the
delivery of primary health care up to standards and supporting PHC diagnosis and procedures, avoiding
inappropriate referral to hospitals.

86.     Capacity building for PHC staff. Project support was instrumental in introducing the chosen
doctor concept at the PHC level and reorganizing the PHC around the primary care teams (primary
physicians and nurses), which refers patients for more specialized care and diagnostic services. To enable
the smooth implementation of this reform, wide training was provided, grouped in eleven rounds. A total

                                                     15
of 248 primary health care physicians and 278 nurses completed the entire training over the lifespan of
the original project and additional financing. Several categories of expertise (international and local)
were mobilized to carry out training needs assessments, prepare the training models, and organize all
training rounds. To further improve capacity, a Family Medicine specialization was introduced at the
University of Montenegro. Enabling legislation for the effective practice of this specialization as a career
was fulfilled when the MoH adopted the Rulebook on the criteria of specialization. The first round of
students enrolled in the regular specialization for the 2012 school year.

3.3 Efficiency


87.      Efficiency is rated as Modest. The Montenegro Health System Improvement project had three
components: (i) support for the health reform program to help government identify best practice in health
policy financing and selected areas of service delivery; (ii) phased implementation of primary health care
development, beginning with Podgorica, with scaling up reforms and development to other locations; and
(iii) project management component to support the health sector organizations involved in the project
activities led by the MoH. Although all of the above three project components generated benefits, most
of them are from the second component.

88.      The measures of economic efficiency under the base case scenario and two alternative scenarios
are presented in Table 2 (see Annex 3 for a description of the base case and the two alternative scenarios).
Under the base case scenario, the project yielded 21 percent Economic Rate of Return and a Benefit: Cost
ratio of 1.82. The sensitivity analysis showed that even under conservative assumptions, the discounted
project benefits covered costs resulting in modest returns to investment. The rates of return from the
project are modest and are justified.

Table 2: Measures of economic efficiency under base case and alternative scenarios
                              Base case         Sensitivity analysis under two alternative scenarios
                                                Scenario 1              Scenario 2
Net present value (million $) 7.89              6.27                    5.37
Benefit/Cost ratio            1.82              1.74                    1.43
Economic rate of return       21                18                      14

89.      The project is expected to yield reasonable returns over the next few years. The operation and
maintenance costs are not significantly high when compared with the public expenditures of health sector
in the country. Therefore, the recurrent cost impacts of the project are negligible.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.     The project’s overall outcome rating is based on the achievement of project development
objectives, as discussed under section 3.2 above, its relevance, and efficiency. The relevance of project
objectives and its overall sound design is rated Substantial. Meanwhile, due to insufficient data, the
evaluation of efficiency is carried out based on a number of assumptions. However, available data clearly
show that the project, especially its second component, has generated considerable benefits and is
expected to yield reasonable returns even during the coming years.




                                                    16
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

91.      The project contributed to improvements in the functioning of the health system and is also
expected to have contributed to better affordability of primary health care services. Initially, the project’s
results framework included two key outcome indicators related to the utilization of primary care by the
poor (namely: “gap between PHC utilization of the poor and non-poor is reduced? and “utilization of day
care services by the elderly is increased?). Since both indicators were not monitored and were dropped at
project MTR, no clear qualitative evidence exists to prove the project’s impact on poverty. However, the
project did have positive impacts on increasing the utilization rates of primary care for the Roma
population (as described in section 3.2), even though it did not have a direct impact on gender aspects and
social development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

92.      The project had a significant impact on institutional development and building long-term capacity.
Interviews carried out during the ICR mission, which included officials from MoH, HIF, IPH, MDA and
other project stakeholders, clearly highlighted the important impacts that project investments in capacity
building and technology had on institutional development. The provision of technical assistance, training,
and study tours significantly strengthened the HIF’s managerial capacity on budget planning, expenditure
and revenue forecasting, as well as resource allocation. The project supported a large number of technical
assistance and training to the HIF, MDA and IPH staff that were instrumental in enabling the
establishment of needed structures for a performance-oriented health care system and quality assurance,
such as: DRGs, BBP, clinical guidelines, and the new model of contracting and financing of PHC.
Training for 248 primary health care physicians and 278 nurses was also provided, creating the required
capacity for the smooth implementation of the above mentioned reform. In addition, the project enabled
the adoption of laws and by-laws necessary for creating a legal framework to support health system
reform.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

    4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

93.      The ICR team rates the risk that project development outcomes will not be maintained as
Moderate. The government has demonstrated strong commitment, throughout the lifespan of the project
towards achieving and maintaining its outcomes and, more broadly, supporting the overall reform of the
health sector. Key reforms are currently preserved in a solid legal framework and a number of strategic
documents, hence they are unlikely to be reversed. Although the country has been facing economic crises,
financing of health sector reforms has continuously been among the government’s priorities. This was
clearly revealed during project implementation, when the government took over financing some of the
infrastructure in PHCs (including three PHC centers in Podgorica and the one in Bjelo Polje), as well as
IT investments, which were key outputs for the reform in PHC and health financing. In addition, key

                                                     17
project-supported investments (i.e, reforming PHC services through registration with a chosen doctor, and
introducing BBPs and DRGs) have been institutionalized.

94.     However, caution should be exercised so as not to be too optimistic about the government’s
capacity to remain committed to the reform, especially considering the high level of staff turnover in the
MoH and other main related institutions. These changes may negatively influence the government’s
commitment towards sector reform, as well as evolving priorities. In addition, without a follow-up
support project by the Bank or other donors, the government may not have sufficient capacity to continue
maintaining and deepening the system’s reforms (including the completion and utilization of DRGs,
BBPs, clinical guidelines, and continuation of medical education among others).

    5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of experts, providing the required
technical skills to address sector issues and generally produce a proper design. The team considered a
number of alternatives during the preparation process, as well as major risk factors and lessons learned
from previous Bank involvement in the country.

96.     The project’s consistency with the government’s strategy and priorities in the health sector was
assured. The Bank team maintained good working relations with the Borrower throughout preparation.

97.       Conversely, the project was prepared very rapidly so as to benefit from IDA eligibility. As a
result, the team missed the opportunity to prepare detailed and sound implementation approaches. Also, a
few ambiguities and duplications are noticed in the formulation of certain project activities. More
importantly, the design could not put in place a proper M&E system for monitoring project
implementation and assessing its achievements. Baseline data were lacking for most indicators and there
was no forecasted activity related to a baseline survey. Although these shortcomings were addressed
during project implementation (mainly during the MTR), the assessment of project progress and its
achievements thus became quite challenging.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

98.     The Bank’s performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. Task teams
focused on the project’s development impact. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated and
the project was adequately supervised and closely monitored. Bank supervision took place on a regular
basis and provided appropriate and well-targeted advice and observations. The aide memoires provided
evidence of regular supervision and professional advice given by the Bank’s experts throughout the
project’s lifetime. In addition, interviews with stakeholders clearly show the government’s appreciation of
the technical skills and advice provided by the Bank’s experts.

99.     The Bank team was quite flexible in making adjustments, especially during the project’s MTR,
which led to project restructuring in July, 2007. Following the restructuring, the team was commendably
proactive in identifying implementation bottlenecks and measures to overcome project implementation
delays. In addition, the task team’s flexibility and quick decision-making reflected the support received



                                                    18
from members of the Bank’s senior management team, especially during difficult periods of
implementation.

100.   In spite of frequent changes of TTLs (in total six), the smooth transition from one to the next,
provided continuity and reduced any possible negative impact of such frequent change.


101.    Fiduciary and safeguards policies were well managed and reported.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

102.    While quality at entry was less than satisfactory, the Bank team’s performance significantly
improved during project supervision, especially from the project MTR until closure. However, despite
team’s efforts during supervision, certain shortcomings from design stage, such as M&E, could not be
completely bridged. Hence, overall performance of the Bank is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

103.     The project was designed and mostly implemented by a government that has shown strong
commitment towards reforming the health sector. In addition, the government demonstrated a long term
strategic vision in the sector over the project’s lifetime. Government officials worked closely and fully
cooperated with the Bank’s project team, and on a continual basis. The Steering Committee, headed by
the Minister of Health and comprised of officials representing key project stakeholders, played a key role
in strategic decision making and project monitoring. It was the initiative of this committee during project
MTR, to carefully analyze the functioning of the working groups (responsible for implementing activities
in each project component) and determine whether these groups created bottlenecks and therefore slowed
down project implementation pace. This was resolved by the Committee’s decision to replace the
working groups with institutions appropriately qualified to effectively implement project activities.

104.    The project did not experience any counterpart funding problems. In contrast, the government
took over funding of the physical rehabilitation of three PHC centers that could not be completed with
project support due to significant cost overruns. Also, during the AF, the government took full
responsibility for covering the entire counterpart funding for the physical rehabilitation of the Bijelo Polje
health center, including the part originally planned to be covered by the municipality (due to a lack of
local government financial resources).

105.     Overall, government performance in ensuring political and institutional commitment was
satisfactory. The first few years of project implementation was a period of political transition for the
government; although implementation suffered significant delays at this time, the situation was quickly
rectified.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

106.    Although the MoH was the lead implementing agency for the project, daily project
implementation was carried out by the Project Management Network (PMN), with all fiduciary functions
managed by the Technical Services Unit (TSU) attached to the MoF. In general, both units had the
required skills to implement the project. The “moderately satisfactory? rating is based on the

                                                     19
achievement of all project planned outputs and the flexibility these organizations demonstrated while
working in a changing environment.

107.    However, the manner in which project implementation was organized proved to be quite
challenging. The separation of project management functions from the fiduciary ones resulted in
coordination issues, which negatively affected the project implementation pace.

108.     In addition, both units went through a number of staff changes during the project’s lifetime. Due
to delays in replacing of staff, project implementation suffered more than once from a lack of a fully
functional PMN and TSU. This created a somewhat fluid environment, especially during the first years of
project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

109.   The satisfactory performance of the government and moderately satisfactory of the Implementing
Agency averages to a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for overall borrower performance.

    6. Lessons Learned

110.    The need for quick project preparation must be balanced with the quality of project at
entry. The project was prepared quite rapidly, with only nine months from concept review to Board
approval. Additionally, the country situation at preparation stage was still fluid, coming out of a turbulent
phase of its history. Although the speedy project preparation was related to benefiting from IDA
financing, it negatively affected project implementation, especially during the first years. In addition,
while designing the project, specific needs and situations of the country, such as human capacity,
especially the capacity to undertake and implement major project activities, should be carefully
considered.

111.    Agreed institutional arrangements, government commitment and a viable single agency are
basic prerequisites for a successful project implementation. The lead project implementing agency
was the MoH, supported by a Project Management Unit (PMU), whereas all fiduciary functions were
carried by the TSU under the MoF. While overall the government has shown strong commitment, project
implementation suffered significant delays due to: (i) lack of coordination between the implementing
agency/PMU/TSU and various project stakeholders; and (ii) frequent staff changes at all levels.

112.    Both the Bank and the government need to involve proper expertise in different areas, to
ensure a smooth implementation of project activities. While very good expertise in the areas of
medical equipment and information systems was provided, project supervision lacked the expertise in the
civil works area. Having no expert civil engineer to support the teams with reviewing required technical
specifications and bid evaluations for all reconstruction works negatively influenced the implementation
pace (including delays in completing most civil works and cost overrun issues in a number of PHC
centers).

113.    Lack of a proper M&E design raises questions on the overall quality of project design.
Furthermore, project monitoring becomes challenging and it is quite difficult to prove project
achievements. The lack of baseline data for most outcome and output indicators can negatively affect
overall project relevance. The results framework for this project was somewhat neglected at design stage
and continued to be so until project MTR.

114.   Close coordination with other development partners is very important. Coordination with
key donors involved in the sector, such as: WHO and EU Observatory, proved to be very important for
keeping implementation of certain project activities on track.

115.     Health sector reforms are long-term and quite complex. The project successfully supported
key reforms at all levels of health care, including health financing efficiency, quality of services, and
strengthening institutional capacity. In order to sustain, and, most importantly, further reform the health
sector in the country, it is important that the Bank considers follow-up actions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1. Introduction
The health sector in Montenegro is characterized by high public health and total health expenditures; high
expenditures for pharmaceuticals; weak capacity for policy development, planning, forecasting, and
management; and an insignificant role played by primary health care in prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment. The motivation for the project was the high public health expenditures in Montenegro and the
need to reform the health sector to achieve sustainable levels of health care financing and health
expenditures. The project helped the Government of Montenegro to reform the health sector and improve
the efficiency and development of the primary health care system so as to attain financial sustainability.

The project had three components:
   a. Support for the health reform program to help the government identify best practices in health
       policy, financing, and selected areas of service delivery. This component had two sub-
       components. The first sub-component was intended to develop health policy and capacity
       building of the MoH, HIF, and IPH. The second sub-component was intended for investments in
       health information systems to improve data collection, contracting, monitoring, and management
       of primary health care and related services.
   b. Phased implementation of primary health care development, beginning with Podgorica, with
       scaling up reforms and development to other locations. Under this component the project
       supported the development of primary care policy, standards and implementation capacity
       through technical assistance and training. The activities included the development primary care
       specialization training and continuing professional development. This component also supported
       the phased scaling up of implementation of the reforms piloted in Podgorica to the rest of the
       country. In initial phase of implementation the project facilitated patient choice and registration
       with a primary care doctor, consolidation of specialized primary care based services, streamlining
       organization of services to reduce patient waiting times and more efficient use of time with
       patients and motivating medical staff to provide better care.
   c. Project management component to support the health sector organizations involved in the project
       activities led by the MoH.

The above mentioned three components improved the overall efficiency of the health sector by improving
the delivery of primary health care and hospital services. The benefits and gains from improved
efficiency were passed on to the patients in the form of higher quality of care through increased access to
primary care, improved referral process and specialized treatments, lower treatment costs, lower out of
pocket payments and less severe health problems among patients. As a result of improved access to
quality care, better patient case management and use of preventive care people reported less fewer
hospital referrals, faster recovery, less in-patient admissions, reduced mortality and fewer days lost
through diseases and inactivity. Thus, the benefits from the project included a decrease in unnecessary
hospital bed days due to improved quality of primary health care and the savings in hospital expenses,
reductions in referrals to specialists and costs of specialist care, reductions in out-of-pocket expenditures,
travel times and travel costs, losses in labor productivity averted and benefits from reduced mortality.

2. Methodology, data and assumptions
All three project components complemented each other and generated both direct and indirect benefits,
particularly with regards to Component 2 – “Phased implementation of primary health care development,
beginning with Podgorica, with scaling up reforms and development to other locations?. The methods
used to estimate those benefits are presented below.



                                                     28
2.1. Benefits
The benefits from the project included:
     a. Reduction in hospital outpatient care and hospital admissions as a result of the increase in quality
        and access to primary care in health houses and ambulatory consultations.

The project facilitated better primary care and consultations in health centers and ambulatory consultation
facilities by increasing consultations from 52 to 57 percent in both settings. Hospital visits were also
reduced annually by about 5 percent from 31 percent to 26 percent. Further, there were reductions in
unnecessary hospital admissions which resulted in savings in total bed days and inpatient care expenses.
Such savings in bed days were as high as about 20- 25 percent. Since we did not have data on actual cost
of inpatient care avoided in Montenegro, we have estimated it from the national data on inpatient hospital
expenses and the number of hospital days in Montenegro. It was then adjusted for inflation to represent
the data over the project period. The cost per inpatient day is estimated at US$51 and the recurrent costs
of the hospitals are assumed to be 20 percent of the total inpatient costs at US$9. The above costs are
then adjusted using the inflation rates in Montenegro.

    b. Savings from unnecessary specialist referrals due to improved care and case management in
       primary care centers and adherence to standard specialist care protocols and consolidation of
       primary care services.

In addition to reduction in hospital care, the development of primary health care program and the
improved referral program resulted in a reduction in the number of specialist referrals and treatment. The
beneficiary surveys and project progress reports showed a reduction in specialist visits and inpatient
hospital care by as much as 25 percent in the project area.

    c. Reduction in disease incidence in days and thus averted losses in productivity due to diseases and
       lost workdays.

Averted productivity and man days arise from fewer disease incidence leading to a reduction in inpatient
admissions and therefore bed days. The reduced productivity losses are estimated to be 0.5 days per
referral. Similarly, fewer admissions and fewer bed days results in significant savings in productivity.
Reduction in number of bed days as a result of the project has been estimated at 30 percent. Furthermore,
in order to estimate the value of averted productivity losses, productivity is valued at an average wage rate
of US$3.2 per person per day at a labor participation rate of 54.5 percent.

    d. Reduction in patient waiting times at primary health centers.

Streamlining the appointment process has reduced patient waiting time at the health care facilities. The
average waiting time has been reduced by about 5 percent. The resulting savings in waiting time has been
valued at the daily wage rate.

    e. Savings in potential life years as a result of reduced mortality from diseases.

Better quality of treatment and preventive measures averted chronic diseases and mortality and the burden
of diseases in Montenegro. According to the World Health Organization’s Atlas of Health in Europe,
improved monitoring and treatment of respiratory and circulatory system diseases as well as early
detection of diseases of digestive system reduces mortality rates from these diseases. Based on available
evidence from surveys and evidence from other published works, early detection through higher
utilization of public health services and better quality of care has reduced the mortality rate by about 3
percent over a ten-year period. In order to compute the gains from reduced mortality it is assumed that
each death averted results in nine life years saved. The monetary value of life years saved was then
estimated from the per capita incomes over nine years at a at 5 percent discount rate. The project

                                                     29
supervision documents and the beneficiary surveys showed that the benefits started to materialize from
the second year of project implementation.

     f.   Reduction in expenditures for pharmaceuticals through regulation and expenditure control

The regulation and expenditure control supported by the project has reduced the price of pharmaceuticals
sold in the country which reduced the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures for the population. These
reductions in out of pocket expenditures for pharmaceuticals then become a benefit from the project.

     g. Reduction in travel costs to hospitals and specialist clinics

OOP expenses and travel costs to the hospitals are in general greater than for visits to primary care centers.
Hence a reduction in specialist consultation will result in savings in travel costs and OOP expenses. The
difference in OOP and travel costs for the reduced number of visits to specialty centers then become
project benefits.

     h. Savings from reduction in space and use of fuel/energy

Reduction in space and fuel/energy savings through consolidation of primary-care based services into
primary care reference center resulted in 30 percent reduction in space requirements.

3.        Project costs

The project had three components, of which Component 2 accounted for most of the project costs and
benefits. The total project cost including additional financing was 88.2 percent of the appraisal estimate
(Annex 1). The IBRD and IDA accounted for 35.4 percent and 38.7 percent respectively of the total
project costs. Note that the borrower country shared a significant proportion (20.4%) of the total project
costs, which indicates a higher country ownership of the project. The Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) had a minor share in the total project costs are US$0.8 million accounting
for 4.5 percent of the total project costs.


In addition to the capital costs, the recurrent costs for the years 7 to 10 and the rest of the project period
are estimated at US$38,100. The incremental staff salaries are assumed to be self-financing after the sixth
year. The project costs include recurrent costs, excluding. The cost of outpatient visits vary significantly
based on which particular health unit of the hospital is utilized. Based on data provided by the MoH, the
average cost per visit at the primary care level is US$6.2 while it is around US$12.4 at the secondary
level.

4. Project benefits and measures of economic efficiency

As mentioned above, the project benefits arise from a reduction in hospital outpatient care and admissions,
reduction in referrals to specialists, reduction in disease incidence and savings and averted losses in
productivity, savings in potential life years as a result of reduced mortality, reduction in expenditures for
pharmaceuticals and reduction in travel costs to hospitals and specialist care centers. The analysis
considered a base case scenario and three alternative scenarios. Under the base case scenario, most
project benefits started to accrue in the third year. The benefits from reduction in costs of pharmaceutical
start to accrue in the second year though at a limited scale but continue to accrue until 20 years. As a
result of the project, the outpatient treatments at hospitals and referrals to specialists were reduced on the
average by 5 percent. The project resulted in a reduction in mortality by about 2.9 percent. The measures
of economic efficiency of the project under the base case scenario are presented in the following table.

                                                      30
Table A3.1: Base case scenario: Measures of efficiency (5% discount
rate)
                                  5 percent discount rate
Net present value (US$ million)   7.89
Benefit/Cost ratio                1.82
Economic rate of return           21

Most of the benefits from the project started to be realized from the third year of the project. Under the
base case scenario, the project yielded modest returns on the investment as these returns compare closely
with the rates of returns and measures of project as presented in the PAD with most of the benefits
generated from Component ?.

5. Sensitivity analysis

The total project benefits and measures of economic efficiency are sensitive to the different project
benefits considered. Reduction in one or more of the benefits would affect the net present values and
rates of return of the project. The sensitivities of the project’s results are considered under two scenarios.
    i)       Scenario 1: Reduction in hospital outpatient visits is only 3 percent (in the base case scenario,
             the reduction in hospital visits is 5 percent)
    ii)      Scenario 2: There is an increase in recurrent costs by about 50 percent.

Table A.3.2: Sensitivity analysis under alternative scenarios (5% discount rate)
                                          Scenario 1               Scenario 2
Net present value (Million $)             6.27                     5.37
Benefit/Cost ratio                        1.74                     1.43
Economic rate of return                   18                       14

The sensitivity analysis showed that the returns from the project are positive even under the above two
scenarios. The effect of an increase in recurrent costs seems to have a higher impact on the returns from
the project. On the whole, these results under the base case scenario and the alternative cases are
comparable to the ex-ante results presented in the PAD.

                 MONTENEGRO HEALTH SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PROJECT9

Summary

Common to other transitional countries, Montenegro experienced threats to health status during the
1990s. Conflicts, disasters and considerable macroeconomic changes had an adverse effect on the health
status of the population.
However, despite all difficult factors, the national average of some of the vital indicators has improved
over the past years. It is obvious that Montenegrin population is getting older and its demographic
structure resembles very much the European countries demographic structures. Also, Montenegro has
faced a growing demand for access to quality and efficient health services and health expenditures.
Like many European countries Montenegro has experienced an epidemiological transition and it faces an
increased burden of non-communicable diseases related to high-risk behaviors and inadequate nutrition.
The health status of the poor and other vulnerable groups is particularly at risk.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) plays a central role in providing stewardship function for the health system
and has centralized approach to health system management.

Since 2003 considerable reform efforts were invested in line with ‘Health Services Policy in the Republic
of Montenegro Up to the Year 2020’ (2001) and “Strategy for Health Care Development in Montenegro?
(2003) to strengthen priority areas of health policy, planning and regulation, build further institutional
capacity, improve quality, efficiency and access in primary health care, take measurable steps towards
ensuring financial sustainability of the health care system, improve governance of the health insurance
and health care and develop health information system to support management and clinical care.

In May 2010, the Government of Montenegro adopted the Master plan on development of healthcare
system of Montenegro for the period 2010 – 2013 identifying direction and actions of health interventions
aimed at hospital optimization (introduction of the new payment model based on outputs, redesign of the
health institutions network reflecting the health needs, public private partnership) facilitating delivery of
socially responsive, equitable, accessible and quality services to all the people of Montenegro.

In July 2011 the government adopted the Strategy for secondary and tertiary health care level reform with
the aim to ensure an adequate response to the population’s health needs and enable equal access to quality
health services at the secondary and tertiary level of care to all social groups regardless of their socio-
economic status and geographical distribution

  Project Design, Project Objectives and Implementation

  The development objective of the Health System Improvement Project (PDO) was to put in place the first
  phase of steps towards reform of the health system in Montenegro, giving priority to increasing capacity
  for policy, planning and regulation; stabilizing health financing and improving primary health care service
  delivery. Specifically, the project was intended to: (i) support improvement in financial sustainability of
  the health care system by strengthening institutional capacity and information systems for health policy,
  planning, regulation and management in the MOH, HIF and IPH; (ii) improve quality, efficiency and
  access to primary health care services, by investment in training of staff, facilities and equipment and
  reform of organization and financing of primary care beginning in Podgorica, and extending reform to
  areas outside Podgorica; and (iii) support a project management network (PMN) of the Ministry of
  Health (MOH) and a central Technical Services Unit (TSU) that will provide procurement and financial
  management services for this and other future World Bank-financed projects.

      ? Components

  The project was comprised of the following three components:

      1. Support for health reform program of Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Insurance Fund
         (HIF). This component was directed at helping the government to identify best practice in health
         policy, financing and selected areas of service delivery. The intention was that policy
         development and adoption would be built into the project and supported by it, rather than being
         fully determined ex-ante.
      2. Phased implementation of primary health care development, beginning in Podgorica and
         additional locations in the rest of Montenegro. This component would support phased
         implementation of policy and plans to develop primary health care.
      3. Project management, monitoring and evaluation. It was agreed that the Ministry of Health would
         be the lead implementation agency for the project. It established a project Management Network
         (PMN). Also the central Technical Services Unit (TSU), responsible for carrying out core
         procurement and financial management functions for all future Bank-financed projects, was
         established in the General Secretariat under the office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Within the first two years of project implementation, some of the activities planned under HSIP (such as
the renovation of a few facilities in the PHC Network, the training provided to the PHC doctors, etc.)
were started and did contribute to the successful implementation of the reform in Podgorica. However,
political tensions and unclear division of roles and responsibilities between the regulatory bodies (MOH,
IPH), the purchaser (HIF) and the providers, as well as the arrangement of a network of working groups
proved to be a bottle neck for a smooth and timely project implementation. These factors limited
communication and cooperation among stakeholders and delayed the project implementation with respect
to its original schedule.

The delay put at risk the success of the project and, most importantly, and constituted a serious threat that
the health system would be prevented from delivering the quality, equitable and efficient health services
to the population of Montenegro.

On February 12-17 2007 the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Montenegro Health System Improvement
Project (HSIP) took place. During the MTR, the MOH and other project stakeholders and the Bank team
agreed to restructure the project but to keep the same development objectives as the original project.
Following MTR and restructuring, it was decided that the project activities would continue evolving around
three original components. However, sub-components were revised to reflect a more logical grouping of the
activities financed by the IDA Credit.

The new restructured project reflected the following decisions10:

(1) The implementation of the first phase of the PHC reform will be focused on Podgorica;
(2) The proposal to create a Primary Health Care Support Center in Podgorica has been dropped since the
same planned activities have been integrated into the existing PHC Network; and
(3) the responsibility of leading activities in each component and subcomponent has been transferred from
Working Groups to Institutions in the Government of Montenegro.
During the MTR it was also agreed to reallocate the Credit Proceeds by Category of Expenditures.

      Outputs

COMPONENT 1: SUPPORT FOR HEALTH REFORM PROGRAM

1.1 Health Policy Development
This sub component was intended to support development and implementation of policy and plans with a
particulars focus on the primary health care.

Activities were implemented with the aim to increase quality, efficiency and access in primary healthcare,
and to increase the ‘value-added’ of primary care in the health care system; to promote effective diagnosis
and treatment of a larger number of patients and broader scope of conditions at the primary care level; and
to strengthen the role of primary care in disease prevention.

This sub component was intended to help:
    - reorganization of the PHC service delivery model
    - define the basic benefit package for PHC and secondary and tertiary health care level

     This refers to project restructuring in July 2007


                                                         38
    -   develop norms and standards for service delivery at the PHC and secondary level
    -   develop human resources strategy
    -   develop strategic and operational plan for the implementation of an efficient, effective, equitable
        and sustainable health network of public and private facilities, including development of evidence
        based protocols/guidelines for common conditions and high cost conditions
    -   develop pharmaceutical policy and strengthen institutional capacities.

Actual outputs

At the very beginning of the project implementation the Plan of reform implementation was developed.

The primary health care service delivery was reorganized to include two categories: chosen doctors team
and primary health care support centre under the organizational scheme of Dom Zdravlja (primary health
care centre) as a legal entity. Chosen doctors for women, children and adults were introduced.

The new PHC service delivery model has been elaborated in details in the “New PHC Service
Organizational Model? that was adopted by the Steering Committee of the project.

The registration process of for health insurers was designed and piloted in Podgorica on March 28, 2005.
The registration process was the first visible project activity. To initiate the registration process it was
necessary to secure many legal prerequisites, technical conditions and implement appropriate PR
campaign. The Action plan for registration process with the chosen doctors envisaged all actions to be
take, holders of responsibility and implementation dynamics. There were four working groups in charge
of the registration process: PHC working group, finance working group, IT working group and PR
working group.

From the technical point of view necessary telecommunication conditions were provided, 22 working
posts were equipped, software application was developed to support the registration process and hardware
was procured.

Prior to initiating the registration process, training for 70 nurses was organized to get familiar with the
work on computers (basic course and course for the work with the application software)
Within two years time that is in 2007 the registration model was replicated in Danilovgrad, Rozaje, Tivat
where as of 2008 the registration process was conducted at the national level. Upon completion of the
project the registration rate at the national level was over 83%.

The basic benefit package for PHC was developed and translated into a Government Decree on scope of
rights and standards of health care covered by the compulsory health insurance. The Decree was adopted
by the Government of Montenegro in 2005. This government regulation defines only the basic benefit
package for services provided at the PHC level.

As a result of technical service for planning of health services norms and standards for health care service
delivery, including norms and standards for human resources at the PHC level have been developed. In
2005 the Rulebook on conditions with respect to standards, norms and modes of delivering PHC services
through the chosen doctor was adopted by the Ministry of Health and published in the Official Gazette.

The project supported development of an outline for human resources development in health sector. The
key objective was to ensure a balanced supply, make more effective use of the workforce’s skills, and
provide the ongoing support and education to promote high quality care and effective HHR planning, thus
optimizing the Montenegrin health workforce. As this was an outline of human resources development


                                                    39
tested in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it provided only strategic directions for developing
the Strategy on Human Resources development in health sector.

    International technical assistance was provided to: (i) support institutional and legal context to ensure
    compatibility with EU rules including formulation of by-laws and a pharmaceutical policy. The
    project supported development and adoption of two laws (Law on pharmaceuticals and medical
    devices), and 33 by-laws. (ii) support newly appointed Drugs agency director in developing Study on
    organization and structure of the MDA; (iii) set up and implement transparent pricing and
    procurement system to ensure cost containment and following EU rules; (iv) set up transparent drugs
    registration system in compliance with EU practice; (v) propose and implement drugs information
    system in compliance with overall HIS to transfer utilization and finances information from public
    and private pharmacies to the HIF and drug agency; (vi) set up quality control system. The project
    supported equipping (computer and telecommunication equipment) and furnishing of the MDA.
    Under the project, a local coordinator for pharmaceutical policy was hired to manage and support
    activities and involvement of the Pharmaceuticals working group in the reform process.

1.2 Health Financing

This sub component was intended to provide expert advice on key areas of health finance policy ,
including evaluation and refinement of the primary health care payment model, budget planning,
expenditure and revenue forecasting and analysis and resource allocation. Under the project the basic
benefit package was supposed to be defined and coasted. It was also intended to provide advice on
options for payment for secondary and tertiary health care.

The project was designed to support capacity building of the key staff in the Ministry of health, Health
insurance fund, Institute of public health and health care institutions about health finance and health
finance reform.

Actual outputs

As a result of provided technical assistance through the project, a new payment model for PHC was
developed. It envisaged combination of capitation and fee for service to depart from the traditional
payment based on input factors. The new payment model was introduced into the practice at the country
level as of 2009.

Capitation/fee for service payment was simulated and supported by development of a temporary PHC
software which was implemented in the HIF to keep records of services produced, generate automatically
reports on services provided, generate automatically invoices and submit them to the HIF where they
were reviewed and analyzed.

Development, implementation and maintenance of the PHC temporary software has been fully financed
by the HIF.

COMPONENT 2: IMPLEMENTATION OF PHC REFORM IN PODGORICA
2.1 Renovation of PHC Network

This sub component was to support conduct of civil works in the form of construction, reconstruction and
adaptation with the view of securing sufficient space required for implementation of the new PHC service
delivery organizational model in Podgorica. Also, equipping and furnishing of the PHC premises in
Podgorica was envisaged. PHC medical and non-medical equipment was required to bring the PHC group


                                                    40
practices in Podgorica up to standard and support PHC diagnosis and procedures as well as to avoid
inappropriate referral to hospitals.

Actual outputs

Following development and adoption of the Model of organization of the PHC system, technical expertise
was mobilized to develop the Program on spatial organization of the PHC in Podgorica. The program was
developed to elaborate clearly how the Model of organization of the PHC system will be supported from
the functional point of view. The project supported implementation of civil works on all sites as per the
Program on spatial organization. Due to cost over runs, the government financed completion of civil
works on the following sites: Nova, Varos and Stara Varos.

The project supported procurement of medical equipment for diagnostics and therapeutic services
provided by the chosen doctors and in Support centers, as well as the non medical equipment and
furniture.

2.2 Health and financial information system

The project was intended to focus on HIS investments that were recognized as necessary to support the
development objectives of the project, including introduction of primary health care, and the creation of
an efficient, effective and integrated information system for the entire health system.

The following activities were supposed to be supported under the project:

(a) Identification of Information Flows and Needs - to examine information flows (both within and
between institutions), as well as the information needs for management decision-making for the Ministry
of Health, and the Health Insurance Fund, and within and between these institutions and other health
service providers.
(b) Information Systems Plan for the Institute of Public Health - to define the parameters to be monitored
by the IPH, examine the best method of reporting and monitoring these indicators, define data sources,
method of inclusion and processing; report users, method and schedule of distribution, and develop an
implementation strategy to achieve these objectives.
c) Information system for the Ministry of health
(d) Primary Health Care Information Systems

Actual outputs

As a result of technical assistance mobilized under the project the following activities were implemented:

    -   IT support provided to the registration process. This included: development of a detailed Action
        plan for implementation, development of hardware specification, development of functional
        requirements for software application, development of technical specification for communication
        equipment, software development, training to use computers and software application, hardware
        procurement,
    -   IT system concept was developed. Assessment of needs for IT system and support on the part of
        different stakeholders was conducted. Strategy on IT harmonization was developed. Functional
        requirements for software development were produced. Also, the project supported development
        of technical specification for hardware and communication equipment.
    -   Software development – software application for the PHC; application software for the HIF. The
        software application was introduced into practice.


                                                    41
    -   Hardware procurement – hardware was procured as per the technical specifications for all
        primary health care facilities at the national level and Health insurance fund.
    -   Capacity building activities- several study tours were organized to acquire knowledge and
        exchange experience on the recent developments of the health information systems.

2.3 Training

This sub component was to support retraining of PHC doctors and nurses to refresh their theoretical
knowledge and skills and shift the health system to center around the family medicine. This intervention
was indispensable to ensure that chosen doctors’ teams would be able to deliver under the new roles and
responsibilities assigned as per the new Model of primary health care organization. Also, it was planned
to support under the AF formal introduction of a department for Family medicine at the Medicine faculty
and post graduate formal education in the field of primary health care.

Actual outputs:

The project supported development of the Model of re-training for doctors and nurses that envisaged
implementation of the: (i) main training course covering 250 hours, and (ii) optional training course
covering 50 hours.

The main course was mandatory for all PHC doctors and nurses, and it was conducted twice a year during
the project life. According to the Model of re-training some training programs were attended jointly by
doctors and nurse. Optional courses did not apply to nurses.

Prior to embarking into the re training of doctors and nurses, a comprehensive training needs assessment
was conducted. Training needs assessment provided relevant inputs for development of the Re-training
plan, program and methodology.

2.4 Communication (PR)

This sub-component was to support promotion of health care reform and introduction of the new PHC
organizational model (selection of the chosen doctors) into the health system in Montenegro.

Actual outputs

The PR campaign was designed and implemented. Also, public opinion surveys were focused on the
degree of awareness of the reform, its benefits and novelties, as well as citizens’ perception of the
problems in healthcare. Survey reports have demonstrated that health is an important segment of everyday
life and preoccupies most citizens. But it also became evident that in time positive trends in terms of
perception, support and confidence were recognized.

COMPONENT 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

    Project management network and Technical services unit (TSU)

According to the project, the Ministry of Health would be the lead implementation agency for the project,
responsible for project management. It was necessary to establish a Project Management Network (PMN),
consisting of a full-time project coordinator, an administrative assistant, including coordinators for the
relevant project components.



                                                   42
The Government of Montenegro decided to establish a central Technical Services Unit (TSU), responsible
for carrying out core procurement and financial management functions for all future Bank-financed
projects, and potentially for other donor-supported projects. This TSU was established in the General
Secretariat (under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister). The TSU employed a full time procurement
officer and finance officer.

Actual output:

The Project management network was established and comprised of the project coordinator and
administrative assistant.

During the project life several component coordinators were hired:
   - PHC coordinator
   - Coordinator for health policy
   - Finance health coordinator
   - IT coordinator
   - PR coordinator
   - Training coordinator
   - Pharmaceuticals coordinator

The Government of Montenegro passed a decision to establish a project Steering committee providing
strategic guidance for project implementation. The Steering committee consisted of the key stakeholders’
representatives (Ministry of health, Institute of public health, Health insurance fund, PHC, Medical
faculty ) to ensure their full involvement in the decision making process on the key project
implementation issues. The PMN office provided secretarial support.

TSU was also established as it was envisaged by the project and it was fully financed by the project.

b) Additional financing

The original Project Development Objective remained the same. Under the additional financing the
Project Development Objective is supported through the same three original components.

COMPONENT 1: SUPPORT FOR HEALTH REFORM PROGRAM

1.1 Health policy development and capacity building

Under this sub –component it was planned to provide technical assistance in development of a secondary
and tertiary care health sector reform strategy. The elements of this reform would include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the plans and normative framework for the health network; defining the package
of services financed by the state (and those that are not financed); defining an output based (i.e. diagnostic
related groups or DRGs) payment mechanism and contracts between the providers and insurer;
developing the priority clinical guidelines to ensure effective and efficient delivery of the state financed
services; executing a workforce study in the health care system with recommendations according to
international norms and standards; determining models of public and private cooperation in the delivery
of health services, including defining appropriate models and proposing legislative solutions; and using
communications and information to ensure stakeholder involvement and buy-in to the reform strategy.

Another priority for intervention was further development of the MDA’s capacity, as an entity responsible
for the regulation and oversight of the pharmaceutical sector. Establishment of a quality assurance system


                                                     43
was also recognized as an area requiring technical support under the project. It was planned to support
development of the health service quality assurance strategy.

Actual outputs

As a result of mobilizing the international and local technical expertise the Network of public health
institutions and Plan for development of human resources in health for 2012-2022 were

Under the project, the IPH produced the proposal on the Basic benefit package of services to be provided
at the secondary and tertiary health care level, including Methodology for costing the basic benefit
package. The HIF assisted with the international consortium and with strong involvement of the key
policy makers in the health sector proposed a new mechanism of payment for services provided at the
secondary and tertiary level. The project also supported the process of defining the National strategy for
quality assurance in health sector. The Strategy was adopted by the Government of Montenegro in 2012.

Work on development of the Strategy on integration of private health care institutions into the network of
health institutions was also successfully completed.

The project supported numerous activities with the view of strengthening MDA capacity.

1.2 Health Information System

The objective of this sub component was to ensure support for the health policy reform results and
complement on-going investments of the Health insurance fund. It was decided to carry out procurement
of computer and related equipment to establish the information system between hospitals and the
insurance fund.

Actual outputs

The project supported development of functional requirements for software application, software design
and software implementation in three institutions: Institute of public health, Ministry of health and Drugs
agency. Required computer and related equipment was procured in order to support the software
solutions and their installation in the Institute of public health, Ministry of health and Drugs agency. The
project did not support development of the hospital information system, as that was supported by the
Health insurance fund in its entirety.


COMPONENT 2: Phased Implementation of Primary Health Care Development.

2.1 Podgorica Phase I implementation

       It was planned to provide technical assistance to support the Ministry of health in monitoring and
        assessing the implementation of the primary health care reform. In order to better inform the next
        stage of PHC reform under the additional financing, a primary health care (PHC) study was
        conducted to: (i) get a complete overview of the current PHC centres performance by analyzing
        the revenues, costs, and productivity of (PHC) facilities, (ii) examine the performance of Chosen
        Doctors Teams in delivering services, and evaluate the impact of new provider payment reforms
        on the efficiency, performance, and management of (PHC) facilities.




                                                    44
2.3 PHC Professional Training

This sub component was to: (i) provide further technical assistance in establishing a Family Medicine
specialization in the medical faculties, (ii) support the nation-wide upgrade of primary health care
services through the provision of re-training of doctors and nurses; and (iii) procure medical equipment
for the offices of the “Chosen Doctor? and the diagnostic services in the Health Centres outside of
Podgorica.

Actual outputs

The project supported realization of two re-training courses for doctors and nurses (round 10 and round
11).
Technical assistance was provided to develop formal curriculum for Family medicine, which was
introduced into the official undergraduate program at the Medical faculty. Additionally, the project
supported capacity building and four persons were fully trained to be able to deliver the Family medicine
curriculum.
Project activities resulted in development of the family medicine specialization program.

2.4 Scaling up Reform Outside Podgorica

Physical upgrade (rehabilitation and extension) of the Primary Health Care Center in Bijelo Polje (with
co-financing from the Health Insurance Fund and Bijelo Polje municipality) was considered as a priority
intervention area due to poor conditions for providing health services.

Actual outputs

The project supported revitalization (reconstruction and extension) of the PHC Centre in Bijelo Polje and
procurement of modern medical (diagnostic and therapeutic) equipment. The facility was opened and
became fully functional in December 2012.

COMPONENT 3: Project Management

Due to the extension of the project, the Additional Financing continued to support the functioning of the
Project Management Network through the provision of technical assistance, training and the operating
costs of the dedicated office as well as proportional cost of the staff and operating costs of the TSU.

Actual outputs

The Project Management Network was functional throughout the project implementation. Due to the
work load the PMN office was extended by hiring an administrative assistant, whereas the current
administrative assistant was promoted to project coordinator assistant. The project co-shared costs of the
services provided by the Technical services unit.
