REPORTf AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
-     A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA FOR
AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Credit to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent of US$7.5 million on
standard IDA texms, to help finance an Agricultural Credit Project. US$7.1
million will be relent for on-farm investment through the Agricultural Bank
and commercial banks. Large and medium size ranchers and farmers would
borrow either at 4% with repayments indexed to the La Paz cost of living
or at 14% with readjustment of the principal based on the rate of exchange
between the dollar and the Bolivian peso. Small farmers would borrow at 12%
interest rate without indexing. Subloans to farmers would have repayment
and grace periods varying according to the nature of the product. The
remaining US$0.4 million of the Credit will be used for project adninistration
and agricultural research.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Bolivia" (WH-213a) dated November 9, 1972 was distributed to the Executive
Directors in 1972.  A new economic report is near completion and will be dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors in the near future. Country data sheets
are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains the poorest
country in South America. The majority of the population is engaged in tra-
ditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force participates in
salaried activities in the modern sectors. The infrastructure is still very
primitive and the road and rail networks cover only a fraction of the country.
The combination of strong traditional ties within the Indian communities and
geographic, health and educational obstacles to population mobility has per-
petuated the demographic concentration on the barren, windswept and dry 10-15
thousand feet plateau lands of Bolivia known as the Altiplano. About half of
Bolivia's population lives a physically, culturally and economically isolated
subsistence existence in this inhospitable region which is rich in mineral
deposits but limited in agricultural resources.
4.        The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual economic
structure which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and
to deprive the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This
objective was only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating
fuedal relations, distributing the land and eliminating obstacles to social



-2-
mobility. The agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines, how-
ever, were followed by declines in agricultural, mining and manufacturing
production. GDP declined in the 1950s and did not recover to its pre-1952
level until 1961. During the subsequent decade, output increased steadily
at an average annual rate of around 5%, providing for average annual per
capita income increases of 2.5%. As a result, GNP per capita which had
fallen by 24% in the 1952-60 period had recovered, by 1970, to the 1952
level and was better distributed.
5.        In 1971, the momentum of econoinic growth was again lost because
of pulitical instabi7ity and deteriorating public finances. Private invest-
ment fell and public investment was unable to fill. the shortfall due to lack
of ftnancial resources. The deterioration of public finances reflected a
stru-tural flaw in the economy.  Since the expropriations of 1952, Bolivia's
public sector became proportionatel;y one of the largest in South America and
a source of livelihood for a sizeable segment of the population. With the
scarcity of emplcymentr opportunities in the private sector, pressures to
exoarid the ranks ,Dl public servants proved difficult to resist. Increased
expend]itures on wages and salaries, combined with a weak tax system, left
few resources for irnvestmnent. Moreover, the inability of the public sector
to generate adequate ;3avings limited its capacity to utilize external assist-
an e.
6.        On coTaing to p,ow :r in 1971, Presiderrt Banzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the unemployed and to set the basis for investment growth.
This need f;as faced in the context of a sharp deterioration in Bolivia's
t_ims of tr-ade wi4ch declirned by about 20% in 1971. In late 1971, the
-iove,nrent put into e-ffect an "'Thergency Program" aimed at creating jobs in
public works. `o establish a more favorable climaLte for private investment,
new law!s offering g-iarantees and incentives to private investors were promul-
gated. ITr addition, the Co-venurent settled cla:imas arising from earlier
nationali3ations.  4t the same time, the Goverrinent also improved public
admiriistration, and the pricing policies of some public undertakings. These
policises were successfld in fn r.-easing private investment and in bolstering
t`he rate of growth. Th2y ~iLso resulted, however, in a large budgetary
deficit and losses of international reserves.
Recent Economic DeveloE2ents
7.        The most important event affecting recent economic performance has
been thd substantial imDroverient in the tenns of trade in 1974 caused by the
increases in petroleum and mineral prices. Although GDP growth slowed down
to about 5% i4r 1974 --due t;o slower agricultural. growth, stagnant hydrocarbon
out put andi a fall in mining, output-- the substant,ial gain in the terms of
trade has allowed a simultaneous and large expansion of both consumption and
investment.
8.        There has been a significant improvement in Central Goverrmnent
revenue and in overall public savings. The increase in Central Goverment
current revenue in 1974 was close to 20% in real terms. Over one-half of
this increase was due to higher export prices. Current expenditures



-3-
increased only by about 5%. The Central Government achieved a current
surplus --after running current deficits during 1971-73-- equivalent to
nearly 50% of its capital expenditures, which were about 17% above the 1973
level. Savings of the public sector as a whole in 1974 increased to nearly
10% of GDP, exceeding the sector's capital expenditures and producing an
overall surplus. In contrast to previous years when borrowing from the
domestic banking system financed close to 40% of the public sector deficit,
outstanding net credit to the public sector has been reduced by one-half
between the end of 1973 and August 1974, and public sector deposits with
the banking system increased by about $b2.4 billion for the whole of 1974.
9.        The strong balance of payments perfonnance in 1974 was the result
of sharp price increases for Bolivia's principal export commodities. On
average, export prices nearly doubled in 1974, following an increase of 25%
during the previous year. The average price of Bolivia's light crude low
sulphur petroleum was about US$15 per barrel in 1974 compared to US$4.13
in 1973. Prices of minerals and sugar also nearly doubled in 1974. Natural
gas prices increased less. However, a new long-texm contract has been
negotiated with Argentina, still Bolivia's sole natural gas customer, which
will provide substantially higher prices from 1975 onwards. On the other
hand, import price rises approached 30-35% with much higher increases for
mining and petroleum drilling equipment, items which are becoming an
increasingly important component of Bolivia's imports. Nevertheless, the
terms of trade gain in 1974 was equivalent to about 9% of GDP and the trade
surplus reached about US$180 million. In spite of the deficit on service
account because of higher transport costs and larger factor service payments
abroad, there waS a current account surplus of nearly US$80 million.  It is
estimated that net capital inflows approached US$65 million, nearly four
times their 1973 level, primarily as a result of substantially higher dis-
bursements of loans to the public sector. The gain in net foreign reserves
in 1974 was US$145 million.  This brought total reserves to US$176 million,
representing over four months of imports.
10.       The growth of the Bolivian economy was accompanied by continuing
wage-price pressures during 1973-74. As a result, in part, of the openness
of the economy, Bolivia in the 1960s enjoyed relatively low rates of infla-
tion. The substantial devaluation at the end of 1972, however, unleashed
inflationary pressures. These pressures were accentuated by sharply rising
international prices during 1973/74, the spillover of excessive credit
expansion of past years, and the acceleration of wage increases following
the 1972 devaluation. The retail price index for La Paz (the only price
index available in Bolivia) rose 31.5% in 1973 and nearly 30% during the
first two months of 1974 as prices of basic commodities were sharply in-
creased by the Government in an effort to bring them into line with inter-
national prices.  In addition, some public service tariffs, such as those
for railways and electricity, were increased by the Government. Since then
price rises have slowed to a monthly average of 1-1.5%. The increase in
retail prices for 1974 was about 45%.



-4 -
Debt Service and Greditworthineas
11.       Bolivia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at end-
1974 amounted to US$723 million, equivalent to over 41% of that year's GNP.
Service on external public clebt amounted to 12.9% of exports of goods and
non-factor services net of investment income abroad. This represents a
considerable reduction from the debt burden of previous years which fre-
quently absorbed 15-20% of net export receipts. Average terms of the
external debt outstanding hawe remained soft, reflecting the high proportion
of concessionary aid channelled to Bolivia. Average interest in 1973 was
4.4% and average maturity about 26 years,
12.       This position is bound to change, howe7ver5 as it can be expected
that lending teris will became harder and the slare of loans on convent.ional
terms wiil increase.  of newi loans attracted during 1974, nearly One-half
were from commercial banking soarces. With substantial disbursements envi-
saged during the next six years, external public de(bt outstanding by 1980
might be as high as US$1.9 billionx (in current pi-ices) the service of whiLch
would absorb some 19% of net export receipts. In view of these heavy cormiD.t-
ments, prudence in choosing e-xter,al capital sources nd insistence on utiUiz
ing external capital for high prior:-irty purposes will have to become an essen-
tial element of Bolivia's external debt management.
13.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons which has tI'Jo be developed to sustain rapid economic growth
and, in particular, rapid expEansion of export earnrings in thle foreseeable
future. If production in the export sectors can be increased as plaELMed and
prices for the country's major export pI-oduts (cils gas, minerals) stay
relatively firm, Bolivia can be considered creditworthy for substanvially
increased amounts of external lending on conventiocinal term.s.  Nevertheless,
some additional lending on soft teras is justified by Bolivia's poverty and
its large and continuing external capital requirements  Even unLder thie best
circumstances, the country pill requi-e substantial external fT_nancing of
investment to supplement the domestic savings effort at least unmitil the
early 1980s, including some local cost financing. This is justified since,
during the past two years, the Government has made a serious effort to mobili;e
domestic resources and prepare a development program for Boli3;ia. However, the
implementation of this program will require externnal assistance wel' in exceCs
of the foreign exchange component of suitable project presently available for
international financing. Although substantially increased supplier and finan-
cial credits will probably become available, they will at the most meet 45% of
the public capital inflow required during 1975-80 for meeting projected grows>h
targets. To finance the remaining gap of almost US$650 million, Bolivia wiLl
also require international development financing, includeing an expanded Bank
lending program.



-5-
PART II - THE BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
14.       Bolivia is an original member of the Bank but did not receive
Bank Group resources until 1964. Bank Group assistance to Bolivia has been
limited by the country's tight budgetary situation and its limited capacity
to service external debt. Except for one Bank loan to help finance an
"enclave" project, and for the Second Railway project lending to Bolivia
has been in the form of IDA credits. Because of the narrow scope for
private investment, the first IFC investment, amounting to Us$400,000 in a
cable and plastic products enterprise, was made only in 1973.
15.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects. IDA has made previously, three credits for livestock
development (US$10.2 million), four credits for power generation and dis-
tribution (US$28.4 million), one credit to the railways for US$8 million
and one for mining (US$6.2 million). The Bank has made a loan (US$23.5
million) to help finance an "enclave" project for the construction of a
pipeline to transport natural gas to Argentina and a loan (US$32 million)
for the Second Railway project.
16.       The proposed credit would be the tenth credit and the thirteenth
Bank Group operation in Bolivia. Net of undiSbursed balances,- Bolivia's
debt to the Bank and IDA now represents 8.3% of its external public indebted-
ness. This ratio might increase to 9.3% by 1980. The share of the Bank
Group in total debt service is now about 4% and is expected to increase
marginally to about 4.3% in 1980. Although the Bank Group has ranked below
the U.S. Government and the IDB as a source of financial assistance to
Bolivia, its role has been expanding. In the period 1964-68, the first
five years of Bank/IDA lending to Bolivia, IDA credits of US$17 million
were made. Additional Bank/IDA loans and credits of US$59.1 million, or
more than three times the credits made during the first five years, have
been made to Bolivia since then.
17.       Future Bank Group activities will give emphasis to supporting
Government efforts to remedy imbalances in the distribution of the benefits
of economic growth. About half of future Bank lending is planned for agri-
culture, where priority will be given to the needs of poor farmers. (See
paras. 23-25). The Bank Group's assistance to infrastructure projects will
be concentrated in transportation, where we have selected specific areas in
which we believe serious constraints to development exist and Bank assistance
could be most effectively utilized. Thus, in addition to the second railway
project, we are contemplating an eventual third project to complete the
planned rehabilitation of the railways. We are also contemplating an airport
and air navigation aids equipment project which will permit access to isolated
areas of economic activity, where transportation needs are not now adequately
served. In the power sector, we contemplate participating in the financing
of a national interconnection project, once the difficult issue of tariffs
has been resolved.



-6-
18.       A common element of constraint in most development activities in
Bolivia is institutional capacity. We plan to finance projects in rural
development, small scale agro-industries, forestry, fisheries, water supply
and rural education which will contain significant elements for technical
assistance and focus on developing institutional capacity. We also hope
to be able to continue lending in the mining sector, where the existing IDA
credit provides for technical assistance. Our future financing to that
sector will furnish credit assistance to small and medium producers.
19.       In addition to the railway project, which was presented to the
Board on June 3, 1975, project preparation is well advanced for two other
projects. One is an integratled rural development project for poor farmers
in the Altiplano. The project is expected to assist 4,000 families. The
second is a project designed to meet the pressing credit needs of medium
size mining enterprises. It is also possible that this project might
con-taiII 9. component for industrial credit, if the industrial credit needs
of the development bank handling mining credit are not adequately met by
other external lenders, such as the IDB.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Overall performance of the agricultural sector during 1968-74 was
mixed and according -to some indicators showed a decline in the sector's
relative importance. Thus, while GDP growth during 1968-74 averaged about
h.8% p.a., that of agriculture grew only at 3.9% p.a. and the sector's share
of GDP decreased from a high of 30% (1962) to about 21% in 1974. However,
in spite of agriculture's relatively small contribut;ion to total exports
(about 7%), the volme of agricultural exports has been increasing rapidly
during the past two years. The increase has come from the exceptional
expansion in commercial agricultural production of :Livestock, cotton, sugar-
cane and soybeans in the Beni and Santa Cruz regions.  Some small gains have
also beer made in the produc-tion of foods for domestic consumption by the
subsistence sector. They were achieved mainly by additional inputs of
labor and utilization of improved seeds rather than by any significant
increase in the flow of credit, increase in acreage, introduction of improved
technology or utilization of improved agricultural -tools. By contrast, the
expansion in the commiercial sector stimulated by high prices for cotton,
sugarcane and livestock on the world markets, was achieved mainly through
bringing additional land under cultivation, a reasonable supply of credit
and mechanization.  The major expansion has been sustained by credit received
from. the Banco Agricola de Bolivia (EAB3). the Central Bank through its
rediscount operations and foreign banks operating in Bolivia.  In general,
medium and long term agricultural credit is scarce and its allocation between
subsistence and commercial farmers has been highly skewed in favor of large
and medium size farmers. Of all available agricultural credit, about 81% is
estimated to have been lent to cormmercial farmers in Santa Cruz and the Beni.
Developmoent has been slowest in the Altiplano and the Valles regions which



-7-
contain the majority of the rural population and provide most of the output
of minerals and staple foods. Yields and production have remained low in
these regions, which are inhabitated by the rural poor who live on sub-
sistence agriculture and outside the market economy.
21.       There is evidence that the living standards of the rural poor could
be improved considerably provided the Government takes a number of essential
measures. These would consist of the following: (a) preparation and execution
of investment programs and the establishment of a proper institutional frame-
work to execute such programs in the Altiplano, the Valles and the Yungas;
(b) channeling of adequate credit and technical assistance to snall farmers
in support of such programs; (c) organizing snall landholders into cooperatives
or other functional groups; and (d) research to develop appropriate crop va-
rieties for the climatic conditions of the Altiplanos the Valles and the Yungas.
22.       The present administration is well aware of the need to adopt such
measures and with external assistance has recently begun to reform the relevant
institutions and to improve sector management capabilities. Thus, in early
1974, the two previous Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Affairs were merged.
USAID is presently considering provision of technical assistance to improve the
Ministry's capabilities in the formulation of policies, sector planning and
coordination and supervision of investment programs. It is also providing
technical and financial assistance to the National Community Development Services
(SNCD) in order to help this agency expand its role since, so far, it has mainly
been active in financing only infrastructure projects in rural areas. IDB is
planning assistance in the field of agricultural research. A reorganization
study for the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB) in order to improve the
efficiency of this institution will be financed from IDA's Credit 261-30. While
these efforts get uxnderway, the production momentum generated by the commercial
sector should be sustained in order to keep established and develop new markets
for Bolivia's agricultural exports, including beef. It is our intention to
assist the Government also in this aspect.
Bank Group Strategy in the Agricultural Sector
23.       IDA's efforts since 1967 to foster expansion of beef production in
the Beni through the financing of three livestock projects have the following
long-range objectives: (i) to improve management of cattle ranchers on the
basis of modern technical and economic criteria; (ii) to improve processing
and marketing of beef from Beni on the basis of a marketing study financed
under the Third Livestock Project (Credit 261-Bo); and (iii) to stimulate other
economic activities and encourage the Government to provide better infrastructure
for the region.. However, IDA has been discussing with the Government beef price
and export controls. Since beef is the most important source of protein in
Bolivia, the Government feels that beef must be sold at reasonably stable prices
in order to provide Bolivians with an adequate diet and therefore has been reluc-
tant to liberalize prices.  Present policies, however, have not resulted in
serious distortions and continue to provide the necessary incentives to invest
in livestock development. The Development Credit Agreement (Section 4.02)
provides that the Government maintain a price policy aimed at stimulating agri-
cultural production and providing adequate incentives to farmers.



- 8 -
24.       The proposed Agricultural Credit Project, while continuing assist-
ance to the Beni ranchers, also includes a substantial small farmer component..
In this and subsequent projects, we intend to place increasingly greater
emphasis on helping subsistence farmers in the Altiplano, the Valles and the
Yungas. To that end, we have begun a dialogue with the Government to encourage
the fordulation of appropriate policies and to identify a suitable institution
for dealing with small farmers since BAB is likely to concentrate increasingly
on providing effective service to ranchers and commercial farmers. We are
appraising a first Altiplano integrated rural development project and hope t-his
will be followed by other projects assisting small farmers. In addition,
there are three subsectors in which Bolivia's potential is good, but develop-
ment is lagging: (i) agro-industry; (ii) forestry and (iii) fisheries. We
see the Bank's role in these sectors as that of a catalyst in identifying and
helping the Government finance high priority projects which would contribute
to diversifying Bolivia's exports and at the same time create additional.
employment opportunities in poor rural areas.
25.       In addition to the d_ialogue concerning small farmers, we will
continue active discussions with the Covermnent to encourage further improve-
ments in price and interest rate policies, marketing arrangements, and we
will also seek ways to help improve extension and research services.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The Goverrnment of Bolivia has requested an IDA credit to help
finance the expansion of prodiuction of cattle, sheep and crops in selected
areas of the lowlands, the ALtiplano and the Valles.. The project was
appraised by an IDA mission which visited Bolivia in June 1974. A report,
entitled "Appraisal of the Agricultural Credit Project," No. 695a-B0 dated
June 6, 1975 is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A credit and project sumnary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took
place in Washington from May 5 to May 12. The Government of Bolivia was
represented by Messrs. David Blanco, Julio Gamba and Jorge Balcazar, the
Bolivian Agricultural Bank (BAB) was represented by Messrs. Carlos Taborga
and Fernando Garron and the private banks were represented by Mr. Alberto Valdez.
Background
27.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's fourth operation to
assist Bolivia's agricultural development. The first two credits for a
total of US$3.4 million, signed in 1967 and 1970, financed the development of
approximately 300 cattle ranches and provided for the establishment of an
autonomous Livestock Project Division (LPD), within BAB to manage and provide
technical services for the projects.  A third IDA Credit of US$6.8 million to
assist further development of the cattle investment programs started under
the former two credits was signed in 1971. This project has financed ranch-
investment in Alto Beni. and Chapare, sheep breeding in the Altiplano, a meat
marketing study and the construction of slaughter and freezing facilities.



-9-
28.       Implementation of the Third Livestock Project slowed down in 1974
for several reasons. Extensive areas in the Beni were flooded during early
1974 and disrupted lending operations; lending for sheep has slowed dowm
because of delays in formation of farmers cooperatives in the project areas;
delays in reaching agreement on a workable form of indexing, and the dete-
rioration of BAB's financial position due to lack of management controls.
The Government has since taken measures to improve BAB's operations and
strengthen it financially, and has appointed a new General Manager. There-
fore, it is anticipated that Credit 261-Ba will be fully committed by early
1976 and fully disbursed by the original closing date of June 30, 1977.
Project Description
29.       The proposed project aims at increasing production of food for
domestic and export markets. In addition to complementing the development
efforts started under previous IDA operations in the Beni and expanding it
to the Santa Cruz region, IDA will finance for the first time in Bolivia
cultivation of crops to help improve the economic conditions of about 3,600
poor rural families. This assistance would help the Government to initiate
a more balanced regional growth pattern by channeling resources to less
privileged agricultural regions.
30.       The project would provide credit for the following:
a. Livestock (i)   continuation of the cattle development
program in the Beni by medium and large
size ranchers and of sheep breeding by
subsistence farmers in the Altiplano;
(ii) development of cattle by medium size
farmers in Santa Cruz;
b. Crops      (i) production of sugarcane by small farmers
in Santa Cruz;
(ii)  cultivation of potatoes, wheat and oats
by mall farmers in Cochabamba; and
(iii) growing of grapes by small farmers in Tarija.
In addition, the project will also contribute to financing the cost of agri-
cultural research in Saavedra (Santa Cruz).
Project Adninistration
31.       A project account would be established in the Central Bank through
which Government and IDA funds would be onlent to participating institutions;
i.e.., BAB and commercial banks. The staff of the Agricultural and Livestock
Division (ALPD) in BAB would manage the project and approve the technical and
financial aspects of the farm plans including those prepared by commercial
banks. The core of ALPD staff would be built up around the former LPD which



- 10 -
would be expanded to handle lending for crops and for additional livestock
under the proposed project. The proposed Project Agreement provides (Section
2.02) that ALPD will be established within BAB and would be headed by a
Director assisted by a deputy. The internationally recruited deputy would be
in charge of ALPD's technical and administrative affairs. ALPD would provide
technical assistance to project beneficiaries engaged in the development of
livestock, sheep, sugarcane and grapes. It would supervise A.S.A.R.'sl/
technical assistance services to small farmers cultivating potatoes, wheat
and oats in Cochabamba. A.S.A.R. would help farmers to prepare loan requests
for submission to conmercial banks and would assist beneficiaries in selling
their harvests.
32.       The proposed Development Credit Agreement (Section 4.01) provides
that the Government would give priority to granting land titles to project
beneficiaries by assigning some of its land titling mobile units to work in
the project areas. The Government has also agreed to expand its agricultural
experimental programs at the Saavedra station in Santa Cruz by adding to its
ongoing research programs experiments in crop/pasture rotation designed to
help project beneficiaries increase their productivity. To ensure execution
of high priority research programs which are relevant to project needs, the
crop rotation study programs will be coordinated with the Director of ALPD.
33.       Overall project performance would be measured by a special monitor-
ing unit which BAB has agreed to establish within ALPD according to the
Project Agreement (Section 2.05). Also, the Project Agreement (Section 3.03)
provides that BAB will within 18 months review with IDA the administrative
status of AdLPD in the context of overall progress being made in the restructur-
ing of BAB's organization.
Credit Channels
A. The Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB)
34.       BAB is a Goverrnent-owned auttonomous entit-y which was established
in 1942 and reorganized in 1963 and 1974. Overall supervision of BAB's
operations is shared among the Ministry of Peasant and Agricultural Affairs
(MPKA.) (technical) the Ministry of Finance (financial) and the Central Bank
(cost accounting and legal). BAB has a staff of about 290 and 66 branch
offices located throughout the country. Since July 1974, BAB has reduced
the number of its operational units from seven to two divisions: Credit
and Finance/Administration.
35.       by the end of 1973, BAB's total resources amounted to about,$b69O
million of which $b614 million were in loans and $b76 million in equity.
Between 1970 and 1973, BAB's debt equity ratio increased from 1.2 to 6.5
and its overdue loans represented about 30% of the loan volume outstanding

Rural AUtisans.



as of March 31, 1974. Over the past few years, BAB has been decapitalized
mainly because: (i) it carried the foreign exchange risk on external loans
and was severely affected by the devaluation of the Bolivian peso in 1972;
(ii) it undertook unprofitable rice marketing activities (another specialized
agency has since assumed this task); and (iii) it operated on insufficient
margins to cover rising administrative expenditures. The Government is
determined to strengthen BAB, the only agricultural credit organization in
the country, and has already contributed US$0.5 million for its recapital-
ization. In addition, the Development Credit Agreement (Section 3.01(c))
provides that the Government would contribute US$4.3 million to BAB's equity
over a period of two years. Moreover, the Government has taken already a
number of important measures which are likely to improve BAB's overall
performance in the long run. It has appointed a new Board of Directors, a
new General Manager, and has dismissed a considerable number of BAB's staff
which were found unqualified. Also, BAB is expected to undertake in June 1975
a study, with the assistance of consultants to be financed from Credit 261-BO,
of BAB's overall organizational, financial and accounting system as provided
in the Project Agreement (Section 3.01(a) and (b)). The study would recommend
how to strengthen BAB and would examine its future role within the agricultural
sector. Section 3.01(c) provides that BAB will implement its reorganization
programs not later than the end of 1977.
B. Commercial Banks
36.       About 10 Bolivian commercial banks operate in the project area and
have agreed in principle to participate in the proposed project by contributing
about US$0.9 million equivalent to the project's credit component. The Develop-
ment Credit Agreement (Section 3.04) provides that the Government would make up
the shortfall on the US$0.9 million should the banks decide not to contribute
this amount to the proposed project. Since these banks' lending for agriculture
has so far been limited, ALPD's and A.S.A.R.'s staff would provide technical
and administrative assistance to borrowing fanners until commercial banks have
trained their own agricultural technicians. The participation of commercial
banks would have the following advantages: (i) it would introduce private
banks' expertise in fields usually left to agencies in the public sector; (ii)
it also would introduce more competition in lending to farmers; (iii) it would
provide added flexibility; and (iv) it would allow the project to be extended
to regions which otherwise would have to be excluded because of staff and
resource constraints in DAB.
On-Farm Investment
37.       About 4,600 families will benefit from the on-farm investment credit
available under the project. Approximately 930 families engaged in ranching in
the Beni and Santa Cruz, most of whom in the past already have received some
assistance from either IDA or IDB, would receive additional loans to cover 65%
of on-farm investment. No other medium or long term lines of credit would be
available for this purpose over the next few years. In addition, the project
would include a new component aiming at about 3,600 small and subsistence
farmers who have received hardly any assistance in the past. The amount to



- 12 -
be channeled has been estimated on the basis of: (i) the number of loan
applications which can reasonably be processed in the next two years through
the proposed organizational arTangement; and (ii) the individual farmer's
needs, which are generally not very large. To ensure adequate participation
of small farmers in the proposed project, the Development Credit Agreement
(paragraph 5 (a) of Schedule 1) provides that subloans for cattle will not
exceed 55% of the amount of the credit allocated to on-farm investment.
Lending to sugarcane and grape farmers will be limited to those having up to
50 ha  and 4 ha, respectively (paragraph B.l of Schedule 3).   Such limitations
are not necessary for farmers breeding sheep in the Altiplano where groups
of 20 families would have about 100 ha and 60 sheep on the average, and those
growing potatoes in Cochabamba would have about 2 ha. On-farm investment
credit would be mainly for purchase of cattle and sheep breeding stock, stakes
and wire, vineyard plants, fencing, recurrent inputs, establishment of pasture
and the construction of small irrigation canals.
Re-Lending Terms
38.       The Government would open a Project Account in the Central Bank
which would lend the proceeds of the credit to BAB (for ALPD) and commercial
banks for re-lending to participating farmers. Repayment and grace periods
of subloans would be four and two years, respectively for potato growers, six
and three years for sugarcane growers, eight and four years for grape growers
and twelve and four years for cattle and sheep raising. The Development Credit
Agreement (paragraphs B.5,6 and 7 of Schedule 3) provides that subloans for
cattle, sugarcane and grapes would, at the choice of the sub-borrowers, bear
either: (i) a 4% interest rate calculated on outstanding balances periodically
adjusted on the basis of the La Paz cost of living index or (ii) a 14% interest
rate calculated on outstanding balances periodically adjusted according to
fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. Subloans to subsistence farmers
breeding sheep in the Altiplano and cultivating potatoes in the Cochabamba
area would not be adjusted but carry a nominal 12% interest rate. On-lending
terms from the Government to BAB and participating institutions would be either
interest-free, under the La Paz cost of living index option, or at 9% under the
foreign exchange option for on-lending for cattle, sugarcane and grapes. The
Government would charge the intenmediaries 6% nominal. interest for on-lending
for potatoes and sheep. Participating institutions vould thus be given the
following spreads: 4% for on-lending for cattle, sugarcane and grapes lmder the
indexing option; 5% for on-lending for cattle, sugarcane and grapes under the
foreign exchange formula and 6% (without indexing) for on-lending for potatoes
and sheep. These spreads are necessary to cover the costs and provide adequate
renuneration to the participating institutions. The Develo]pment Credit Agreemernt
(Section 3.07) provides that repayments of publoans be re-lent for the sane
purposes for 15 years.
Project Cost and Financing
39.       Project costs are estimated at US$12 million equivalent, of which
US$5 million would be foreign exchange. The Government would contribute
US$2.3 million or 20%; farmers from their own resources US$1.3 million or 11%;
commercial banks US$0.9 million or 7%; and IDA would finance the balance of US"7.5



- 13 -
million or 62% whiph would include US$2.5 million of local cost financing.
As noted in paragraph 13, some local cost financing is justified in Bolivia
to enable the Bank to make an adequate contribution to meeting the country's
external capital requirements.
Pr curement
40.       Vehicles estimated to cost about US$200,000 would be purchased
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines for procurement. The purchase of on-farm inputs, together with
office and laboratory equipment estimated to cost about US$10,000, would
be made through nonmal commercial channels. Several international and local
fins. selling farm machinery, wire, fertilizers and seeds are represented in
Bolivia. Supplies of the goods and services required are adequate and prices
are competitive. Small contracts totalling some US$200, 000 for the construction
of housing and other facilities for project personnel would be placed with
local firms following Government procedures.
Disbursement
41.       Commitments for on-farm investments would be completed over two
years, while disbursements would be spread over about four years. IDA would,
against statements of expenditure, disburse an equivalent of 73% of the amounts
disbursed by participating financial institdtions for on-fanm investments.
In addition, reimbursement for the salary of ALPD's deputy manager and the cost
of vehicles for ALPD and research equipment would be made on the basis of
actual foreign exchange costs incurred; disbursements for construction and
equipment for project administration would be 40% of the total expenditures.
Economic Benefits and Justification
42.       It is estimated that the project would provide full employment to
some 4,000 smallholders and seasonal employment to no less than 8,000 workers
whose present average fanily income is about US$350 per annum. Also, the
project would contribute to an increase in exports of sugarcane and beef as
well as help to meet increasing demand for food consuned locally. As a result
of the project, the participating families would increase their net fanily
incomes to the following levels (in US$):
At FUll
Activity            Present            Development
Beef                 1,205               4,625

Grapes                 105               2,040
1/ The contribution of sheep raising to family income only.

Economic rates of return have been calculated on the basis of farm models
for the different types of farming activities that would be financed under
the project. These rates range from 13% in the case of small farmers to
34% in the case of cattle ranchers. Financial rates of return are similar
to the economic rates.
PARE V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and IDA,
the draft Project Agreement between IDA and BAB, the recommendation of the
Committee provided in Article V, Section (1) (d) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Special conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(i) the Government and BAB have signed a Subsidiary Loan Agreement;
(ii) the Government has contributed the equivalent of US$0.25
million to the Project Account in the Central Bank;
(iii) the Government has contributed the equivalent of US$0.25
million to BAB in the form of equity;
(iv) the Director and the Deputy Director (ALPD) have been
appointed; and
(v) the Government has issued the Decree authorizing the
participating institutions to lend at the interest rate
of 14% for project purposes with an adjustment of principal
based on the rate of exchange between the Bolivian peso
and the do]lar.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PARE VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 148 - Second ENDE Power Project, US$7.4 million, April 28, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project has been successfully completed. The
undisbursed balance represents contractor
payments that will be made upon tenrination of the
guarantee period.
Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June
25, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Status of the project is discussed in Part IV of this
Report.
Credit 346 - Railway Project, us$8 million, December 1, 1972;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
All of the funds under the project have been
committed. Due to inflation, however, the funds
available under the credit have been insufficient
to procure all of the items included in the
project. About 50% of the items planned for
procurement for the first project, have been
deferred for purchasing under the second railway project.
Materials and equipment ordered under the project
did not begin to arrive in Bolivia until the last
quarter of 1974. Although it is therefore
premature to measure physical progress under the
project, significant improvements have been made
in the management, operations, financial condition
and tariff structure of the railway.
Credit 433 - Third ENDE Power Project, US$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Cosing_ Date: December 31, 1976
The Santa Cruz gas turbine was put into service in
December 1974. Because of delays in preparing bid
documents and possible future delays in equipment
delivery, completion of the various transmission
line and substation equipment components is expected
to be six months to two years behind the appraisal
estimate. The project's foreign and total costs are
expected to be 40-50% above appraisal estimates.
Although the beneficiary's recent financial performance
has been satisfactory, it needs tariff increases to
maintain its agreed upon 9% rate of return in 1975 and
future years.
Credit 455 - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is proceeding as scheduled and the credit
should be fully committed by the second quarter of 1976.



ANNEX 1-
Page 3 of 3
Largely beeause of increased costs, the average size of
mining projects are double the US$200,000 original
estimate. A second project for additional lending to
medium miners is planned for FY76.
