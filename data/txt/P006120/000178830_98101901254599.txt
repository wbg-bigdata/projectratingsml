AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Bolivia is one of the least developed countries in South America.
The vast majority of its population is engaged in low-productivity traditional
agriculture; only a fraction of the labor force is employed in enclave-type
export activities, as in the fields of mining and petroleum. The problems of
poverty and unemployment are overwhelming and living standards of the majority
of the population are very low, with GDP per capita at about US$300. While
Bolivia's GDP has grown in real terms at an average of 4.6% since 1965, most
of the increase has been due to mining and petroleum. On the other hand, the
agricultural sector experienced a much more modest growth rate, barely keeping
pace with the population growth rate. The principal problem affecting the
agricultural sector is the existing imbalance between population distribution
and natural resources in the three main geographic regions: the High Plateau,
the intermediate Valleys and the Lowlands.
ii.       The proposed credit would help finance agricultural investments in
the three main geographic areas of Bolivia. The Project would represent a
further step in broadening the coverage of the Bank group lending to the
sector, as it would help finance, in addition to cattle in the northern Low-
lands and sheep in the High Plateau (which are already being financed under
IDA projects), sugarcane in the central Lowlands; potatoes, wheat, oats and
grapes in the Valleys. Agricultural research services would be provided
to Project participants. Total Project costs would be US$12 million equiv-
alent and would be financed from four sources: (a) an IDA credit of US$7.5
million (62% of total cost), which would finance all foreign exchange require-
ments (US$5 million, or about 40% of total cost) and about US$2.5 million of
local costs; (b) a commercial banks' contribution of US$0.9 million equivalent,
or about 7% of total cost; (c) a Government contribution of US$2.3 million
equivalent, or 20% of total cost; and (d) beneficiaries' own resources amount-
ing to US$1.3 million, or 11% of total cost.
iii.      Responsibility for the execution of the Project's credit component
would rest with Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB), but initially Project execu-
tion would be handled by the Agricultural and Livestock Projects Division, a
fully autonomous unit within BAB, until the latter becomes an efficient and
financially viable institution, which is deemed feasible by the end of 1976.
Approximately 50% of the sub-loans would be channeled through commercial banks
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Government, indicating lending
terms and procedures. The Ministry of Peasant and Agricultural Affairs would
be responsible for the research associated with the Project.
iv.       Participating financial institutions would extend loans covering
about 80% of ranchers' and 100% of farmers' on-farm investment. With regard
to rate of interest to ranchers, sugar and grape farmers, beneficiaries would



- ii -
be given an option to choose between the two following alternatives: (a) 4%
calculated on the outstanding balance adjusted on the basis of the La Paz cost
of living index; or (b) 14% calculated on the outstanding balance adjusted
on the basis of the variations of the rate of exchange between the Bolivian
peso and the US dollar. The rate of interest for subsistence farmers (sheep
and potatoes) would be 12% nominal. Terms of repayment would range from four
to 12 years, including a grace period of two to four years.
v.        Procurement for vehicles required for Project staff would be secured
through international competitive bidding. Other procurement would be through
normal commercial channels given the diverse nature and small individual
amounts of inputs required. Existing arrangements would ensure adequate com-
petition.
vi.       Estimated financial rates of return for the various activities range
from 13% to 34% and the estimated economic benefits to the country would be
similar. In the case of livestock the economic rate of return would be
marginally higher taking into account taxes. With appropriate assurances,
the Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$7.5 million. The Borrower
would be the Government of Bolivia.



BOLIVIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government has requested an IDA credit to help finance an agri-
cultural credit project which would virtually encompass the whole of the
country. To date, the Bank Group has made three credits to agriculture in
Bolivia. Two credits for cattle development in the Beni Department of the
Lowlands for a tocal amount of US$3.4 million were made in 1967 and 1970,
and a third credit of US$6.8 million for beef development in the northern
Lowlands and sheep development in the High Plateau was made in 1971. Exe-
cution of the first two projects was successful, but the third project has
run into difficulties.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Bolivia in June 1974 led by Mir. J. Andreu and composed of Messrs. F. Lucca
and 0. Lafourcade (IBRD), P. Bono (FAO/IBRD), and B. Bilbo and R. Brandeis
(consultants).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2
2.01      Bolivia, with an area of 1.1 million km , has a population of 5.5
million, two-thirds of whom are indigenous Indians. Most of these live in
the countryside, the large majority on subsistence holdings. GDP at market
prices at US$1.7 billion results in a per capita GDP of only about US$300
per annum, one of the lowest in Latin America. GDP growth in real terms
averaged 4.6% annually between 1965 and 1972, owing mostly to the development
of petroleum and natural gas, which. together with mining, represent more
than 80% of exports.
2.02    , Bolivia's poverty is compounded by an income distribution pattern
which is considerably uneven. The information available for 1970 (and still
deemed valid) indicates that the poorest 20% of the population share only
2.5%, while the richest 5% obtain 32% of the national income.
2.03      Although there are no reliable estimates of unemployment and under-
employment, there are several indications that -he latter is considerable,
especially in agriculture. Moreover, the overall pattern of investment in
recent years has contributed to aggravate the unemployment situation. During
1965-1972, petroleum, transport and communications absorbed over 50% of in-
vestment expenditures but only 3% of additions to the labor force.



-2-
2.04      The rate of inflation, which averaged about 4.5% per year in the
1960s, increased rapidly beginning in 1971 and is estimated to be running
above 40% in 1974. The exchange rate remained constant at $b 11.88 to the
US dollar from 1959 to 1972, when it was set at Ab 20 to the US dollar.
B. Rural Sector
2.05      Agriculture's share of GDP has fallen from about 30% in 1962 to
approximately 21% in 1974. In the 1965-1972 period, agricultural output
increased at 2.6% annually, barely keeping pace with population growth. It
represented only about 12% of exports in 1974. Nevertheless, the sector
still provides the only source of employment for over one-half of Bolivia's
labor force. Considerable structural impediments and the absence of ade-
quate policies have resulted in a slow growth of output and productivity.
2.06      The principal problem affecting the agricultural sector is the
existing structural imbalance between demographic and natural resources in
Bolivia's three main geographic regions: (i) the cold, dry and largely
barren High Plateau, which comprises 44% of the country's cultivated land,
holds 56% of the population and contributes only 34% of the agricultural
GDP; (ii) the temperate and humid Valleys with 33% of the cultivated land,
30% of the population and 39% of the agricultural GDP; and (iii) the tropical
and subtropical Lowlands with 23% of the cultivated land, 14% of the popula-
tion, and 27% of the agricultural GDP. Traditional agriculture is concen-
trated in the High Plateau and the intermediate Valleys, while production of
crops (including cotton, sugarcane, rice and oilseeds) and beef has been
developed spontaneously by private enterprise in the Departments of Santa
Cruz and Beni (Map) in the central and northern Lowlands, respectively.
2.07      While unbalanced geographic population and resource distribution
constitute the biggest obstacles to the sector's development, such development
is also hindered by such things as lack of land tenure, legal titles, trans-
portation facilities and technical and financial resources, as well as the
high cost of colonization (averaging US$20,000 per family), which precludes
large-scale resettlement.
2.08      Precise cadastral statistics are not available.  It is estimated,
however, that about 85% of the farms are less than 15 ha and cover only 30%
of the land. A farm size of 15 ha, although apparently not very small, should
be considered in the context of the highly eroded soils of the Altiplano,
mostly suitable for only extensive grazing, which substantially reduces the
economic viability of smallholdings. The agrarian reform of 1952 carried out
a drastic land redistribution among peasants in the High Plateau and interme-
diate Valleys (the Lowlands were uninhabited in those days), but the high and
increasing population pressure on the land, together with the adverse soil
and climatic conditions and the lack of supporting services, have combined to
keep rural incomes low. Directed colonization projects transferring High
Plateau peasants to the Lowlands and Valleys have largely failed due to lack



-3-
of knowledge of geological conditions and of supporting services. Spontaneous
colonization, however, continues to be carried out mostly in northern and
western Santa Cruz (see Map), albeit on a modest scale (5,000 to 8,000 settlers
per annum out of a peasant population of 2.3 million in the High Plateau).
C. Agricultural Supportip Services
2.09      The Minister of'Peasant and Agricultural Affairs (MPAA), Banco
Agricola de Bolivia (BAB), the National Community Development Services (SNDC)
and private organizations provide agricultural extension services. However,
shortages of funds and lack of well-qualified extension workers have made it
difficult to provide adequate technical assistance to farmers. Agricultural
school training is practically non-existent and the majority of the 15 to 20
students who graduate each year at university agricultural engineering schools
tend to leave the country for lack of good opportunities in Bolivia. Agri-
cultural research is also under MPAA and suffers from lack of funds and adequate
direction. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is planning assistance in
the field of agricultural research and specific proposals have been made under
the proposed Project for the Saavedra Station located in the Lowlands (para
3.09).
2.10      Organization of the market for agricultural products could be improved
substantially. Marketing of domestically consumed commodities is handled
individually by the producers themselves through local markets or by small
truck operators, acting as middlemen. Marketing of export crops (cotton and
sugar) is handled through producers' associations and brokers. Beef, mutton,
and wool are marketed by individual owners (High Plateau) and the former also
by producers' associations and private dealers (Lowlands).
2.11      Credit availability, except for large agricultural enterprises,
falls far short of what is required to encourage production and raise peasant
incomes.  The major institutional source of agricultural credit, and, more
importantly, of long-term credit, has been Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB)
(Annex 1). Its lending volume has grown quite rapidly but it has been largely
concentrated in livestock and export crops in the Lowlands, financed out of
external resources. A large part of it is short term. At present no medium-
or long-term funds are available to BAB, with the exception of IDA Credit 261-BO.
2.12      Other sources of institutional credit include Banco del Estado (BE),
a public bank; private banks, both foreign and Bolivian, all of which con-
centrate almost exclusively on short-term lending; and the Central Bank through
rediscounting operations.
2.13      The establishment in 1966 of a rural cooperative network in
Cochabamba (see Map) based on a central coordinating body, the Desarrollo
Economico y Social (DESEC) (paras 3.30 to 3.32), together with the expansion
of the Government's National Community Actions Services Agency, have served
to promote cooperative movements in Bolivia.



-4-
2.14      Institutional credit is available only to the top 5% of farmers
and ranchers. The bulk of credit is supplied by intermediaries who charge
nominal rates of between 8% and 12% for six-month periods, but who additionally
purchase crops from farmers at high price discounts, which results in sub-
tantially higher effective rates of interest. The nominal annual interest
rate is 10% for public banks (which are legally forbidden to charge higher
rates), while private banks charge rates commensurate with the prevailing
rates of inflation. The only foreign loan which is explicitly indexed (as
opposed to de facto indexing through interst rate and service charges ad-
justments practiced by private banks) is the IDA Credit 261-B0, whose im-
plementation has been delayed mainly because of ranchers' reluctance to
accept it (para 2.17).
D. Government Policies
2.15      There is a lack of clearly defined policies with respect to the
agricultural sector. Short-term policy decisions taken on an ad hoc basis
cannot compensate for a comprehensive overall approach to the problems of
the sector. In particular, the lack of financial and other incentives and
support to bring about the participation of small farmers in the process of
development may lead to worsening social and economic imbalances. More re-
cently, a serious, although very limited, effort has been made by DESEC and
other Government agencies to correct the situation (paras 3.30 to 3.32); IDB
has financed two rural development/colonization projects; and a rural develop-
ment project is being prepared by the Bank for the High Plateau north of La
Paz. The Project would initiate a coordinated effort to help the rural poor
which could later be considerably expanded.
E. Performance Under IDA Credits 107-B0, 171-B0, and 261-BO
(First, Second, and Third Livestock Projects)
2.16      A Livestock Projects Division (LPD) within BAB has managed the three
projects.  Credits 107-B0 and 171-B0 provided financing for the development of
approximately 300 cattle ranches (compared to the 270 estimated at appraisal).
Disbursements were made substantially ahead of schedule for the agreed purposes.
The average size of sub-loan at US$12,700 equivalent was slightly smaller
than planned (US$13,300 and US$14,000, respectively), and the composition of
on-farm investments was remarkably close to appraisal estimates. The projects'
economic rate of return is estimated at 17% to 22%, roughly as planned (see
Audit Report of May 30, 1974).
2.17      Credit 261-BO for US$6.8 million was approved in 1971 to help
finance: (i) the continuation of beef cattle investments in Beni; (ii) beef
cattle fattening, mainly in Alto Beni and Chapare; (iii) development of sheep
production in the High Plateau, and (iv) a meat marketing study and the con-
struction of slaughter and freezing facilities following completion of the



- 5 -
study. After a successful beginning, performance under the beef component
deteriorated seriously. The main reasons were the lack of local counterpart
funds to be provided by BAB, the lack of implementation of the agreement on
indexing of sub-loans, and the continuing deterioration of BAB's management
and financial condition. As a consequence, in late 1974, IDA requested BAB
not to submit further withdrawal applications, and disbursements were sus-
pended.   The Project's sheep component has progressed very slowly due to
the difficulties associated with organizing traditional farmers in the High
Plateau. More emphasis will be placed on promotion and organization in future.
Project prospects for continued implementation have recently substantially
improved.  The Government provided BAB with a capital contribution of US$1
million equivalenteas counterpart funds required under the Project. Recently,
ranchers have accepted the indexing of sub-loans and the Government has agreed
with IDA to index beef sub-loans under the present indexing system until
April 24, 1975 and on the basis of the cost of living index adjusted annually
after April 25, 1975. During negotiations, at the request of the Government,
which was concerned about the ranchers' reluctance to borrow under indexing
conditions, IDA agreed to give beneficiaries the alternative of borrowing at
a rate of interest of 14% nominal with principal adjusted according to the
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the Bolivian peso and the US dollar.
2.18      The three projects have served to introduce basic principles of
ranch and herd management in the Lowlands. Other benefits include bringing
to the Government's attention the need to provide sufficient price incentives
to producers and introducing measures to combat cattle diseases, such as
rabies and foot and mouth, in the Lowlands.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Description
3.01      The proposed Agricultural Credit Project would support a two-year
lending program to help develop: beef and sugarcane in the Lowlands, annual
crops and grapes in the Valleys and mutton and wool production in the High
Plateau. The Project would cover the costs of on-farm investments and some
of the required Project administration and agricultural research.
3.02      The main objectives of the Project would be to:  (i) expand agricul-
tural production both for export (livestock and sugarcane) and domestic con-
sumption (wool, mutton, wheat, potatoes, oats and grapes); (ii) improve the
economic condition of about 3,600 families of rural poor; and (iii) begin
counteracting the negative effects of past unbalanced regional growth by
channelling resources to the less privileged geographic regions (High Plateau
and Valleys) in higher proportions than has been the case in the past.

3.03      Farm sizes, average investment per farm and phasing of commitments

/1   Farm sizes average 50 ha, of which 4 or 5 ha are developed each year.
Note:     Figures are rounded.
B. Detailed Project Features
Project Area (see Map)
3.04      The Project would be executed in parts of the three main geographic
regions of Bolivia (Lowlands, Valleys and High Plateau). Beef financing would
take place in the Lowlands, where about 85% of the country's cattle population
is concentrated (Annex 2). Sugarcane farms financed under the Project would
be located in Santa Cruz, which accounts for almost all of the existing sugar
production (Annex 3). Potatoes, wheat and oats would be produced in
Cochabamba (Annex 4) and grapes would be financed in a traditional vineyards
area (Valley of Tarija) (Annex 5). Sheep breeding would be developed in the
cold, dry and largely barren highlands north and east of La Paz (Annex 2).
Beneficiaries
3.05      Of a total of about 4,600 sub-loans, roughly 3,600 (mostly to sheep
owners, grape and potato farmers), or more than three-fourths, would be made
to farmers having annual family incomes of less than US$500 equivalent and
belonging to the lowest 40% income stratum of the population. It is expected
that on-farm investments for small farmers would be about 30% of the Project
but total amount could be increased if the administrative absorptive capacity
of the participating institutions and these farmers could handle more credit



- 7 -
than is presently envisaged. Lending to small farmers is expected to be about
45% of the total farm sub-loans under the Project.
3.06      Beef ranchers in Beni and Santa Cruz would be predominately medium
to large size. However, sub-loans could also be made to small ranchers who
would be encouraged to form livestock cooperatives for the purpose of receiv-
ing credit under this Project. Ranchers are already familiar with IDA and
IDB lending procedures and this, added to the strong demand for funds, would
result in a satisfactory pace of disbursements. Sugarcane farmers would have
initial family incomes of about US$1,000 per annum, which places them in an
intermediate income category in Bolivia. Among Project participants would be
recent spontaneous settlers in the northvest of Santa Cruz, and potato and
grape growers who own less than 4 ha each in Cochabamba and in Tarija. The
latter would set aside an average of 1 ha for vineyards to increase their
incomes substantially from the present level of less than US$200 equivalent
per family.
Directly Productive Investments
3.07      On-farm investments would be made in cattle and sheep breeding
stock, fencing, pasture establishment, small irrigation canals, vineyard
plants, stakes and wire, land preparation and other inputs during crop es-
tablishment. Agricultural machinery, vehicles and equipment would be pur-
chased by contractors for use in Project farms.
Project Administration (Annex 6, Table 1)
3.08      Because of difficulties encountered during the implementation of
the Third Project (para 2.17), the LPD of BAB would be enlarged to become the
Agriculture and Livestock Projects Division (ALPD). Under the Project, a
manager experienced in agricultural credit would be recruited as Director of
ALPD. The Deputy Director of the Division would be internationally recruited
and well qualified in livestock and agriculture. Additional vehicles,
equipment, and some buildings (extension or construction of small offices
or houses) would be required. Under the Third Livestock Project, only partial
recording has been made of on-farm investments, incomes and expenditures, as
well as of physical changes in the relevant coefficients induced by the
Project. Under the proposed Project, a special unit would be created in the
ALPD to carry out a systematic recording on the basis of a representative
sample of participating farmers. This would reveal the real impact of the
Project and improve, the effectiveness of future agricultural projects in
Bolivia. Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations.
3.09      Agricultural Research (para 2.09 and Annex 7).  In the Lowlands,
research has been conducted at Saavedra, but results have been poor due to
lack of planning and resources. Nonetheless, some experience has been gained
in measuring adaptation and yields of improved maize, sorghum, oilseeds and
rice varieties. Research and experimentation in crop/pasture rotation based
on adaptable varieties are presently needed. Under the Project, MPAA would



- 8 -
assign the necessary staff to carry out a crop/pasture rotation program.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the assigned staff would
coordinate with the Project Director to ensure that the research conforms
to the needs of the Project.
3.10      Land Titling.  Although the agrarian reform was started in 1952, a
large number of farmers in the High Plateau have not yet received definitive
title to their lands. In the Lowlands, recent spontaneous settlers have also
established themselves (especially north and northwest of Santa Cruz) with-
out receiving ownership titles. The lack of titles hinders the farmers'
access to medium-term credit. Assurances during negotiations were obtained
from Government that MPAA would give high priority to issuing titles to
Project beneficiaries by providing sufficient funds and resources for such
purpose.
C. Cost Estimates
3.11      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$12 million, of
which US$5 million would be foreign exchange requirements. Costs have been
estimated at February 1975 prices. Price contingencies of 25% for 1975,
20% for 1976 and 15% for 1977/78 are allowed for expected price inflation
on the local currency component and 11% for 1975 and 7.5% annually through
1978 on the foreign exchange requirements. Cost estimates are summarized
below and the phasing of investments is shown in Annex 8:

D. Financing
3.12      The IDA credit would finance US$7.5 million, or about 62% of total
Project costs (US$12 million). This would include US$2.5 equivalent of local
cost financing. The Government would contribute US$2.3 million equivalent
and the commercial banks US$0.9 million equivalent. The remaining US$1.3
million equivalent would come from the subborrowers' (ranchers') own resources
and would cover 20% of their on-farm investment costs. Financing of various
Project components would be as follows (in US$ million):

3.13      The Republic of Bolivia would be the Borrower, obtain the credit
on IDA terms and carry the foreign exchange risk. The Government would
transfer the proceeds of the IDA credit to a Project Account to be estab-
lished in the Central Bank. About US$7.1 million would support the
agricultural credit program and about US$400,000 would help finance Project



- 11 -
administration and agricultural research. The US$7.1 million would be on-lent
to participating financial institutions (BAB and commercial banks), which
would, in turn, lend to farmers. With sub-loans being made over a two-year
period, the last repayment to participating institutions and the Project
Account would be made 14 years after the beginning of the Project (Schedule
on Lending Terms and Conditions). Sub-loan repayments from the Project would
accrue to the CB Project Account and would be used for further lending for
similar purposes. The Government's contribution to the lending program would
be equivalent to US$1.7 million, US$0.8 million equivalent of which would be
transferred to the Project Account in CB for 15 years and US$0.9 million to
BAB in the form of equity (para 3.27). As a condition of effectiveness, the
Government, in order to enable the participating institutions to start
operations, would make available the equivalent of US$250,000 to the Project
Account (CB) and the equivalent of US$250,000 to BAB in the form of equity.
The Government would agree to transfer the balance, US$650,000, to BAB in the
form of equity in four semestrial installments, the first not later than
January 31, 1976, and would agree to transfer within 18 months of signature,
sufficient amounts to the Project Account (CB) for on-lending until the
equivalent of US$11 million in sub-loans had been lent to beneficiaries.
The lending program is based on 50% of the loans being made by the commercial
banks and 50% by ALPD (BAB). In case the commercial banks' contribution (US$0.9
million equivalent) did not materialize, either in part or in total, the Govern-
ment would agree to transfer to BAB in the form of equity on a six-month basis
the difference between the expected and the actual contribution of commercial
banks. Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations.
3.14      The US$400,000 from IDA funds for Project administration and agri-
cultural research would be transferred as follows: about US$300,000 would
go to BAB in the form of equity for Project administration to cover the cost
of vehicles, equipment, buildings and internationally recruited staff and about
US$100,000 would go to MPAA for agricultural research. A Government equity
contribution of the equivalent of US$650,000 for Project administration would
be provided to BAB over a period of two years to ensure Project implementation
(para 3.27) and a contribution of US$100,000 for agricultural research to MPAA.
Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations.
3.15      The Government would on-lend through the CB Project Account to par-
ticipating institutions under Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Subsidiary Loan Agreements would be accept-
able to IDA. Such agreements would specify the types of sub-loans eligible,
the percentage to be financed, the rate of interest, maturity dates, methods
of repayment, procurement and audit (details in attached Schedule of Lending
Terms and Conditions). The signing of such Subsidiary Loan Agreements between
the Government and BAB would be a condition of effectiveness and between the
Government and commercial banks, a condition of disbursement.



- 12 -
E. Procurement
3.16      Procurement of investment items for farm inputs would be made
through normal commercial channels, given that their wide diversity and the
small individual amounts involved do not make them suitable to bulk procure-
ment through ICB. Several international and local firms selling farm machinery,
wire, fertilizer and seeds are well represented in the country and this would
ensure an appropriate degree of competition among suppliers. Supplies of
goods and services required are adequate and prices are competitive. Vehicles
required for Project staff and estimated to cost about US$200,000 would be
grouped and secured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank/IDA's Guidelines for Procurement. Office and laboratory equip-
ment totaling not more than US$110,000 would be procured in small amounts
through commercial channels. Contracts for the construction of buildings,
housing and other facilities for Project personnel would be placed with local
firms following Government procedures satisfactory to IDA. Each contract is
estimated to cost about US$30,000 and the total cost is estimated to be about
US$200,000.
F. Disbursement
3.17      Participating institution disbursement to subborrowers would take
about four years. IDA would disburse against appropriate statements and
documents of expenditures for 73% of loans made under the Project for invest-
ments in farm development for beef, sheep, sugarcane, potatotes, oats, wheat
and grapes. Disbursements would also be made against 40% of cost of equipment
purchased locally and buildings. In addition, the reimbursement for vehicles
and the salaries of internationally recruited staff would be made on the basis
of actual foreign exchange costs. A schedule of estimated IDA disbursements
is given in Annex 9.
G. Project Administration
3.18    - Project administration (para 3.08) would be the responsibility of a
newly established unit within BAB, the ALPD (para 3.28).. This body would be
created by enlarging the existing LPD in both staff and responsibility. It
would be responsible for Project implementation and would approve all sub-loans,
including those made by participating commercial banks. It is expected that
ALPD would carry out at least 50% of the lending and the commercial banks the
balance (para 3.29). ALPD would provide guidance and initial technical super-
vision to participating institutions' staffs, umtil these become proficient,
and to subborrowers. Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations.
Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB)
3.19      IDA's initial position, under the previous project, was to concen-
trate its efforts on LPD to ensure adequate project implementation. However,



- 13 -
about two years ago when it looked as though BAB's financial problems would
adversely affect performance of IDA's on-going projects, IDA's main interest
and efforts shifted and focussed on Banco Agricola itself. There was full
agreement with the Government that BAB had to be restored as an efficient and
financially sound agricultural development bank, particularly as BAB is the
only agricultural development institution of Bolivia. During the last 18
months, IDA, with the support of the Government, has directed its efforts at
improving BAB's organization, financial condition, and accounting and manage-
*nt procedures, including a personnel policy review. As a result of the
work so far, BAB's basic structure was changed in July 1974 (para 3.22);
the Government has decided to have BAB discontinue non-profitable operations
(rice marketing and other activities of a social nature) on its own resources
and to contribute $b 65 million (US$3.25 million) to BAB's capitalization
(para 3.27); and several consulting firms have made proposals to study
BAB's financial condition, reorganization, personnel and administrative
requirements based on job analysis and evaluation; to study its accounting
procedures; and to establish and undertake a training program for BAB's staff.
The terms of reference for the employment of consultants were reviewed by
IDA during negotiations and a contract is expected to be signed in June 1975.
Also the Government has directed a revision of BAB's statutes to reflect the
changes undertaken and to take into account any further changes which may
result from the consultantst study. In February 1975, because of differences
of views on the conduct of BAB's affairs, the General Manager, his Deputy,
and the Board of Directors resigned. The Government has since appointed a
new Board of Directors and, after consulting with IDA, appointed a new
General Manager in April 1975.
3.20      General Situation.  BAB was created in 1942 and reorganized in 1963
and again in 1974. It is a fully owned Government institution and enjoys
day-to-day operational autonomy. Supervision of BAB is exercised by MPAA on
technical matters and by the Central Bank on administrative, accounting, and
legal matters. The Ministry of Finance is ultimately responsible for BAB's
financial condition. BAB's stated objectives are to support agricultural
development, with special attention to smallholders.
3.21      Organization and Management.  The Board comprises one representative
each of MPAA, Ministry of Finance, Planning Secretariat, Farm Workers' Federa-
tion, farmers and ranchers, and BAB's employees. The Board's president is
the Minister of MPAA. The Board sets policy, approves annual budgets and
lending terms and conditions, oversees BAB's activities, approves external and
internal financing, and makes structural and procedural changes. The General
Manager is appointed by the President of the Republic.
3.22      Since July 1974, BAB has streamlined its structure by establishing
two main operational departments: Credit and Finance/Administration. The
previous organization had seven main operational units.
3.23      Staffing.  BAB has 66 branches and field offices spread over the
country. The staff increased from 289 at the end of 1973 to about 380 by
June 30, 1974 but many of the new appointments are unwarranted because they



- 14 -
do not correspond to operational requirements. Besides the recent appointees,
there is a basic core of old employees whose professional qualifications may
not be high, but who are experienced and necessary to BAB until more efficient
employees are recruited. Job description and evaluation (as well as a new
remuneration system) should be introduced, and staff with corresponding
qualifications should be reallocated or recruited to improve BAB's perform-
ance. This would be done on the basis of the consultants' proposed study
(para 3.19). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that BAB would adopt
and implement within six months of the consultants' recommendations an overall
staff development plan mutually agreed with IDA, including staff reallocation
in line with its operational needs, and proposals for salaries and benefits
improvements.
3.24      Policies and Procedures.  BAB's policies and procedures are ade-
quate but cast in general terms. The levels of responsibility for loan
approval are appropriate and loan terms and conditions are set on the basis
of the nature of investments being financed.
3.25      Under the previous management, BAB's normal policies and procedures
have not been followed: (i) lending has been concentrated among large farmers
in the Lowlands and loans have been given without adequate prior analysis;
(1i) short-term loans have been given to finance medium-term investments; and
(iii) loan collection has been substantially weakened. As of March 31, 1974,
delinquent loans amounted to $b 168 million (US$8.4 million equivalent), 30%
of loan portfolio. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that an
analysis of arrears by category of borrowers would be undertaken, classifying
debts by age and probability of collection; that recoverable loans would be
collected and uncollectable debts would be segregated and written off; and
that a financial medium-term plan based on realistic expectations and sound
financial principles would be presented to IDA for agreement not later than
12 months after signing of the Credit Agreement. In addition, it has been
agreed that BAB would issue, in consultation with IDA, within one year of
Credit Agreement, revised statutes governing BAB's future operations.
3.26      Accounts and Auditing.  Data are incomplete and not compiled in
accordance with acceptable banking criteria. Internal and external auditing
are consequently deficient, as often mentioned in recent external auditing
reports. The terms of reference of the consultants who will reorganize the
accounting procedures of BAB call for them to pay particular attention to
the quality of data collection and statements of accounts.
3.27      Financial Condition.  Resources, amounting to about $b 690 million
at the end of 1973, are divided as follows: loans (including interest and
commissions payable), $b 614 million; and equity, $b 76 million, or only 11%.
The main sources of financing have been multilateral and bilateral public
institutions and private foreign banks (50%), as well as Central Bank (23%).
BAB has suffered a gradual decapitalization as a result of increasing losses
(from $b 1.3 million in 1971 to $b 11.9 million in 1973), due mainly to the
devaluation of the Bolivian peso (which affected BAB's loan repayments in
foreign currencies), rice marketing activities (recently transferred to a



- 1S -
specialized outside agency), projects of a subsidized nature, narrower in-
terest spreads and increasing administrative expenditures. The debt/equity
ratio increased from 1.2 (1970) to 6.5 (1973). This is excessive, especially
in view of the high risk level of the portfolio.  Overdue loans represented
about 30% of loan volume outstanding March 31, 1974 and there is a lack of
reserves against bad debts. A minimum of $b 65 million (US$3.25 million)
would be required from the Government as equity participation to maintain BAB
operations. The Government has already contributed to BAB capital the
equivalent of US$500,000 and it has agreed during negotiations to contribute
the balance of the required US$3.25 million equivalent in semestral install-
ments within two years of the date of the Credit Agreement. This contribution,
jointly with the US$900,000 (para 3.13) and the US$650,000 (para 3.14) to be
made available as Project Government counterpart, amount to a total of US$4.3
million to be provided to BAB in the form of equity over a period of two years.
Agriculture and Livestock Projects Division (ALPD)
3.28      ALPD would handle all Project day-to-day matters and would report
directly to BAB's new General Manager, who would exercise overall supervision.
ALPD's Director would be an experienced high level administrator who would
have as his Deputy Director an agricultural and livestock expert. Assurances
were obtained that the Director and his Deputy would be appointed on terms
and conditions mutually agreed between IDA and the Government. The appoint-
ments would be conditions of effectiveness. ALPD's headquarters and regional
offices would have their own staffs and would work independently of BAB's
regional offices. Project funds would be used exclusively for Project purposes
and disbursements would have to be authorized by ALPD's Director. The above
structure and procedures are designed to guarantee the efficiency of Project
management and would be maintained until BAB's organizational and financial
positions have been strengthened. The financial and managerial autonomy of
ALPD and its possible integration within BAB would be reviewed within 18
months of the signing of the Credit Agreement. Assurances on the above were
obtained during negotiations.
Participating Institutions
3.29      A group of 10 commercial banks, including Cochabamba, Santa Cruz,
Beni Livestock and Mercantile, operate in the Project areas and their clientele
include many would-be subborrowers under the Project. The banks have
expressed interest in participating in the Project subject to an agreement
with Government on suitable financial, administrative and technical conditions.
The participation of these institutions under the Project would introduce
competition, provide added flexibility to agricultural credit, and spread
geographically the impact of the Project. As few of these commercial banks
have agricultural staff, the ALPD would assist them initially in preparing
sub-loan applications. Also, DESEC, specialized in working with small farms,
would participate and assist ALPD as well as the commercial banks in loan
processing.

The Center for Social and Economic Devel2pment (DESEC)
3.30      DESEC is a non-profit private organization established in 1966 under
Bolivia's cooperative law. It is a member of the Pan American development
foundation which provides assistance to the socially oriented foundations of
the Western Hemisphere. DESEC's principal functions are to promote and
organize cooperatives in the rural areas, carry out feasibility studies and
coordinate its own operations with its four affiliates. Its budget, averag-
ing about US$1 million p.a., is financed mainly from external contributions
made by charitable organizations. DESEC's most active affiliate is the
association which provides technical assistance to farmers and rural artisans
(ASAR), followed by the association in charge of the construction of rural
housing (VIPO), provision of health services (SEPSA) and education (ICE),
and that portion of the rural poor which DESEC has helped to organize into
about 200 cooperative centers (ARADO). 1/ ARADO has a membership of about
3,000 families mainly in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, the Altiplano and the Yungas.
DESEC's staff consists of about 33 members, responsible for the cooperative
centers and the execution of feasibility studies being financed from local
and external sources. In 1974, DESEC assisted the FAO/CP in a study for a
rural development project in the province of Ingavi (Altiplano), which is
expected to be financed by the Bank. Profits generated from services
rendered by DESEC are transferred to support the operation of ASAR and the
other affiliates working with the 200 cooperative centers. ASAR has a staff
of about 38 people who are directly involved in providing agricultural
extension and marketing services to the 200 cooperative centers. Given its
limited financial and human resources, ASAR has concentrated its efforts since
1970 on helping small farmers and about 200 families to grow potatoes, wheat
and oats in Cochabamba.
3.31      DESEC, through ASAR, has established an integrated system whereby
it helps associations obtain loans from private banks and supervises disburse-
ments and repayments. The latter are facilitated because ASAR markets the
produce of association members, which, in turn, enhances the creditworthiness
of the peasants.
3.32      Under the Project, ASAR plans to assign a Project Director, six
agricultural extension workers, one marketing expert and one promotor of co-
operatives to provide technical assistance in the valleys of Cochabamba to
Project-beneficiaries receiving loans directly from ALPD or from participating
commercial banks. This assistance would be provided on the basis of a com-
mission or fee to be paid out of the margin obtained by participating institu-
tions.
Lending Policies and Procedures
3.33      Participating institutions would assist farmers in the preparation
of farm plans, would make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of an
1/   Action Rural Agricola de Desarrollo Organizado.



- 17 -
individual or group of applicants, would appraise investment sub-projects
with their own technicians, and bear the full credit risk. ALPD would assist
and train commercial bank technicians in sub-project appraisals, when needed.
All sub-loans to be refinanced out of the Project Account would require ap-
proval by ALPD's Director. He may delegate such authority, at his discretion,
to his deputy or to participating commercial banks.
3.34      With inflation reaching 35% in 1973, and about 45% in 1974, indexing
was introduced under Loan 261-BO. Adjustments on principal were previously
made on the basis of the lower of two indexes: the La Paz food price or the
Trinidad (Beni) meat price (para 2.17). As inflation has been declining in
recent months, it was agreed during negotiations to leave to the subborrowers
the option of choosing between the following alternatives: (i) interest
rates of 4% calculated on the outstanding balances adjusted on the basis of
the cost of living index compiled by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS);
or (ii) interest rate of 14% calculated on the outstanding balances adjusted
on the basis of the variations of the rate of exchange between the Bolivian
peso and the US dollar. Sub-loans to subsistence (sheep and potato) farmers
would bear a 12% nominal interest. Assurances on the above were obtained
during negotiations. During negotiations, it was also agreed that issuance
of a Supreme Decree by Government to permit lending to agriculture at an
interest rate of 14% would be a condition of effectiveness.
H. Accounting and Auditing
3.35      Separate Project accounts would be kept at the Central Bank and at
each of the participating institutions, and ALPD would supply IDA with period-
ic reports on Project operations. BAB would have its accounts and those of
ALPD audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The Project Account
within Central Bank would be audited according to auditing procedures accept-
able to IDA. The participating banks would have their accounts audited by
independent firms of standing. The audited statements of accounts and the
auditors' report would be sent to IDA within four months of the fiscal year
of the various institutions. Assurances on the above were obtained during
negotiations.
IV. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
4.01      A wide range of crops would be produced by farmers participating in
the Project. Only beef and sugar would be produced partly for export, as
international market prospects (Chile and Peru for beef) appear adequate for
these two products. Assurances were obtained from Government that it would
maintain a price policy aimed at increasing agricultural production and at
providing adequate incentives to farmers.



- 18 -
4.02      Part of beef and sugar incremental production, as well as mutton,
wool, potatoes, wheat, oats (all of which would represent less than 5% of
present national production) and grapes, would be consumed locally. Grapes
(representing about 15% of total production at peak levels) would be pro-
duced mostly for the fresh market, except in Tarija where about one-half of
the production would be used to make wine. Wool production would be sold in
the main cities of the High Plateau and would help reduce current imports.
4.03      Marketing of potatoes, wheat and oats would be handled by ASAR.
Grapes, wool and mutton would be sold either directly by individuals or
through cooperatives; sugarcane would be marketed under present arrangements
with mills and beef through producers' associations as at present.
4.04      A summary of producers' benefits derived from the Project models
of production is shown in the following table:
Beef   Sheep   Sugar   Potatoes   Grapes
Number of families                    930/1 1,600      300      1,800        220

(Annex 2)(Annex 2)(Annex 3)(Annex 4) (Annex 5)
/1   Assuming only 50-cow herds.
The sheep net income relates only to sheep breeding. The overall family
income from other sources for sheep farmers at present is estimated at US$200
equivalent. This, together with the family incomes for potato and grape
farmers, falls within the 40% lowest income stratum of the population. The
incremental financial rates of return would be sufficiently high to make
on-farm investment attractive. The Project cash flow is given in Annex 11.



- 19 -
V. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The economic rate of return would be similar to the financial
returns for the various activities. In the case of livestock, the economic
rate of return would be marginally higher, taking into account taxes
(Annex 12).
5.02      The Project would give full employment to some 4,000 smallholders
and seasonal employment to no less than 8,000 workers whose present average
family incomes are of the order of US$350 per annum and would help consolidate
the financial position of participating marginal producers. Additionally,
land titles would be provided to participating farmers, and input supplies
and marketing would be improved as a result of cooperative efforts made by
producers' associations.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points that Government would:
(i) contribute as Project counterpart US$0.8 million equivalent
to the Project Account in the Central Bank in sufficient
installments to ensure Project implementation as scheduled
(para 3.13);
(ii) contribute Project counterpart US$0.9 million equivalent
to BAB in the form of equity in sufficient installments
to ensure Project implementation as scheduled (para 3.13);
(iii) transfer to BAB in the form of equity on a six-months' basis
the difference between the expected and the actual contribution
of commercial banks in case the participation of such banks
should not materialize, either in part or in total (para 3.13);
(iv) transfer about US$300,000 of IDA proceeds needed for Project
administration to BAB and about US$100,000 to MPAA (para 3.14);
(v) contribute the equivalent of US$650,000 in the form of equity
to BAB to ensure Project implementation over two years and
transfer the equivalent of US$100,000 to the MPAA for agri-
cultural research under the Project (para 3.14);



- 20 -
(vi)  regulate lending terms and procedures through a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with participating institutions acceptable to
IDA, as outlined in attached schedule (para 3.15); and
(vii) contribute to BAB in the form of equity $b 65 million
(US$3.25 million) within two years of the date of the
Credit Agreement (para 3.27).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points that BAB would:
(i)  establish a special unit within the Agricultural and Livestock
Projects Division (ALPD) to determine the impact of IDA lending
in the Project areas and help improve the effectiveness of
future agricultural projects (para 3.08);
(ii)  enlarge the present LPD to become the Agricultural and Live-
stock Project Division (ALPD) with responsibility for Project
implementation (para 3.18);
(iii) adopt an overall reorganization plan, including staff develop-
ment, based on the recommendations of the consultant and in
agreement with IDA, and start implementing the plan within
six months after the consultants' recommendations (para 3.23);
(iv)  make an analysis of arrears by category of subborrowers, collect
recoverable debts and write off uncollectable debts, and prepare
a medium-term financial plan within 12 months of signing of the
Credit Agreement (para 3.25); and
(v)  review with IDA within 18 months of signing of the Credit Agree-
ment a possible integration of ALPD into BAB, depending on BAB's
reorganization and financial condition (para 3.28).
6.03      Conditions of effectiveness of the credit would be that:
(i)  a contribution of the equivalent of US$250,000 had been made
to the Project Account in the Central Bank (para 3.13);
(ii)  a contribution of the equivalent of US$250,000 had been made
to BAB In the form of equity (para 3.13);
(iii) the Government and BAB had signed a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
acceptable to IDA (para 3.15);
(iv)  the Director and the Deputy Director of ALPD had been appointed
on terms and conditions mutually agreed between IDA and the
Government (para 3.28); and
(v)  Government had issued a Supreme Decree to permit lending to
agriculture at an interest rate of 14% (para 3.34).



- 21 -
6.04      A condition of disbursement would be that the Government and
commercial banks had signed a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (para 3.15).
6.05      With the indicated assurances, the proposed Project is suitable
for an IDA credit of US$7.5 million.

ANNEX 1
Page 1
BOLIVIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB)
General Situation and Objectives
1.        BAB was created in 1942 and reorganized in 1973 and in 1974 (the
latter following IDA's recommendations). It is a fully owned Government
institution and enjoys day-to-day operational autonomy. Supervision of BAB
is exercised by MPAA on technical matters and by Central Bank regarding
administrative, accounting and legal matters. The Ministry of Finance is
ultimately responsible for BAB's financial condition. BAB's objectives are
to support agricultural development in general with special attention to
smallholders.
Organization and Management
2.        As a consequence of a series of measures undertaken by the Govern-
ment to reorganize BAB in early 1975 the Board of Directors, the General
Managers and the Deputy General Managers have resigned. According to present
statues the Board comprises one representative each of "PAA, Ministry of
Finance, Planning Secretariat, Farm Workers' Federation, farmers and ranchers,
and BAB's employees.  The Board's president is ipso facto the Minister of
MPAA. The Board: (a) sets policy; (b) approves annual budgets and lending
terms and conditions; (c) oversees BAB's activities; (d) approves external
and internal financing; and (e) makes structural and procedural changes.
The general Manager is appointed by the President of the Republic. He is
BAB's main executive officer and had traditionally exerted his powers and
influence fully. Since 1970, however, four general managers have been
appointed in rapid succession. The last manager was not able to work at his
job full time in view of his other responsibilities, which resulted in very
weak and improper management. The Deputy General Manager position was created
and filled a few months ago under prodding by IDA. The Deputy General Manager
was expected to assume direct responsibility for the credit and financial
departments. These objectives have not been fulfilled because of the delays
in approving the reorganization plan, and lack of support by the General
Manager.
3.        Overall Organization.  BAB's six main operational units were con-
solidated into two main departments recently, e.g., credit and finance/
administration. Credit is, in turn, subdivided into agriculture and livestock
projects divisions. The latter (LPD) has been, and is, responsible for
managing the IDA-financed projects. A loan collection unit has been estab-
lished in the finance department. This is important, since it will centralize



ANNEX 1
Page 2
this responsibility at a high level at a time when a serious problem of arrears
must be faced (paras 24 to 28).
4.        Planning and data collection divisions have been recently created
to handle project preparation and economic studies; and an improved flow of
financial and accounting data, respectively.
5.        BAB has presently 66 branches and offices covering the whole
country. In many of these areas the lending is minimal and staffing super-
fluous, thereby producing net operating losses. One important result of the
study shortly to be undertaken by Arthur Young would be the reduction of
losses through the consolidation of a number of agencies.
6.        Staffing.  BAB's staff number 289 at the end of 1973 (Table 1).
This represented an increase of 33 staff or 12% since end 1972. However,
the staff size increased to 380 or by 31% through June 30, 1974. This was
unjustified on the basis of lending activities and given BAB's present
financial difficulties (para 16). With some notable exceptions, the staff
is generally of low caliber. There is a basic core of old employees whose
professional qualifications may not be high, but whose services are necessary
at this stage in view of their banking experience in the agricultural field.
Most of the recent appointees (see above) lack both experience and profes-
sional qualifications. Salaries are about 30% below those paid by other
public, and by private,, banks and this is related to the poor quality of
the staff (Table 2).
7.        Policies and Procedures.  In the past, BAB has had two sets of
credit lines, one using its own resources, the discount facilities of the
Central Bank and the funds of Brazilian and Argentinian banks (regular lines);
and the other using funds from bilateral and multilateral international
financial agencies, such as USAID, IDA and IDB (special lines). The terms
and conditions of loans under the various lines of credit differed markedly;
and specifically those of "regular" loans (many of which are given exclusively
on the basis of the security offered), were totally unrelated to the produc-
tion and income-generating capacity of the activities financed. This led
to financing medium-term investments with short-term credit and consequently
to situations of borrowers' illiquidity, loan arrears and defaults. Another
unfortunate result of the distinction between regular and special loans was
that the staff were assigned to one or the other line exclusively, which led
to their underemployment and to haphazard supervision. Such distinctions
were not warranted and, therefore, new and standard loan terms and conditions
have been approved in principle based on the financial requirements of diffe-
rent types of investments.
8.        BAB makes mostly "specialized" loans, e.g., for cotton, sugar,
mutton, beef (Table 3) and each of them in a specific geographic area which
forces farmers/borrowers to apply elsewhere (often to private money-lenders
at very high interest rates and with excessively short repayment periods)



ANNEX 1
Page 3
for obtaining the funds needed to finance supplementary basic requirements,
such as other subsistence/c.^sh crops and/or livestock production. This
weakens unnecessarily the financial condition of farmers and results in a
waste of time, frustration and different and sometimes incompatible loan terms
and conditions. Under the basic reorganization already approved, financing
will be made available by BAB on the basis of the overall financial needs of
farmers and ranchers.
9.        At present BAB is encountering difficulties in lending to small-
holders in the High Plateau and the lowlands because of: (a) lack of land
titles; and (b) lack of cooperatives or farmers' associations to channel the
credit and to assume collective responsibility for loan repayments. A more
intensive promotion and organizational effort by BAB is required and coor-
dination with MPAA is needed for accelerating land titling in areas where
BAB's lending is potentially important.
10.       Loan approval authority is as follows:
$b               US$ Equivalent               Legal
Up to 50,000            Up to 2,500          Provincial Agent
50,001 to 220,000       2,501 to 11,000      Regional Agent
220,001 to 450,000    11,001 to 22,500    Chief of Credit Department
450,001 to 750,000    22,501 to 37,500    Executive Committee at
Headquarters
Above 750,000           Above 37,500         Board
The above structure is deemed adequate under present circumstances but the
upper limits at the provincial and regional levels might be increase sub-
stantially as soon as warranted by the quality of the staff.
11.       BAB has been charged by the Government in the past with the
responsibility of administering programs which were either heavily subsidized
and hard to manage, e.g., rural development and colonization, or were of a
commercial nature, e.g., rice purchasing and marketing. As a result of the
nature of these activities and/or of BAB's total lack of expertise in these
fields, BAB has: (a) committed to them an unduly high proportion of its
manpower resources; and (b) experienced heavy financial losses which have
not been covered through Government allocations. Under BAB's reorganization
plan, a decision was made to create the National Rice Board and to transfer
BAB's rice activities to the Board. As for projects of social nature,
Government funding in advance is presently required to absorb the probable
losses resulting from these Projects.
12.       Accounts. BAB keeps separate accounts for each of the different
programs it handles, but these accounts are inadequate for analytical and
decision-making purposes because of incompleteness and errors. Accounting



ANNEX 1
Page 4
data is not analyzed sufficiently so as to give, among others: the current
position of the portfolio and debt; aging of the portfolio; and details of
loans in arrears. Of equal concern is BAB's inability to use available data
for current and long-term financial planning. The improvement of data collec-
tion would be handled by consultants under a contract signed by BAB.
13.       Auditing.  Internal auditing is extremely deficient.  External
auditing which legally should be the responsibility of the Central Bank, is
entrusted to private firms. Auditing has been hampered by inadequate and
erroneous data (para 12). The mDst recent audit as of June 30, 1973:
(a) does not show a reconciliation of its estimated balance sheet with the
one prepared by BAB; (b) expresses no opinion as to the adequacy of the
provision for bad debts; and (c) is otherwise incomplete by the standards
required by IDA. This gives an idea of the task to be performed by the
consultants (para 12).
Financial Condition
14.       Resources.  During the last four-and-a-half years the composition
of BAB's resources has changed as follows:

BAB has relied increasingly on loan funds, its equity decreasing from 39.4Z of
the total resources as of June 30, 1970 to 11% at the end of 1973. During
this period, BAB has relied heavily on the refinancing facilities provided
by the Central Bank, as well as on term loans by IBRD, USAID and IDA. Short



ANNEX 1
P age 5
term loans by the Banco do Brazil, Argentinian banks and Bank of America have
also been made. These institutions had contributed a total of about $b 960.5
million, as of March 31, 1974, of which an estimated $b 350.0 million was
outstanding and about $b 167.0 million was still undisbursed.
15.       Financial Structure.  BAB's FY/70-73 financial statements are given
in Tables 4 and 5. They show that BAB has suffered a gradual decapitalization
as a result of increasing losses. There has also been a sharp increase in the
debt-equity ratio as shown below:
Debt Equity Ratio
(in $b million)
--------June 30--------_
1970    1971-   1972    1973    Dec. 31, 1973
Debt            103.0   169.6   244.2   417.5          494.4
Equity           86.3    83.6    80.6    76.1            75.9
Debt/Equity       1.2      2.0      3.0     5.5          6.5
BAB's debt/equity ratio of 6.5:1 at the end of 1973 is excessively high
considering the level of risk of its loan portfolio (para 24). Furthermore,
if adequate additional provisions for possible portfolio losses were made
(at least $b 60 million, para 28) and the total exchange loss written-off
($b 101.4 million, Table 6), BAB's equity would be more than wiped out.
This states clearly the case for a substantial Government equity contribu-
tion to BAB, estimated at $b 65 million (US$3.25 million). Additional
equity is also justified as a means of lowering the cost of BAB's borrowing.
16.       Profitability.  BAB has since 1970 recorded increasingly higher
losses. During FY/72 income from lending operations increased by 29.4%.
However, costs increased during the same year by 35.7%. The situation has
sharply deteriorated during fiscal year 1973 when income from lending oper-
ations increased 26% while costs increased by 41.7% resulting in a loss of
$b 11.9 million. The following table shows the development of BAB's income
and expenses during the last four years:

Total Assets    219.4 100.0   293.4  100.0   398.8  100.0   593.8  100.0
The financial expenses (interest and other charges on debt) which had
increased sharply during FY/70-72 went through a 99% increase during FY/73.
This was mainly due to excessive borrowing and increasing costs of capital.
Administrative expenses (62% of which consisted of personnel expenses in
FY/73), although decreasing from 4.9% in FY/72 to 3.8% in FY/73 as a pro-
portion of total assets, are still high. Net losses produced by rice marketing
operations ("other expenses") amounted to about $b 2.7 million from 1971 up
to the moment when these operations were transferred to an outside specialized
agency in 1973.
17.       Interest Spreads.  BAB has enjoyed very sizable interest spreads
during the last four years, although these have steadily decreased:
June 30,   June 30,   June 30,   June 30,

ANNEX 1
Page 7
Up to October 1972, BAB's lending rate had, with few exceptions, been 12%,
whereas the cost of its debt funds had varied widely between 1.5% and 9%.
IDA funds for livestock deve lopment had been passed on to BAB at 4% under
the first two Credits (107- and 171-BO) and at 7.25% under the last Credit
(261-BO). The cost to BAB of AID and IDB funds had averaged 4%, whereas
funds from the Central Bank had been received at rates of interest ranging
from 5% to 8%. BAB had also borrowed from Banco do Brasil for cotton
development at a cost of 9% which had been a contributing factor to the
increase in financial expenses. Table 3 gives details about BAB's credit
lines and interest spreads.
18.       In October of 1972, the Government reduced the interest rate to be
charged by BAB from 12% to 10%, thereby decreasing BAB's spread and interest
income. BAB's lending rate is now 10%, except for 6% in the case of two
IDB-financed programs of social nature (colonization and rural development),
17% on three cotton loans financed by Banco do Brasil and Central Bank, and
12% on a rice loan also financed through Central Bank discounting facilities.
In the case of IDA-financed projects, an indexing system has been introduced
based on a real interest rate of 6%; at the same time the cost of funds
received by BAB under IDA Credit 261-BO was reduced from 7.25% to 4% to
compensate for the loss of interest income, BAB intends to negotiate a
reduction in the cost of other credit lines with the Government and the
Central Bank.
19.       Impact of the Reduction of Interest Rates Charged by BAB.  The
October 1972 Government decision to limit BAB's lending rate to 10% will
further affect its profitability, which is already negative (Table of para
16). This will diminish BAB's interest income at a time when: (a) there is
an increase in the cost of borrowing (BAB's cost of borrowing increased from
5.3% in 1971-72 to 7.4% during the last two years); (b) the scope for any
substantial reduction in administrative expenses (about 3.8% of the assets)
is limited; and (c) the need for a substantially higher provision for bad
debts (para 28), which was set at the clearly insufficient level of about
3.7% of the loan portfolio at the end of 1973, is evident. The reduction
in BAB's lending rate is totally unjustified, especially for commercial
ranchers and farmers, whose investments financed with BAB loans are highly
profitable. The 10% nominal rate is completely out of line with the present
rate of inflation of about 40%. To the extent that BAB is required to main-
tain an unrealistically low interest rate, there is no possibility of its
developing into a strong financial institution independent of the Government
financial support. If, however, this rate cannot be raised and if the use
of indexing cannot be generalized, both for political reasons, BAB's profit-
ability could still be improved by reducing the cost of its operating funds.
This can be done through: (a) BAB having Central Bank discount facilities
at a rate of less than 3% (about one-half lower than the current 6% average);
and (b) by increasing BAB's equity through a Government contribution to reduce
the relative importance and cost of borrowings.



ANNEX 1

20.       Impact of the Devaluation.  In October 1972, the Bolivian Government
devalued the peso by 67% in relation to the US dollar. The exchange loss
resulting from the difference between sub-loans repaid in pesos to BAB and
amounts repayable by BAB in foreign exchange was estimated at $b 2.4 million
during the first year and would eventually total $b 101.4 million (Table 6).
21.       The devaluation also had a negative impact on the quality of BAB's
portfolio. As indicated in para 24, overdue and delinquent loans increased
from 15% of the portfolio in June 1970 to 30% in March 1974. Among other
reasons, this is because part of BAB's portfolio is denominated in dollars
and its clients are having difficulties and/or are reluctant to repay amounts
that are two-thirds higher than those originally received.
22.       Financial Prospects and Projections.  BAB's financial prospects
raise deep concern if no steps are taken to improve the situation. Losses
from normal lending operations are expected to continue to increase. This,
together with the deterioration in the quality of BAB's portfolio, seriously
threatens the liquidity and solvency of the institution. The current ratio
decreased from 1.3 in June 1971 to 1.2 in June 1972, 0.8 in June 1973 and
to an intolerable 0.23 in December 1973.
23.       A complete financial analysis of BAB to be included in consultants'
terms of reference is required at this stage. To this end, existing data
should be improved and made more comprehensive. A recent study prepared by
Arthur Young on BAB's accounts in view of introducing D.P. facilities fully
confirms this impression.
Loan Portfolio
24.       The quality of BAB's loan portfolio is very poor and has badly
deteriorated over the last two-and-a-half years (Table 7). The following
table summarizes the evolution of the portfolio from June 30, 1970 to
March 31, 1974:

ANNEX 1
Page 9
25.       Loans made to cooperatives have a higher proportion of loans in
arrears (62%) than loans made to individuals (38%). Programs of a social
nature (colonization and rural development) also have a higher incidence of
loans in arrears than programs designed to finance commercial ranchers and
farmers. Cases in point are two IDB-financed projects: one for coloniza-
tion with a delinquency rate of almost 100%; and another for rural develop-
ment with a delinquency rate of 86%. Details about the distribution of the
portfolio are shown in Table 8.
26.       Loans Overdue.  Rescheduling of loans is a common practice in BAB.
In connection with its periodic collection drives BAB has to a considerable
extent resorted to the practice of rescheduling its overdue loans, thereby
compromising its liquidity to the benefit of its doubtful clients. Accord-
ing to a recent study: 1/ more than 50% of the number and value of all loans
approved since 1964 have been rescheduled at least once. If the rescheduled
loans were added to the loans in arrears, doubtful loans would amount to
about 85% of the total value of BAB's loan portfolio at the end of 1973.
27.       Delinquent Loans.  Delinquent loans, which amounted to 20% of
total loan portfolio as of June 30, 1972 and to 25% as of March 31, 1974,
are loans overdue more than 120 days, which should have been handed over
to the legal department. However, legal action has been initiated for only
about one-fourth of the value of delinquent loans, in spite of the existing
rapid legal collection procedures available to BAB.
28.       Provisions for Losses.  BAB has not attempted to make an accurate
estimate of adequate provisions for losses which would entail a thorough
analysis of BAB's outstanding loans, the number of which has exceeded 5,000
in past years since 1967. Furthermore, BAB's auditors have not expressed
an opinion as to the adequacy of BAB's provisions. BAB's existing provisions
are established as a flat percentage (5%) of the value of the loan portfolio,
although as of December 31, 1973, they were as low as 3.75%. This, of course,
does not bear a direct relationship to the risks of the portfolio. Thus the
provision in BAB's books as of December 31, 1973 amounted to $b 17.5 million
compared to loans in arrears of $b 113.5 million and $b 220 million as of
March 1974 (Table 7). Even excluding from the latter about $b 50 million of
overdue loans which remained unsettled as a result of the 1972 devaluation
of the Bolivian peso, and which reportedly should not necessarily be consi-
dered as bad accounts, the possible losses on the total portfolio have still
been estimated at about $b 60 million by BAB's financial manager. The latter
amount exceeds the existing provisions by $b 42.5 million and would, if
considered as the minimum provision required, lead to a reduction 57% of
the equity. When sub-loans made in foreign currency fall due, a further
deterioration of the quality of the portfolio can be expected as a result of
the devaluation.

29.       Summary and Main Conclusions.  BAB's financial situation is serious
and continues to deteriorate. Operating losses which had increased sharply
since 1970 experienced a dramatic 300% increase in FY/73. This was mainly
due to: (a) the devaluation of the Bolivian peso; (b) the reduction in the
rate of interest charged by BAB from 12% to 10% together with higher costs
of borrowing; (c) uncollectable loans made mostly to smallholders for social,
not economic, reasons (transferred by the Government to BAB from other
agencies); (d) loans extended to commercial farmers on political more than
financial ground which have not been rescheduled on time; (e) high adminis-
trative costs; and (f) high financial costs due, in past, to nonselective
borrowing. It is interesting to note that while the first three factors are
attributable to the Government measures imposed on BAB without consultation
the last three are attributable to BAB's poor management. It is, therefore,
both the Government's and BAB's management responsibility to improve BAB's
financial condition.
B. Recommendations
30.       Since January 1973, as part of its institution-building effort,
IDA has sought with Government Agreement: (a) to bring about a functional
reorganization of BAB; (b) to improve accounting procedures; (c) to improve
BAB personnel administration; (d) to improve BAB financial standing. During
prenegotiations the Government has accepted IDA's recommendations to:
(a) appoint a new and qualified General Manager; (b) hire the services of
the international consulting firm, Arthur Young, to reorganize BAB and
establish more functional accounting procedures; (c) contribute US$3.25
million to BAB capital to partially compensate BAB's 1972 devaluation losses.

ANNEX 2
Page 1
BOLIVIA
AGRICULTUIRAL CREDIT PROJECT
Livestock
A. Beef
Cattle Numbers and Herd Structure
1.        The annual increase of the size of the national herd of 2.3 million
is estimated at only 1.6%. This is partly due to low productivity and partly
to an extraction rate which increased from 10% to 17% from 1969 to 1973 in
response to attractive on-ranch prices and which may have involved some
slaughter of breeding cows. This high extraction rate is unsustainable in
the long run and an important objective of the IDA livestock projects has
been, and is, the retention of breeding cows by small, financially hard-
pressed ranchers.
2.        Herd structure in the lowlands is as follows:  35/40% of cows,
10/12% of heifers, 5/7% of bulls, 20/26% of steers and 11/16% of calves.
There are no meaningful herd structure statistics for the High Plateau and
the valleys, where individuals own less than ten animals on average.
3.        The national distribution of ranches and herds by size is not known.
However, in Beni and Santa Cruz (Table 1) more than 40% of the cattle is
owned by less than 5% of the ranchers, with average large ranches above 7,000
ha and herds above 2,500 head.  A much more better distribution of ranch and
cattle ownership prevails in Chaco (southern, dry lowlands), while typical
individual ownership in the High Plateau and most of the valleys comprises
less than 10 head fed mainly on cropping residues in small (2/8 ha) plots.
Production Patterns
4.        In the lowlands beef production is a separate activity, while in
the valleys and the High Plateau it is a by-product of dairying and of the
use of draft animals. Breeding and fattening take place mostly in the same
properties. On-farm infrastructure is rudimentary, management poor and yields
very low. The average carrying capacity is 4 ha per animal unit in Beni and
even lower in Chaco. Weaning rates are about 40%, adult mortality about 6%,
and steers are slauglhtered at 5/6 years of age weighing 170/190 kg per carcass.
In these conditions the sustainable off-take is about 10%. The main breeds
are Zebu/criollo crosses and criollo in the lowlands and Holstein/criollo
crosses and criollo in the High Plateau and valleys.

Animal Health
5.        The main health problems (though still relatively unimportant) in
the lowlands are rabies and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). A much improved
system for vaccine certification and distribution is required to avoid
future major outbreaks of FMD and an anti-rabies campaign would be feasible
now using the latest proven techniques. Parasite infestation and brucellosis
are the main health hazards in the High Plateau and the valleys. These could
be controlled with relative ease given adequate technical support.
Marketing
6.        Beef consumption is estimated at 10 kg per capita and represents
one-half of total meat consumption. Beef is mostly consumed in the urban
centers (25 kg per capita) and the lowlands, and practically not at all in
the rural areas of the rest of the country. The high level of per capita
beef consumption in the cities is undoubtedly due to relatively low domestic
prices (about the same as prices for mutton and pork and below those for
poultry) which have been kept largely insulated from world market conditions
until recently through export and domestic price controls. In early 1974,
on-ranch beef prices were allowed to increase to US$0.25 per kg on the hoof
following supply/demand conditions.
7.        The main transport means are:  (a) on the hoof (60% of cattle
marketed); (b) air (carcasses), 26%; (c) road, 12%; and (d) rail, 2%. Air
transport offers the best possibility for both expansion and improvement in
the short term, given the uneconomically high costs of building roads and
railways in difficult terrain in the sparsely cattle populated areas of the
lowlands.
8.        Cattle in the lowlands are slaughtered in many small and widely
scattered establishments under rudimentary conditions and with total lack
of hygiene. Slaughterhouses are located by earthen air strips and plane-
loads are arranged beforehand. More recently there has been a tendency to
expand and improve the few large slaughterhouses in Beni to replace the
smaller establishments and to permit fuller use of more modern facilities,
expand cold storage capacity and improve hygiene. These are welcome.
Past and Future Development Strategies
9.        In the past IDA has successfully sought to improve productivity in
about 300 ranches (or 10% of ranches in the northern lowlands) through the
introduction of basic infrastructure and management techniques. This should
be pursued and expanded to include smaller, but economically viable ranches
and herds (50 to 150 cows) where potential productivity increases are esti-
mated to be at least as high. The project, therefore, would emphasize the
development of these herds (Table 2) not only in the northern lowlands, but
also in Santa Cruz. Greater emphasis than in the past would be placed on

controlling seasonal mating, weaning, breeding, cow feeding, and culling at
the ranch level, and on disease control in the lowlands. An official request
was made by IBRD to FAO to include the Beni area in their existing cattle
health program for Bolivia.
B. Sheep
Sheep Numbers and Flock Structure
10.       The total sheep population of Bolivia amounts to approximately
7.3 million, almost exclusively concentrated in the Altiplano and the Valleys.
Sheep are owned by small farmers with flock sizes varying from 20 to 80 animals,
50% of which are breeding ewes. Very few sheep cooperatives have been estab-
lished, principally in Oruro and La Paz. Generally, the grazing land is
communally owned but the flocks are kept on an individual basis.
Production and Marketing Patterns
11.       There is very little information about mutton production, which is
estimated at about 13,000 tons p.a., of which probably no more than 7,000
tons are marketed through regular commercial channels. Breeds are of the
Criollo type, with carcass weight averaging 8 kg and wool yielding less than
500 grams per animal. Wool quality is poor and only 10% of the national
clip, estimated at 1,800 tons, is processed by the local textile industry.
Bolivia imports 200 to 300 tons of wool annually to meet its total require-
ments.
12.       Sheep are a very important element to the family economy in the
Altiplano. Mutton and wool are generally consumed and used respectively at
the family or village levels, wool being processed through the local cottage
industry. Sheep generally do not compete with cattle, as the latter are used
mainly for draft purposes and are fattened on hay and crop residues, while
sheep tend to graze in the extensive communal areas. The price of mutton is
somewhat higher than that for beef (approximately $b 20 per kg of carcass),
and wool prices average $b 20 per kg of clean fibre. Because of the low
yields in meat and wool, net cash income from sheep production alone is quite
small, not exceeding US$80 per family from a flock of about 20 breeding ewes.
13.       Recent production improvements on a small scale have been based on
the introduction of cultivated pastures, mainly alfalfa and festuca, and the
use of improved breeds such as Correidale, Targhee and Ideal. Liveweight
increase and improvement in the quality of fleece have been obtained when an
adequate pasture improvement has been carrieh out parallel to sheep upgrading.
These improvements, however, have so far had little impact on the large
majority of sheep producers and good flock management still remains one of
the most important obstacles to increased production in the Altiplano and
the Valleys.

14.       Sheep are well acclimatized to the High Pleateau.  Their main health
problem is parasite infestation, which reduces weight, weakens general body
defenses and makes animals receptive to more serious health hazards.
Past and Future Development Strategies
15.       There has never been a sheep development strategy in Bolivia.
Extensive research has been conducted by Utah University experts on sheep
breeding, but only tentative recommendations have been offered and no govern-
ment or private action have followed those recommendations. The Utah program
has been terminated for lack of IUSAID funds and is not likely to be renewed.
16.       IDA is financing sheep breeding development under Credit 261-BO.
The strategy followed is to group peasants who own large communal parcels
of land in cooperatives and to introduce better grazing practices, some
alfalfa and improved breeding stock and animal health practices gradually,
to enable peasants to develop herds and farms on a solid basis. So far this
IDA-sponsored effort has been only partially successful. The main difficulties
have been the reluctance of peasants to form, and work in, cooperatives, and
land titling problems. These difficulties are important and require more
attention, staff, financing, coordination with the government agencies in-
volved and time to be progressively reduced.
17.       The above strategy would be followed under the proposed project
continuing to emphasize gradual improvement at relatively low investment
costs per family based on simple techniques which can be duplicated on a
much larger scale to make an impact on the standard of living of as many
families as possible. Mluch more emphasis would be placed on promotion and
organization of sheep farmers.
C. Livestock Project Investments and Financial Results
18.       These are given in Tables 1 and 2 and show that the proposed
development patterns would be attractive enough to enlist the participation
of the e7xpected number of ranchers and sheep owners.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Sugarcane
Subproject Area
1.        Location, climate and soils:  The sugarcane area lies north and
northwest of the city of Santa Cruz in the lowlands. The climate is sub-
tropical with rainfall averaging 1,600 mm p.a., mostly spread over a six-
month period. Temperatures vary little and average 30C. Soils are mostly
light clays. The area is at present mostly under forest.
2.        Topography, water supply and drainage:   The topography is mostly
flat to gently undulating. There are several permanent water streams and
groundwater is available at depths between 40 and 60 mf. No salinity pro-
blems have appeared, although the degree of land utilization is so low as to
make it difficult to foresee likely salinity under extensive cultivation and
irrigation. Under the project no irrigation is contemplated.
3.        Basic infrastructure:  There are two main asphalted roads serving
the project area: one from Santa Cruz city straight north and another lead-
ing from the northern road west to Puerto Greter. Dirt roads are passable
in the dry period, when cane is harvested. Telephone and radio comnunica-
tion are available in the city of Santa Cruz.
Land Tenure and Cultural Practices
4.        The typical farm has 40/60 ha and has been taken as project model
farm. Farmers are recent spontaneous settlers from within the lowlands and
from the valleys. Typically they clear and plant 3 to 4 ha p.a. using the
slash and burn technique, and moving into new patches of cane after 3 to 4
years of cultivation (8 to 9 years in the case of sugarcane) at which time
the original plot reverts to secondary bush. Very few small farmers have
definitive land titles, but most have obtained certificates of occupancy.
Boundaries are not clearly demarcated, however, and this may lead to serious
problems as the land is progressively put to crops. Most of the farmers
plant staples for their own consumption and sugarcane for cash. No fertil-
ization is practised and cane seeds are those traditionally used in the area.
Therefore, yields are low for subsistence crops and for cane after the first
2/3 years of cultivation. Practically no credit or technical assistance
reaches the small farmers except to a limited extent in the farms closest to
roads, where the Cane Growers Association (CNCA) provides planting material
and some advice on planting and maintenance practices.

5.        Under the project funds would be made available to develop 10 ha
of sugarcane each in about 300 smallholdings. Funds would be mostly used
for land clearing, planting material and maintenance up to the first harvest.
Credit and a modicum of technical assistance would be channeled through BAB
and DESEC local branches.
Benefits to Pro1ect Participants
6.        The 10 ha per farm would be developed over a three-year period.
During a future (not yet planned for) second phase similar investments would
be made in farm areas still under forest to compensate with new production
for the declining output of lands already planted to sugarcane. Declining
output would result from the lack of fertilizer applications, which are not
made at present because they are not justified financially. Cane would be
sold as at present to the sugar mills, which have unused capacity, and which
in turn would sell the excess sugar supply in the world market through
brokers. Benefits to growers would be substantial (Tables 3, 4).

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Potatoes, Oats and Wheat
Subproject Areas
1.        Location, Climate and Soils:  The project area lies in the High
Plateau north, west and east of the valley of Cochabamba. Altitude averages
3,500 m, temperature 5C in winter with periodic night frosts and 15C in
summer, rainfall is about 650 mm p.a. and occurs over a six-month period.
Soils are generally eroded clays, but there are finer textured alluvial
deposits with higher fertility in the upper valleys.
2.        Topography, Water Supply and Drainage:  Topography is generally
gently undulating. Irrigation water is scarce, but groundwater surveys prove
that water would be available at depths of 90 to 150 m in sufficiently large
amounts for permanent irrigation of several thousand ha. There are incipient
salinity problems in the lowest areas receiving irrigation water, mostly from
surface streams.
3.        Basic Infrastructure:  The main road Santa Cruz-Cochabamba-La Paz
passes close to the project area, which has an abundance of narrow all-
weather roads. Telephone and radio communication are available in the nearby
city of Cochabamba.
Land Tenure an.: Cultural Practices
4.        The typical farm has 3/4 ha.  In addition, there are communal lands
for grazing sheep. Demarcation and land titling problems abound, and this
is a major difficulty in organizing cooperatives and obtaining credit. Land
has been excessively subdivided as a result of increasing population pressure.
The main production items are basic staples, such as potatoes, barley, oats
and some rice. Alfalfa is planted as forage supplement for draft animals.
Cultural practices are primitive, and consequently, yields low. The lowest
quality seed is used for replanting and the best seed is sold for cash. Only
limited amounts of organic fertilizer are used. The lack of credit and
technical assistance are the main stumbling blocks to increased agricultural
production.
Project Investments
5.        Under the project funds would be made available to about 1,800
families grouped in cooperatives of 4,000 ha for deep plowing, purchase of
improved seed, limited amounts of chemical fertilizer and small storage bins.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Credit would be provided mainly through DESEC, which has organized groups
for this purpose and for input distribution, provision of technical assist-
ance and marketing of produced.
Benefits to Project Participants
6.        These would be substantial.  It is interesting to note that one
of the main reasons for the high project-induced cash inflows would be the
achievement of higher on-farm prices through the marketing efforts of the
cooperatives. Presently, produce is bought from the farmers by middlemen
who have advanced funds to cover living expenses and cropping costs prior
agreement to sell the crop at low, predetermined prices. These middlemen
who own or control trucking, sell their produce in the urban centers at
exceedingly high profit margins. The financial analysis at the level of
the group of 600 families is given in Table 4.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Grapes
Subproject Areas
1.        Location, climate, and soils:  The 220 small vineyards to be
financed are located in the Departments of Tarija and Cochabamba (see Map).
Most of the new plantings in the Department of Tarija would be in the
provinces of Avites, Arce, Mendez and Cercado, while those in Cochabamba
would be in the provinces of Sacaba, Cochabamba, Ouillacollo and Vinto
Suticollo. Rainfall measures between 480 and 800 mm and is concentrated
in the period from December to March, with the heaviest rains in January
and February. Days of rain average 55,,per year. There can be frost into
October and there is occasional hail, but normally, not during the growing
season. The temperature variation throughout the year is not great, being
32 to 360C. The lowest temperature seems to occur in July with the range
being 3.0 to 11.5C. Winter winds can be strong, but the breezes are gentle
during the growing season. The soils are primarily alluvial, some being
fine to medium-fine and others being medium to coarse in texture. The fine
to medium-fine textured soils have low inflitration rates and may be improved
by using green manure crops, especially legumes, as the soils are also low
in organic matter and nitrogen. The pH is slightly alkaline to alkaline.
The medium to coarse textured soil has a very high infiltration rate and care
must be taken not to over-irrigate and leach out the few remaining nutrients.
2.        Topography, water supply and drainage:  Tarija and Cochabamba are
in the zone of the intermediate valleys at an elevation of 1,500 to 2,500 m.
Within the valleys, the slopes are moderate and generally divided by meander-
ing streams. The hills and mountains have rather steep slopes and erosion
is a problem. Water is the most critical constraint to agricultural develop-
ment in the intermediate valleys. The quantity and distribution of rain for
perennial crops is not adequate so irrigation must be made available. Prac-
tically all irrigation is dependent on rivers and streams, although more
efficient use could be made of these resources with the construction of minor
dams and canals. UNDP is completing a groundwater survey of the three major
valleys around Cochabamba where there are a number of 3- to 6-inch artesian
wells with depths of 35 to 40 m. The groundwater situation in Tarija is not
as well known, but the limited number of wells with depths of 60 to 90 m,
produce good quality water. Salinity problems, however, are appearing in the
lower portions of the valleys and seem to be on the increase. The major
causes apparently are bad management of irrigation water, some water supplies
of poor quality and poor drainage.

3.        Basic infrastructure:  Both regions are served by all-weather roads
and airfields. Radio and telephone communication to the rest of the country
is available.
Land Tenure and Cultural Practices
4.        Individual farms average 1.5 ha in Cochabamba and 2.5 ha in Tarija.
Land titling is a problem to some extent in Cochabamba only. Much more
important is the problem of continuous land subdivision among younger members
of families which leads to uneconomic minifundia.
5.        Most varieties grown are selectedrfor the fresh market.  They
include White Muscat of Alexandra, Pedro Jitnenez, Cereza and native creole.
Yields vary from 10,000 kg/ha to 25,000 kg/ha under irrigation, depending
on varieties.
6.        Although fertilizers are required to obtain higher than marginal
yields, partically no chemical fertilizers are used, although minor nutrients
are applied through foliar sprays. Approximately 20 tons of manure per
smallholding is applied every three years in established vineyards. In new
areas, most growers apply it at planting time and for the next two years
to ensure good plant growth. Otherwise cultural practices in general are
quite good in the Tarija area, but some diseases have been identified, one
being an incipient incidence of Phylloxera Vastarix P.  Efforts are being
made by growers and extension workers to control it and prevent its spread
to other vineyards.  Cochabamba has no disease problems and the modern tech-
niques of grape growing are just being introduced.  Two years ago, a group
of technicians established a grape nursery, bringing to Cochabamba cuttings
from Mendoza, Argentina. A well known professor of viticulture from the
University at Salta has now joined them to help in establishing a private
commercial grape production. The group produced 120,000 one-year-old plants
and 60,000 two-year-old plants for vineyard establishment in July 1974. The
one-year-old plants are priced at $b 6.50 each and the two-year-old plants
at $b 9.50 each. When a customer purchases the plants, he also receives
technical service as required to help in the planning, layout, planting and
care of his vineyard. The nursery is to be expanded by 440,000 more plants
to be sold as one-year-old plants in July 1975. Plant material for 400,000
of these'plants is being imported from Mendoza.
Project Investments
7.        Under the project all planting stock would be certified by the
Cochabamba nursery as being free of disease and indicating place of origin
and variety. A complete farm plan would be made out by the farmer assisted
by the nursery experts, and the AUPD staff. Areas that show signs of possibly
having high water tables would be avoided since grapes like well drained soils.
After the site is selected the land would be ripped or deep plowed by a tractor



ANTNEX 5
Page 3
below any existing plow sole or hard layer. The area then would be smoothed
and laid out for irrigation surface drainage, and planting. The one-year-old
plants would be planted before they break dormancy so they do not suffer set-
backs. Replacements the second year would be with two-year-old plants to
keep the vineyard uniform.
8.        Care must be taken to see that the newly planted grapes get adequate
moisture around their root zone with the initial irrigations. Weeds must be
well under control so they do not compete with the newly planted granes.
Some varieties may require staking the first year, but the trellising can
wait until the second year and some wires until the third year. Plants
would be inspected regularly and treated as needed to prevent insect and
disease damage. Fertilizers would be applied to ensure good early growth.
Project Financial Benefits
9.        One-half ha and 1 ha per farm would be planted to grapes in
Cochabamba and Tarija respectively. Grape yields would increase from 3.5
tons per ha at the end of the third year of planting to 12.5 tons in the
seventh year and beyond. At existing fresh grape producer prices averaging
$b 15 per kg and of $b 5 per kg of wine, financial returns would be about
27% and net cash inflows would be substantial after the third year. Since
production would increase slowly and at its peak it would not represent more
than 15% of total domestic production, no effect on process to producers
is foreseen. These, together with the high family labor component of produc-
tion, make grape production an ideally well mixed activity to the presently
marginal smallholdings in the irrigated temperate valleys of Bolivia.

Notes:
(i) Figures represent real values, as principal and interest on con-indeoed sub-loans (sheep sod potatoes) have been deflated according to foreseen
rates of inflation of 207, in 1976, and 15X in the following years.
(ii) On-lending to participating institutions at U07 en indexed sub-loans and at 6X nominal on subsistence sub-loans (seeop and poatotes), the Government
would almost maintain the value of its lending.  Gover-ent on-leoding including IDA funds would amount to about Us$7.9 million, amortization
plus interest to about US$6.9 million.



ANNEX 12
BOLIVIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return for the various activities would be
similar to the financial returns (Annex 10). In the case of investments for
livestock production, the economic rate of return would be marginally higher
(22.5% as against 22%) than the financial one, taking into account taxes paid
by ranchers. The key assumptions made are as follows:
(a) The official rate of exchange is equal to the shadow rate of
exchange;
(b) The prices of investment and operating cost items in real
terms would remain at estimated February 1975 price levels;
(c) All administrative costs of the Project were estimated and
charged to the Project;
(d) The shadow wage of labor was assumed to equal the monetary
wage;
(e) Due allowances were made for taxes and customs duties;
(f) Prices of output of beef and sugar reflect international
conditions, according to the projections of the Bank's
Commodities Price Division; and
(g) Prices of commodities produced for the domestic market
(including subsistence crops) were assumed constant throughout
the life of the Project at their estimated February 1975 market
values.
