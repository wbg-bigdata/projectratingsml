EIGHTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1443-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report (PCR) for the project financed under
the eighth loan to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya
(MEM). The US$22 million loan which became effective on January 9, 1978, was
provided to finance approximately 18X of the foreign cost of a project
consisting of the construction of a thermal power station at Pasir Gudang with
two 120-MW oil fired units, associated 132 kV transmission lines and a 275 kV
transmission line in the north. Additional foreign exchange financing for
specific imported project related items was provided through supplier's
credits and commercial banks.
Although the project was completed in July 1982, disbursements,
mainly for payments of contractor's retention monies, continued until December
1984, and the original closing date of June 30, 1982 was extended to
December 30, 1984. The Bank loan was underutilized to the extent of US$1.7
million, which was cancelled in January 1985.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division following a project completion mission which took
place in July 1985, and is based in part on draft project completion reports
prepared by NEB.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by ORD staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Covernment and the Borrower for comments. Comments received from the
Government and NEB have been reproduced as Attachments A and B to the report.

EIGHTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1443-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A US$22 million loan was made to NEB in March 1977 to finance part
of the foreign costs of constructing a new thermal power station at Pasir
Cudang with two 120-MW oil fired units, associated 132 kV transmission lines
and a 275 kV transmision line in the north. The station was commissioned in
July 1982 about 13 months behind schedule and was accomplished with a cost
under run of about 102. The units have been operating satisfactorily with
acceptable levels of efficiency and plant outage rate. The IERR of the
project was 18.02 against an appraisal estimate of 14.02, inspite of rises in
fuel oil prices, largely due to timely and adequate tariff increases.
During the implementation period of the project (1977-82) MEB's
sales increased by about 552, at an average annual growth rate of 9Z. The
project was thus a timely addition to NEB's generating capacity.
Except for the year 1980 when NEB made a net loss, its financal
performance was satisfactory, due to adequate tariff increases and exemption
from payment of taxes and dividends. WEB's institutional development has been
impressive and the utility has strengthened its capabilities in many fields.
There still remain certain areas, such as distribution system planning,
feasibility studies for large power projects, and improvement in operation of
thermal/hydro stations, where NEB needs to focus its attention.

EIGHTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1443-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.01      Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous government
owned entities. The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB)
serves Peninsular Malaysia, while the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the
Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) serve the two states on the
island of Borneo. WEB took over the supply and distribution of electric power
on the island of Penang, from the Penang City Council in 1976. NEB als2
acquired in 1982 the operations of the Perak Hydroelectric Company which
generated and distributed electricity in the state of Perak. Small generating
and distribution licensees still exist in isolated areas, where NEB's supply
is not yet ara.'-lable,
1.02      Table 1.1 presents NEB's generating capacity in 1975, the time of
project identification, in 1983 and as projected by 1988. The figures indi-
cate a sustained high growth rate of about 14 - 15X in capacity and energy
capability over a period of 13 years. As a consequence of the oil price
increases from 1979, a definite shift away from oil burning thermal stations
has been planned. While gas and coal are foreseen to be fuels for future
thermal stations, proposals for transport of hydro electricity from Sarawak to
the mainland over submarine cables are presently under evaluation.
The Borrower
1.03      The borrower, NEB, is an autonomous government owned corporation
established in 1949, responsible to the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunication
and Posts. It is an operating agency and has the legal power to set tariffs.
Until 1984, NEB was also a regulatory agency with the power to grant licenses
to independent electricity works. Since January 1, 1984, NEB's Inspectorate
Division was converted into a Federal Government Department and integrated
with Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Ports. NEB is a well estab-
lished entity with competent management. Its major operational and policy
decisions are made by the Board of Directors whose members are appointed by
the Minister. The Chairman of the Board is the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet
and the General Manager is the Deputy Chairman.

1.04      The Bank has made eleven loans to WEB since 1958 totalling US$439.5
million. Projects under the first nine loans have been completed. The fifth
power project was completed about three months behind schedule with a cost
overrun of 151, whereas the sixth power project was delayed by eleven months
with a cost overrun of 311. Both these projects were executed as planned and
achieved their major objectives. The PPAR for the sixth power project (Report
No.3506 of June 22, 1981) noted that NEB is a well managed utility and has
some effective staff training programs. It concluded that apart from the
utility's unsatisfactory financial performance in 1980 and 1981, due to
factors beyond the control of its management, the project was a success.
NEB's financial position has since improved.
1.05      Since 1976, the year of the SAR, several institutional changes have
been implemented by NEB. The organization structure has been changed and
capabilities have been substantially enhanced in the fields of system
expansion planning, engineering and design, project implementation, accounting
and auditing, data processing, system operation and control, planning and
development for rural electicification, training and manpower development.
The Bank has been associated with some of these activities through loans for
the ninth, tenth and eleventh power projects (Loan Nos. 1808, 2143, and
2438-MA).

II. PROJECT IDEITIFICATION PREPARATION AMD APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      The Bank has been having a zontinuing participation in the power
development program of Malaysia starting with the first power loan in 1958.
The present project originated during discussion of NEB's expansion plans,
between a Bank mission and NEB's senior planning personnel, in May 1975.
NEB's consultants had made extensive studies of the Generation and Trans-
mission expansion program covering the priod 1975 to 1983. These studies
showed that following the 3 x 120 MW Port Dickson thermal station (a Bank-
financed project), the least cost development plan would be:
(a)  4 x 87 MW Temmengor hydro project (then under construction);
(b)  expansion of Prai thermal power station by 3 x 120 MW units
(financed under Bank Loan 1178-MA);
(c)  2 x 120 MW capacity Pasir Cudang thermal power station; and
(d)  new hydro development, Bersia (3 x 24 MW) and Kenering (3 x 40 MW)
(projects financed under Bank Loan 1808-MA).
2.02      Construction of Pasir Gudang was foreseen as the only feasible
development that could be completed in time to meet the forecast demand by the
end of 1981. This has been subsequently justified by load growth which
necessitated emergency commissioning of 5 x 20 MW gas turbines during 1979.
2.03      The station was located on the southern tip of the peninsula to meet
the anticipated load growth in the state of Johor; the 3 x 10 MW Sultan Ismail
thermal power station serving this region being due for retirement in the
early eighties. An appropriate unit rating for the NEB system was 120 MW and



this size was selected for Pasir Gudang. The next higher sized units of 300
MW will come on line at Port Kelang towards the end of 1985.  The Pasir Gudang
site is suitable for a future addition of two 300 MW units.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.04      The project was prepared by NEB from May 1975 to November 1916, with
necessary assistance from the nonsultants who had been appointed in November
1975. There was active interaction with the Bank during the project
preparation stage, both through correspondence and a preappraisal in June
1976. The project execution was planned with due consideration of manpower
constraints faced by NEB, whose personnel were engaged at that time on the
design and implementation of the Prai thermal station project.
Pro,ict Objectives
2.05      The main objectives of the project were to augment system's generat-
ing capability to meet the rapidly growing load especially in the south and to
finance a part of NEB's 275 kV and 132 kV transmission program including
132 kV interconnection of Pasir Gudang thermal station with the grid. The
requirement of a dialogue with the Bank on tariff changes and improvement of
NEB's financial health through the meeting of specified financial covenants,
were expected to stren:gthen the institution.
Project Description
2.06      The project as appraised comprised the following components:
(a) Construction of 2 x 120 MW Pasir Gudang thermal power station;
(b)  Seventy-four miles of 275 kV double circuit line from Prai thermal
station to Temmengor substation;
(c)  Eight miles of 132 kV double circuit line from Pasir wudang thermal
station to Majidee substation.
Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
2.07      The cost estimate and financing plan for the project were as

2.08      In view of limited Bank funds available in 1977, the Bank loan
financed only about 131 of the cost. However, Bank's participation was
instrumental in securing cofinancing of US$30 milli(-. from a consortium of
commercial banks.
Subsequent Changes
2.09      The project was constructed substantially as envisaged in the SAR
except for the addition of three miles of 132 kV double circuit line froit Prai
thermal station to Bukit Tengah substation and short 275 kV spur lines from
Temengor to Bersia and Kenering. Further, NEB requested the Bank and the Bank
agreed to finance the contracts for water treatmen= plant, generator
transformers, station and distribution transformers and HV switchgear, which
were not in the original scope of the loan. All these contracts had been
earlier awarded by NEB to lowest bidders, following ICB procedures. The
original and revised loan schedules were as under:

III, IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Arrangments
3.01      Alchough NEB had the capability to engineer and implement major
thermal power station projects, it decided to entrust all facets of work on
this project, preliminary investigations, engineering and design, procurement,
quality control, construction and commissioning supervision, to a consultant,
in view of preoccupation of its staff with the Prai thermal power station
project. The project was coordinated from WEB's side by Deputy General
Manager (Major Projects) and Chief Engineer (Generation Projects) at the head
office, while one Deputy Senior Resident Engineer and three Resident Engineers
(turbine, boiler and auxiliaries) participated in field supervision.
3.02      Consultants for the Pasir Gudang thermal station were selected by
NEB in November 1975, out of a total of 27 consultancy offers received. Apart
from cost, the selection criteria gave weight to the much greater quantum of
engineering done by consultants under American, Australian and Indian
practices compared to European and Japanese practices which left a greater
portion of engineering to contractors.
3.03      WEB selected in December 1976, local subconsultants for civil
design, airconditioning and lighting of auxilliary builtdings.
3.04      Consultants for the transmission system were directly appointed by
NEB based on their past association. Their scope of work included design,
procurement, quality control, supervision and commissioning. One NEB engineer
was seconded to the project in the capacity of an Assistant Resident Engineer.

Implementation Schedule
Pasir Cudang Thermal Station
Delayo in Contract Awards
3.05      An analysis of the scheduled and actual dates of contract award and
contract implementation is presented in Annex 1, for major project compo-
nents. There have been delays of two to five months in the award of contracts
for items which could affect project schedule, such as the major civil works
and the boilers and turbine generators. Contract award delays for the less
critical items are even greater, ranging from seven to sixteen months. The
delays are due to a variety of reasons, such as specification preparation
delays by the consultant, review delays by NEB and the prequalification
process undergone for all major civil works.
Major Problems and Delays in Civil Construction
3.06      The project was beset with several problems during the civil
construction phase, which resulted in lengthy implementation delays. The
major problem areas are highlighted belowt
(a)  Piling (Delay of 8 months from contract completion date).
An unusual problem of soil upheaval in the circulating water (CW)
outlet tunnel area required increased quantum of excavation,
backfilling and driving of additional piles in difficult
conditions. Late availability of vendor data resulted in delays in
pile drawing releases, the number of piles increasing from 2,200 to
2,775. Access for piling for turbine generator of unit 1 had to be
deferred to allow construction of CW tunnels. The consultant
reacted promptly in taking remedial measures and the contractor's
response was very satisfactory.
(b)  CW System Civil Works and Other Marine Works (Delay of 23 months
from contract completion date).
The hydraulic model studies which were completed after award of this
contract, necessitated basic changes in the original scheme for the
intake channel and the skimmer bay structure and a shift in the pump
house location. As rock was encountered at the revised locations,
new designs and methods of execution had to be evolved and new item
rates negotiated with the contractor. All this took an inordinately
long time to finalize and the work on intake channel could proceed
only from March 1980, the original contract completion date.
Extensive blasting work, not foreseen earlier, required procurement
of 5,000 lbs of explosives and suitable personnel and equipment.
Contractor's response in organizing blasting operations was
inadequate and the situation was worsened by strict regulatory
requirements for explosives. This resulted in delay of almost a
year in execution. Work on the circulating water (CW) pump house
could proceed at a very slow pace due to the presence of rock and
inability of the contractor to evolve a more workable method for
cofferdam construction than the cumbersome internal shoring arrange-
ment. Construction of seal well and outfall structure also
encountered problems such as tilting of piles and presence of



- 8 -
boulders, necessitating changes in design and construction
procedures. In short, problems encountered were severe,
consultants' response, though technically efficient, did take some
time, while the contractor's response was not adequate to meet the
demands of the difficult situation.
(c) Main Plant Foundations (Delay of 24 months from contract completion
date).
Due to subsoil problems affecting piles and subsequent excavation
work, contractor's scope of work on circulating water (CW) outlet
tunnel was substantially increased and the method of execution
adopted considerably slowed down the rate of progress. Construction
of CW intake tunnel was hampered due to CW pump house problems.
Cracks on this tunnel necessitated epoxy grouting. Turbine building
and boiler house foundations were delayed due to delay in piling and
the need for the piling and foundation contractors to work in the
same area at the same time, While the workmanship of the
countractor was satisfactory, his efforts at keeping to schedules
were inadequate.
(d) Steelwork and Cladding (Delay of 14 month from contract completion
date).
The overall delay was due to increase in scope of work from 4,300 to
5,383 tons, slow down of work due to water logging at the column
foundations caused by prolonged rain spells, delay in delivery of
turbine crane and late release of pump house. The contractor's
performance was, however, very good.
(e) Superstructure (Delay of 9 months from contract completion date).
Commencement date was too early to ensure continuity of work and
hence seviral drawings were released late.  However, early
commencement helped in achieving an earlier plant commissioning date
than what would have been otherwise realized. Further, access was
delayed due to late completion of foundations and this was
compounded by acute labor shortage in Pasir Gudang area. The
contractor's labor force was considerably affected, as the same
contractor was executing the works under (b) and (c) above. The
contractor's management planning of work and attitude towards
satisfying the client were unsatisfactory.
Claim raised by Contractor for CW System Civil Works and other Marine Wcrks,
Main Plant Foundation and Superstructure.
3.07      The contractor for the above works has raised the following claims
due to prolongation of contracts beyond the original completion dates:

The extra claim is based on:
(a) Idle machinery and labor due to late and piecemeal issue of
drawings, limited work area and cement and steel shortages;
(b) Frequent movement of plant and materials due to changes in
priorities;
(c) Excessive wastage of materials due to prolonged maintenance of
temporary works and facilities.
The consultant has dismissed most of the claims on the following grounds:
(a) Mobilization commenced prior to issue of order to start work;
(b) Joint records of idle plant and labor were not maintained;
(c) Specification allowed for progressive issue of drawings and
piecemeal availability of access;
(d) Contractor's local organization set up was very poor, unable to cope
w'.th site activities and there was lack of backup from head office;
(e) Basis of claim was arbitrary and not based on any tendered rates.
The matter is likely to go for arbitration.



- 10 -
Mechanical, Electrical and Miscellaneous Contracts
3.08      The performance of all other contractors on this project was
satisfactory. The implementation delays shown in Annex 1 are by and large the
result of late release of access due to delays in completion of plant
foundations and buildings' civil works.
Transmission Lines
3.09      An analysis of scheduled and actual dates related to transmission
line work is presented in Annex 2. The 132 kV line outlet from Pasir Gudang
was completed practically on schedule and well ahead of commissioning of the
generating sets. Delay in completion of Prai-Temengor 275 kV line was due to
delay in securing way leaves, coupled with security problems in the area,
which hampered access, held up work for prolonged periods and necessitated
introduction of communication equipment.   Though otherwise satisfactory, the
contractor's performance in respect of route selection was below expectation.
3.10      The delay in construction of Prai-Temmengor line did not impose any
restriction on generation at Prai or Temmengor in view of availability of
alternative transmission routes.
Project Costs
3.11      The estimated and actual costs of the project components are
detailed in Annex 3 and a summAry of comparison with the SAR estimates is
presented below:

/a   Based on conversion at weighted average rate of US$1 - M$2.3
3.12      There have been large differences between estimated and actual costs
of some of the components. Thus for example between NEB's estimates and
actual costs there has been an underrun of 33Z in the boiler cost, an underrun
of 661 in the cost of foundations, an overrun of 42% in the cost of steelwork
and cladding and an overrun of 1191 in the cost of superstructures, see
Annex 3. The differences are also large in some of the other items. Foreign
equipment prices were significantly lower than SAR estimates and price and
physical contingencies were not utilized. The overall project cost underrun
is about 101. Bank loan of US$22 million was unutilized to the extent of
US$1.7 million, which was cancelled in January 1985.
Disbursements
3.13      A comparison of actual disbursements against the Bank loan versus
appraisal estimate is shown in Annex 4. Actual disbursements as percentage of
the SAR disbursements are tabulated below:

- 12 -
The delayed disbursements were due partly to procurement delays, partly to
extension of construction period for Pasir Gudang and the transmission lines,
partly to deferment of procurement by NEB to suit the revised project
requirements and partly due to cost savings.
Performance of Consultants
3.14      Performance of the main plant consultant was satisfactory in respect
of engineering and design work and their response to difficult civil construc-
tion problems at site, due to marshy land in some areas causing tilting of
piles and upheaval of soil and presence of rock in other areas requiring
special construction techniques. The consultant's performance was however
weak in dealing with the contractor for CW system and marine works, main plant
foundations and superstructure.
3.15      The performance of the consultant for transmission lines was
satisfactory.
Reporting
3.16      NEB submitted to the Bank a total of 29 quarterly progress reports
on Pasir Gudang, which were prepared by the main plant consultant. The format
of these reports was useful in monitoring progress of the project. The
consultant for transmissiont lines submitted 18 quarterly reports. The overall
reporting system was satisfactory. The main plant consultant prepared a
detailed completion report, which though not following Bank guidelines,
contained useful information on the project.
Procurement
3.17      Procurement was accomplished through a total of 50 contracts.  The
number of packages was relatively high in order to promote local partici-
pation. ICB procedures were followed for all foreign contracts, including
contracts financed by IBRD, Commercial Banks and Bilateral/Supplier's
credits. Documents were reviewed and awards cleared by the Bank not only for
IBRD procurement but also for Commercial Bank financed procurement, according
to the terms of the commercial loan. Procurement proceeded smoothly, largely
due to efficient management by NEB's coordinating personnel and prompt action
by the Bank. Bank staff visited WEB headquarters and the consultant's
offices, to monitor procurement activities.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Pasir Gudans Thermal Station
4.01      The operating performance of Pasir Gudang as briefly narrated here
is based on discussions with NmB engineers in the head office and the
operating staff of NIB during the site visit in July 1985.
Operating Efficiency
4.02      The overall operating efficiency of the two 120MW units has been
satisfactory. The plant has been demonstrated to produce the rated output at
the guaranteed heat rate. The average annual heat rate of the order of 10,400
kJ/kWh is considered satisfactory.
Operating Problems
4.03      There have been no major problems in the operation of this
station. A few minor problems and design deficiencies are noted belows
(a) The soot blower valves, operating under main steam pressure, have
given trouble in operation;
(b) Corrosion of air preheater due to hig'i sulfur content in oil has
necessitated provision of stainless steel liner plates on unit 2;
(c) Gas sampling system for boiler flue gas and combustion monitoring
systems have not been operating satisfactorily;
(d) The water treatment plant is slightly undersised; i
(e) Power packs have failed in the instrumentation system; electronic
equipments have not been housed in clean conditions;
(f)  There is no "black start" facility at the station.  Start up using
Johor Bdhru gas turbines has not been feasible due to high voltage;
(g) Condenser tube leak detection system did not initially function
satisfactorily; this has since been put right;
(h) The automatic combustion control/is not working satisfactorily and
manual control is resorted to; -
(i) The generator transformers are cooled by sea water, with inherent
risk of corrosion and water mixing with oil;
(j) The stores are inadequate for large items.

Plant Outages
4.04      Outage times of the two units, since commissioning, are tabulated in
Table 4.1

4.05      The average forced outage rate of the two units over the three year
period is of the order of 61. The outage rate is considered to be within
acceptable range for good operating practice.
Engineering, Design, Operation and Maintenance
4.06      The engineering and design of the plant are generally satisfac-
tory. The plant is well operated and maintained. The station employs 300
people (240 for operation and maintenance) which is high. NEB is adopting the
practi % of giving out major maintenance and overhaul works on contract with a
view to reducing permanent personnel requirements in the unskilled and semi-
skilled categories. As elsewhere in the system, NEB has been facing problems
in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel and engineers.
Environmental Aspects
4.07      Environmental considerations have been taken into account in the
station design. The chimney height is adequate to meet pollution require-
ments. The fuel oil tanks have been provided with effluent treatment
systems. A boiler wash water treatment plant was installed after commis-
sioning of the station to separate solids and reduce PH value. Effluent
emission from the incinerator is subject to Pyrolysis process type treatment.
4.08      Hydraulic model studies showed that due to tidal currents in Johor
Straits, hot water recirculation would take place with the original locations
of intake and outfall structures. These were subsequently modified by the
consultant. L shaped deflectors were provided at the outfall and a skimmer
wall at the cooling water intake.
4.09      The temperature differential betweent inlet and outfall cooling
water is within 1O0C.

5.02      Energy sales during the period FY77 to FY83 increased at an average
annual rate of 7.81 as compared to the appraisal estiDate of 1&2. The main
reasons for the lower than forecast sales growth were steep tariff adjustments
between 1975 and 1980 and world-wide recession in tin prices which resulted in
the closing down of a number of tin mines in 1981. During the first oil
crisis in 1975 the government introduced fuel cost variation charges (FCVC)
which allowed 1001 recovery of fuel cost increases from industrial users. As
a result, conservation measures were initiAted and actual electricity con-
sumptions in the subsequent years have been lower than projected. In 1979,
the government stopped the application of FCVC but approved a 132 increase in
rates. The adjustment was insufficient and NEB reported a net loss in FY80.
In an effort to improve NEB's finances, the government exempted the Board from
paying taxes and dividends from FY80 to FY84. In addition, tariff was further
adjusted in FY81 (521 increase in December 1980, with abolition of FCVC and
restructuring of tariff to a progressive block rate). At the end of FY81, the
Board was able to report a net profit again (M$75 million), with average rate
per kWh at M¢20, almost 1541 of the appraisal estimate of M¢13.
5.03      While the magnitude of both revenue and costs were underestimated
(actual average annual increases of 241 and 221 respectively as against 181
and 171 projected at appraisal), total capital investment for this period
followed the forecast fairly closely. With government equity injections and
contributions to rural electrification projects, coupled with revised tariffs
which required capital contributions from industrial and commercial consumers,
NEB's borrowings were lower than forecast. During the period FY77-83, the
Board had no difficulty in raising funds required to finance its development
program. A comparison of actual and projected financing plan of the Board for
the period FY77 to FY83 is detailed in Annex 6.
Financial Targets
5.04      The financial covenants governing loans to NEB have undergone change
over the years 1975 to 1984, commencing with the Seventh Power Loan 1178-MA
and ending with the Eleventh Power Loan 2438-MA, as illustrated in Table
5.2. The criterion of rate of return on net fixed assets was changed from
historical value asset base to revalued asset base in FY78 and was replaced by
the self financing ratio requirement from FY81 onwards. The debt service
coverage covenant was substituted by the debt equity ratio covenant from FY78
onwards, while short term debt limitation was changed from an absolute value
to a value related to total debt from FY78 to FY80. In FY81 a requirement
governing current liability as a percentage of cash operating expense was
introduced which was later replaced in FY83 by a current ratio stipulation.
The changes reflect Bank's recognition of NEB as a well managed and rapidly
growing utility.
5.05      For the years FY75 to FY77 NEB complied with the covenanted
requirements of rate of return on historical value of assets, debt service
coverage and short term debt limitation. NEB was unable to comply with the
rate of return criteria based on revalued net fixed assets in FY78 and FY79
mainly due to rapid increases in fuel prices. Government took remedial
measures such as permitting tariff changes from FY79, exempting NEB from
taxation and payment of dividends and injecting equity into NEB's resources.
From FY81 onwards NEB has complied with the self financing ratio covenant.
NEB has also complied with the debt equity ratio covenant from FY78 onwards.

Deviations from the liquidity covenants from FY78 to FY82 were minor. By
1983, NEB's current ratio was about 1.0, somewhat lower than the covenanted
level of 1.1. This was mainly due to large payables of retention amounts on
projects under completion. NEB has not experienced any serious liquidity
shortage in all these years and the current ratio is expected to exceed 1.0 by
1985.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      At appraisal NEB was a financially sound, well organized .-nd
operated public utility. Its management structure had been reorganized in the
year 1973-74, based on a consultant's recommendations which took into account
the government's policy of providing a more equitable distribution of jobs
among the various races. NEB had an efficient finance and accounting organ-
ization; however it experienced some difficulty in recruitment and retention
of qualified staff. It ran a comprehensive staff training program, usder its
Education and Training department and planned to construct a training school
for technicians and clerical cadres. NEB's institutional development in the
r,riud 1975 to 1985 is narrated below.
Organization Structure
6.02      Notable changes introduced since the time of SAR are:
(a) Incorporation of a corporate audit department directly responsible
to the General Manager.
(b) Creation of a post of Deputy General Manager Major Projects.
(c) Shifting of the Commercial Manager to the Administration department
under Deputy General Manager Administration.
(d) Setting up of a separate Rural Electrification department (including
Minihydro) under a Chief Engineer, directly responsible to the
'eneral Manager.
(e) Setting up of a separate Materials Management department directly
responsible to the General Manager.
(f)  Institution of a 'Technical Planning' department, under Deputy
General Manager Development Planning, responsible for studies such
as Energy Utilization, Tariff and System Planning. Under Bank's
Loan 2438-MA, NEB will be engaging the services of experts to review
and advise measures to strengthen its corporate planving capabil-
ities.
A review of NEB's organizational efficiency was made by consultants Gilbert
Commonwealth International USA in 1982. NEB appointed a senior management
committee and various subcommittees to implement some of the recommendations
of the consultant which were aimed at making the management structure more
effective.



- 20 -
Manpower and Training (The Training Institute)
6.03      A problem that has been faced and continues to be faced to some
extent by NEB is the recruitment anl retention of technically and managerially
qualified manpower and an excess of semi-skilled and unskilled manpower. NEB
has addressed this problem with some success by severely curtailing recruit-
ment to the semi-skilled/unskilled cadres and providing incentives such as
foreign travel and an attractive pension plan for retaining sernior staff.
NEB constructed in 1982, at a cost of M$70 million, a Training Institute to
cater to all Power Utility operations. This is one of the largest institutes
of its kind in the world. The institute has a staff of 320, conducts about
230 courses a year (for 3000 to 4000 personnel) related to diverse subjects
like:
(a) basic Technical skills;
(b) administration and Finance;
(c) management and Supervisory development; and
(d) general and Physical education.
Training is given to new recruits as well as to existing NEB personnel for
whom it is compulsory for promotion.
6.04      The Training Institute houses a thermal power plant simulator,
simulating the Prai thermal station control room. The simulator is computer
based and the software mathematically models the operation of the plant.
Consequent to the experience gained with the Prai simulator NEB is procuring a
simulator for the multi fuel *i-ed 300MW Port Kelang thermal units.  The
simulator will be financed under Bank Loan 2438-MA.
Accounting, Budgeting and Data Processing
6.05      NEB's accounting systems conform to modern utility practices and
accounting applications at Kuala Lumpur have been computerized. Under Bank
Loan 2438-MA NEB will install 'Distributed Source Data Generation Project'
which will transmit data from districts directly to the EDP center in Kuala
Lumper, using the Telecom Malaysia's Packet Switching Network, which is set up
by the Government as basic infrastructure. This will considerably improve the
efficiency of Accounting and Management Information system of NEB.
6.06      NEB also has plans for the following:
(a) Computerized billing system linking the districts with the center;
(b) Microcomputer project for technical applications and inventory
control of 70 district stores;
(c) Computerised Materials Management system - Purchasing, Supply,
Stores Accounting and On Line Inventory Control;
(d) Credit Control Project - Consumer Billing, Revenue Accounting,
Deposit Accounts (on line access to district bank accounts),
customer services;
(e) Capital Works Job Accounting;



- 21 -
(f) Fixed Assets and Depreciation Accounting;
(g) investment Forecasting.
Billing and Collection
6.07      The billing and collection system has been streamlined with on-the-
Jpot billing and collection through district offices, post offices and
agents. The customer's accounts receivables outstanding are about 50 day
billing.
Audit and Internal Control
6.08      NEB's accounts are audited by the Auditor, General, who has engaged
the services of external auditors. Although NEB is able to produce unaudited
accounts within six months of fiscai year ending, the audited accounts take
about nine months due to delays in the Auditor General's department.  The
corporate audit department of NEB is fairly well staffed with qualified
m aagement experts, engineers and accountants. Measures for augmenting and
training of staff are constantly in progress.
-SYstem Planning, Operation and Control
6.09      NEB has developed considerable inhouse expertise in generation and
transmission planning and owns and uses computer programs for generation and
transmission investment planning. Under Bank Loan 1808-MA NEB will be
employing specialists to review and recommend measures for further strengthdn-
ing its system planning capabilities. NEB has a computer assisted Load
Despatch Center at Kuala Lumpur and plans to introduce regional control
centers.
Institutional Performance
6.10      The key figures relating to institutional performance over the
period 1977 to 1983 are reproduced in Table 6.1. The figures for consumers
per employee and sales per employee may be regarded as substantially constant
over th seven year period. This is due to the rapid growth in non-technical
and IMG- cadres required to man growing district wise and rural elect-
rification operations as well as NEB's decision to take security staff in its
employ. To improve this situation NEB has imposed a freeze on the recruitment
of unskilled category of staff since 1981.

6.11      Summarizing, NEB's organization has advanced considerably in
structure and capabilities since the time of the SAR.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      An economic reevaluation of the 2x12OMW Pasir Gudang Thermal station
has been done, essentially on the lines of the SAR. The main points which
highlight the differences between the data and assumptions used in the SAR and
those used in this reevaluation are summarized below.
Plant Capacity Factor
7.02      The SAR had assumed a constant capacity factor of about 801 and a 30
year plant life. It, however, did not indicate energy generation in the first
three-five years of plant ovieration.  With the present policy of moving away
from oil for power generation, energy production from Pasir Gudang will
decline over the years.  The PCK uses actual capacity factor values from 1982
to 1984 and values declining from 691 in 1988 to 301 in the year 2006 as shown
in Annex 7, assuming a plant economic life of 25 years.  The capacity factors
are based on NEB's prediction of the operation of Pasir Gudang thermal station
as visualized today. This scenario could change in the next few years if
Pasir Cudang is converted to gas firing following completion of the east coast
gas pipeline project to Singapore.



- 23 -
7.03      The SAR's economic evaluation is based on a 1977 fuel oil price of
M$223/ton and a fuel efficiency of 0.238 kg/kWh yielding a fuel cost of
MC5.31/kWh. With the sharp increase in oil prices from 1979 onwards, the fuel
oil price had risen to about M$450/ton in 1980 declining subsequently to about
M$433/ton in 1984. The PCR assumes actual fuel oil consumption and cost from
1980 to 1984 (in constant end 1980 prices) and 1984 value for the life of the
plant. The figures are indicated in Annex 7 and reflect a fuel cost level of
about M¢10.0/kWh.
Operation and Maintenance Cost
7.04      The SAL had assumed "System Operation Costs and Financial Costs for
T&D System" as MC2.9 per kWh sold. The PCR assumes actual operation and
maintenance figures for Pasir Gudang thermal station for the period 1982 to
1984 (in constant end 1980 prices) and 1984 value of M$12.7 tillion throughout
plant life. For the year 1984 this works out to MCO.88/kWh generated
(M¢1.04/kWh sold). The operation and maintenance cost of the Transmission and
Distribution (T&D) system that could be reasonably associated with Pasir
Cudang generation has been evaluated on the following basis.
0&M cost of T&D  =  Total System O&M cost    X  Pasir Cudang Generation XO.85
associated with        for T&D (including               Total Energy Sales
Pasir Gudang       depreciation)
The factor 0.85 assumes an energy loss of 151 for station use and in
the TED system. Actual figures are used for the period 1982 to 1984 (in
constant end 1980 prices) and 1984 value of M02.56/kWh generated (M¢3.01/kWh
sold) for the life of the plant.
Benefits
7.05      The SAR evaluated the benefits from Pasir Gudang at the rate of
M013.0 per kWh sold. Compared to this, the average revenue per kWh sold in
1977 was M011.0/kWh.
7.06      The present day revenue per kWh sold for the entire system is of the
order of M021/kVh (in 1980 prices). The PCR evaluates the benefits based on
actual revenue realized per kWh sold for the years 1982 to 1984 (in constant
end 1980 prices) and the 1984 value of M¢21.29/kWh for the life of the
plant.
EIRR Computation
7.07      Details of the economic evaluation are presented in Annex 7.  The
EIER works out to 18%. The SAR had evaluated an EIRR of 14%.
7.08      The reevaluated EIRR of 18% compared to the SAR value of 14%1,
indicates that although the fuel costs have gone up considerably, tariff
increases which were effected from 1978 to 1980, have been more than
compensatory and have resulted in a high level of return from oil fired
generation comparable to Pasir Gudang thermal station. A sensitivity test,
evaluating the benefit from 1984 onwards at M*19 per kWh, which was the long
run average incremental energy cost estimated in 1981 (ref. SAR for eleventh
Power Project), yields an 11 ERR.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Achievement of Project Objectives
8.01      Construction of the Pasir Gudang thermal station was a timely
augmentation of the generstion capability of NEB, as borne out by the
sustained load growth at an average annual rate of 81, which necessitated
installation of 5 x 20MW gas turbines in 1979 as the Temmengor hydro project
was delayed. The gas turbines continue to meet system peaking requirements
even today. The 3 x 10 MW Sultan Ismail thermal power station is expected to
close down in September 1985.
8.02      Pasir Gudang has been operating at about 7'] capacity factor instead
of 80X assumed in the SAR. Further, with shift away from oil fired generation
to gas, coal and hydro (an indicative gas price of H$6.5/MBTU compares favor-
ably with oil price of M$10.8/MBTU for Pasir Gudang) the capacity factor for
Pasir Gudang operation will progressively reduce. Even so, the Pasir Gudang
thermal station has an economic internal rate of return of 181, with benefit
evaluation based on present tariff level.
Project Implementation and Operating Outcome
8.03      Implementation of the Pasir Gudang thermal power station with 2 x
120 MW units was achieved with a delay of 13 months. A part of the delay was
due to difficulties of piling in marshy land; the contractor's response to
this was however very good. A substantial portion of the delay was due to
major changes in the design of the circulating water system, dictated by
hydraulic model studies. It took a rather long time for the consultant to
revise the design and finalize construction methods and rates with the
contractor, although it must be recognized that construction had to be under-
taken under onerous conditions. The situation was aggravated by lack of
proper management and poor response on the part of the contractor. Unsatis-
factory performance of the same contractor on main plant foundations and
superstructure caused further delay. The contractual aspects were not
effectively handled by the consultant with this contractor. The dispute is
likely to go for arbitration. All this points to the need for (a) careful
study of soil conditions prefera'ly at the time of site selection and
definitely prior to piling; (b) completion of hydraulic model studiei suffic-
iently in advance of design and tendering especially when the expanse of cool-
ing water is narrow; (c) careful review of management and manpower resources
before awarding more than one major contract to the same contractor; (d)
timely and forceful approach on the part of the consultant/client in dealing
with contractors when long delays are foreseen.
8.04      The delay of over two years in civil construction work was shortened
to an overall project delay of only about a year due to efficient management
on the part of the consultant and good response from the other plant con-
tractors.
8.05      Delays in transmission line construction were partly due to wayleave
problems (which continue to be faced in Malaysia) but to a large extent due to
security reasons, over which NEB or the contractor had little control.

8.06      Pasir Cudang thermal station plant achieved its guaranteed output
and efficiency. Forced outage rates in the last three years were about 6x.
Though forced and planned outage rates are within acceptable limits they can
be further improved. WEB is aware of the need to reduce plant major overhaul
periods and is taking necessary action through staff training and subcon-
tracting work to external agencies.
Performance of Esternal Agencies
8.07      The Bank staff worked closely with NEB on this project.  Procurement
work proceeded smoothly. There were six supervision visits, about one every
year. This frequency is adequate. NEB has extended excellent cooperation to
Bank missions and are appreciative of Bank's role in their power sector
development.
