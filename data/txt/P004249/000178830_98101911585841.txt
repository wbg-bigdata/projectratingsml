MALAYSIA
NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
EIGHTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Eighth Power Project of the National Electricity Board of the
States of Malaya (NEB) covers the construction of a new thermal power station
(2 x 120 MW) at Pasir Gudang on the Johore Strait and expansion of transmis-
sion facilities.
ii.       NEB has received an aggregate of US$214.2 million (net of cancella-
tions) in seven Bank loans since 1958 which have helped finance additions of
1,370 MW to system capacity and expand the transmission system. The proposed
loan would assist NEB in financing its generation and transmission expansion
program. The projects under previous loans have been satisfactorily completed
or are now under construction and no significant problems have arisen since
the beginning of the Bank's association with NEB.
iii.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$164.0 million
equivalent of which the Bank would finance US$22 million, a portion of the
foreign cost. The balance of the foreign cost (US$98 million) would be
financed as to US$68 million from bilateral or suppliers' credits, US$25 mil-
lion from commercial banks, many of which are interested in the project and
US$5 million from NEB. Local costs would be financed as to US$39 million
from NEB's internal cash generation, government equity or local borrowing and
US$5 million from commercial banks. This would be the first Bank loan to NEB
in cooperation with commercial banks.
iv.       The proposed loan would be applied against the foreign exchange
cost of civil works, transmission facilities and engineering services.
Procurement would be made on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Finance for the
foreign cost of boilers and turbo-alternators would be procured by bilateral
or suppliers' credits, and those of other electrical and mechanical equipment,
by commercial bank loans.
v.        Malaysia has embarked on a dynamic program to expand the economy
both in agriculture and industry. Economic growth during the Second Malaysia
Plan (1971-75) averaged 7.5% per annum. The per capita income of US$720 in
1976 was among the highest in Southeast Asia. Demand for power grew in line
with the expansion of the economy.
vi.       Responsibility for the power sector in Peninsular Malaysia rests
with two organizations: NEB, responsible for most of the generation, trans-
mission and distribution; the Perak River Hydroelectric Company Limited (PRHE)
responsible for generation and transmission in part of the State of Perak.
PRHE is now controlled by the Government and will be integrated with NEB in
the near future.



- ii -
vii.      NEB operates in Peninsular Malaysia and is organized as a modern
public utility with considerable autonomy. Separate Boards are responsible
for electric power in the States of Sabah and Sarawak. NEB's stock is almost
wholly Government-owned and the directors are appointed by the Minister of
Works and Utilities. Its financial history is good and NEB's present finan-
cial position is sound. A rate of return greater than 8% on revalued net
fixed assets in operation is expected throughout the forecast period.
viii.     NEB's expansion program required to meet forecast growth FY1977-83
is estimated at US$1,600 million; the proposed project would account for 10%
of this amount. The program after 1981 has yet to be optimized to show that
it is the least cost sequence of system development.
ix.       The Pasir Gudang thermal project is the only possible development
that can be constructed in time to meet forecast load and energy requirements
in 1981. It forms part of all the sequences of system expansion used to
determine the least cost solution.
x.        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$22 million for a
period of 17 years including a grace period of 3-1/2 years.

NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
EIGHTH POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The report covers the appraisal of the Eighth Power Project of the
National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB), for extension of
generation and transmission facilities.
1.02      The project consists of the construction of a new thermal power
station (2 x 120 MW) at Pasir Gudang on the Johore Strait, 74 miles of 275 kV
transmission line from Temengor to Prai and 8 miles of 132 kV transmission
line from Pasir Gudang to Majidee substation to link the new facility
with the existing transmission grid system.
1.03      The estimated cost of the project is M$410.0 million (US$164 mil-
lion). The Bank has been requested to finance part of the foreign exchange
component in an amount of M$55.0 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) about
13% of the total cost. M$170 million (US$68.0 million) of the foreign cost
would be financed by bilateral or suppliers' credits; M$62.5 million
(US$25 million) by commercial banks; and M$12.5 million (US$5.0 illion) by
NEB. The local cost component of M$110.0 million (US$44.0 million) would be
financed as to M$12.5 million (US$5.0 million) by commercial banks and
M$97.5 million (US$39.0 million) from NEB's internal cash generation, govern-
ment equity or local borrowing.
1.04      The Borrower would be NEB to which the Bank has made seven loans
aggregating US$214.2 million (net of cancellations). The projects under the
first four loans have been completed and are operating satisfactorily. Under
the fifth, three 120 MW units were commissioned in February and September
1976, and February 1977 respectively. Construction of the projects under the
sixth and seventh loans are progressing satisfactorily.
1.05      A project performance audit report made in 1975 for the fourth loan
indicated that the project had a saving of US$5.2 million but was completed
about two years behind schedule due to delays arising from industrial disputes
at the factory of the supplier of turbo-alternators. NEB's financial perfor-
mance was better than the appraisal projections and NEB's organization struc-
ture was modified.
1.06      The project now proposed is to assist NEB in expanding its generation
and transmission facilities, to continue the Bank's role in institution
building and to assist NEB in borrowing from commercial sources.
1.07      This report is based on a system study report prepared by Preece,
Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the United Kingdom, a project engineering report
prepared by TATA Consulting Engineers of India and on information gathered
by Bank missions to Malaysia in July and November 1976.

2. THE COUNTRY, THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      Malaysia consists of the peninsula of Malaya which lies between
Thailand and Singapore, and the States of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of
Borneo (Kalimantan). The aggregate area of Malaysia is about 128,730 square
miles. In 1974 it had a population of about 11.7 million, which grew at an
average rate of 2.6% 1965 through 1974.
2.02      Malaysia's economy has done well in the past, particularly during
the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) period 1971-75.  The per capita income of
US$720 in 1976 was among the highest in Southeast Asia. Public and private
investments have been stepped up, as a result economic growth which during
the 1960's averaged 6% a year, increased during the SMP period to 7.5%.
2.03      During 1970-74, rubber continued to be the main pillar of the Malay-
sian economy contributing about 30% of export earnings. Tin ranked second
representing 17% of merchandise exports, followed by saw-logs and sawn-timber
totalling 17%; oil palm products, 8%; and petroleum products, 5%. Progress
has been made in reducing the economy's dependence on rubber and the manufac-
turing sector has performed well, both in terms of output and employment. It
contributed on average 19% of export earnings for 1970-74. This trend is ex-
pected to continue and export earnings are expected to rise to 25% by 1980
and 29% by 1985.
2.04      Net reserves at the end of 1975 were US$1,643 million equal to
about 5 months' net imports at present levels. The ratio of debt service
to export of goods and non-factor services was only 3.9% in 1975.
The Sector
2.05      General.  Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous
government-owned entities. The National Electricity Board of the States of
Malaya (NEB) serves Peninsular Malaysia with the exception of part of the
State of Perak, which is supplied by the Perak River Hydroelectric Company
(PRHE). The Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the Sarawak Electricity Supply
Corporation (SESCO), supply the two states on the island of Borneo.
2.06      The Perak River Hydroelectric Company (PRHE).  The company and its
distribution subsidiary (Kinta Electric Distribution Co., Ltd.) generate and
distribute electricity within their concession area in the State of Perak to
some 70,000 customers; the bulk of the output is sold to the mining industry.
PRHE has a profitable operation. The company is incorporated in the United
Kingdom and operates under a concession granted by the State of Perak in 1926
for a term of 80 years with a break-clause after 50 years. The Government
decided to exercise its right under the concession agreement to acquire the
assets of the company for operation by NEB. Negotiations on the acquisition
of the assets went on for some time but agreement could not be reached on the
price. Government then decided to purchase all the shares in the Company. A
company (Chenderoh Electricity of Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.), was formed for this
purpose and acquired 95% of the Ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange



by June 1976 using a merchant bank as its agent. The General Manager of NEB
has already been appointed a director of PRHE. However, the takeover of the
two companies by NEB which was originally scheduled for November 1976 has
been postponed due to the higher salary scales of PRHE. A committee has been
formed to study ways and means of overcoming these problems and integrating
PRHE into NEB.
2.07      Penang City Council.  The Electricity Supply Department of the
Penang City Council was taken over by NEB in January 1976. Since then, it
has been operating as a district of NEB. Negotiations are still continuing
on the final valuation of the assets to enable the price, when agreed, to be
paid to the Council.
2.08      Energy Resources.  Both natural gas and oil have been found off the
coasts of Sabah and Sarawak and, more recently, off the east coast of the
peninsula of Malaya. Production at present is about 180,000 barrels per day,
or 8 million tons per year. In 3 to 4 years' time, production is expected to
increase at least threefold. Since 1973, Malaysia has been a net exporter of
petroleum products. In the next few years, liquified natural gas might also
become an important foreign exchange earner. Offshore drilling had been
practically suspended since 1975 due to failure to reach a settlement on a
profit sharing formula between Petroleum National Berhad (PETRONAS) and the
private oil companies. Agreement was, however, reached in late 1976 and
drilling has resumed.
2.09      Hydroelectric potential is still a most valuable indigenous energy
resource for power, with 292.4 MW installed and 348 MW under construction
(Temengor Hydroelectric Development). A preinvestment study of the Pergau
Hydroelectric Scheme (100 MW) was completed by the Snowy Mountains Hydroelec-
tric Authority of Australia in 1969 under the Colombo Plan. A group of Russian
Engineers has completed a feasibility study in 1976 of the Sungai Tembeling
Scheme (90 MW). The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is preparing the
detailed design and tender documents for the Trengganu Multi-purpose Project
(400 MW) on the east coast; the feasibility study was completed in 1976 by the
same firm. The development of hydro resources is therefore being actively
pursued.
2.10      Supply and Demand of Electric Power.  The present generating
capacity installed by the various entities in Malaysia is as follows:
Entity        Installed Capacity (MW)
NEB                 1,307.8
PRHE                  121.0
SEB                    88.6
SESCO                  84.2
Total          1,601.6
Out of this total, 292.4 MW is hydro (18%); 1,064.0 MW (67%) steam; and
245.2 MW (15%) diesel. In addition, there is a total of 41.8 MW in about
117 diesel plants owned by small electric companies which supply power on a
licensed basis and 150 MW of privately owned small diesel units.



- 4 -
2.11      For Peninsular Malaysia, total energy generation in FY75 was 5,444
GWh of which 5,211 GWh were generated by public utilities, 48 GWh by mining
installations and 185 GWh by private industries. Hydroelectric plants produced
989 GWh or 18%; steam power plant, 4,052 GWh or 74%; diesel units, 403 GWh or
8%. Per capita generation was 544 kwh.
2.12      The power market has grown steadily in the past decade with a 14%
average annual increase in total sales from FY67 through FY76. Out of 826,400
consumers served by NEB in FY76, 226,200 are located in the Central Region,
272,200 in the Northern Region, 219,400 in the Southern Region and 108,600 in
the Eastern Region.
2.13      Consumption per capita in FY75 was 475 kwh which compares with 490
kwh in Korea, 229 kwh in the Philippines, 176 kwh in Thailand and 30 kwh in
Indonesia. Of the total energy consumption of 4,754 GWh in FY75, 877 GWh or
18% were used by residential consumers, 2,737 GWh or 58% by commercial and
industrial consumers (other than mining); and 1,140 GWh or 24% by the mining
industries. Access to electricity in Peninsular Malaysia is estimated to be
52% (Annex 1).
2.14      Except for some rural stations which provide only 12 hours service,
the quality of service has generally been good. However, due to a shortage of
reserve capacity, limited load curtailment has been necessary during the
dry season or during the emergency shut-downs of large thermal units. This
situation should improve after the commissioning of the Temengor Hydroelectric
Project (4 x 87 MW) in 1978/79.
2.15      Rural Electrification.  Rural electrification in Malaysia began in
the 1950's when a large number of the rural population was concentrated in
villages during the emergency.  These villages were electrified from diesel
generators to provide perimeter lighting for security reasons. Originally
the installations were operated by NEB's predecessor organization (the
Central Electricity Board) on the basis of cost reimbursement from Government.
After the emergency, the majority of the small systems were sold to private
licensees as they were uneconomic on a full NEB service basis; 82 such licen-
sees still exist.
2.16      Rural electrification as a social objective began in 1957 and by
the end of FY75, 2,681 villages covering 227,041 consumers had been electri-
fied. The 30,000 rural consumers who were given supply in FY 75 represented
about 46% of NEB's domestic consumer increase for that year.
2.17      While it is Government's intention to electrify rural Malaysia to
the greatest extent possible, the current program is unplanned. Villages make
application to the State Governments for supply; state administrators select
villages from these applications on a rather arbitrary basis for recommendation
to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government approves the program
according to the availability of funds. The capital cost of the program,
including estimated operating deficits for the first 7 years is now financed
two-thirds by the Federal Government and one-third by NEB.



2.18      Under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA), a rural electrifica-
tion study was included in the loan package in order to formulate a comprehen-
sive rural electrification plan and to review its technical, economic and
financial implications. The study is being carried out by the Middle West
Service Company of Chicago in association with the Perunding Bersatu Sdn.
Bhd. of Kuala Lumpur covering the following items:
-    review of NEB's past rural electrification performance;
-    projection of future load, energy and consumer growth in
rural areas;
-    criteria to be used in selection of areas and villages
to be electrified;
-    formulation of system alternatives;
-    estimate of capital and operating costs; and
-    analysis and comparison of alternatives.
The study which began in January 1977 is expected to be completed in about 18
months. The report should be available by mid-1978.
3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be NEB, established in 1949 under the Electricity
Act of that year, a financially sound, well organized and operated utility.
Highlights of NEB's operations are given in Annex 2.
Organization and Management
3.02      NEB is organized and functions as a modern public utility corporation
with a considerable degree of autonomy. It is both a regulatory and operating
agency, charged with the operation of the electric installations under its
jurisdiction and the establishment of such new facilities as may be required.
It regulates the production and use of electric energy in West Malaysia and
grants licenses for the installation and operation of independent electricity
works to be used for public or private purposes. NEB has the legal power to
set its tariffs (see para 3.11) but operates under Government direction in
this regard.
3.03      The Board of Directors consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman and
not more than 10 nor less than 5 other members. At present there are 10
members, all of whom serve in a part-time capacity, with the exception of
the Deputy Chairman who is also the General Manager. Members are appointed
by the Minister of Works and Utilities and their appointments are subject to
terms and conditions he may determine.
3.04      NEB has reorganized its management structure over the course of
the past three years, based on consultants' recommendations which took into



- 6 -
account Government's policy of providing more equitable distribution of job
opportunities among the different races. Principal changes in higher-level
positions have been essentially completed. A copy of the organization chart
is shown in Annex 3.
3.05      The previous loan agreement contained an undertaking that the Bank
would be consulted before appointments were made to the positions of General
Manager and Financial Controller. This undertaking was inserted for the
First Loan made by the Bank to NEB shortly after Malaysia gained its indepen-
dence. Such an undertaking is no longer considered necessary and therefore
it is discontinued.
3.06      NEB had a total of 12,780 employees by end FY76, consisting of
476 senior officers, 2,359 technical staff, 2,859 non-technical staff and
7,086 in the industrial and manual group. The management and staff are able
and well qualified. In recent years, NEB has been losing middle-level staff
to the private sector because salary scales are tied to those of the civil
service and the demand from the private sector for skilled employees has been
high due to Malaysia's rapid industrial development. NEB is endeavoring to
overcome the problem by training members in excess of its requirements.
Training
3.07      NEB operates a comprehensive staff training program under its
Education and Training Department which is satisfactory. Since 1960, 693
engineering scholarships have been sponsored at universities and technical
institutes both in Malaysia and overseas; of this number, 394 have graduated
and 299 are continuing their studies. In 1976, NEB sponsored scholarships
for 19 student accountants for the first time. 355 technical cadets, junior
accountants and apprentices have received on-the-job training.
3.08      A training school, presently under construction, is expected to be
completed in FY78. A staff member of the International Labor Organization is
currently attached to NEB to formulate the curricula. Courses offered will
generally be at the technical and clerical level with the aim of meeting
NEB's manpower requirements and furthering Government's policy of ensuring
equitability in employment for Malays.
Consultants
3.09      In the past, NEB used consultants to make engineering and manage-
ment studies and for the design, procurement and supervision of construction.
The arrangement and performance have generally been satisfactory. Recently
NEB began to use its own staff to design and supervise the construction of
small thermal units (the sixth unit at Johore Bahru Thermal Power Station of
30 MW) and 66 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and will likely expand such
activities with time. NEB will however continue to use consultants to aug-
ment its own capabilities for large or complex facilities.
Planning
3.10      NEB has been attempting to carry out more of its system planning
in-house in recent years rather than using consultants. However, manpower



constraints and unfamiliarity with objective system planning based on least-
cost solutions, have led NEB to change the power development program without
undertaking sufficient analysis. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the power development program will be reviewed at least every year and
updated as and when necessary, based on a least-cost analysis, either in-
house or by using consultants.
Tariffs
3.11      Under the Electricity Act, NEB has the power to fix tariffs without
reference to any other authority. In practice, because of political con-
siderations, the Cabinet deliberates on the sector tariffs. NEB's policy
has been to produce a return on its average net fixed assets in operation of
at least 8% per annum on historically valued assets and to finance at least
40% of construction costs from internal sources. NEB's internal cash genera-
tion has financed over 60% of the expansion program, but this situation has
been changing due to accelerated load growth, the expanded construction
program and inflation; consequently, greater reliance will have to be placed
on borrowing and additional equity in the future.
3.12      Basic tariffs have not been revised since 1958 and are therefore not
related to NEB's current costs of system operation in view of the changes that
have occurred since then. Furthermore, the present tariffs are too cumbersome
involving 23 different categories. NEB engaged Electrowatt of Zurich to re-
view tariffs in 1971, but they did not then investigate the cost of supplying
the different categories of consumers. NEB re-engaged Electrowatt in 1975 to
study these costs and an outline of appropriate terms of reference for the
study was sent by the Bank to NEB covering inter alia the incremental costs
to the economy of NEB operating and expanding its system. The draft final
report was completed in January 1977; it is being reviewed by NEB and the Bank.
3.13      NEB has a fuel adjustment clause in its tariff schedules which
allows any increase or decrease in fuel prices to be passed to consumers.
Taxation
3.14      NEB is liable to pay corporation and development taxes.  Corpora-
tion tax is levied at a rate of 40% and development tax at 5% of taxable
income. In addition, NEB is liable to pay import duties, a fuel tax of
M$17 per ton, a surtax of 5% on imports, and a sales tax of 5%.
Accounting and Audit
3.15      NEB has an efficient finance and accounting organization.  Increas-
ing use is being made of NEB's computer:
(a) the billing system is being expanded to cover more consumers;
and
(b) present worth and rates of return techniques are now being
used to evaluate internally planned projects.



- 8 -
3.16      Price Waterhouse and Company have been the principal auditors of
NEB since it was established; a local firm of accountants, Hanafiah, Raslan,
Mohamad and Partners, audits NEB's branches; both firms are acceptable and
satisfactory. During negoliations, assurances were obtained that NEB will
continue to employ independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Industrial Participation
3.17      NEB is promoting the establishment of local manufacturing capability
in electric meters, paper Lnsulated lead-sheathed cable, medium voltage dis-
tribution transformers and switchgear.  A company in which NEB has a 60%
interest, has already been formed to manufacture paper insulated lead-sheathed
cables; commercial product:Lon began in February 1976. A company is to be
formed in association with Bonar Long & Co. of Scotland for the manufacture
of distribution transformers. Proposals have been received by NEB for coop-
eration in the manufacture of electric meters and switchgear; negotiations
with selected firms are underway.
3.18      The latest loan agreement (Loan 1178-MA) contains a covenant that
limits NEB's investment in industrial activities to a maximum of M$25 mil-
lion (US$10 million). This provision is to limit NEB's investment in fields
other than generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.
Inflation and the increasing scope of NEB's activities make absolute number
limits outdated and the limit was changed during negotiations to a maximum of
1% of gross plant as revalued each year (para 6.09).
Facilities of NEB
3.19      NEB's total present generating capacity of 1,307 MW is made up of
265 MW of hydroelectric plant, 970 14W of steam plant and 72 MW of diesel plant.
Details of existing plant are given in Annex 4. Units 3 and 4 at Port Dickson
Thermal Station (2 x 60 tW - Loan 579 MA) have been in commercial operation
since 1974 and Units Nos. 5 and 6 (2 x 120 MW - Loan 700 MA) have been in
operation since February and September 1976 respectively. No. 7 unit
was commissioned in February 1977. The Temengor Hydroelectric Plant
(4 x 87 MW) scheduled for completion by 1978/79, will bring NEB's total
installed capacity to 1,655 MW including hydro capacity of 613 MW.
3.20      By the end of FY76, NEB's transmission system consisted of about
100 miles of 275 kV, 700 miles of 132 kV, 330 miles of 66 kV and 520 miles
of 33 kV overhead lines as well as 3 miles of 66 kV and 40 miles of 33 kV
underground cables. Distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 11 kV by 290
miles of overhead lines and 3,020 miles of underground cables as well as 200
miles of lines and cables at lower voltages. 4,035 substations with a total
capacity of about 5,760 MVA are in commission. NEB uses underground cable
extensively for its distribution system because NEB has substantiated it as
being cheaper than paying compensation for wayleaves through rubber and
oil-palm plantations. The practice will be reviewed in detail in the
rural electrification study.
3.21      Included in the above, is a 132 kV single-circuit line to connect
the Western System to Kuantan on the east coast of the peninsula. The 275 kV



- 9 -
transmission lines from Temengor to Machang, Kota Bahru and Kuala Trengganu
on the east coast are scheduled for completion by 1980/81. Thus the entire
peninsula will be interconnected and generation by relatively high-cost
isolated diesel stations will be reduced to a minimum.
Future Development
3.22      The Malaysian Government's development strategy for the power sector
is to develop indigenous energy resources, particularly economically justified
hydro-potential to meet peak load to the maximum, and to utilize thermal and/or
nuclear power plants to take the base load.
3.23      NEB's future development program, 1977 through 1983, is based on
the least cost sequence of development as the result of a system study made
by Preece, Cardew and Rider (para 5.02). Total capital expenditures at cur-
rent prices, amount to M$4.1 billion (US$1.6 billion), including M$2.5 billion
(US$1 billion) for generation, M$0.8 billion (US$0.3 billion) for transmission
and M$0.8 billion (US$0.3 billion) for distribution.
4. THE PROJECT
The Project
4.01      The project proposed for Bank financing will consist of the
following:
(a) a new oil-fired thermal power station of 2 x 120 14W located
at Pasir Gudang, on the Johore Strait; and
(b) expansion of transmission facilities.
4.02      The load in the Johore Bahru area in the southern part of Peninsular
Malaysia has been growing at a rate of about 10% per annum in recent years.
The existing generating facilities in this area of the country consist of
only 3 x 10 MW and 3 x 30 MW steam units at Sultan Ismail Power Station. Under
Loan 1031-MA the Bank has financed a double circuit 132 kV transmission line
from Malacca to Scudai interconnecting the Southern System to the Central
Network and, under Loan 1178-MA, a double-circuit 132 kV transmission line
from Scudai to Majidee sub-station with a further extension to Kota Tinggi.
The proposed power station in the Southern System will therefore not only
meet the local load requirements but will also feed into the Central System.
4.03      The unit size will be 120 MW, identical to the units now in oper-
ation at Port Dickson (Loan 700-MA) and under construction at Prai Thermal
Power Station (Loan 1178-MA). Each unit will consist of one 839,520 lbs/hr
reheat tyge boiler designed to operate under steam conditions of 1,800 psi
and 1,000 F/1,0000F; and a turbo-alternator with a maximum continuously rated
capacity of 120 MW.
4.04      The expansion of transmission facilities will include 74 miles of
275 kV double circuit line from Temengor to Prai and 8 miles of 132 kV double
circuit line from Pasir Gudang step-up substation to Majidee. These lines



- 10 -
are required to feed the power output to the national grid from the Prai
thermal power station (3 x 120 MW) financed under the Seventh Power Project
(Loan 1178-MA) and the Pasir Gudang thermal power station proposed to be
financed under this project.

- 11 -
4.06      The basic cost estimate is at end-1976 price levels.  Physical con-
tingencies of about 15% for civil works, 5% for plant and equipment and 10%
for transmission facilities have been included. The price contingencies for
foreign costs were derived by applying the following rates of escalation:
for civil works 9% in FY77-79, and 8% thereafter; for equipment and transmis-
sion facilities 7.5% in FY77-79 and 7% thereafter. The price contingencies
for local costs were assumed to be 6% per annum, based on forecasts made by
the Government.
4.07      Excluding taxes, duties and price contingencies, the unit cost of
Pasir Gudang thermal power station is about US$450 per kW installed. This is
of the right order of magnitude for a newly developed site at end-1976 prices.
Financial Arrangements
4.08      The proposed Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange costs of
civil works, transmission facilities and engineering services. NEB plans to
use bilateral and suppliers' credits for the procurement of boilers, turbo-
alternators and their ancillary equipment. Tender documents for boilers and
turbo-alternators requesting cash and credit bids were issued in October 1976
and opened in February 1977. Very favorable price offers together with finan-
cing terms were received. They are being evaluated by the consultants. No
difficulty in obtaining bilateral or suppliers' credits is anticipated. About
15 commercial banks have submitted their proposals to the Treasury with
favorable financing terms. Treasury will start negotiations with one or two
selected banks in the coming few weeks,
4.09      The proposed financing arrangements are as follows:

Engineering Services
4.10      TATA Consulting Engineers of India has been engaged by NEB to pro-
vide engineering services for site investigation, engineering studies, detailed
design, procurement and construction supervision of the project. This arrange-
ment is satisfactory.
4.11      The Phase I and II services which include investigation, engineering
studies, detailed design and procurement are a lump sum contract amounting to
about US$1.25 million./l The Phase III services which include project manage-
ment, construction supervision, start-up testing and training are estimated at
about 200 man-months averaging approximately US$2,000 per man-month. It was
agreed that there will be no retroactive financing.
Construction
4.12      Civil works will be carried out by contractors under the supervi-
sion of NEB with the assistance of consulting engineers. About 4 years will
be required to complete the project. The first unit is scheduled for com-
missioning by February 1981 and the second unit, by August 1981. A project
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 6.
4.13      The 275 kV transmission line will be constructed by suppliers on a
supply and erect basis. The target date for completion is August 1980, in
line with the completion date of No. 6 unit at Prai thermal power station.
Procurement
4.14      The equipment and materials for transmission facilities to be
financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, with the Bank's
usual preference of 15% (or the custom duties, whichever is less) being
granted to local manufacturers. Civil works, to be similarly financed, which
would include piling, structural steel and cladding, the cooling water
system, other marine works and the chimney, would also be contracted through
international competitive bidding.
Disbursement
4.15      Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made 100% of
foreign expenditures for civil works, engineering services, and directly
imported equipment and materials; 100% of ex-factory cost of equipment and
materials manufactured locally; and 70% of total expenditures for imported
equipment and materials procured locally. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by June 30, 1982. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule
is given in Annex 7.
Ecology
4.16      The Pasir Gudang site is located about 19 miles east of the city
of Johore Bahru. It is situated in an industrial zone with a very low
population density. Land use, other than for industrial development, is
largely devoted to rubber and oil palm plantations. The nearest small town,
/1 Estimated about 750 man-months.



- 13 -
Masai, is about three miles away.  No significant environmental effects on
human life in the region are expected. A chimney of adequate height will be
constructed to keep the ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide within
permissible limits.
4.17      Circulating water will be obtained from and discharged directly
into the Johore Strait. Since this stretch of water is large when compared
with the relatively small cooling water requirements of the station, the
temperature rise in the Strait is not expected to be significant and no appre-
ciable effect on local biota or marine life is expected. Flood and ebb cur-
rents will assist in dissipating the heat. Proposed hydraulic model studies
will indicate the temperature pattern to be expected in the water mass. A
report on these studies will be available by late 1977.
4.18      The transmission lines will pass mostly through rural areas; they
will not impose any environmental problems.
Risks
4.19      Although Malaysia is not considered to be in the seismic zone, a
10% seismic factor is proposed in the design of the plant buildings and other
structures. Meteorological records do not indicate incidence of typhoons or
tornadoes. The maximum gust wind reported is about 66 miles per hour. Wave
heights rarely exceed 1 m. The site has been well investigated; foundation
rock is about 10-20 m below the ground surface. This can be solved by using
piling foundation. Therefore, very little risk is expected in the construc-
tion of the plant.
5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Power Market
5.01      The power market served by NEB has had a long history of steady
growth.   The average annual increase in total sales from FY67 through
FY76 was 14%. Energy sales for the next seven years (FY77-83) are ex-
pected to increase at an average rate of around 13% per annum levelling
off to 10% by FY83. Annex 8 shows the actual and forecast sales of energy.
The system maximum demand in FY76 was 913 MW including the PRHE system.
It is forecast to increase to 1,900 MW by FY83. Annexes 9 and 10 give a
tabulation and chart of the system load requirements and the capabilities
available to meet these demands.
Least Cost Solution
5.02      Preece, Cardew and Rider, NEB's consultants on system development,
have made extensive studies of the generation and transmission expansion pro-
gram covering the period from 1975 through 1983. The least cost sequence
following Port Dickson Stage III (3 x 120 MW) up to 1983 is given below in
chronological order of development:
(a) to develop Temengor Hydroelectric Project (4 x 87 MW)
which is now under construction and scheduled for comple-
tion in 1978/79;



- 14 -
(b) to extend the Prai Thermal Power Station by installing
three additional 120 MW units, No. 4 unit, to be brought
into service in 1979 and No. 5 and No. 6 units in 1980;
(c) to develop a new thermal power station in the South at
Pasir Gudang with 2 x 120 MW units, scheduled for comple-
tion in 1981; and
(d) to develop Bersia (3 x 24 MW) and Kenering (3 x 40 MW)
hydro sites on the Perak river downstream of Temengor,
scheduled for completion in 1982 and 1983 respectively.
The justification of the last two hydro projects is subject to further study
based on revised project costs including transmission. The sequence of devel-
opment after 1981 has yet to be optimized.
5.03      By 1980/81 the system load would increase annually by about 140 MW
in peak demand and 800 GWh in energy requirement. A thermal station is
required to meet the load requirements in 1981. The Pasir Gudang thermal
project is the only possible development that can be completed in time. It
forms part of all the sequences of system expansion used to determine the
least cost solution.
5.04      The 275 kV transmission line from Tememgor to Prai is the result
of "Transmission System Studies, 1976-1985" made by PCR recently to feed the
output of Prai thermal power station into the national grid.
Return on Investment
5.05      The internal rate of return on the Pasir Gudang thermal power sta-
tion including the associated 132 kV transmission line or the discount rate
at which the present worth of costs attributable to the project, excluding
duties and taxes, is equal to that of the benefits derived over its life, is
14% (see Annex 11).
5.06      the updated internal rate of return for the Prai thermal power
station extension using the latest revised cost estimate and including the
new Temengor-Prai line is 15%.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Results and Financial Position
6.01      Policies followed by Government enabled NEB to maintain a sound
financial position until FY74 when Government as part of its anti-inflation
drive, disallowed the application of NEB's fuel adjustment provisions in the
tariff schedules to industrial and commercial consumers from early FY74 until
mid-FY75. Resulting revenue losses drained NEB's cash reserves, causing
liquidity problems by the end of FY76. The Bank urged that action be taken
and the problem has been remedied in the current fiscal year by Government
having paid M$69 million of equity.



- 15 -
6.02      Despite the liquidity problems in FY75-76, NEB performed well.  The
rate of return on historically valued net fixed assets in operation, less
consumer contributions, varied from a minimum of 8.8% in FY69 to a maximum of
13.4% in FY76, satisfactorily exceeding the rate of 8% covenanted with the
Bank. The Debt/Equity ratio improved from 59/41 in FY67 to 50/50 in FY76;
the current ratio for FY76 was 0.7, which was low. NEB had withheld payments
of corporation tax, customs duties and dividends from Government in order to
improve liquidity; in addition NEB drew down bank overdrafts to the maximum
and arranged medium-term loans. Income Statements and Balance Sheets for
FY67 through FY76 are shown in Annexes 12 and 13.
Future Position
6.03      Malaysia's rapid industrialization and rural electrification pro-
grams will cause NEB to expand its asset base about 3 times at current prices
over the next 7 years. Capital expenditures to meet the required construc-
tion program will total about M$4.1 billion (US$1.6 billion). The financial
forecasts FY77-83 assume that M$2,065 million (US$826 million) or 51% would
be borrowed abroad; M$750 million (US$300 million), about 18%, would be
borrowed locally; M$599 million (US$240 million) or 15% would come from
Government equity; and on the assumption that tariffs would be fixed at the
level required to yield an 8% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation, M$837 million (US$335 million) or 20% would be financed from cash
generation. Malaysia and NEB are both extremely creditworthy and no diffi-
culty is anticipated in raising the funds required to meet the financing
plan. Based on the foregoing, the finance plan which is reasonable is as
follows:
Finance Plan: FY77-83
(Millions of M$ and US$)
M$        US$         %
Internal Cash Generation                            2,573      1,029       63

ments and Working Capital                    1,736        694      43

- 16 -
6.04      A contribution to construction from internal cash generation of 20%
would normally be considered low by present-day standards. However, NEB's
average tariff levels in 1976 are high compared to surrounding countries,/1
mainly because NEB pays high taxes and dividends compared to other power
utilities. Taxes and dividends payable to Government included in NEB's
expenditures through FY83, total M$844 million (US$338 million) or 21% of
construction expenditures, an average of about M J1.5 (US j 0.6) per kwh
for the 7 years through FY83. Given the high contribution NEB makes to the
Treasury, arguments can be advanced that Government should plough back some
of these funds to maintain tariffs at a reasonable level and at the same time
make some contribution to offset the low returns on rural electrification
investments (see para 2.17).
6.05      The assumed tariff increases over the forecast period required to
maintain an 8% rate of return on net fixed assets revalued at 5% per annum
and the corresponding average tariff levels /2 are as follows:

/a     Includes 17% which is covered automatically by the
fuel cost surcharge incorporated in NEB's tariff
schedule. (see Annex 14, para 2 for fuel prices)
6.06      Government should take urgent decisions on the tariff and financing
policies to be followed in future so that NEB is in a position to plan its
financing sources. The Electrowatt tariff report (para 3.12) should render
an early decision feasible. Assurances were received during negotiations that
the Bank will be consulted before any changed tariff structure is implemented
and that Government will provide adequate funds to support NEB's development
program.

Future Operating Results
6.07      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 4,543 GWh in FY76 to
10,654 GWh in FY83, an average annual growth rate of 13%. Based on the
tariff increases assumed over the forecast period, energy revenues are fore-
cast to increase from M$488 million (US$195 million) in FY76 to M$1,481 mil-
lion (US$592 million) in FY83.
6.08      The operating ratio LI remains between 74-80% over the 7-year fore-
cast period compared to 75.0% for FY76; in FY83 it is estimated to be 76.5%.
Rate of Return
6.09      The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation, less
consumers contributions, has been high in the past (13.4% in FY76), but
was based on assets valued at historic cost. The covenanted rate of 8% has
always been met. Revaluation of the net fixed assets from FY70, based on the
Malaysian fixed capital formation deflator, would increase the value of the
net fixed assets by about 40% for FY76. In the forecasts, assets have been
revalued at 5% per year. The covenanted rate of return (after tax) for the
proposed loan was agreed at 8% and will be calculated on net fixed assets
in operation revalued as from FY77 in accordance with the fixed capital for-
mation deflator used each year in the Malaysian National Accounts, using
FY70 as the base year.
6.10      NEB's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period after including as equity the surplus arising from the
revaluation of net fixed assets. The debt/equity ratio will vary between
51/49 (FY80) and 44/56 (FY77), a satisfactory position.
Debt Control
6.11      Debt service coverage on an annual basis is estimated to vary
between a minimum of 1.3 times (FY83) and 2.5 times (FY77), an indication
of the short repayment periods and high interest rates assumed for future
borrowings compared to the past (see Annex 14 for Assumptions in Financial
Forecasts). The existing debt service covenant between NEB and the Bank
provides that, except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree,
debt shall not be incurred unless cash generation for the previous fiscal
year is not less than 1.3 times maximum future debt service on all debt
incurred. NEB has always met this test in the past but may have difficulty
in doing so in future. NEB's large investment program would require an
application to the Bank for concurrence on borrowing for each of the numerous
loans required to support it. In view of the fact that NEB's management is
able and follows conservative financial policies, a covenant is required that
will give NEB adequate freedom to manage its debt while providing for Bank
review of borrowings when debt reaches a level that may affect the future
financial position of NEB. During negotiations it was agreed that NEB may

- 18 -
incur any loan when the debt/ ratio is below 60/40. Short-term debt, defined
as maturing within 1 year, would be limited to 5% of total debt.
Current Ratio
6.12      The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.0 (FY67) and 1.8
(FY72); it was 0.7 for FY76. Consumers receivables at end-FY76 were about
1.25 months billing and they have been forecast at this level through FY83.
Inventories were about 5% of gross plant and have also been forecast at this
level through the forecast period. Payables have been forecast at 25% of
operating cost, 10% of construction, 100% of tax and 40% of interest, at the
FY76 levels. Working cash is low through FY78 but can easily be covered by
NEB's bank overdraft and short-term borrowing arrangements. The current ratio
reaches a minimum of 1.1 in FY79 and rises to 1.6 by FY83. Income, Funds
Flow Statements and Balance Sheets are shown in Annexes 15, 16 and 17.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreements were reached on the follow-
ing points and appropriate covenants included in the loan and guarantee
agreements:
(a) NEB's power development program (para. 3.10);
(b)  industrial participation (para. 3.18);
(c)  tariff policy (para 6.06);
(d)  government equity (para 6.06);
(e)  rate of return (para 6.09);
(f)  debt/equity ratio (para 6.11); and
(g)  short-term borrowing (para 6.11).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$22 million
equivalent to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya for a
period of 17 years including a grace period of 3-1/2 years.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
1.   Revenues
Forecast revenues are based on GWh sales predictions by consumer
categories; average prices per kwh are those required to produce the revenues
necessary to yield an 8% rate of return on net fixed assets in operation re-
valued each year less average consumers contributions; on this basis, tariff
increases including 17% to be covered by fuel surcharge of 30% for FY79 and 8%
for FY82 are required.
2.   Fuel Costs
Fuel oil prices based on 1976 levels have been estimated as follows:
(a)  M$110 (US$44) per ton for Port Dickson through FY78 based
on a contract signed in 1973 which expires in 1978, and
M$240 (US$96) thereafter;
(b) M$240 per ton for other steam stations;
(c) M$267 per ton for heavy diesel fuel; and
(d) M$1.31 per gallon for low-speed diesel fuel.
3.   Customs Duties and Other Taxes
NEB is subject to fuel oil duties (M$17-US$6.8 per ton), customs
duty, development tax and corporation tax of 5% and 40% of taxable income
respectively.
4.   Operating Costs
Forecast, operating, maintenance and administration expenditures
are based on a detailed analysis of the cost per kwh sold by each station
for FY76 escalated at an average of 6% per annum.
5.   Construction Expenditures
Construction expenditures are based on consultants' or NEB esti-
mates at 1976 prices and escalated thereafter at about 5% per year for
local and foreign costs respectively.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
6.   Depreciation
Depreciation is charged on the straight line method and averages
about 3% of revalued gross plant.
7.   Forecast External Sources
Projected borrowings and other sources are assumed as follows:
(a) the proposed IBRD loan of M$55 million (US$22 million) at
8.2% for a term of 17 years including 3.5 years of grace;
(b) balances to be drawn on IBRD loans 700-MA, 1031-MA and
1178-MA amounting to M$154.3 (US$61.7 million) at interest
rates of 7, 7.25 and 8.5% respectively for terms of 20
years including 5 years grace;
(c) agreed bilateral and suppliers credits of M$421.8 million
(US$168.7 million) at interest rates varying from 3% to
8.75% with repayment periods ranging from 10 to 22 years;
(d) agreed commercial bank loans totalling M$95 million
(US$38 million) at interest rates varying from 9.5 to 10%
and repayment periods ranging from 4 to 10 years;
(e) assumed foreign loans totalling M$1,292.0 million
(US$516.8 million) at an interest rate of 9% and terms of
20 years including 5 years of grace;
(f) an assumed local loan of M$750 million (US$300 million)
at an interest rate of 9% for a term of 15 years including
5 years grace;
(g) assumed equity investment by Government of M$599 million
(US$239.6 million) of which M$69 million (US$27.6 million)
has been arranged. Dividends of 5% per year, less tax, have
been assumed payable on equity; and
(h) contributions from consumers totalling M$107 million
(US$42.8 million).
