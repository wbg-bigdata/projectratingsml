REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD
OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF tALAYSIA
FOR AN EIGHTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) with
the guarantee of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$22 million to help
finance an eighth power project. The loan would have a term of 17 years
including three and a half (3-1/2) years of grace with interest at 8.2%
per annum. Co-financing in the amount of US$30 million is presently being
negotiated by the Government with commercial banks.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia:   Second Plan Performance and
Third Plan Issues," (No. 1177-MA) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on September 20, 1976. Detailed data on Malaysia's economy are shown in
Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) (1971-75). The per
capita income of US$720 is among the highest in Southeast Asia. Public and
private investment activity has been stepped up and, as a result, economic
growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased during the SMP
to 7.5%. Progress has been made in reducing the economy's dependence on
rubber, and the manufacturing sector has performed well, both in terms of
output and employment. With a high export component in GNP, the country is
very vulnerable to external fluctuations, which were significant during the
SMP. During the Second Plan the proportion of agricultural households in
poverty in Peninsular Malaysia was reduced from 68% to 63%. In addition, in
spite of the increased investment activity and resulting current account
deficits in the balance of payments, during the SMP Malaysia managed to main-
tain a strong external position with relatively low debt service payments and
growing international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance during the SMP there are still
substantial inequalities in income and employment, as well as considerable
poverty; 44% of the population is considered to be in poverty. In 1970 in
Peninsular Malaysia the per capita income among Malays, who constitute a
little over half of the population, was only half that of the Chinese and 60%
of that of the Indians who, together, make up most of the remainder of the
population. This inferior income position of the Malays is related to the
concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and the comple-
mentary meager ownership of corporate assets and poor representation of Malays
in the modern industrial sector, especially in managerial, professional,
supervisory and clerical occupations. These inequalities have threatened the
stability of the country and prompted the Government in 1971 to introduce the
New Economic Policy. The New Economic Policy is designed to achieve national
unity through the two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and restruc-
turing society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.



5.        The Government recently approved the Third 2Ialaysia Plan (TMP)
(1976-80). In addition to reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy,
the TMP stresses that national unity as well as social and economic progress
can only be achieved in an environment of security and order. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980 (which would mean reducing poverty in the
agriculture sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of employment in
these sectors of 32% towards a goal of 50%); (c) to increase the share
of Malays in the equity ownership of the corporate sector (from the 1975
Malay share of 8% to 16% in 1980); and (d) to promote the participation of
Chinese and Indian Malaysians in agriculture and services.
6.        One of the principal means set out in the TMP to reduce poverty
is to raise agricultural production. In the Third Plan one quarter (M$4.7
billion) of total development expenditures is allocated to this sector
(compared with 22% or M$2.1 billion in the SMP).    Of this more than one third
will be spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural areas. In
addition, one million acres of new land are targeted for development. As a
means of reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improving housing
(M$2.5 billion) and other essential services for the poor in both rural and
urban areas. The TMP also stresses that greater attention will be given to
improving the less developed states in Malaysia.
7.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. The
investment rate, in real terms, is projected to increase from 18% to 19.5% of
GDP, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion, in current prices, over the
TMP period. Public development expenditures are set at M$18.6 billion and a
higher level of M$20 billion is targeted if resources become available.
8.        An examination of the external circumstances likely to prevail
during the Third Plan suggests that Malaysia can pursue an ambitious invest-
ment and growth strategy. With the likelihood of an improvement in the terms
of trade and an increase in oil production, Malaysia's external capital
requirements should not exceed US$1.4 billion during the period. To support
the development program, about half of this inflow would need to be loans to
the public sector. If project loans from multilateral sources (IBRD and ADB)
remain at approximately current levels, there will need to be an increase in
assistance from bilateral sources such as Japan and the OPEC countries, as
well as higher levels of market borrowing.
9.        Debt service obligations at present are about 3.2% of exports of
goods and nonfactor services and should not rise beyond 6% by 1980. This
level is well within Malaysia's debt servicing capacity. Disbursed Bank
loans outstanding represent about 22% of Malaysia's total external public
debt outstanding and disbursed. The Bank's share in Malaysia's debt service
payments is about 21% and by 1980 is expected to drop to about 14%.
10.       In general, Malaysia can reasonably expect to be able to raise
sufficient resources during the next five years to continue a high growth and
socially oriented development strategy. In the public sector, the main focus



- 3 -
will have to be on the rural sector, especially on improving productivity on
existing farms where most of the poor live. In the private sector, a con-
tinued high level of investment will be important in increasing Malay partici-
pation in industry. While there has been some apprehension by the Chinese and
to some extent the foreign community over the Government's efforts to raise
the participation of Malays in the modern sectors, the Government is concerned
by this reaction and it is taking steps to address non-Malay complaints in
order to encourage a high rate of private investment. With a recovery in
private investment, Malaysia should register a strong economic performance
during the Third Plan, including a more than 8.5% growth rate, enabling
considerable progress toward achieving the goals of the New Economic Policy.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 35 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport.
Seven Bank loans have been made for the power sector in Malaysia amounting
to US$214.2 million (net of cancellations), which have helped to finance the
increase of approximately 1,370 M4W in generating capacity and associated trans-
mission lines. The projects under the first four loans have been completed
and are operating well. Under the fifth loan for the third stage extension
of the Port Dickson Thermal Power Station and related transmission facilities,
the commissioning of the first unit was delayed by about 20 months due to the
delay in the delivery of structural steel. Implementation of the sixth and
seventh power projects is on schedule. The power systems in Sabah and Sarawak
are being assisted by ADB loans.
12.       Although in a few cases disbursements have been slower than expected,
the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satisfactory.
As of March 31, 1977, the effective loans to Malaysia held by the Bank
amounted to US$668.2 million. In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965 to
the Public Utilities Board of Singapore (Loan 405-N4A), guaranteed by Malaysia,
to finance the Johore River Water Project. The amount held by the Bank under
that loan, as of March 31, 1977, was US$4.0 million. Twelve loans have been
fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as well
as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is consistent with and supports the
country's policies to eliminate racial and geographical imbalances in income
distribution. The Bank will continue to provide assistance to Malaysia's
agricultural programs - including land development, rehabilitation and
settlement, and improvement of production in low income farming areas - which
are the effective means of reducing unemployment and income disparities. The
Bank will also continue to assist in financing infrastructure development,
including urban services and housing for the poor and transport projects that
improve producer and market links. The Bank has helped the Government to
prepare projects in the course of its lending operations and its sector work
and has also helped to strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying
out important parts of Malaysia's development program. The Bank will continue
this policy, which will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the



- 4 -
Executive Directors in the next few years. These loans would be for projects
involving agricultural extension, irrigation, rural development, land settle-
ment, development finance companies, education, and some infrastructure devel-
opment including transport and power.
14.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling US$8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of March 31, 1977 amounted to US$1.65 million (Annex II).
PART III - ELECTRIC POWER IN MALAYSIA
The Sector
15.       Over the last ten years, demand for electric power has grown by
about 14% per annum. Industry and mining have been the largest users of
power, followed by commercial and residential consumers. Power is supplied
principally by autonomous government-owned entities, the largest being the
National Electricity Board (NEB). NEB serves Peninsular Malaysia with the
exception of part of the state of Perak, which is supplied by the Perak River
Hydroelectric Company (PRHE). The Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the
Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) supply the two states on the
island of Borneo.
16.       The present capacity installed by the Government entities (NEB,
PRHE, SEB and SESCO) is 1,602 MW of which 18% (292 MW) is hydro, 67% (1,064 MW)
is steam, and 15% (245 MW) is diesel. In addition, there is an aggregate
capacity of about 200 MlW owned by private corporations and some small electric
companies operating on a licensed basis. NEB's generating capacity accounts
for about 72% (1,307 MW) of the total for Malaysia. Quality of service has
been good except for some rural stations which provide only 12 hours supply.
Due to the shortage of reserve capacity, limited load curtailment has been
necessary for the past few years during dry seasons or emergency shut-downs
of large thermal units. However, this situation is expected to improve after
the full commissioning of the Temengor Hydroelectric Power Plant (1978/79).
17.       The Perak River Hydroelectric Company (PRHE), incorporated in the
United Kingdom and with current installed capacity of 121 MW, operates under
a concession granted by the state of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years.
The Government has recently acquired control of the company by buying its
shares on the London Stock Exchange, and a special committee is currently
studying the method of integrating PRHE into NEB.
18.       Energy sales for the next seven years are expected to increase at
an average rate of 13% per annum. NEB's present expansion program includes:
(a) construction of the Temengor Hydroelectric Power Plant (4 x 87 MW)
scheduled for completion in 1978/79; (b) installation of three additional
units at the Prai Thermal Power Station (3 x 120 MW) to be brought into
service during 1979/80 under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA); and
(c) construction of the Pasir Gudang Thermal Power Station (2 x 120 MW) to be
completed in 1981 under the proposed Eighth Power Project.



- 5 -
19.       NEB's interconnected system covers most of the western side of
Peninsular Malaysia. A 132 kV line connecting the western system to Kuantan
on the east coast was completed in 1976. Further links to Kota Bahru and
Kuala Trengganu will be completed by 1980/81 when the entire Peninsula will be
interconnected. Rural electrification, which started in the 1950s, was accel-
erated under the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75). The capital cost of this
program, including the coverage of expected operating losses for the first
seven years, is borne two-thirds by the Federal Government and one third by
NEB. By the end of FY75, some 2,700 villages had been electrified covering
about 227,000 consumers. Thus far, the deficits have been insignificant in
relation to NEB's scale of operations, but with the increasing pressure for
rural electrification the cash deficits may increase in future. So far the
rural electrification program has not been based on clearly established
economic priorities and the villages to be electrified are often selected
on a rather arbitrary basis. In the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA) a
rural electrification study was included in order to formulate a comprehensive
rural electrification plan and to review its technical, economic and financial
implications. The study is being carried out by the Middle West Service
Company of Chicago in association with the Perunding Bersatu Ltd. of Kuala
Lumpur and is expected to be completed by mid-1978.
The National Electricity Board (NEB)
20.       The National Electricy Board, established under the Electricity Act
of 1949, is a financially sound, well-organized, and well-operated utility.
It regulates the production and use of electric energy in Peninsular Malaysia
and grants licenses for the installation and operation of independent elec-
tricity works. NEB's Board of Directors is appointed by the Minister of
Works and Utilities, subject to the terms and conditions he may determine.
The Board is headed by a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman, who is also General
Manager.
21.       In recent years, NEB has lost some of its middle management staff to
the private sector. NEB is now trying to fill the vacancies through recruit-
ments from outside and a vigorous internal training program. A training
school is under construction and will be completed in FY78. An ILO staff
member is currently working with NEB to formulate the curricula. There is an
active apprenticeship scheme for technical staff and further training programs
at the college level. Courses offered are aimed at promoting the Government's
policy of providing more equitable job opportunities for Malays, as well as
meeting NEB's internal manpower requirement. Senior personnel attend overseas
seminars and some are sent abroad for post-graduate studies.
22.       NEB is liable to pay corporation and development taxes, which amount
to 40% of taxable net income and 5% of gross income respectively. In addition,
NEB is liable to pay import duties, a fuel tax of M$17 per ton, a surtax of 5%
on imports and a sales tax of 5%.
23.       In the past, NEB's internal cash generation has financed over 60%
of the expansion program, but this situation has been changing due to accel-
erated load growth, the expanded construction program and inflation. Conse-
quently, greater reliance will have to be placed on borrowing and additional
equity injections. To maintain a sound financial policy, a covenant has been



- 6 -
incorporated in the Loan Agreement (Section 5.06) requiring NEB to earn an
after-tax rate of return of at least 8% on net fixed assets in operation
revalued each year in accordance with the fixed capital formation deflator
used in the national accounts. The 8% rate of return covenant has been
incorporated in the previous loan agreements, but this is the first time that
the method of revaluation has been specified.
24.       Under the Electricity Act, NEB has power to fix tariffs without
reference to any other authority. In practice, however, the Government
deliberates on tariff questions because of their political impact. As basic
tariffs have not been revised since 1958, they are not well related to NEB's
current costs of system operation (see para. 42). The increase in average
revenue for kilowatt-hour sold resulted almost entirely from fuel surcharges
imposed on the basic schedule. Furthermore, the present tariffs are too
cumbersome involving 23 different categories. NEB has therefore engaged
Electrowatt of Zurich to review its tariff schedules. The draft final report
is now under review. It was agreed that the Borrower shall exchange views
with the Bank prior to making any changes in its tariff structure. (See
Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement.)
25.       NEB's financial position is sound.    The rate of return in the past
decade has varied between 8.8% (FY69) and 13.4% (FY76). The existing debt
service covenant between NEB and the Bank provides that, except as the Bank
and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, debt shall not be incurred unless
cash generation for the previous fiscal year is not less than 1.3 times
maximum future debt service on all debt incurred. NEB has always met this
test in the past but may have difficulty in doing so in the future. In view
of NEB's large investment program and its sound management and conservative
financial policies, a new covenant is required that will give NEB adequate
freedom to manage its debt while providing for a Bank review of its borrowings
to ensure that the debt would not be raised to a degree that could unfavorably
affect NEB's future financial position. It was therefore agreed that the
Bank's concurrence would be required when NEB's borrowings result in a debt/
equity ratio higher than 60/40. Short-term debt, defined as maturing within
one year, would be limited to 5% of total debt. (See Sections 5.07 and 5.08
of the Loan Agreement.)
26.       NEB is promoting the development of local manufacturing capability
in electric meters, cables, transformers and switchgear for which NEB would
be the main customer in the early years. A company has already been estab-
lished in which NEB has a 60% share to manufacture cables. Another company
is being formed for the manufacturing of distribution transformers. The Loan
Agreement for the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA) contains a covenant
that limits NEB's investment in industries (other than for the generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity) to a maximum of M$25 mil-
lion (US$10 million). In view of the current rate of inflation and the
increasing scope of NEB's activities, however, this ceiling is no longer
adequate. Therefore, it was agreed that the limit would be a maximum of 1%
of gross plant revalued each year. (See Section 5.09 of the Loan Agreement.)
27.       In recent years NEB has been attempting to carry out more of its
system planning in-house rather than by using consultants. NEB has not
always been able to undertake sufficient analysis of the system plan due to
manpower constraints and unfamiliarity with objective planning, but it is



determined to make further improvement in this field. Moreover, assurances
were obtained that NEB would review its power system development program
annually, update it if and when necessary based on a least-cost analysis, and
employ qualified consultants for that purpose if needed. (See Section 5.04
of the Loan Agreement.)
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Description
28.       The project was first identified by NEB in 1974 in the course of
its overall system development planning. Subsequently, the engineering
studies were carried out by TATA Consulting Engineers of India. The project
was appraised in November 1976 and negotiated in May 1977.
29.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) construction, supply and installation of a new thermal
power station of 2 x 120 MW located at Pasir Gudang; and
(b) supply and installation of transmission facilities.
30.       The load in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia has been grow-
ing at about 10% per annum. The existing generating facilities consist of
six steam units with aggregate capacity of only 120 MW. The Bank has financed
under the Sixth Power Project (Loan 1031-MA) a double circuit 132 kV transmis-
sion line from Malacca to Scudai interconnecting the southern network to the
central network, and under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA), a double-
circuit 132 kV transmission line from Scudai to Majidee and further on to Kota
Tinggi. Thus the proposed power station will not only meet the local load
requirements but also augment the central system until the major base-load
station is completed at Port Klang in 1985/86.
Project Cost and Financing
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$164 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$120 million (73%). The proposed Bank
loan of US$22 million equivalent will cover 13% of the total project cost and
represents about 18% of the foreign exchange component. The Bank loan will
finance the foreign exchange costs of civil works, transmission facilities,
and engineering services. NEB plans to use bilateral and suppliers' credits
for the procurement of boilers, turbo-alternators and ancillary equipment,
which, in total, are estimated to cost about US$68 million. Commercial banks
are expected to provide US$30 million for other electrical and mechanical
equipment (see paras. 33 and 34) and NEB and the Government will provide the
remaining amount of US$44 million.
32.       The above estimates include physical contingencies of about 15% for
civil works, 5% for plant and equipment and 10% for transmission facilities.
The price contingencies for foreign costs were derived by applying the
following rates of escalation: for civil works 9% in FY77-79, and 8% there-
after; for equipment and transmission facilities, 7.5% in FY77-79 and 7%
thereafter. The price contingencies for local costs were assumed to be 6%



- 8 -
per annum, based on the forecast made by the Government. Excluding taxes,
duties and price contingencies, the unit cost of the Pasir Gudang Power Plant
is about US$450 per kW installed. This is of the right order of magnitude
for a newly developed site in end-1976 prices. Details of the cost estimates
are given in the Loan and Project Summary. (See page ii).
33.       Currently there is considerable interest among commercial banks in
making medium- to long-term loans to Malaysia through co-financing with the
Bank. The proposed project is viewed by such commercial banks as an ideal
vehicle to initiate this activity since the project is well defined, NEB's
management is sound, and there is sufficient guarantee by the Government.
The co-financing arrangement will enable NEB to borrow from commercial
sources at better terms and conditions than it can normally borrow on its
own. This would be the first loan to Malaysia with co-financing from
private sources, thus introducing a new dimension to the Bank's lending
program, which will enable the Bank to continue to play a leading role in
assisting Malaysia's development effort while minimizing the use of the
Bank's own resources.
34.       Fifteen commercial banks have already submitted co-financing
proposals to the Government. Their terms and conditions appear to be favor-
able. The Goverment is currently negotiating directly with commercial banks
and hopes to finalize the co-financing arrangement by late July. In view of
the Borrower's preference to arrange the proposed co-financing in the form of
parallel financing, the Bank agreed to finance civil works, transmission
facilities and engineering services, and to let commercial banks finance
equipment and materials other than boilers and turbo-alternators for the
power plant. The commercial banks have indicated interest in having a
cross-default clause incorporated in the Bank's Loan Agreement. We will seek
Board approval if the co-financing arrangement requires any changes in the
Bank's loan documents. No difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the necessary
suppliers' credits and the co-financing; nevertheless, should co-financing
arrangement fail to materialize, the Government will promptly provide necessary
financing to NEB. (See Section 2.02 (a) of the Guarantee Agreement.)
Implementation
35.       Engineering Services:   TATA Consulting Engineers of Bombay, which
prepared the engineering report for the project, has also been engaged by NEB
to provide services for site investigation, detailed design, and supervision
of procurement and construction of the project. The Phase I and II services
(mainly site investigation, engineering studies, detailed design and procure-
ment) are estimated to require 750 man-months at a cost of about US$1,500 per
man-month. The Phase III services (mainly project management, construction
supervision, testing and training) will require about 200 man-months at a
cost of about US$2,000 per man-month.
36.       Construction:   Civil works will be carried out by contractors and
the 275 kV transmission line will be constructed by suppliers on a supply and
erect basis, both under the supervision of NEB. About four years will be
required to complete the project.



-9-
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       The equipment and materials for the transmission facilities to be
financed under the proposed loan would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. For the pur-
pose of bid comparison, a preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local
manufacturers. Civil works, which include piling, structural steel and
cladding, cooling water system and other marine works and chimney, would also
be contracted through international competitive bidding following the Bank's
guidelines.
38.       Disbursements for the proposed Bank loan would be made against:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for civil works, engineering
services and directly imported equipment and materials for
transmission facilities;
(b)  100% of ex-factory cost of transmission equipment and
materials manufactured locally; and
(c) 70% of total expenditures for imported transmission equip-
ment and materials procured locally.
Benefits and Risks
39.       Consultants' studies of NEB's system expansion program have demon-
strated that the sequence of projects as proposed is the least cost solution
to meet the load requirement up to 1983. It includes the Temengor Hydro-
electric Development, the Prai Thermal Power Station extension, the proposed
Pasir Gudang Thermal Power Plant construction, and the associated transmis-
sion projects (see para. 18). The internal rate of return of the proposed
project is approximately 14%.
40.       During the period since 1958, when the Bank was first associated
with NEB, the Board's management has been considerably strengthened. NEB
today has a solid organizational structure and operates with a high degree of
autonomy and efficiency. Continued Bank involvement in NEB's development
program will help continue the steady and healthy growth of Malaysia's power
sector. As stated in para. 27, NEB's system planning capability needs to be
further strengthened; NEB also needs additional capital funds. The Bank can
provide significant assistance to NEB in the analysis of its least-cost
program. Facilitating the flow of commercial funds to NEB through co-financing
arrangement is another important role of the Bank.
41.       Technically there is little risk involved in this project.     Malaysia
is not in the seismic zone and the meteorological records do not indicate
any possibility of typhoons or tornadoes. The site has been fully investi-
gated and no construction difficulties are anticipated.

Financial Forecast
42.       It is currently estimated that, in order to secure an 8% rate of
return on net fixed assets in operation revalued each year as stated in
para. 23, tariff increases of 30% for FY79 (of which 17% would be auto-
matically covered by the fuel cost surcharge now incorporated in NEB's tariff
schedules) and 8% for FY82 are required. In addition, considerable additional
equity is needed to complete NEB's system development program for the period
FY77-83 including the proposed project. In view of the high rate of NEB's
contributions to the Government through taxes and dividends (see para. 22),
it would be appropriate for the Government to plough back some of these
contributions to NEB as equity capital. Therefore assurances were obtained
that the Government would provide NEB or cause NEB to be provided with adequate
funds to complete its development program as approved by the Government. (See
Section 2.02 (b) of the Guarantee Agreement.)
43.       NEB's financial forecasts show that internal cash generation would
contribute about 20% of estimated construction expenditures for the period
FY77-83. Based on the tariff increases assumed over the forecast period,
energy revenues are expected to increase from US$195 million in FY76 to
US$592 million in FY83, an average growth of 17% per annum. The operating
ratio remains between 75-80% over the 7-year period. The debt service
coverage on an annual basis would vary between 1.3 (FY83) and 2.5 (FY77).
Ecology
44.       The project is not expected to have any significant adverse eco-
logical effects. The cooling water system will slightly raise the tempera-
ture of the sea water near the Plant site, but the thermal effect will be
confined within a negligibly small area. A chimney of adequate height will
be constructed to minimize the local air pollution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the National
Electricity Board, the draft Guarantee Agreement between MIalaysia and the
Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
46.       Features of special interest in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
are described in Annex III.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969;
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The project aims at improving Malaysia's technical, vocational, and
agricultural education. Construction of all project institutions has been
completed. The quality of the completed facilities is satisfactory. Deliveries
of furniture and equipment to the project schools are near completion. Project
implementation is about 27 months behind schedule because of site problems
for one agricultural school. The closing date has been postponed by six
months to September 30, 1977. Project schools are operating at 90% capacity
and are functioning satisfactorily. Although no final evaluation has yet
been made, the schools appear to have achieved low dropout rates and high
pass rates. The total project cost is close to the original cost estimate.
Loan No. 672    Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$13.0 Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Effective
Date: August 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective
Date: June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects (including the First Jengka Triangle Land Settlement
Project which has been completed) consist of clearing the forest, planting
62,000 acres of oil palm and 35,000 acres of rubber, and settling 10,000 families
in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land Development Authority
(FELDA), responsible for the execution of the projects, operates efficiently,
keeping high standards of planting and maintenance. Physical works under the
Second Project (Loan 672-MA) have been satisfactorily completed. The remaining
undisbursed loan amount of about US$0.3 million will be spent for the purchase
of fertilizers. Under the Third Project (Loan 885-MA) clearing and planting
have been completed. Delays of about six months in the planting program and in
infrastructure development will result in similar delays in housing and settler
intake. Standards of agricultural development under both projects are generally
satisfactory. Measures for improving factory design, operational standards,
and financial control are being discussed with FELDA management.
Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of July 16, 1970;
Effective Date: September 29, 1970; Closing Date: April 30,
1977
The Fifth Power Project consists of the final stage extension of
the Port Dickson Thermal Power Station with three 120 MW units. The first
and second units were commissioned in February and August 1976 respectively,
about 22 months behind schedule due to late delivery of structural steel
works. The third unit was commissioned in February 1977 about two months
behind schedule. The project cost was about 39% higher than the appraisal
estimate.

Loan No. 753    Second Telecommunications Project; US$18.7 Million Loan of
June 21, 1971; Effective Date: August 18, 1971: Closing
Date: February 28, 1977
Project execution is substantially complete. The two pending work
items are likely to be completed by end of 1977. The latest financial state-
ments, auditors reports and progress reports show substantial improvement
in the operation of the Telecommunications Department. Disbursements have
been completed and the loan account has been closed.
Loan No. 774    Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Effective Date: August 24, 1971; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in completing the access road to Sandakan
will delay full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977. The new head-
quarters building has been occupied. The total and foreign exchange costs of
the works are now estimated about 1.5 times the appraisal estimate at US$47.1
million and US$24.4 million respectively. Settlement of a large outstanding
claim will delay the final account and the closing date of the loan has been
extended by one year to December 31, 1977.
Loan 799 Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11, 1972;
Effective Date: April 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1978
All equipment and material has been received. However, project
completion, now 21 months behind schedule, will be further delayed until
June/July 1977 due to the damage caused by recent heavy rains to the earth
works on the Port Dickson line. Therefore the closing date has been post-
poned to March 31, 1978. Malayan Railway (MR) operations showed an all-round
improvement during 1976 although the key efficiency indicators were well
below acceptable standards, especially those pertaining to locomotive and
rolling stock maintenance. As the result of a successful marketing drive,
freight traffic during 1976 registered a recovery for the first time in five
years and increased by 24% compared with 1975. Passenger traffic continues
to grow. These results are expected to produce MIR's first annual profit
since 1962, yielding a financial return of 1% in 1976 on net fixed assets in
use. Audit reports are two years in arrears due to the delay in submission
of accounts to the Auditor General by MR. Efforts are being made to clear
the backlog.
Loan No. 810    Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. Implementation has improved but is
still about 14 months behind schedule mainly due to earlier delays in the
appointment of consultant architects for the Science University, the approval



ANNEX II
Page 5
of the campus plan by the University and the preparation of documents by the
Public Works Department. All civil works contracts have been awarded and most
of the construction is scheduled to be completed by late 1977. The recent
estimate of the project cost is about 35% above the appraisal estimate. The
Government is aware of this cost overrun and is prepared to finance it.
Progress on equipment procurement is satisfactory.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project (Highway I);
US$16.0 Million Loan of July 20, 1972; Effective
Date: September 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30, 1978
The project is designed to improve the transport facilities between
Kuala Lumpur and the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. It consists of improvement
of about six miles of Federal Route 2, including detailed engineering, widening
of the road, construction of interchanges and cycle tracks, and relocation of
services. Civil works are about 11 months behind schedule, due to initial short-
comings in one contractor's project management. These problems have since been
overcome and implementation is being accelerated. The project also includes
a transport study for metropolitan Kuala Lumpur (completed), a national road
maintenance study (draft final report completed), and detailed engineering of
about 137 miles of Federal Route 1 (completed).
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The civil works component continues to make progress. Out of 571
buildings, 127 have been completed and an additional 101 are under construction.
Tenders have been awarded for an additional 17 buildings. Until recently, the
most delayed construction component has been the provision of 31 Family Planning
Clinics. This has now been corrected, and two out of the 31 clinics are now in the
stage of preparation of tender documents; preparation of layout site plans has
been started for another 12 clinics. The National Family Planning Board (NFPB)
has selected a supplier for the computer to handle the management information
system; a draft contract is being prepared. A review of the project was
carried out by an external team of experts in April. Program performance in
1976 was even better than in 1975 when the number of new acceptors was the
highest since 1971.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demand in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was virtually
completed in 1976, practically on schedule and within the cost estimate and most
of the works are in operation. The contract for the construction of the Langat
Dam was awarded late, in mid-1976, but construction is now progressing satisfac-
torily. The dam is expected to be completed by the end of 1979, more than two
years behind schedule, and will cost about 25% more than originally estimated.



ANNEX II
Page 6
However, no difficulties are foreseen in raising the additional funds required.
The Selangor State Water Department, which is responsible for the Project,
performs well in spite of staffing problems. Its financial management still
needs some strengthening.
Loan No. 931    Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
August 31, 1977
Overall, the project is about 60% completed. Progress is behind
schedule due to delays in land acquisition and eviction of squatters from the
right-of-way, late grant of licenses by the Selangor State Government to
operate quarries, and late approval of work permits for expatriate staff.
Poor management of some of the contractors also contributed to slow progress.
Although some measures have been taken to remedy these deficiencies and improve-
ment is noticeable, construction progress is still below the revised targets.
An extension of the closing date by two years to August 31, 1979 is being
considered. Consulting services for various studies and detailed engineering
are satisfactory and on schedule. Construction costs have escalated sharply
because of rapid inflation and the total project cost is now estimated to be
US$50 million compared to an appraisal estimate of US$37 million. The
disbursement rate for the construction and improvement of roads was reduced
as of January 1, 1976 from 55% to 40% of actual expenditures.
Loan No. 967    Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: Mlay 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of planting 65,000 acres
of oil palm and settling 4,400 families in the state of Johore. The agricultural
development is progressing satisfactorily in line with the appraisal estimates.
Delays in road development, due in part to coordination problems between FELDA
and Kejora (a regional development authority) have delayed settler intake by up
to two years. However, improvements are noticeable since construction of roads
is now being contracted to private contractors, and since responsibility for
coordination has been unified under the Ministry of Lands and Regional Develop-
ment.
Loan No. 973   lWestern Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project includes main and feeder drains, coastal embankments
and tidal gates to improve drainage in an area of 134,000 ha (330,000 ac) in
southwest Peninsular Malaysia, as well as an integrated agricultural develop-
ment program with changes in cropping patterns to improve farm incomes, inter-
cropping, opening up of 24,000 ha of new land, Farmers Development Centers and
improvements in research, extension and crop processing. Implementation of the
project fell behind the appraisal schedule shortly after loan signing due to
the Drainage and Irrigation Department's decision to redesign the drainage
system utilizing the most recently developed methodology. The design improve-
ments have reduced costs and have resulted in increased system effectiveness,



ANNEX II
Page 7
while delaying the tendering process by about two years. Implementation has
recently accelerated, and 10 out of 11 major drainage basin contracts have
now been let, with two substantially completed. Agricultural supporting
services provided by five different agencies are being improved and coordi-
nated by the Project Director and his staff.
Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government to develop technical training,
preservice teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due to earlier
delays in the selection of sites for the Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs).
Contracts have been awarded for 8 out of 13 project institutions. Construction
began in early 1976 and most of the project institutes are scheduled for
completion in late 1978. The estimated total project cost is about 25% over
the appraisal estimate. Disbursements remain slow but should improve in 1977.
The Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1031   Sixth Power Project; US$45.0 Million Loan of July 25, 1974;
Effective Date: October 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
Loan No. 1178   Seventh Power Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of December 17,
1975; Effective Date: March 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
Implementation of the Sixth Power Project (275 kV transmission lines
from Temengor to Papan and from Port Dickson to Malacca and extension of trans-
mission and distribution system) and the Seventh Power Project (the Prai Power
Station Extension, 3 x 120 MW) are both on schedule.
NEB's financial position is currently sound as the Government has
paid M$39 million (US$15.6 million) of equity funds and has undertaken to pay an
additional M$30 million (US$12 million) early in 1977. A rate of return of
13.4% was earned for 1976, exceeding the rate of 8% required under the Bank
Loan Agreements.
Loan No. 1044 Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of planting 55,000 acres
of oil palm, settling 3,400 families, constructing two palm oil mills and
establishing two urban settlements. The agricultural development is progressing
satisfactorily. However, progress of urban development and of phasing in
nonagricultural activities is still unsatisfactory. Lack of progress in the
construction of village infrastructure and housing has caused delays in settler
intake. The July 1976 supervision mission's findings and recommendations for
corrective measures were transmitted to the implementing agency, the Pahang



ANNEX II
Page 8
Tenggara Development Authority and the Ministry of Land and Regional Develop-
ment under which control of regional authorities and land development agencies
has recently been unified. The development of the urban infrastructure is being
reviewed by the Bank's Urban Projects Department.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation continues to fall further behind schedule.
However, the major bottleneck (terms and conditions of employment of inter-
nationally recruited scientists) was overcome with the Government's approval of
"Terms and Conditions of Employment" on August 19, 1976 and acceptance by the
Bank on September 22. This is the first indication that the project could show
some progress. Action is also being taken to expedite procurement under local
procedures and the first requests for reimbursement have been received.
Little physical progress can be expected before late 1977 or early 1978 although
trends and intent should be identifiable by April 1977.
Loan No. 1213 Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
MIarch 11, 1976; Effective Date: August 25, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan for
the sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. It includes
the extension of sewers (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers) to serve an
additional population of 200,000 in Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institu-
tion of a separate Sewerage Department within Kuala Lumpur City Hall with its
own finance and accounting system; engineering and management consultants
services; staff training; and preparation of sewerage and pollution control in
the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. The project is in its initial stage. It
has started about six months behind schedule because of delays in engaging
consultants but can be completed on time. Work is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1214 Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will
be improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although the
project is essentially an urban transport project, it also contains important
components and initiatives in other urban sectors such as squatter upgrading
and development of new low-cost settlements. The main components are: (a)
about 7 miles of new roads and 10 miles of road improvements; (b) traffic
engineering and control schemes; (c) sites and services for about 1,400 house-
holds and 150 businesses; (d) upgrading of infrastructure services for about
2,100 households, and (e) feasibility and engineering studies for a Kuantan
UJrban Development Project and for a national sites and services program.



ANNEX II
Page 9
Related policy measures include the introduction of minibus services, traffic
priorities for high-occupancy vehicles and area road pricing. Progress is
generally satisfactory except for the sites and services component which
has been delayed as a result of bad weather and contracting problems.
Loan No. 1294  North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project includes the Lemal Irrigation component which will provide
drainage and flood protection to 30,000 gross ha of farmland and intensive
irrigation to 12,000 net ha of padi; construction of 190 km of rural roads
throughout North Kelantan; 15 small irrigation schemes serving 1,300 ha of padi;
construction, rehabilitation and equipping of 25 Farmers Development Centers
(FDC); and establishment of an effective agricultural extension service for
Kelantan. The project start-up period has seen rapid implementation of the FDC
component, good progress on the agricultural extension component with planning,
staffing and preparation of equipment specifications proceeding on schedule and
a welcome degree of cooperation between the Farmers Organization Authority and
the Kelantan Department of Agriculture in joint planning of agricultural service
buildings and field operations. Some delay in engineering of roads and irriga-
tion works has occurred due to delays in approval of staff, but this problem
appears to have been largely resolved.
Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date:   January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is designed to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress exisiting imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additional classrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak. The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
includes also a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. The Loan was declared effective on
January 14, 1977.
