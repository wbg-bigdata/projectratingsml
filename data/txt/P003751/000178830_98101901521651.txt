APPRAISAL OF PUSRI IV FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Indonesia has embarked on a major investment
program to expand fertilizer production and has entrusted P. T. Pupuk
Sriwidjaja (PUSRI), a fully-owned Government company, with the responsibility
of implementing the major portion of that program. The proposed project,
representing the Company's fourth stage development (PUSRI IV), will increase
PUSRI's urea capacity from 1.0 million to 1.6 million tons per year (TPY).
The plant will be located adjacent to the Company's existing facilities on
the bank of the Musi River at Palembang, in South Sumatera. Total financing
required for the project is estimated at US$186 million of which 78% is in
foreign exchange. A Bank loan of US$70 million is proposed, to be made to the
Government which will onlend it to PUSRI. The balance of the financing is
expected to be contributed by the Saudi Fund for Development (US$70 million
equivalent), and by the Government, US$46 million -- most of it in local
currency (US$34 million).
ii.       The Bank's role in assisting Indonesia's fertilizer industry is geared
to make the country self-sufficient in N-fertilizer by 1980 and ultimately to
enable it to become a marginal low-cost exporter. The proposed loan represents
the fourth Bank Group operation in Indonesia since 1970 in fertilizer facilities,
including three for production units with a total capacity of 1.5 million TPY
of urea and one for distribution facilities designed to handle 1.4 million TPY
of fertilizer. At present, there are only two fertilizer companies in operation
in Indonesia, with a total yearly capacity of 0.26 million tons of nitrogen
(N). Of these by far the more important is PUSRI which at present accounts
for 85% of the nitrogen fertilizer produced. PUSRI has consistently operated
its plants at high levels of capacity and has completed very satisfactorily
its first expansion and is implementing well and according to schedule the
second expansion, both financed by the Bank Group. It is expected that the
Company's capable management team will carry out the proposed project with
equal competence.
iii.      Indonesia has abundant reserves of natural gas and is in a position
to produce economically N fertilizer from its own feedstock; it is also likely
to remain the leading producer of N fertilizer in South East Asia and to be-
come a supplier of urea to neighboring countries. At present, however,
domestic production of fertilizer is lagging behind consumption. In 1975
domestic production accounted for only 54% of N fertilizer consumed, with
imports covering the remaining 46% as well as 100% of phosphate and potash
fertilizer reqirements. Fertilizer consumption on the other hand has been
growing fast. Between 1970 and 1975, application of N fertilizer increased
from 183,900 to 380,000 nutrient tons or 15.6% per year and is expected
to register a 10% annual increase through the mid-1980's.



- ii -
iv.      Under these circumstances and given the high escalation in equip-
ment prices, there are significant benefits in speedy project implementation.
The Government, therefore, requested, and the Bank agreed, that the Company be
permitted to continue to use the same engineering firms as for PUSRI II and
III, which were approved by IDA/Bank and which have performed satisfactorily.
Procurement of critical long-delivery items was begun in June 1975. Bidders'
lists and proposed award for major equipment supply contracts have been
reviewed by the Bank and all equipment items are being procured following Bank
guidelines, irrespective of the source of finance. The Bank has agreed to the
advanced contracting of engineering services and long-lead equipment and PUSRI
has been advised that, subject to approval of the loan by the Executive Direc-
tors, up to US$7.0 million would be financed retroactively for down-payments
on these contracts. The proposed Bank loan would be made for 15-1/2 years
including 3-1/2 years of grace. PUSRI would pay 12% annual interest, including
a fee accruing to the Government which will bear the foreign exchange risk.
v.         Since the new plant will benefit from the existing infrastructure
and utilities in Palembang, capital and operating costs will be lower than for
a similar plant at a new site, and flexibility of operation will be increased.
Thle project's estimated production cost and assumed sales price (US$142/ton,
ex-factory) are expected to be internationally competitive with prices forecast
to prevail towards the end of the decade. The Company's financial structure
would remain satisfactory with the debt/equity ratio projected at 50/50
at completion of the project, and the debt service coverage above 1.9 times
during the life of the loan. The project's incremental financial return
beafore tax is estimated at 21%.
vi.       The economic rate of return of the project is about 29% and there-
fore well above most recent industrial projects the Bank Group has been
financing. It would remain satisfactory (at about 22%) under the conceivable
adverse assumptions regarding capital and operating costs, project implemen-
tation time and world fertilizer prices. An important part of the project is
the provision for the training of personnel of not only PUSRI but also other
fertilizer plants, existing and/or proposed, in Indonesia. A total of about
3,,800 persons are expected to be trained in various fields such as finance and
accounting, plant operation and maintenance as well as marketing and distribu-
tiLon. Direct employment from the project is estimated at 850 and the project
is expected to have a significant impact on indirect job creation in transpor-
tation, storage and distribution of fertilizers and in the exploitation and
diistribution of natural gas. Further, the project shows a net annual foreign
exchange saving of US$72 million equivalent at full production.
vii.      The project faces minimal technical and commercial risks and will
result in substantial benefits to the Indonesian economy. Although Indonesia
is likely to have some exportable surplus of nitrogen fertilizer, it is
presently expected that all of PUSRI's production would be sold domestically.
Based on agreements summarized at the end of this report, the project is
suLitable for a Bank loan of US$70 million equivalent.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested a Bank loan of US$70
million equivalent to finance part of the estimated foreign exchange
cost of an ammonia/urea plant for the Government-owned fertilizer company,
P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI), to be built adjacent to its existing
facilities on the bank of the Musi River at Palembang, in South Sumatera
(Map, IBRD 12069). The project, representing the Company's fourth stage
development (PUSRI IV), will increase PUSRI's urea capacity from 1.0 to
1.6 million tons per year (TPY), equivalent to an increase from 483,000
to 741,000 TPY in terms of nitrogen (N). 1/ The project would represent the
Bank Group's third industrial loan to the Company and the fourth financing
considering the loan for distribution facilities. 2/ The proposed project
follows the successful completion in September 1974 of the first expansion
(PUSRI II). The second expansion (PUSRI III) is under construction and is
expected to start production in April 1977 about in line with original ex-
pectations. PUSRI III is being financed by a Bank loan of US$115 million, 3/
with the Government providing the balance of US$77 million.
1.02      Total financing required for the project (PUSRI IV) is estimated
at US$186 million, of which nearly US$145 million or 78% is in foreign ex-
change. The proposed Bank loan to the Government, which would be the Borrower,
would cover about 48% of the foreign exchange or 38% of the estimated total
financing required. The Saudi Fund for Development (38%) and the Government
(24%) would meet the rest of the financing.
1.03      Indonesia has abundant low-cost natural gas to become a leading
competitive producer and exporter of nitrogenous fertilizer. However, do-
mestic production of fertilizers at present is substantially lower than
consumption. Considering existing production and projects to be executed
in the next few years, Indonesia could become self-sufficient in nitrogenous
fertilizers in 1979 and a marginal exporter by 1980.
1.04      The proposed project was appraised in September-October 1975 by
E. Tortorelli (Chief), P. Lietard and Y. T. Shetty of the Industrial Projects
Department and R. W. Van Wagenen of the Education Department.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      Fertilizer production in Indonesia is carried out exclusively in
the public sector. PUSRI, the country's first fertilizer company, was es-
tablished in 1959 to manufacture urea. The initial small plant, PUSRI I,
went on stream in 1964, quickly achieving capacity operation (i.e., 100,000
1/   A glossary of technical terms used in this report is given in Annex 1.

TPY of urea). In subsequent years, capacity utilization has been fluc-
tating between 84% and 104%.
2.02      PUSRI I is expected to need major revamping by 1978, after 13
years of operation. The urea section will have to be modified or abandoned
altogether but the ammonia section could probably continue operation. This
would allow ammonia supply to a new phosphate fertilizer plant or sale of
industrial ammonia. The Company is firming up its plans for PUSRI I and
has agreed to present them to the Bank, together with their costs, by Dec-
ember 31, 1976. For the purpose of financial projections, no production from
PUSRI I is taken into account beyond 1977.
2.03      PUSRI carried out its first expansion (PUSRI II which was assisted
by IDA) during 1971-74 at a total cost of Rp 35.6 billion (US$85.9 million).
In addition, a gas gathering and transmission system was built as a part of
the project by the Government-owned oil company, PERTAMINA, at a cost of about
Rp 16.2 billion (US$39 million) to supply natural gas as feedstock.
2.04      The PUSRI II fertilizer plant was mechanically completed in Septem-
ber 1974, one month ahead of the revised scheduled date, and passed its 15-day
performance test November 7, 1974. During 1975, it produced a total
oF 290,130 tons of urea, representing an average capacity utilization of 76%
in spite of some technical problems such as liquid in the gas supply, equip-
mrent failures and corrosion, and tube ruptures in the ammonia condenser and
waste-heat boiler. Those problems have been mostly solved, and the plant is
operating satisfactorily since the annual maintenance in July/August, 1975.
Details of the existing facilities of PUSRI are given in Annex 2-1. As PUSRI
I[ was nearing completion, the Government decided in early 1974 to commence
PIJSRI III to meet the growing demand for fertilizers. Work on PUSRI III is
proceeding according to schedule but the work on the related gas pipeline is
experiencing delay (para 4.03). In April 1975, the Government decided to
sltart work on PUSRI IV when PERTAMINA's East Kalimantan Fertilizer Project
(designed as a floating plant) financed largely by a consortium of foreign
banks organized by the American Express Development Corporation, began to
fall behind schedule because of serious technical and financial problems.
B..  Organization and Management
2.05      PUSRI is generally considered one of Indonesia's best managed
large industrial enterprises. Wherever necessary, it has relied on expert
technical assistance from foreign advisors and consultants. At the same time,
it has developed its own staff to take key responsibilities. Today, the
Government seeks its advice on all aspects of fertilizer industry development
in Indonesia. The management structure of PUSRI, in keeping with Indonesia's
Company Law, is patterned after the European two-tier model, with a supervising
Board of Commissioners (Dewan Komisaris) and a Management Board (Direksi).
Members of the Board of Commissioners are the Director-Generals of: (i)
Monetary Affairs (Ministry of Finance), Chairman; (ii) Chemical Industries
(Ministry of Industries); and (iii) Agriculture (Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry).



-3-
2.06      Managerial responsibility for PUSRI's day-to-day operations rests
with the four-man Management Board, consisting of a President-Director aad
three Directors. Members of the Management Board as in the case of the Board
of Commissioners are appointed by the Government. An organizational chart of
the Company is given in Annex 2-2.
2.07      General (retired) H. Hasan Kasim has been President-Director of
PUSRI since 1966. The other three Directors and their respective responsibi-
lities are: Mr. Kotan Pasaman, Technical and Production Director; Mr. Dalil
Hasan, Commercial Director; and Mr. Faisal Abdaoe, Financial Director. Mr.
Abdaoe was appointed by the Government in mid-1975, when the other three
directors were re-appointed for another five years. As agreed under previous
IDA/Bank arrangements, top management appointments including those of con-
sultants are to be made in consultation with the Bank.
C.   Past Growth and Financial Results
2.08      PUSRI markets its own as well as imported fertilizers and other
agro-chemicals. Sales of its own output averaged about 103,000 TPY of urea
during 1970-1973, reflecting more than full rated capacity utilization in
PUSRI I, and increased to 115,000 and 207,000 tons of urea in 1974 and 1975
respectively with the completion of PUSRI II. Its sales of imported urea,
triple superphosphate (TSP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and complex fertili-
zers increased about 11 times during 1970-75, reaching about 427,000 TPY of
products in 1975. The following table shows the trend of sales volume,
sales revenue and net profit of PUSRI during 1970-1975 (Annex 2-3):

-4-
2.09      Under the current fertilizer marketing system, the Government buys
all locally-produced fertilizers at a fixed price, and sells them, again at a
set price, with imported fertilizers to approved distributors including PUSRI.
In November 1974, the urea retail price to the farmer was increased by 50% to
Rp 60,000 per ton (US$144.6). Subsequently, effective October 1975, the
price was raised by an additional 33% to Rp 80,000 (US$192.8) per ton.
2.10      Although PUSRI has been operating efficiently, it made only small
profits or incurred losses during 1970-73 because of rising costs of inputs
other than gas, and low fertilizer prices fixed by the Goverment. To rectify
this situation, the Government increased its purchase price of PUSRI-produced
urea by stages from Rp 28,200 (US$68) per ton in 1972 to about Rp 63,910
(US$154) per ton in the last quarter of 1974; no further increase has taken
place since. This price, comparable to the current world export prices
(f.o.b.) for urea (about US$110-150 per ton after peaking to more than US$300
per ton during 1973-1974) would, under normal circumstances, be adequate to
provide sufficient revenue for PUSRI to be financially viable. However, under
a system of fertilizer rationing introduced in Indonesia in October 1973 to
control illegal marketing in fertilizers, all wholesalers became PUSRI's
agents. Therefore, PUSRI has to finance the distribution of not only its own
fertilizer but also of imported fertilizers -- which in 1975 accounted for 2.1
times the volume of PUSRI's own fertilizer sales -- and wait up to 10 months
to be paid for sales to farmers on the basis of vouchers issued by the Bank
Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the State Agriculture Bank.
2.11      Further, the Government has initiated a fertilizer stockpiling pro-
g]ram in which PUSRI is entrusted with a leading role among distributors.
As a result, current assets increased to US$380 million equivalent by the
end of 1975 (in the form of letters of credit, inventories, including stock-
piling, and receivables) and were financed under Government direction ex-
clusively by short-term borrowing mainly from BRI at an average interest
rate of 1.3% per month. This situation, i.e., the consequence of a pre-
dominantly public service function entrusted to the Company by the Govern-
ment, has led to losses from PUSRI's marketing operations, thus creating
a heavy financial burden on the Company's finances. It was agreed during the
negotiations for PUSRI III that the Goverment would relieve PUSRI from the
adverse effects of that unprofitable activity through payments to cover the
marketing losses. The Government had also agreed to make up the forecast
losses for 1975 by payments in four equal instalments to PUSRI on April 1,
July 1 and October 1 of 1975 and January 1 of 1976, respectively. Adjustments,
upwards or downwards, were to be done on the basis of PUSRI's annual audited
accounts. This arrangement was to continue until the assets in service in the
marketing department had increased substantially with the execution of the
US$130 million Fertilizer Distribution Project which is expected to be opera-
tional in early 1977. Subsequently, a reasonable rate of return on the assets
in operation was to be ensured by the Government.



-5-
2.12      The Government has not fully met its obligation as described above
in covering the marketing losses for 1975 1/ as it had underestimated those mar-
keting losses and had made inadequate provision in its 1975/76 budget to meet
them. The 1975 losses amounted to Rp 17.1 billion (US$41 million equivalent)
of which as of the end of March 1976 the Government had paid only Rp 7.6 bil-
lion (US$18.2 million equivalent) to cover all losses through the third quar-
ter. As for the losses on marketing fertilizer from the national stockpile
during the fourth quarter of 1975 and subsequent quarters, the Government has
proposed to pay: 50% within 45 days after the submission by PUSRI of quarterly
financial statements and the rest within 4 months of presentation of accounts
for each quarter. Usually, PUSRI submits its financial statements to the
Government 6-8 weeks after the closing of each quarter. The above proposal
has been accepted by the Bank with the commitment by the Government that it
will not ask PUSRI to pay: (a) its interest liabilities to Bank Rakyat
Indonesia (BRI) -- a government bank -- before the Company receives payments
from the Government to cover stockpile marketing losses; and (b) its principal
repayment liabilities on BRI loans to import fertilizers before PUSRI recovers
its receivables from the sale of imported fertilizers. Further, the Government
has made adequate provision in its 1976/77 budget to cover PUSRI's marketing
losses and also the necessary financing for the company's capital investments.
Funds required in the budget year to cover marketing losses (about Rp 22.8
billion) will be available from the Government allocation of Rp 114 billion to
subsidize fertilizer sales to farmers. Besides, Rp 22.6 billion is earmarked
in the budget for PUSRI capital expenditure.
2.13      One of the reasons for the heavy marketing losses is the inadequate
marketing margin allowed by the Government. The margin has not been increased
significantly during the last two years when transportation and other operat-
ing costs of PUSRI's marketing department have risen sharply. The Government
has informed the Bank that the issue of marketing margin is being examined by
an inter-ministerial committee, and that a decision will be taken following
the recommendations of the committee in June 1976.
2.14      Under the Loan (No. 1139-IND) for the Fertilizer Distribution
Project, PUSRI is obligated to suggest for Government approval by October 1976
a methodology for showing the fertilizer stockpile accounts separately from
PUSRI's normal marketing accounts. Subsequently, PUSRI and the Government
have agreed that by mid-1977, PUSRI will start reporting the fertilizer
stockpile accounts separately in its financial statements.
2.15      Further, under the Loan (No. 1089-IND) for PUSRI III Fertilizer
Expansion Project, the Government had agreed to discontinue the fertilizer
distribution control system as fertilizer shortages are overcome and fertilizer
prices decline to more normal levels. The Government is now awaiting the
results of the National Fertilizer and Pesticides Distribution Study underway,
and will, upon the completion of that study in June 1976, review the fertilizer
distribution control system and subsequently initiate measures to reduce
fertilizer stocks.
1/   The unaudited financial statement for 1975 has been expressed on
the basis that the marketing losses will be offset by payments
from the Government against what are shown under accounts receivable
as of December 31, 1975.



-6-
2.16      As noted (para 2.11), from 1977 onwards, the Government under the
PIJSRI III Loan had agreed not to preclude a reasonable rate of return on the
Company's marketing department assets in operation. 1/  Part of this return
is to be provided by the lower costs and greater efficiency of the new fertil-
izer distribution project and the balance by: (a) reduction in current assets
to a normal level by the time the marketing assets are put into service; (b)
abolition of the distribution control system; and (c) if that system should
still be in force at that time, through an adjustment in the distribution
margin to PUSRI to reflect the cost of short-term borrowing, or through the
provision of working capital, or a combination of both. The Government had
also agreed to ensure a reasonable rate of return on the assets in operation
of the production department at efficient operation. The above agreements
of the Government were reaffirmed during negotiations for the proposed loan.
2.17      In 1975, the production department made a net profit of Rp 7.6 bil-
lion (US$18.2 million equivalent), representing a return of about 18% on
net assets in operation estimated at Rp 59 billion (US$142 million). This was
a reasonable return in line with the Government's obligation.

2.19      As PUSRI I was financed entirely with Government equity, the Company
had initially no debt to service. However, the construction of PUSRI II
increased the Company's debt steeply with the debt/equity ratio reaching 72/28
in 1973 partly because of negative or low earnings resulting from insufficient
ex-plant urea prices during 1970-1973, and partly because the Government
delayed the conversion to equity of some of its loans to bring the debt limit
to the level stipulated in the PUSRI II agreements until the full project cost
was known. As a result, through 1973 the entire Government contribution was
shown as debt. This situation has been rectified by the conversion of
part of debt into equity for PUSRI II and the provision of new equity for
PUSRI III; the debt/equity ratio reached the satisfactory level of 49/51 at
the end of 1975.
2.20      PUSRI's accounting and internal reporting system has improved con-
siderably with technical assistance provided by Price Waterhouse and Company,
but is not yet fully satisfactory.  PUSRI has reaffirmed its obligation to
submit promptly detailed annual and quarterly production, income and cash
flow statements, and balance sheets as well as annual audited statements and
forecasts in a form satisfactory to the Bank, and to retain consultants to
further train PUSRI staff in establishing appropriate departmental and
consolidated cost systems.
III. THE MARKET
3.01      Three aspects characterize fertilizer consumption in Indonesia:
(a) predominance of the paddy (rice) crop in agriculture and in total
fertilizer usage; (b) heavy reliance on N fertilizers, mostly urea for rice;
and (c) concentration of consumption in Java, Madura and Bali, the major rice-
growing regions. A detailed analysis of the fertilizer market and marketing
system in Indonesia is presented in Annex 3.  The following table summarizes
the trend of past fertilizer consumption and the Bank forecast of demand
compared to local production and resulting import requirements and export
surplus.

A.   Consumption Trends
3.02      From a 1968 low base, fertilizer consumption increased during 1968-75
at an annual average rate of about 21% with little growth variation among the
three nutrients. N consumption in 1974 was lower than the year before, mainly
as a result of (a) the shortage of nitrogen fertilizers in the world and their
related high prices and (b) the strict control imposed by the Government in
October 1973 upon the distribution of fertilizers. The 1975 consumption,
though significantly higher than in 1974, was still about 15% lower than the
expectation because of floods that year.
3.03      Urea continues to be the main N fertilizer used in Indonesia and
represented about 96% of N fertilizer applied in 1975: most of the urea was
used for rice which accounted for 76% of N consumption. The predominance of
rice cropping justifies the urea as the major N fertilizer in Indonesia;
and as rice continues to have prime importance, urea is expected to continue
to be the most popular N fertilizer.
3.04      In spite of these rapid increases, the fertilizer consumption per
hectare is still comparatively low in Indonesia as shown in the table below:

3.05      Projections of total N fertilizer consumption in Indonesia made by
several authorities show only minor divergence (Chart 1 of Annex 3). The
Pelita II (Second Five-Year Plan, 1974-79) target of 1.2 million tons of N in
1980 is not supported by any of these studies. The Pelita forecast was too
high by 80% in 1974 and 50% in 1975. The demand projections presented earlier
in this chapter are an update from the last Bank appraisal report of PUSRI III,
and represent an increase in the expected annual demand by about 10%. The
reasons for such increase are that (a) the fertilizer already stockpiled (para
3.09) and the production of the new units will lift the availability con-
straint that has existed in the past and (b) the Goverment has, therefore,
introduced the following incentives to boost the use of fertilizer: (i)
strengthening and expanding the credit program (para 3.17), (ii) maintaining
an attractive ratio to the farmer between the prices of fertilizer and of
agricultural products, and (c) increasing the recommended dosages of urea
toward an economic optimum. The Government is also planning to further expand
this incentive program to accelerate the application of fertilizers. The
expected increase in domestic consumption of N fertilizers to 775,300 tons in
1980 and 981,500 tons in 1985 is based on the assumption that the above
actions are in fact taken. 1/ This increase is, however, expected to occur at
a declining rate, and as fertilizer application in irrigated areas reaches its
maximum extent, application of fertilizers in non-irrigated areas will occur
at a slower pace.
3.06      The foodcrop sector (mostly rice) will continue to dominate the
consumption of fertilizer in Indonesia; it accounted for 90% of total
fertilizer consumed in 1974 and 1975, but its share is forecast to decline
slightly to 82% in 1980 and then remain stable up to 1985. The following
table shows the Bank's regional fertilizer consumption projections which
indicate that Java would continue, though in a lesser proportion, to be by
far the major fertilizer user in Indonesia:
1/   The projections for P205 and K20 are based on desirable N:P:K ratios.
To achieve these relatively high consumption levels considerable efforts
will have to be put into promotion of phosphatic and potash fertilizers.

B.   Past Supplies and Supply Prospects
3.07      At present, the total annual capacity for N fertilizer in Indonesia
is 504,000 product tons of urea and 150,000 product tons of ammonium sulfate,
or a total of 263,000 N nutrient tons. The annual production capacity for
N fertilizer is projected to increase fivefold in ten years to about 1.2 mil-
lion tons of N in 1985 when four additional plants are scheduled to be in
commercial production: (a) PUSRI III in April 1977; (b) PUSRI IV in February
1978; (c) the West Java plant in July 1979; and (d) the East Kalimantan
plant in July 1980. Domestic production of N fertilizer is still lagging
behind consumption and represented 54% of N fertilizer consumption in 1975.
PUSRI III will increase the domestic production share to 89% of consumption
in 1978 and by 1980 PUSRI IV, the West Java and East Kalimantan plants are
expected to make up for the deficit and produce an exportable surplus of up to
234,000 nutrient tons in the early 1980's. The export surplus could be double
thtis volume if Indonesia builds another ammonia/urea project at Aceh by 1982.
This project is in an initial stage of planning and is proposed as a regional
export-oriented project with investment from Indonesia as well as neighboring
countries. This project has not been taken into account in this report
because of its preliminary status.
3.08      There is no indigenous phosphate production but Petrokimia is plan-
ning a project, reportedly to be completed by 1979, to annually produce
330,000 tons of TSP, 80,000 tons of DAP and 50,000 tons of NPK fertilizers,
representing respectively 21,900, 196,000 and 7,500 tons in N, P205 and K20
nutrients. 1/ Phosphatic and potash raw materials will continue to be
imported and so will additional  phosphate and potash fertilizers to make up
the projected P and K deficits. The Goverment will from time to time exchange
views with the Bank regarding Indonesia's plans to meet the country's nutrient
requirements.
1/   In addition PUSRI is considering shutting down the PUSRI I urea unit
and installing a DAP producing unit. It is not clear yet, however,
whether this project will mature.

C.   Past Imports and Export Potential
3.09      From 1964 to 1973, Indonesia's total imports of fertilizers increased
at an average annual rate of 20%. In 1974, imports jumped by 87% over the
previous year and in 1975 by an estimated 56%, as a result of an active
stockpiling program:

1964           35.7          23.5        7.9        66.1

1975 (est)    672.1         281.9       31.1       985.1
/a   Urea has gained increasing importance accounting for
94% of total N imports in 1974 compared to 39% in 1964.
Bagged urea import prices (c.i.f. Jakarta) rose steeply from US$62/ton
in January 1972 to US$424/ton 1/ at the end of 1974, and even at this high
price, fertilizers in general, and urea in particular were not readily avail-
able in adequate quantity on the world market. This shortage situation
encouraged the Government of Indonesia to engage in 1974 upon the above
mentioned program of stockpiling fertilizers to secure adequate supply to the
farmers: in the last quarter of 1975, the country had in stock about 1.6
million tons of urea and 0.7 million of TSP/DAP, i.e., about two-year needs at
1975 levels of consumption. With a sizeable amount of urea already at hand,
Indonesia is not expected to have to import additional urea in the foreseeable
future; by 1978, the stock of N fertilizers is forecast to decline down to
about 250,000 product tons, i.e., three to four month consumption. As
mentioned, phosphate and potash fertilizers will still be imported.
3.10      As the new production units go on stream, Indonesia should emerge as
an exporter of N fertilizer toward the end of the decade. The exportable
surplus is projected to increase to about 234,000 tons of N in 1982 and then
decline to about 174,000 tons in 1985 as domestic demand rises (para 3.07).
The Government has undertaken to study potential export markets and develop
an export strategy and submit a report to the Bank by December 1, 1977.
Indonesia should not find it too difficult to market this surplus even in the
neighboring countries alone, for which import needs are projected to develop
as follows:
1/   International urea prices (f.o.b. exporting countries) have since then
come down to US$110-150/ton.

respectively.
3.11      Indonesia, because of its favorable location, is in an advanta-
geous position to cover these deficits compared to more distant countries
which are expected to have some export surplus by the end of this decade.
However, competition from Japan may be substantial, depending on the degree
to which their present exports to China,that account for about 65% of total
Japanese fertilizer exports, may have to be diverted to other markets on
account of a rapid build-up of China's own fertilizer production capacity.
D.   PUSRI Marketing and Distribution
3.12      PUSRI has established an efficient distribution network to market
its own and imported fertilizers and related agro-chemicals. The Company's
marketing organization which operates separately from its manufacturing
activities, is extensive and currently accounts for the distribution of about
60% of all fertilizer consumed in Indonesia; PUSRI is expected to remain the
leading distributor in the future as well.
3.13      PUSRI owns two bulk terminals with bagging facilities at Surabaya
and Cilacap; and storage depots in selected locations (Map, IBRD 12069).
A third bulk terminal/bagging station built by PERTAMINA at Tanjung Priok
near Jakarta, especially to handle imported fertilizers, is also available
for use by PUSRI. Finally, two new bulk terminals at Belawan and Padang
(Sulawesi) with adequate facilities will be established under the Fertilizer
Distribution Project (US$68 million, Loan No. 1139-IND of July 10, 1975).
3.14      Urea is presently shipped from Palembang both in bags, through Regu-
lar Liner Service (RLS) vessels which operate among the islands, and in bulk,
through chartered carriers equipped for unloading at the bulk terminals where
urea is bagged, stored and dispatched for inland distribution. These present
bulk carriers do not represent an optimal solution for fertilizer shipments
and are to be replaced by more efficient bulk carriers. In addition, shipping,
unloading, bagging and related storage facilities will be installed under the
Fertilizer Distribution Project which is expected to be in place by mid-1977.

3.15      PUSRI has made a preliminary estimate of the additional facilities
required to accommodate the increment of production of PUSRI IV: they
include transport facilities (bulk carriers, locomotives and freight wagons),
additional Inland Storage Depots (ISDs) and a new bulk terminal and bagging
station to be built at Ujung Pandang (Sulawesi). Final design of the system
will have to await the outcome of the National Fertilizer and Pesticides
Distribution Study, which was included in the Fertilizer Distribution Project
for completion by June 1976. Agreement was reached with the Government and
PUSRI that they will develop the additional distribution facilities in time
for the commercial operation of PUSRI IV and that they will submit to the Bank
a financing plan and an implementation schedule for such facilities within
three months after the completion of the National Fertilizer and Pesticides
Distribution Study.
3.16      Initially about 80% of PUSRI production will be shipped in bulk
to the main markets in Java and Sumatera through the new system, and the
rest bagged and shipped in RLS vessels. PUSRI's imported fertilizers will be
received in bulk and bags at Java ports and also be distributed through this
system. Considerable economies will be achieved by using the ships provided
by the Fertilizer Distribution Project to distribute imported fertilizers as
backhaul between Indonesian ports.
E.   Credit
3.17      Over 60% of the fertilizer consumed in Indonesia is applied in
areas covered by two successful programs for promoting intensive cultivation of
foodcrops, especially of rice: the BIMAS 1/ (Mass Guidance) Program and the
INMAS 2/ (Mass Intensification) Program. The rest of the fertilizer is con-
sumed mostly by the cash crop or estate sector. The Bank Rakyat Indonesia
(BRI) is the sole credit agency for the BIMAS and INMAS programs, while the
estate sector depends on the normal banking facilities to meet its credit
needs. Adequate credits are currently provided by BRI and the normal banking
facilities at 1 to 2% monthly interest rates and no serious problem is fore-
seen with respect to credit in the future. BRI is attempting to set up
offices to process loan applications in each village. Village units without
a BRI office are covered by mobile units. To obtain fertilizer, the farmer
has to apply to the village head for an allocation and, to BRI for a credit
voucher covering the cost of the fertilizer allocated to him. Fertilizer
is either sold in village "kiosks" operated by retailers or by village unit
1/   BIMAS is a credit program designed to provide farmers with cheaper
finance than that of local money lenders, and supported by an agricul-
tural extension service.
2/   INMAS, the other major agricultural improvement program, is designed
for farmers who are financially more secure than the beneficiaries
of BIMAS, and provides for the distribution of essential agricultural
equipment.



- 14 -
cooperatives (BUUD's and KUD's). 1/ It is the Government's policy to pro-
mote the BIJWD's and KUD's as a main source of input supplies for farmers
covered by the BIMAS and INMAS programs. Presently, the cooperatives lack
trained personnel to operate efficiently and the Government is making efforts
to expand and strengthen them.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The plant will consist of two single-train units of modern design,
an ammonia plant with a capacity of 1,000 TPD and a urea plant of 1,725 TPD.
The capacities and the design characteristics of the two units will be similar
to PUSRI III. The project is part of a larger program which will also include
the development of (i) a gas gathering and distribution system; (ii) a fertil-
izer distribution facility; and (iii) a training program for the national
fertilizer industry. The project is the third expansion of the Company's
existing facilities at Palembang (see Annex 4-1 for the plant layout) and is
to make maximum use of the present plant site. Soil conditions will necessitate
piling and provisions for this have been made in the capital cost estimates.
Additional auxiliary facilities are included in the project, such as an
ammnonia storage, urea storage and loading facilities, and a gas turbine
power generator to ensure continuous supply of power without fluctuation and
voltage dips.   A training center for operating and maintenance staff will be
constructed at Palembang 2/ and its cost is included in the investment estimates.
A description of the proposed PUSRI IV production process and plant facilities
and a project implementation schedule are given in Annexes 4-2 and 4-3.
B.   Gas Supply and Price
4.02      Natural gas will be used for both feedstock and fuel, and will
be obtained from the nearby oil and gas fields in South Sumatera operated
by PERTAMINA and STANVAC 3/. The project's daily gas requirements at design
capacity are about 60 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) compared to
12, 42 and 60 MMSCFD for PUSRI I, II and III, respectively. Total gas require-
merits of the Company's plants and other users through 1997, the end of the
useful life of PUSRI IV, are the following:
1/   The functions of the BUUD's/KUD's are to provide farmers with agricul-
tural extension services in an effort to increase food production,
supply farm input and manage farmers' output for their better benefit.
2/   A second training center for accounting and marketing staff will be set
up at the existing headquarters in Jakarta.
3/   Annex 4-4.

/a   Billion standard cubic feet (BSCF).
lb   Through expected useful life of PUSRI plants.
/c   Including gas lift and compressor fuel.
Total gas reserves in the area (proven, probable and possible) are 1,862
BSCF of which 1,384 BSCF are proven, and are therefore expected to be adequate
to meet PUSRI's need over the entire life of the projects. Furthermore, the
Goverment has assured PUSRI that its requirements will be met on a priority
basis, since the other users (essentially two refineries in Plaju and Sungei
Gerong) could switch to fuel oil if necessary. Details of gas requirements and
reserves are given in Annex 4-5.
4.03      PUSRI I is served by a gas pipeline operated by STANVAC, while
PUSRI II needs are met by the gas gathering and transmission systems devel-
oped by PERTAMINA as part of the PUSRI II project, financed by IDA. For
PUSRI III, PERTAMINA, under instruction from the Government, had initiated
in 1974 some engineering and drilling activities to develop new gas fields
in the Musi Block, about 250 Km southwest of PUSRI, and to upgrade the present
system (by looping from Simpang to the plant). Early in 1975, however, the
Government requested PERTAMINA to (a) review the basis of the gas project,
since some doubts had been expressed on the economic validity of exploiting
the distant gas field (the Musi Block) so early and (b) develop a supply
scheme to cover the additional gas requirements for PUSRI IV. As a result
PERTAMINA designed an integrated gas system which will supply all of the
Company's requirements (except PUSRI I) as well as those of the other users in
the area. A description of the gas system and cost estimates are given in
Annex 4-5. Gas fields which are closer to the consumption site will be the
first to be connected to the gathering system. As the reserves of the closest
fields are exploited, new gas fields further away will be connected. Invest-
ment costs will therefore be spread over a longer period of time, thus reducing
their present value. STANVAC gas fields, which were not included in the
original project, are now planned to supply gas to the system from the early
years of operations. However, PERTAMINA and STANVAC have not been able thus
far to agree on a gas pricing formula. The Government has informed the Bank
that it will make every effort to get the contract signed at an early date.
4.04      PERTAMINA will act as the executing agency of the integrated gas
project and, through contractors and its own Gas Division, implement the



- 16 -
project. Decisions concerning equipment and services procurement, however,
will be subject to approval by a steering committee, formed by representatives
of the Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs, Industry and Mines Ministries.
This committee will review from time to time the status of the project and
will exercise close control over project cost. The PUSRI III project is
expected to require gas for initial testing by mid-1976 and the existing
gas system developed for PUSRI II is capable of delivering the 10 MMSCFD
needed for this purpose. It is also expected that PUSRI III will be ready for
final performance tests in early 1977 when its full gas requirements (60
MM'SCFD) will have to be available and, therefore, the looping work from
Simpang to Palembang and extension of the existing gas gathering system to
nearby STANVAC and PERTAMINA fields will have to be completed. In April
1976, PERTAMINA and Quadra Engineering Company, of Canada, signed a contract
to complete the most urgent phase (1-C) of the gas project by February 1977.
Financing for this phase of work is being negotiated with the Export Develop-
ment Corporation (EDC) of Canada. Should EDC financing not be available, the
Government has undertaken to finance the project from its own resources.
Further, the Government has undertaken that PERTAMINA will complete other
phases (1-A and 1-B) of the gas project which are being carried out by local
contractors and with Government financing, in time to insure adequate gas
supply to PUSRI III and PUSRI IV. The various phases of the gas project are:
(1-A) looping from Simpang to Palembang by December 1976; (1-B) looping from
Cambai to Simpang by mid-1978; and (1-C) tying-in of the gas fields between
Rambutan and Cambai between December 1976 and first quarter of 1977.
4.05      In August 1975 PUSRI and PERTAMINA entered into a gas purchase
agreement, whereby PERTAMINA will supply PUSRI II, III and IV with the
total gas requirements over their respective lives (estimated at 20 years),
thereby amending the earlier agreement covering the gas supply to PUSRI II.
The pricing formula has not changed except for the fee PUSRI has to pay to
PERTAMINA, which has been increased from US2.0 cents to US3.5 cents per
MSCF to cover overhead charges . According to this formula the price of gas
is set at a level to cover interest as well as full operating costs (including
depreciation) 1/ of the gas system.  The price of gas should thus decline as
interest payments on debt decline.  Because it is not possible to determine
accurately in advance the amount of further investment in drilling to maintain
gas delivery, this pricing system allows such investment to be ammortized by
an increase in the then ruling price of gas, and quite probably, without
exceeding the initial gas price. For the purpose of financial projections,
an average gas price of Rp 250 (US$0.60) per MSCF has been assumed. The
Government has agreed to cause PERTAMINA to supply to the project adequate gas
of required quality at reasonable prices.
C.   Management and Project Execution
4.06      The project management for PUSRI III will also implement PUSRI IV.
A project team headed by Mr. Kotan Pasaman, PUSRI's Technical and Production
1/   Depreciation equals the debt repayment at present as the PUSRI II gas
project was financed exclusively by debt. The gas project expansion will
also be financed exclusively by debt.



- 17 -
Director, has been formed to supervise and coordinate the work of the two
engineering firms, Kellogg (U.S.) and Toyo Engineering (Japan). Kellogg
will have overall responsibility for construction, erection and start-up
of the complete fertilizer plant which will be supplied as follows: (i) the
ammonia plant and all offsites and auxiliaries are being designed and procured
by Kellogg; and (ii) the urea plant is being designed by Toyo which is also
procuring the equipment for shipment to the plant site ready for erection by
Kellogg. As the Company staff is limited, it is being supplemented by the
same consultants engaged in PUSRI III implementation.
4.07      Kellogg and Toyo Engineering have been the contractors for PUSRI II
and III, and the Company has retained them, with Bank concurrence, to also
implement the project (PUSRI IV). The ammonia and urea units will be essen-
tially a duplication of the design used for PUSRI III. This together with
some standardization in equipment, with reduced spare parts requirements, will
significantly lower the capital cost of the project. Letters of intent were
issued to Kellogg and Toyo in June 1975 and the final contracts signed in
August 1975. The project is at an advanced stage: design and engineering is
well underway and ordering of critical equipment has been completed in
accordance with Bank approved procedures. The project is expected to be
mechanically completed by November 1977 with commercial production after the
final acceptance test scheduled for February 1978 (Annex 4-3). This is a
tight but realistic schedule given the good performance record for PUSRI II
and III and the duplication nature of the project.
D.   Employment and Training
4.08      PUSRI's present staff of about 2,600 is expected to increase by 60%
in the next three years. At the same time the Government is relying upon
PUSRI to provide the staff and training facilities required to implement the
investment program in the entire fertilizer industry. The Company recognizes
the importance of early recruitment and is planning to begin recruitment for
PUSRI IV in January 1977. Only the hiring of graduate accountants is expected
to be a potential problem. As one approach to relieving the problem, the
Government and PUSRI have agreed to review the present salary scales, including
fringe benefits, of professional staff of PUSRI and submit a report to the
Bank by June 30, 1977.
4.09      PUSRI's record of staff training is good.  The additional demands
which will be placed on the training system within the next three years,
however, make it necessary for programs to be made more efficient and for
a National Fertilizer Production Training Center to be established at Palembang
with minor ancillary facilities in Jakarta. The estimated total cost of this
component of the project is US$1.7 million of which the foreign exchange
share accounts for US$880,000. Details of the overall training require-
ments which will arise by 1978, together with the proposal for meeting them,
are outlined in Annex 4-6. The training program will be carried out according
to a schedule to be mutually agreed between PUSRI and the Bank.
E.   Ecology
4.10      There are currently no statutory regulations in Indonesia for
controlling the discharge of industrial effluents, and the plants will be



- 18 -
designed in accordance with standards established by Kellogg and Toyo on the
biasis of regulations in the U.S. and Japan. As natural gas from the South
Sumatera fields is virtually sulphur free, atmospheric pollution problems are
expected to be minimal. Liquid effluents from the plant will be treated in
waste water treatment units prior to discharge into the Musi River. Pollution
control and monitoring facilities, as envisaged under the project, account for
2% of the project cost and are satisfactory. Their inclusion in the project
was confirmed during negotiations.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Costs
5.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$186 mil-
lion equivalent, including US$145 million in foreign exchange. Details of
capital cost estimates given in Annex 5-1 are summarized below:

- 19 -
5.02      The above cost estimates are based on PUSRI III and other compara-
ble Bank Group projects as well as data prepared by the Company with the help
of their Technical Advisor, Scientific Design of the U.K., using December 1975
prices. These prices were derived from quotations submitted to Kellogg and
Toyo by prospective suppliers and from actual bids received on a firm basis for
about 60% of the equipment. In addition to the normal level of expenditures
for site preparation, US$5.2 million have been included for piling and soil
investigations. Provisions for training and training-related consultants'
expenses were included under different headings: US$2.8 million under Project
Management for the costs of the Technical Advisor as well as consultants on
management, accounting, shipping and marketing; US$0.9 million under preoperat-
ing and start-up expenses to cover the expenditures of a comprehensive training
program developed with the help of the Bank (Annex 4-6); and US$0.8 million
under equipment for the cost of two training centers; one in Palembang and the
other in Jakarta. The costs under these headings are relatively high due to:
(i) lack of trained manpower in Indonesia, thus necessitating heavy reliance
on expatriates; and (ii) need for extensive training of local personnel in
view of PUSRI's rapid expansion.
5.03      Physical contingency equivalent to 7% of the base cost estimate has
been added: this is relatively low, due to the advanced state of the project.
Price escalation for equipment (excluding proprietary and critical items worth
US$25 million for which orders have already been placed on fixed price con-
tracts) is calculated on the basis of projected price increases of 9% in 1976
and 8% per year thereafter in major equipment supplying countries because of
worldwide inflation. On civil works, escalation rates of 13% in 1976 and 12%
per year thereafter have been assumed based on the projected rates of inflation
in Indonesia. The above cost estimates, including physical and price contin-
gencies, are considered adequate.
5.04      The incremental working capital requirements due to the project are
estimated at Rp 3,179 million (US$7.8 million) and are detailed in Annex 5-2.
At present, the Company's consolidated accounts show excessive working capital,
primarily because of the large inventory of imported fertilizers held by PUSRI
on behalf of the Government. However, the national fertilizer stockpile
accounts will be shown separately by PUSRI starting in 1977 (para. 2.14) and
the Government will continue to make up all the losses resulting from the
stockpile operation. For the purpose of projections, therefore, the stock-
pile accounts have not been taken into consideration. As a result, the current
excessive working capital of PUSRI is forecast to show a sharp reduction from
1977 onwards.
B.  Financing Plan
5.05      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:



- 20 -
Financing Plan
Government Financing By Sources         In Rp Billion   In US$ Million    %
Bank Loan                                 29.05             70           37.6
Saudi Loan                               29.05              70           37.6

Application of Funds by Government
Loan                                     58.10             140           75.2
Equity                                   19.09              46           24.8
77.19            186          100.0
5.06      The Government will subscribe Rp 19.1 billion (US$46 million) in
new equity in foreign exchange and local currency as required, while the rest
of the financing is to be met with loans from the Bank and the Saudi Fund for
Development (SFD). The project will be financed 75% by debt. This high debt
lievel is acceptable as the debt/equity ratio for the Company as a whole is not
expected to surpass 55/45 (para 6.13).  Agreement has been reached with the
Government that this ratio for the Company will not exceed 55/45 at any
time.
5.07      The total foreign exchange cost of PUSRI IV is estimated at Rp 60.2
billion (US$145 million). Proceeds of the loans from Bank and Saudi Arabia
would cover 92% of such costs, with the Government meeting the remaining 8%.
The Government will also contribute all local currency financing, including
working capital. The timely availability of local as well as foreign exchange
financing from the Government was confirmed during negotiations. In case of
any cost overrun, it will be the responsibility of the Government to provide
promptly the additional funds to complete the project on terms satisfactory to
the Bank.
5.08      The Bank loan will be made to the Government which will on-lend
the proceeds to PUSRI for 15 1/2 years including 3 1/2 years of grace -- the
same terms as proposed for the Bank loan to the Government -- at an annual
interest of 12%, including a fee accruing to the Government which will bear
the foreign exchange risk.   The principal of the loan will be repayable in 24
equal semi-annual installments beginning from the second half of 1978, i.e.,
about 1 3/4 years after the expected start of commercial production.  Though
the financial projections show that the Company would be able to pay off
the loan in a shorter period of time, a repayment period of 12 years is
recolnmended on country grounds.  The proposed Saudi loan 1/ is expected to be

made to the Government at an annual interest of approximately 4% and would be
on-lent to PUSRI by the Government on the same terms as the Bank loan. The
Bank loan will become effective after all conditions for the effectiveness of
other financing are met by the Government and PUSRI.
C.   Procurement
5.09      International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance
with Bank guidelines are being used -- independent of the source of financing
-- for equipment and materials estimated to cost about US$80 million including
escalation. Proprietary equipment essential to the process and items in limited
supply, which are estimated to cost together about US$11 million and cri-
tical to the timely completion of the project, are being procured following
bidding from lists of qualified non-Indonesian suppliers; these lists have
been approved by the Bank. In addition, standardized items worth US$14
million will be procured from the same suppliers as for PUSRI III. Items
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each, and totalling about US$1 million
are being purchased from suppliers on the basis of suitability, availability
and price. The list of items falling into this category has also been approved
by the Bank. A preference of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is lower,
will be allowed to Indonesian manufacturers for the purpose of evaluating
bids following ICB. Bid evaluation will be PUSRI's responsibility with the
assistance as required.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.10      The allocation of the Bank loan was agreed on during negotiations.
The proceeds of the loan will cover the foreign exchange cost of a selected
list of imported equipment and services, including engineering and licensing
fees, as shown below. A separate list of goods and services has been prepared
for Saudi financing under a parallel financing arrangement. About US$7.3
million (10%) of the Saudi loan would finance a part of local costs associated
with those items. Both lists are summarized in Annex 5-3. By the time of
Board presentation, out of the estimated US$145 million foreign exchange cost,
US$60 million will have been committed, with expenditures amounting to US$20
million. In view of the advanced stage of the project, it is recommended that
the Bank retroactively reimburse up to US$7 million equivalent for goods and
services (including US$3 million for goods and US$4 million for services).

account after completion of the project will be cancelled.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Project Revenue and Profit
6.01      The financial analysis of the project is done on an incremental
basis and in real 1975 prices. The major assumptions, detailed in Annex 6-1,
are summarized below.
6.02      It is assumed that the project will start commercial production on
February 15, 1978 with capacity utilization increasing gradually from 75% in
the first full year of operation (February 15, 1978 to February 15, 1979) to
80% in the second and 90% in the third and beyond. Because of PUSRI's past
record and provision for technical assistance for the project, the attainment
of 90% capacity utilization is considered conservative. The economic life of
the project is assumed to be 12 operating years with assets depreciated on a
straight line basis. At 90% capacity utilization, the project would produce
513,000 TPY of urea.
6.03      The current price to producers fixed by the Government includes an
allowance for transportation costs to Java. Taking this into account, the
current ex-factory price is Rp 55,900 (US$135) per ton. The ex-factory price
iLs expected to rise to Rs 58,930 (US$142) per ton from 1977 onwards as a
result of the anticipated reduction in transportation cost due to the commis-
sioning of the Bank-financed PUSRI Fertilizer Distribution Project now under-
way, and this price is used for projecting sales revenue. Operating costs are
calculated at 1975 constant prices and include real increases in labor and
overhead costs.

B.   Production Costs
6.04      The following table shows the per ton production cost of the
project at 90% capacity utilization:
PUSRI IV - Production Costs per Ton (1981)

Total                      111.3             100.0
6.05      Production costs for PUSRI IV are comparable to those for PUSRI III.
The principal raw material, natural gas, accounts for 18.8% of the production
costs (including depreciation and financial charges). Depreciation and finan-
cial charges together represent the largest share (51.2%) of total production
costs.

6.06      Financial projections for the project given in Annex 6-2 are sum-
marized below:

/a   Assuming 5-year tax holiday



- 24 -
6.07      Total sales of the project are expected to increase from about
Rp. 22.0 billion in 1978 (for 10 1/2 months of operation) to Rp 30.2 bil-
Lion in 1981 (the first year of sales equal to full production). Net profit
after tax of the project increases from about Rp 1.9 billion in 1978 to
7.1 billion in 1982 but declines the following year to Rp 4.2 billion because
the 5-year tax holiday for the project ends in 1982. However, the percentage
of net profit/sales in 1983, the first year of tax payment, would still be at
a satisfactory level of 14%.
6.08      The project is expected to generate from the beginning enough cash
to more than meet its debt service. Beyond 1982, the debt service coverage
will come down because of the assumed tax payments (45% of pre-tax profit) but
it will still be at an acceptable level.
]).  Incremental Financial Rate of Return
6.09      The incremental financial rate of return before tax is 21.4% (19%
after tax) and is satisfactory. Sensitivity tests have been conducted to
determine the effects of various events on the financial rate of return; the
results are shown in Annex 6-3 and are summarized below:
PUSRI IV - Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Case                                        Percentage
1.   Base Case                                                     21.4
2.   Sales revenue decrease by 10%                                 17.6
3.   Sales revenue decrease by 20%                                 14.0
4.   Capital cost increase by 10%                                  19.4
5.   Operating cost increase by 10%                                20.0
6.   6-month project delay and 10% capital cost increase           17.0
7.   80% capacity utilization                                      18.5
8.   Combination of (6) and (7)                                    14.1
6.10      The rate of return is more sensitive to changes in sales revenue
than in operating .and capital costs. A six-month delay in project implemen-
lation, combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and the eventual attainment
of only 80% capacity utilization, would reduce the return to 14.1%. However,
the likelihood of this happening is low, particularly because of the involve-
raent of experienced engineering firms. If one-third of the project's output
iLs assumed to be exported, the financial rate would increase to 22.5% as the
1-.o.b. export prices are expected to be higher by US$18 per ton than the
assumed ex-factory domestic price.
E.   Break-even Point
6.11      The profit break-even for the project in 1981 would be 64% capacity
operation, and the cash break-even, 59%. A break-even chart is provided in
Annex 6-4.

6.13      Assumptions used are detailed in Annex 6-1.  The consolidated
projections show that during 1976-1983 total sales volume would increase by
about 117%, while net profit would increase by 2.2 times starting from a low
base. Projected increases in sales during 1977-1983 are mainly due to PUSRI
III and PUSRI IV. The net profit declines slightly in 1983 compared with 1979
in spite of the decrease in interest burden because, as mentioned in para
6.07, from 1982 the Company will no longer enjoy the tax holiday on PUSRI III
and PUSRI IV. The debt/equity ratio of PUSRI is estimated at 49/51 in 1976.
It is forecast to improve significantly and reach 26/74 in 1983 assuming all
earnings are retained and no further expansion is undertaken.



- 26 -
6.14      The Government had agreed under the PUSRI III loan to maintain PUSRI
in a sound liquidity position by ensuring a current ratio of at least 1.2
during the continuation of the fertilizer distribution control system and 1.4
thereafter. However, the projections show that the current ratio would fall
below 1 during 1979-1983 if surplus cash, which builds up impressively during
that period, is excluded from the ratio calculation. Therefore, the Government
and PUSRI are expected to allocate sufficient funds from surplus cash to
current assets to maintain the current ratio at the previously agreed levels.
Should the anticipated surplus cash fail to materialize, the Government will
help PUSRI maintain the current ratio at such levels.
6.15      Even after allocation of surplus cash to current assets there would
be substantial excess funds which are expected to be used to: (i) diversify
and modernize PUSRI I operation; (ii) establish a urea formaldehyde plant at
Palembang; (iii) relocate PUSRI headquarters from Palembang to Jakarta; (iv)
invest in a possible regional joint venture among member countries of the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to produce urea at Aceh, North
Sumatera, for which PUSRI is preparing a feasibility study following a request
by the Indonesian Government; and (v) carry out various studies, e.g., about
export markets.
6.16      The following covenants similar to those in the PUSRI II and PUSRI
III loans were agreed to: (i) PUSRI will have subsidiaries only with the
prior approval of the Bank; (ii) without Bank consent, PUSRI will not incur
additional long-term indebtedness other than Rp 150 billion (US$361 million
equivalent) for PUSRI III, PUSRI IV and the related fertilizer distribution
projects if as a consequence the debt/equity ratio would exceed 55/45 for the
Company; (iii) PUSRI will depreciate fixed assets of the project over 12 years
of its operating life and other assets in conformity with sound accounting
principles; (iv) without Bank consent, PUSRI will not declare dividends except
out of accumulated net earnings nor pay dividends, until PUSRI IV shall have
produced at 80% capacity for 12 consecutive months, i.e., 456,000 tons, or if
its current assets would be less than 1.4 times its current liabilities; (v)
the Government will help PUSRI maintain a debt service coverage annually of at
least 1.5 times; and (vi) except for PUSRI III, PUSRI IV and the related
distribution projects, and normal replacements, PUSRI will not invest more
than US$5 million per year without Bank consent until PUSRI IV produces at 80%
capacity for 12 consecutive months. However, two exceptions to the US$5
million annual investment limit were agreed to: (i) cost involved in the
relocation of PUSRI headquarters from Palembang to Jakarta, and (ii) investment
in a urea formaldehyde plant at Palembang which is expected to cost about
US$11 million.
G.   Major Risks
6.17      The project design is based on modern commercially proven techno-
logy for economically efficient large-scale production, thus minimizing
technical and obsolescence risks in the project. Further, urea has been
produced and marketed by PUSRI during the last 10 years and it is the most
common fertilizer used in Indonesia. However, the project could face problems



- 2 7 -
for lack of realistic Government policies regarding fertilizer prices. Also,
it has to be noted that in the past, the Government responded to PUSRI finan-
cial needs rather slowly and the Company could face certain risks because of
similar slow response. The Government has, however, agreed to meet its
obligation without any delay in the future. In addition, the gas gathering
and distribution system for PUSRI III is one year behind schedule. Any
further delay in the implementation of the gas project will affect both PUSRI
III and PUSRI IV as the system designed for PUSRI III has to be expanded to
serve PUSRI IV as well. The Bank is closely watching the progress on the gas
project and the Government has agreed to provide promptly adequate funds for
the project. Moreover, commercial risks in the sale of urea, including
possible need for temporary exports, are also present, but these are consi-
dered comparatively minor, since Indonesia will have to use most of the
project's output if it is to meet the food requirements of a rapidly expand-
ing population.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   World Fertilizer Prices
7.01      During the late 1960's, world fertilizer prices were depressed due
to excess supply and, consequently, investments in new fertilizer projects
declined sharply. When the world demand for fertilizers surged during 1972-73
with the spreading of the "green revolution" based on high-yielding seed
varieties, the demand was not matched by increased supply of fertilizers.
Partly as a result of worldwide fertilizer shortages and partly due to sharp
increases in the prices of fertilizer feedstocks, international fertilizer
prices skyrocketed. For example, bagged urea import prices reached about
US$300 (f.o.b. exporting countries) per ton in 1974 compared to about US$70/
ton at the end of the 1960's. The prices remained high until May 1975 but
since then urea prices declined to US$110-150 per ton (April 1976) with the
easing of the world supply situation. This sharp decline in prices has come
about mainly because some of the principal importing countries have stopped
buying fertilizers and have even cancelled some contracts for fertilizer
imports after the panic buying during 1973-74 in the face of steep increases
in world fertilizer prices. Those countries built up large-scale stockpiles
assuming the rise in fertilizer prices would continue for 2-3 more years. The
world fertilizer prices are likely to remain at the present levels until the
stockpiles are used up and imports are resumed on a fuller scale. Considdring
the fact that investment costs of US$385-440 per ton of new urea capacity are
required for projects currently commencing, the large-scale expansion needed
to meet future urea demand in the world would necessitate a urea selling price
of US$160-190 (f.o.b.) per ton, in 1975 dollars. If prices remain below this
level for long, the anticipated increase in investment on new urea projects
may be deferred, resulting in shortages, leading to sharp increases in price
as experienced during 1973-74. Therefore, the short-term gains for fertilizer-
deficit countries from dependence on imports rather than indigenous production
may be more than wiped out by periodic surges in world fertilizer prices in
general.



- 28 -
B.   Economic Advantages
7.02      An investigation employing a mathematical programming model has been
carried out by the Bank to determine the least cost solution with respect to
iinvestment, production, importation and transportation in the ASEAN (Associa-
tion of South East Asian Nations) region to meet its long-term fertilizer re-
quirements. 1/ The model dealt with alternate plant sites, plant sizes,
feedstocks, fertilizer intermediates and end products.  In all cases assessed,
assuming varying degrees of regional economic cooperation, the model supports
the proposal for PUSRI IV. With its ample and underutilized resources of
natural gas, the most efficient feedstock for the production of nitrogenous
fertilizers, Indonesia has the potential not only to achieve self-suffciciency
in such fertilizers but also to emerge as a significant exporter. The neigh-
boring countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam,
are likely to depend on imports of nitrogenous fertilizers for many years. To
those countries, Indonesia promises to be a competitive supplier of fertili-
zers. Freight rates, which constitute a major part of imported fertilizer
costs, have increased sharply. In this respect, Indonesia enjoys a definite
advantage in supplying its neighbors compared to competitors further away.
Most of the production from PUSRI IV would, however, be necessary to meet the
domestic demand. Further, PUSRI has well-developed infrastructure facilities
built for PUSRI II and III. As a result, there will be considerable cost
saving with respect to PUSRI IV which is expected to cost about US$40 million
less than a green-field plant of comparable size. Besides, PUSRI has estab-
lished itself as an efficient producer of urea and as an expeditious executor
of expansion projects with the help of experienced firms.
C.   Price Assumptions for Economic Analysis
7.03      The economic analysis is based on 1975 prices in real terms as shown
in Annex 7-1. The production of PUSRI IV for domestic consumption is valued
at US$178 per ton of bagged urea ex-factory. This economic accounting price
is derived by assuming an average price during the life of the project of
US$160 per ton of bagged urea (f.o.b., exporting contries 2/), and adding a
freight charge if US$25 per ton. To this price of US$185/ton no adjustments
are made for port handling and inland freight since such distribution costs
from the port of entry (Jakarta) would be the same for imported as well as
PUSRI-produced urea. However, as PUSRI ships most of its fertilizers from
Palembang to Jakarta to serve the predominant fertilizer market in Java, an
1/   The Potential For Regional Collaboration in Fertilizer:  The Case of the
ASEAN Group, Bank/IFDC Draft Report, November 1975.
2/   By the time the project commences production in 1978, the bagged urea
price (f.o.b.) is projected at US$160 per ton in constant 1975 prices.
This is derived from the latest (November 26, 1975) Bank forecast of
US$200 per ton of bagged urea (f.o.b.) at current prices in 1978.



- 29 -
economic shipping cost of US$7/ton is assumed and it is deducted from the
US$185/ton, thus arriving at the US$178/ton price mentioned above. As for
PUSRI exports, they are valued at US$160/ton (f.o.b. Palembang).
7.04      With respect to operating costs, no shadow rates are used for labor
as most of the labor employed in the project would be skilled personnel. Also
no shadow rates are used for foreign exchange as the Indonesian rupiah is a
freely convertible currency. The feedstock, natural gas from South Sumatera,
is priced on the basis that it is a non-tradeable commodity because: (i) the
present proven reserves there are not large enough to justify a liquified
natural gas (LNG) facility; and (ii) pooling of gas reserves in South Sumatera
with the large-scale gas reserves in North Sumatera (where a LNG plant is
being established) through a pipeline system is too expensive. A gas price
US60 cents per thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF) is used on the basis that
it is the price required to cover investment costs and to ensure a reasonable
rate of return on such investment.
D.   Economic Rate of Return
7.05      The economic rate of return for the project is 28.6% based on
the assumed gas price of 60 US cents per MSCF. Sensitivity tests performed
on the economic rate of return (Annex 7-2) show that a 10% drop in urea price
would reduce the return to 25%, while a 10% increase in operating costs would
bring the return to 27.6%. A six-month delay in project implementation,
combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and the ultimate attainment of
only 80% capacity utilization (as against 90% assumed) would drop the eco-
nomic return to a still satisfactory level of 21.7%. Further, even if one-
third of the production of PUSRI IV were to be exported throughout the life
of the project, the return would drop marginally to 27%. Even when the
gas price is doubled, the economic rate would still be at a sound level of
23.5%. Therefore, under conceivable adverse conditions, the project yields
a very satisfactory rate of return.
E.   Foreign Exchange Effect
7.06      The net foreign exchange outflow (Annex 7-3) due to PUSRI IV during
the project construction period (1975-1977) would be only Rp 6,739 million
(US$16 million). However, the net outflow turns into a significant net
foreign exchange saving of Rs 26.8 billion (US$65 million) in 1978, the
first year of operation of PUSRI IV. The annual net saving would rise to
Rp 29.7 billion (US$72 million) with the attainment of full production in
1981.
F.   Training
7.07      An important part of the project is the provision for training
personnel of not only PUSRI but also other fertilizer plants, existing and/or
proposed, in Indonesia. Under the training program during the next three
years, a total of 3,800 persons would be trained, including about 2,850 PUSRI
personnel, in various fields such as finance and accounting, plant operation
and maintenance, marketing and distribution, administration, etc.

G.   Employment Generation
7.08      Direct employment from the project is low at 850 but the project
is expected to have a significant impact on indirect job creation especially
in transportation, storage and distribution of fertilizers and in the
exploitation and distribution of natural gas.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      During negotiations, the Government provided a new formula to cover
PUSRI's marketing losses (para. 2.12), and a contract between PERTAMINA and
Quadra Engineering Company, of Canada, to complete the most urgent phase
of the gas project by February 1977. Further, it undertook to carry out
other phases of the gas project in time, and also to assist PERTAMINA and
STANVAC (Indonesia) in reaching an agreement on a gas pricing formula at an
early date (paras 4.03 and 4.04).
8.02      In addition, the following major agreements were reached:
(a) From the Government that it will:
(i)  consult with Bank before making top management changes
in PUSRI (para. 2.07);
(ii) ensure a reasonable rate of return on assets in service
at efficient operation (para 2.16);
(iii)  have gas provided to the project at reasonable prices (para.
4.05);
(iv) provide funds promptly for PUSRI IV and the gas project
(paras. 4.04 and 5.07);
(v)  provide necessary funds to complete the project (para. 5.07);
(vi) help PUSRI maintain a debt service coverage of at least
1.5 times (para. 6.16).
(b)  From PUSRI that it will:
(i)  submit a plan for PUSRI I modernization by December 1976
(para. 2.02);
(ii) submit progress and financial reports to the Bank in time
and form satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.20);
(iii)  retain consultants to further train PUSRI staff (para. 2.20);
and



- 31 -
(iv) observe certain financial covenants (para. 6.16);
(c)  From the Government and PUSRI that they will:
(i)  study potential export markets, develop an export
strategy and submit a report to Bank by December 1,
1977 (para. 3.10);
(ii) submit a financing plan and an implementation schedule
for the distribution project within three months after
the completion of the National Fertilizer and Pesticides
Distribution Study now underway, and develop the addi-
tional distribution facilities required in time (para.
3.15);
(iii) review compensation scales for professional staff by
June 30, 1977 (para. 4.08);
(iv) ensure that debt/equity ratio will not exceed 55/45
(paras. 5.06 and 6.16); and
(v)  take necessary steps to ensure PUSRI's sound liquidity
position (para. 6.14).
8.04      The Bank loan will become effective after the additional financing
agreements (i.e. Saudi loan) are signed and their conditions for effectiveness
are met.
8.05      Based on the above agreements, the project provides a suitable basis
for a loan of US$70 million.

INDONESIA: PUSRI JV FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS
1.        Following is a description of the technical terms used in this
report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements,
6 in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities.  Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc,
iron, aluminium, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper.  Carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen are readily available from the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen, phos-
phorus and potassium -- three main nutrients -- and the other elements are
drawn from the soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials
containing the three main nutrients, soil is soon depleted of fertility by
cropping. Use of organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can
be utilized but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far
exceeded the availability of natural "fertilizers". Consequently, the majority
of the world's primary pl,ant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of
manufactured or "chemical  fertilizers.  To an increasing degree, secondary
nutrients such as calcium, manganese are also added to soils along with the
primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists according to specific
crop and soil needs.
3.        Chemical Fertilizers:  Chemical compounds suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and handling
problems; and readily water soluble and available to plant root systems.
Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a large degree
are:
Primary Fertilizer Materials
% of N                    % of P205              % of K20
Nutrient                   Nutrient               Nutrient
Urea                   46%      DAP              46%       Potassium
Ammonium Nitrate       3a%      Triple Super-               Chloride      61%
Ammonium Sulfate       21%        phosphate      46%       Potassium
Diammonium                      Single Super-               Sulfate       54%
Phosphate (DAP)      18%        phosphate      18%
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and potas-
sium chloride (KC1), they are some of the most popular fertilizer materials in
the world today. It is the common practice to report the nutrient content of
materials in terms of percentages of N (nitrogen), P205 (phosphorus pentoxide)
and K20 (potassium oxide).



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Complex or NPK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N, P205,
K20) are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios varying
with the nutrient requirements of different crops. To facilitate handling,
the several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules
for distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to
describe the NPK product. Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each
of N, P 0   and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24%
P205 and 12'% K20.
5.        Phosphate Water Solubility:  The agronomic availability (or effi-
ciency) of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is to use
water solubility as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less signifi-
cant factor.. Higher P205 water solubility permits the fertilizer to be
absorbed more rapidly. The minimum recommended in most cases is about 60%
solubility but in some cases up to 80-85% solubility is preferred.
6.        Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric
acid.  Nitric acid (HNO3), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH ).  AN contains
34.5% nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate form, and is
very hygroscopic. It is a commercial explosive. In many countries, a diluent --
e.g., limestone -- is added to lower the analysis and negate the explosive
properties as well as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the
ammonia synthesi's; in the proposed PUSRI III plant, the feedstock would be
natural gas which is usually the most economic choice when available. Other
potential feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite.
8.        Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONH2 - the normal amide
of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the ammonium
form. It is considerably less hydroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is the
most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
9.        Urea Synthesis:  Urea is made by  reacting ammonia with carbon
dioxide. Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia synthesis
urea production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant. Unfortunately,
the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does not form stable
ammonium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.  Therefore, simple
neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and sulfate fertilizers is
not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined under heat and
pressure to make ammonium carbamate which although unstable, can be dehydrated
under pressure to form urea, a stable compound.  Again, unfortunately, the over-
all reaction is completely reversible and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and
2000C, the conversion to urea in a single pass through the reactor is under
70%. This introduces several complications; high pressure must be used to
maximize conversion; unconverted reactants must be separated and recycled;
increased corrosion under the high temperatures and pressures used must be



ANNEX 1
Page 3
overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable products must be minimized.
In recent years, several engineering and producing companies have developed
ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants capable of producing
1,725 tons per day, or more, of urea to rigid chemical and physical specifi-
tions are now operating successfully for long periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and Measures
10.       The petroleum industry historically has used units of measure based
on the English measuring system. Conversion rates for some units are given
below:
1 barrel          =  2 US gallons;
1 US gallon       =  3.785 liters = 0.003785 j43
1 Normal Cu4ic
Meter (NM )    =  37.3 Standard Cubic Feet (SCF)
The conversion rates between volumetric units, such as gallons, and weights
are approximate since the specific gravity of the oil varies slightly with
its composition.
11.       Materials that exist in the form of gases, such as methane
(natural gas), are measured in volumetric units. Since gases are com-
pressible, standard conditions of temperature and pressure (60°F and 1.0
atmosphere) are used to define the quantity (in volume) of gas, and desig-
nated as "normal cubic meters."

ANNEX 2-1
INDONESIA:  PUSRI IV FERTILIZER EXRZSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACIIITIES AND PLANTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
PUSRI I
1.        PUSRI I, the original plant, by present standards is a small one.
It was engineered by H.K. Ferguson Company, a subsidiary of Morrison-
Knudsen (U.S.), with the Girdler Corporation (U.S.) providing the ammonia
process and the Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC), of Japan, the urea
process. Its ammonia and urea units have capacities of 180 TPD and 300 TPD
respectively, while modern fertilizer plants have capacities more than
fivefold higher, and use efficient single-train ammonia facilities based on
centrifagal compressors.  PUSRI I uses reciprocating compressors in its
dual-train ammonia and urea units. Because of its relatively small size
and obsolete technology, PUSRI I is a high-cost producer compared to larger
scale fertilizer plants. However, through good plant maintenance and
replacement investments, PUSRI 1 has been operating near or above rated
capacity since 1969. The plant is self-sufficient in utilities, but the
power-generating facilities are nearing the end of ti-ir useful life.
2.        Feedstock to PUSRI I is natural gas from STANVAC fed through a 75-
kilometer pipeline having about 12 million standard cubic feet (SCF) per day
capacity.  The gas supply agreement betveen PUSRI and STANVAC expires in
1983 at which time ownership of the gas and gas system would be transferred
to PERTAMINA.
3.        PU5RI I will need majcr :'ePairs by 1978, including the prill tower
and the urea reactor.  However, the ;nmonia plant, which does not have the
corrosion problem is capable of continuing its operation beyond 1978. PUSRI
is currently exploring possible choices for PUSRI I modernization including
urea granulation or using potential excess prilling capacity in PUSRI II and
III.  The anhydrous ammonia from the unit could also be used as a raw
material for complex fertilizer production, or could be sold as such.
PUSRI II
h.        Work or± T`USE  T   as originally scheduled to start in April 1970
and was expected to be in ooxnmercial operation by September 1973. However,
the implementatnon began nearly a year later than anticipated because of
the time required to develop bid specifications and to negotiate supply and
service contracts satisfactory tD all parties.
5.        FUSRI IT includes:  (1) modern single-train ammonia and urea plants
of 660 TD and I  50 TPD capacity; and (2) a gas supply system with 172 km
pipeline for gas gathering and transmission from PERTAMINA and STANVAC gas-
fields in South Sumatera.  The original estimate of financing required for
PUSRI II was eqivalent to nearlr US$91 million, including about US$15 million
equivalent for the gas system. The foreign exchange cost excluding interest
during cons- '-tion was estimated at US$68.0 million, of which IDA committed



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
US$30 million; USAID, US$20 million; ADB, US$10 million; and OECF, US$8
million. However, PUSRI II experienced cost increases because of:
(1) international currency realignments; (2) expansion of the gas gathering
and transmission system capacity by 90% to 116 million SCF/day over the
original plan (60 million SCF/day) to cover the requirements of PERTAMINA's
two refineries and of two power plants operated by the Universal Power
Company; and (3) a general escalation in equipment costs higher than
anticipated partly due to the one-year delay in the start of the project.
According to latest calculations, PUSRI II total cost amounts to over
US$122 million, including US$39 million for the gas system.  The increase
in the foreign exchange cost was almost fully covered by additional
commitments by the four lenders, including US$5 million from IDA through
a supplementary credit approved May 15, 1973. The Government has borne
the rest of the cost increase.
6.        PUSRI II went into production in September 197h.  It has in-
plant facilities for the supply of utilities. It also supplies power to
PUSRI I as the latter's old power generating unit is now used as a standby.
Further, while PUSRI I ships bagged urea, PUSRI II product is shipped in
bulk; however, cross-connection allows part of the PUSRI II production to
be bagged using PUSRI I bagging facilities. PERTAMINA supplies gas to
PUSRI II under a 20 year gas purchase agreement, which has been amended to
incorporate PUSRI III and PUSRI IV gas requirements. The price formula
covers all operating costs including depreciation and financial charges.
Based on this formula, the gas price is expected to gradually decline from
45 US cents to 28 US cents per MSCF during 1975-1980.
7.        The ammonia plant of PUSRI II was designed by M.W. Kellogg Company
(U.S.), using its own process, and the urea plant by the Toyo Engineering
Corporation (Japan), based on the Mitsui Toatsu process. Kellogg had
overall responsibility for the entire fertilizer plant, with Toyo as sub-
contractor. Scientific Design Company (UK), as Technical Adviser, assisted
PUSRI. Agrar-und Hydrotechnic GmbH of the Federal Republic of Germany has
been serving as Marketing Consultants and Price Waterhouse and Associates
of the U.K./Australia, as Accounting and Management Consultants.
PUSRI III
8.        PUSRI III was conceived and its implementation started vrhile
PUSRI II was still under construction. PUSRI retained the same contractors
which were implementing PUSRI II in order to reduce the project execution
duration. In April 1974 basic engineering and procurement activities for
PUSRI III were initiated.  It is expected that the plant will be mechanically
completed by December 1976 and in commercial operation by April 1977.
9.        PRUSRI III consists of two modern large-scale, single train units -
an ammonia plant and a urea plant of 1,000 TPD and 1,725 TPD capacity
respectively. It has in-plant facilities for the supply of utilities and
0olypropilene bags. The capacity of the bag-making plant is sufficient to



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
cover PUSRI I, II and III bag requirements. The capital cost for the
project is estimated at US$192 million, including US$157.6 million
equivalent in foreign exchange. The Bank committed US$115.0 million to
cover part of the foreign exchange cost with the Government providing
the balance US$42.6 million foreign exchange and all local currency
financing, including woridng capital.
10.       The design and process for PUSRI III are similar to those of
PUSRI II, with the same foreign firms that helped develop PUSRI II being
involved in PUSRI III as well (see para. 7).

ANNEX 3
INDONESIA: PUSRI IV FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
Overview
1.        Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago of more than 13,000
islands of which about 3,000 are inhabited. With a total area of approxi-
mately 2 million km2, it ranks thirteenth in the world; with a population
of about 131 million, fifth. The population is growing rapidly at 2.4% a
year. The growth rate is expected to decline to slightly less than 2.3%
over the next ten years, with the population reaching 147 million in 1980
and 165 million in 1985.
2.        Traditionally favorable natural conditions for agriculture have
caused a high density in cultivation and in population in Java, Madura
and Bali (the Inner Islands). These islands now contain nearly two-thirds
of Indonesia's population on about 7% of the land area (Table 1). Popula-
tion density in the Inner Islands has reached there a high 565 person per
km2, which is more than in Bangladesh, in the Mekong Delta or the Central
Plain of Thailand. However, Indonesia still has substantial additional
areas suitable for sustained agricultural production in the Outer Islands.
While about 20 million ha are currently cultivated an area of comparable
size has good potential for agricultural development although with much
lower average fertility.
3.        During the first Five-Year Plan (Pelita I), which ended March 31,
1974, Indonesia's real annual economic growth was close to 7%. A rate of
7.5% is expected during Pelita II (1974-79), and should be maintained
beyond 1979 as well.
4.        Apart from its agricultural resources, Indonesia has forest
resources which are the largest in Asia, and also rich mineral resources,
especially oil and gas. Oil production has expanded rapidly since 1968 to
1.4 million barrels per day in 1974 making Indonesia the eighth largest
oil exporting nation in the world. In addition, a number of large natural
gas finds has been made. Both gas and oil production provide a base, not
only for sizeable exports of crude and refined oil products and of liquified
natural gas, but also for the development of a substantial chemical industry.
5.        Agriculture, which grew at nearly 4% per annum during Pelita I,
accounts for some 50% of GNP, about 60% of employment and for almost all
non-petroleum exports. The six major foodcrops are: rice, corn, soyabeans,
groundnuts, cassava and sweet potatoes. They provide 85% of the total
calorie and 80% of the total protein intake of the population. Among the
estate crops grown are rubber, oilpalm, sugarcane, tea, coffee, tobacco and
coconuts. Rice, the staple food, accounts for more than 40% of harvested

area, one-third of total agricultural production by value, and 12% of GNP.
Over the First Plan period, the Government had concentrated its efforts
on expanding the production of rice, the severe impact of the end-1972
shortage reinforcing its sense of urgency. These efforts, which included
rehabilitating and extending irrigation systems, introducing improved rice
varieties and promoting the use of fertilizers and pesticides have had a
considerable success: rice production rose significantly from 10.8 million
tons in 1968 (100 kg per capita) to 13.4 million tons in 1973 (107 kg per
capita. Despite this increase in rice production, Indonesia has been import-
ing annually 0.5 to 1.5 million tons of rice in recent years. Also, the
clear success in rice has been partly offset by a related decline or stag-
nation in the production of some secondary crops.
Harvested and Fertilized Areas
6.        Total harvested area for all crops increased from 16.2 million  ha
in 1958 to 20.0 million in 1973, at an average of 250,000 ha a year. It is
estimated to increase to 20.2 million ha in 1975, or 10% of Indonesia's
total area. In 1973, 14.6 million ha were under foodcrops (73%) and the
rest under estate crops. Rice alone with approximately 8.3 million ha of
harvested area accounted for about 42% of the total harvested area in the
country. Corn came next with 3.3 million ha (17%) and rubber third with
2.2 million ha (11%).
7.        Java accounts for the largest harvested area among all islands in
Indonesia with Sumatera next, as shown in the following table:
Harvested Area by Island, 1972 (%)
Java                         49.3
Sumatera                     27.9
Sulawesi                       7.8
Kalimantan                     7.5
Other Islands                  7.5
Total Indonesia           100.0
Thus, Java and Sumatera accounted for slightly more than 77% for the total
harvested area. 59.9% of the area under foodcrops was in Java (Sumatera
18.1%), while Sumatera was the largest estate crops grower with 50.4% of
the area under such crops (Java, 25.0%).
8.        The total fertilized area in Indonesia increased at an average of
14.4% a year from about 4.8 million ha in 1972, or 27% of the harvested area,
to an estimated 7.2 million ha in 1975, or 36% of the harvested area. Accord-
ing to 1975 estimates, rice alone represented about 72.5% of the total fer-
tilized area, with about 5.2 million ha, the other foodcrops representing
12.9% (corn 7.9%). Thus, the use of fertilizers is concentrated on food-
crops, especially rice; this situation is expected to continue in the future
as well. With a fertilized area of 1.1 million ha, the estate crops accounted
for 14.6% of the tntal, with rubber coming first (7.5%).



ANNEX 3

9.        Java and Sumatera contained 93.9% of total fertilized area; the
rest of the islands had limited fertilized area:
Fertilized Area by Islands, 1972 (%)
Java                         74.7
Sumatera                     19.2
Sulawesi                      2.7
Kalimantan                    1.3
Other Islands                 2.1
Total Indonesia          100.0
10.       In Java more than 40% of the harvested area is being fertilized,
in Sumatera about 20% while in the other islands it is less than 2%. The
average for Indonesia is about 36%.
Fertilizer Consumption Per Hectare
11.       The following table shows the trend of per hectare fertilizer
consumption:
Fertilizer Consumption Per Hectare of Arable Land (kg)
N         P205        K20
1959/60          2.6         0.5        0.4
1971/72         10.9         1.3        0.3
1972/73         19.2         3.7        1.7
12.       The per hectare consumption of N and P205 has increased signific-
antly since 1959/60. Indonesia's volcanic ground has in the past reduced
the need for K20 consumption which has remained at a low level. Few trials,
however, have shown the benefits of an improved balance fertilization via an
increased use of K20, especially for estate crops. Comparison of fertilizer
consumption per hectare of arable land in 1972/73 among selected countries
is provided in Table 2: it shows that the consumption per hectare of arable
land is still low in Indonesia in spite of significant increases in recent
years.
Fertilizer Consumption
13.       During 1964-68, N consumption in Indonesia declined (Table 3) from
108,200 tons to 101,200 tons mainly because of the scarcity of foreign ex-
change to import fertilizers. During that same period, however, P205 and
and K20 consumption increased, but starting from a low base. The table below
shows the trend of fertilizer consumption during 1964-1975:

1964-1974      11.1     15.5    16.9
14.       As shown above, increase in fertilizer consumption has been parti-
cularly significant since 1968, with the increased emphasis on high-yield
varieties for rice and agricultural development. During 1968-1974, N con-
sumption grew at an average annual rate of 20.5%, P 0 consumption expanding
at a rate of 22.5% a year and K20 consumption at a Mate of 15.1%.  The
N: P 0 : K 0 ratio remained fairly stable during the 1968-1974 period (Table
4), although reflecting at times relatively heavier concentration on N con-
sumption.
15.       Consumption of Nitrogen fertilizers decreased in 1974:  because
of the strict control imposed upon the entire fertilizer distribution system
(para 55) and its not yet well-shaped administrative requirements, many
INMAS farmers had to reduce their purchase of fertilizers that year or
decide to do without it; also that year, a sizeable proportion of BIMAS
farmers who were in arrears over 2 years excluded from the BIMAS program
that had assisted them financially in the purchase of fertilizers.
16.       In 1974, the share of the foodcrop sector in fertilizer consumption
was 96.8% for N consumption and 89.6% for P 20  consumption, with the estate
sector using the rest (Table 5).  In the case of K20, the estates were the
main consumer with 82.8% total consumption in 1974. The following table
shows the respective share of the foodcrop sectors in the total consumption
of the different nutrients during 1968-1974:

17.       In 1968, limited imports of fertilizers severely curtailed the
supply to the estate sector. A more balance distribution between the food-
crop and estate crop sectors followed, until 1974 when the Govelrnment control
on the fertilizer allocation put clear emphasis on the foodcrop'sector: the
share of the estate sector in N and P 205 fertilizers consumption decreased
dramatically to their lowest levels.
Fertilizer Consumption by Crops
18.       Of the total N consumption of 0.31 million tons in 1972, nearly
0.21 million tons, or 67%, were used on rice. Further, rice accounted for
about 58% of the total P 0 consumption, but there was no use of K 0 for
that crop.  It is estimaUeJ that in 1975 rice accounted for 79.8 %2 of N con-
sumption and for 48.2% of P 0 consumption. Excluding rice, major N con-
sumers in 1975 were vegetabies (estimated 5.8%), corn (4.6%), rubber (3.5%),
sugarcane (2.7%), these and rice accounting for 96.4% for the total N con-
sumption. The major P 0 consumers in order of importance were rubber (18.9%),
corn (7.6%), oilpalm (M%), and vegetables (4.5%), these four representing
91.4% of total P 205 consumption.  In the case of K20, apart from rice, the
non-users were corn, groundnuts, soyabeans, and cloves. Some major K 0 users
were rubber (46.3%), oilpalm (30.5%), tea (8.2%), and sugarcane (6.5%), these
four accounting for 91.5% of total K2 0 consumption.

Fertilizer Consumption by Regions
19.       In 1972, for which actual data are available about 242,120 N
nutrient tons, or 79.3% of the total N consumption, were used in Java.
That year, Java used 38,257 tons of P 205 (72% of total consumption) and
3,958 tons of K20 (31.5% of total consumption). It is estimated that in
1975 the N consumption in Java was 271,700 N nutrient tons or 71.5% of total
consumption, thus showing a relative decline in the importance of Java in
fertilizer consumption (Table 11). Apart from Java, a major fertilizer con-
suming regions are Sumatera and Sulawesi as shown below:

20.       The above table shows that while Java is by far the leading user
of N and P 0 fertilizers, Sumatera is the prominent user of K 0 fertilizer:
As the lea&ing producer of rubber and oilpalm, it uses the larger quantity of
K20 for them, essentially on the northern part of the island.

Fertilizer Production
21.       Indonesia had no local facility for fertilizer production until
1964 when PUSRI I went into commercial production with an annual production
capacity of 100,000 tons. The first year of operation, PUSRI I achieved
more than 100% capacity utilization. During 1964-1971, PUSRI I was the only
domestic fertilizer production unit in the country. In August 1972, Indo-
nesia's second fertilizer plant, P.N. Petrokimia Plan at Gresik, East Java,
went on stream. Petrokimia had a 58,000 TPY capacity ammonia unit feeding
two downstream units -- a 45,000 TPY urea unit and a 150,000 TPY ammonium
sulphate unit. The Petrokimia plant has the flexibility to change the
quantity of its main products -- urea and ammonium sulphate -- according to
the fertilizer market situation. However, it has been facing problems in
achieving high capacity utilization. Indonesia's third fertilizer plant,
PUSRI II, went into production in September 1974 with an annual capacity
to produce 380,000 TPY of urea. The country has so far no production
capacity for P 205 fertilizers. As for K 0 fertilizer, the country has no
known local reserves of potash. The following table shows the trend of
local fertilizer production during 1964-1975:

Imports of Fertilizer
22.       In terms of nutrients, N imports increased during 1964-1974, at
an average rate of 32.3% a year to 422,300 tons in 1974 and an estimated of
672,100 tons in 1975 (Table 6).  During the same period, P 05 imports rose
at 22.5% a year to 179,300 tons in 1974 and an estimated 291,900 tons in
1975, and K 20 imports increased at an average of 14.9% a year to 31,800 tons
in 1974 and an estimated 31,100 tons in 1975. The following table shows the
trend of imports during 1964-1975:

1975 (est.)  672.1      281.9      31.1
23.       Among fertilizer materials imported, urea is the most important
followed by Triple Superphosphate (TSP), and Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)
as shown below:

24.       During the critical time of world short supply of fertilizers,
Indonesia had sharply increased its imports of fertilizers and intensified
its stockpiling program. This program aimed at securing adequate supply
of fertilizers to the farmers against possible further shortages. The
situation has developed as follows:
(thousand product tons)
Stock as of:         Urea       TSP/DAP       Total
December 31, 1974        500.9       163.9         664.8
March 31, 1975            731.9      311.9       1,043.8
June 30, 1975          1,372.3       451.6       1,823.9
November 15, 1975      1,627.6       702.9       2,330.5
December 31, 1975      1,604.3       693.1       2,297.4
25.       As of April 1975, the Government had stopped issuing new import
licenses.  The stockpile reached its peak in mid-November 1975 and declined
slightly in the following month. At the end of 1975, the country's stocks
were equivalent to twice the 1975 level of consumption.

Forecast of Production
26.       Indonesia has firm plans to establish three N fertilizer plants:
PUSRI IV, The East Kalimantan Plant I, near Balikpapan and the West Java
Plant at Cikampek. Further, under preliminary stages of consideration are
two more plants: The North Sumatera Plant at Aceh; and the East Kalimantan
Plant II. The following table shows the main units, capacities and Bank
estimates of the expected commissioning dates for the plants most likely
to be built before 1983:
New Plants by 1983
Ammonia             Urea
Unit Capacity    Unit Capacity    Commissioning
(TPD)              (TPD)            Dates
PUSRI IV                 1,000              1,725        Feb. 15, 1978
West Java                1,000               1,725       July  1, 1979
East Kalimantan I        1,500              1,725        July  1, 1980
27.       All of the above plants are expected to produce urea and have
identical urea capacity. The ammonia unit of East Kalimantan I, however,
would be larger than the comparable units for the other two plants. The
surplus ammonia capacity of East Kalimantan I would be either used to
provide industrial ammonia for the proposed petrochemical plant in Surabaya
or exported to the Philippines. One of the unique features of East Kali-
mantan I is that it would be preassembled in Europe on three ships to be
installed ashore near Balikpapan by dredging the area near the shore.
28.       As for the local production of P205 fertilizers, Indonesia has
plans to build new units as part of the Petrokimia complex at Gresik, East
Java. The new plants are expected to go into production on January 1, 1979
and include a TSP unit with an annual capacity of 330,000 product tons, a
DAP unit with an annual capacity of 80,000 product tons, an NPK unit with
an annual capacity of 50,000 product tons. In addition, another project
currently under consideration by PUSRI is to transform the PUSRI I unit
around 1978 when the urea unit will be shut down. The ammonia unit would
be kept in service and a DAP producing unit installed next to it with a
capacity of 370,000 tons per year. However, it is not clear yet whether
this project will mature.
29.       Assuming that all new plants will be commissioned according to
Bank's expectation, the local production of fertilizers would increase
(Table 7) as follows:

Forecast of Demand
30.       Forecasts of fertilizer demand for Indonesia have been made in
several studies: (1) the National Fertilizer Study (NFS), by Agrar und
Hydrotechnik GmbH, of the Federal Republic of Germany, published in 1972;
(2) the Feasibility Study for the West Java Fertilizer Plant by the Bureau
d'Etudes Industrielles et de Cooperation de l'Institut Francais du Petrole
(BEICIP), published in 1973/74; (3) two draft reports prepared by the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the US Agency for International Devel-
opment (AID): "The Likely Impact of Middle East Oil Policies on the Devel-
of the Nitrogen Industry of East and Southeast Asia", January 1974, and
"The Proposal for the Development of the Nitrogen Production Capacity in
Indonesia," July 1974. Further, the Second Five-Year Plan (Pelita II,
1974-1979) also contains a demand forecast for N fertilizers.
:31.      In its appraisal report of the PUSRI III project, dated February
1975, the Bank made projection for fertilizers consumption of up 1983,
based on the BEICIP study and on a Bank draft report, "The Irrigation
Program Survey for Indonesia." The following table compares the Bank
forecast for PUSRI III and the Pelita II projections:

/a   extrapolated.
32.       No new study of the fertilizer market in Indonesia has been under-
taken since the Bank report on PUSRI III. The official reference to future
demand is still the Pelita II forecast. But in 1974, the Pelita targets
were 80% too optimistic, and are estimated to be 50% too high in 1975. How-
ever, the new situation that has developed in recent months, namely the
large amount of fertilizer that has been stockpiled, should help a boost in
the use of fertilizers in the future: there is now about two-year consump-
tion stock of fertilizers at hand in Indonesia. In addition, the coming
on stream of the new units will by 1980 lift most constraints on the use of
urea that has existed in the past. This should form a sound base for en-
couraging increased use of fertilizers, mainly by expanding the fertilized
areas, strengthening the farmers' credit program (paras 53-54), maintaining
an attractive ratio between the prices of fertilizer and of agricultural
products 1/ and increasing the recommended dosages towards an economic
optimum.
1/   In October 1975, the Government of Indonesia increased the prices of
fertilizer, paddy and rice as follows:

33.       The projections for this report are an update of the PUSRI III
report. Rice, which accounts for the bulk of the fertilizer consumption
has been studied separately, and the assumptions are basicaly the same
as in the PUSRI III report except for dosages that have been slightly
increased. For all other crops, a realistic set of BEICIP assumptions
has been used for both fertilized areas and dosages. 1/ Details of fertil-
izer demand forecast by crop are presented in Tables 8 to 10. The major
assumptions used to build those tables are outlined in the following para-
graphs.
A.   Rice
34.       Indonesia receives annual rainfall in the range of 1,500 to
2,000 mm in the main rice growing zones. While this is normally enough to
grow a wet season crop, rain distribution is uneven and rainfed crops are
often subject to drought or floods. Dry season cropping is not possible
without irrigation. Rice production is concentrated on the fertile volcanic
and alluvial soils of Java and Bali, which account for about 60% of the
cropped area. The other major rice growing regions are Sumatera, Kaliman-
tan, and Sulawesi. Rice is currently grown on an estimated net area of
8.4 million ha divided as follows:

35.       About 60% of the net cultivated area is irrigated.  About two-
thirds of this area is in Java and Madura. Irrigated rice accounted for
about 80% of total rice production of 13.4 million tons in 1973. Net culti-
vated area increased at an average of 1% a year during 1968-1973.
1/   The BEICIP study projected fertilized areas and dosages for the years
1978 and 1983. For the purpose of this forecast, assumptions for 1980
and 1985 were inter- and extrapolated from the BEICIP data.



ANNEX 3
Page 13
36.       According to Bank projections, the net rice cultivated area would
increase from 8.4 million ha in 1973 to 9.2 million ha in 1980, and 10.0
million ha in 1985. This represents an annual average rate of 1.6%. During
the same period, rice production is expected to increase at an average annual
rate of 3.2%, reaching 17.6 million tons in 1980 and 19.5 million tons in
1985 (120 kg per capita). The incremental area under rice will come mainly
from the completion of the irrigation developments now on the way; there
remain about 800,000 ha of the existing irrigation systems to be rehabilita-
ted; some 240,000 ha of new conventional irrigation projects have been
prepared and include the expansion of technical irrigation into upland crop
and virgin land. In addition, a program for "simple irrigation projects",
involving the upgrading and extension of village systems by simple means,
is ready to be carried out.  Other possibilities, including groundwater and
tidal irrigation, are under study.  Also, the increased usage of fertilizer
and of high yield varieties will imply higher intensity of cultivation, and
increase in the net cropped area.
37.       The fertilized area under rice would increase from 4.1 million
ha in 1973 to 7.8 million ha in 1985, at an average annual rate of 5.5%. The
fertilization intensity will then increase from 49% in 1973 to 78% in 1985.
The high yielding varieties will spread to 6.8 million ha of irrigated rain-
fed rice by 1985 compared to 2.3 million ha in 1973, mainly because (a) on
already existing irrigated and rainfed area, there will be a shift from
non-intensification or non-high yield variety use to high yield variety use,
and (b) most of irrigated areas will be under high yield varieties. The
table below summarizes that trend during the period 1973-1985:
Fertilizer Areas under Rice, 1973-1985

38.       It is assumed that the per hectare N consumption in the high yield
variety areas will gradually increase to 100 kg per ha in 1980 and 105 kg per

Page 14
ha in 1985, compared to about 80 kg per ha in the past few years.l/ For the
areas under local varieties, the per hectare N consumption would rise from
about 40 kg per ha to 50 kg per ha in 1980 and 52 kg per ha in 1985. On the
small portion of the upland area which will be fertilized, the average N
consumption per ha would be about 50 kg per ha by 1980 and 52 kg per ha by
1985. It is further assumed that the N: P205 :K20 ratio will change from
1:0.15:0 in 1972 to 1:0.20:0.17 in 1980 and to 1:0.35:0.26 in 1985.  The
following table shows the projected fertilizer consumption by rice based on
the above assumption.

B.   Other Crops
39.       The production of Palawija (secondary) crops apparently declined,
overall, in the period 1968-73, partly because of the Government-encouraged
shift of land use to rice. Yet, these crops deserve an important place in
Indonesia's agricultural economy. There are many areas where irrigation is
1/   In its study "Progress and Implementation of Marketing Plan for PUSRI",
Agrar und Hydrotechnik GmbH has tried to determine a urea response curve
for HYV rice in Indonesia. The results are that for an average season,
the highest yield (agronomic optimum) would propose 300-325 kg of urea
for hectare (138-150 kg of N per hectare). The economic optimum would
suggest 250-275 kg of urea per hectare (115-127 kg of N per hectare).
The recommended dosage is lower (200-230 kg of urea per hectare, or
92-106 kg of N per hectare) because, near the economic optimum, the
marginal bag of urea gives the farmer in return a small marginal net
yield increase that only covers the cost of that last bag under average
conditions. A lower dosage is also a protection against bad season.

not feasible, or is insufficient in amount to support perennial rice
cropping, and less water demanding crops could advantageously fill the
gap. In addition some of them have significant nutritional value. The
Government is progressingly extending its efforts to these crops (para
54) and is instituting a program of research designed to provide better
technical inputs. The following table summarizes the results of the
calculations detailed in Tables 9 and 10:

40.       Palm oil, rubber, and tea are being rapidly expanded on the basis
of improved technology. Further growth will stem from upgrading of small-
holder production through programs for transmigration, extension and market-
ing program, and from nucleus estate smallholders corporation. In addition,
the Government'.s easing of the supply of fertilizers to the estates should
make it possible for them to apply near optimum dosages. A summary of
Tables 9 and 10 is given below:

42.       Consumption of Nitrogen fertilizer will increase over the next ten
years at a decreasing rate:  this reflects the fact that, overall, the
"easiest" areas, e.g. irrigated or rainfed, will first be fertilized.  Once



ANNEX 3

saturation is reached there, fertilizer application in the less favored
areas, e.g. swamps or uplands, will occur at a slower pace. Yearly fer-
tilizer requirements for the period 1974-1985 are shown below:

1985               981.5    418.4      343.3
43.       The N: P 0  : K 0 ratio will shift toward a better fertilization
from an estimated 3.4:1:0?3 in 1975 to 3.6:1:0.9 in 1980 and 2.3:1:0.8 in
1985. The share of the foodcrop sector for all nutrients will decline from
an estimated 90.5% in 1975 to 82.1% in 1980 and 82.3% in 1985, with the
estate having the rest.
Trade in Fertilizers
44.       As already noted, Indonesia has no known reserves of K20.  There-
fore, it is assumed that the country would meet all its requirements of K20
from imports. In the case of phosphates, Indonesia has planned as mentioned
earlier to implement a total P 205 capacity of about 200,000 tons a year by
the end of the decade. Therefore, the country would still be dependent on
imports to meet its phosphate needs. In the case of N fertilizers, however,
Indonesia is projected to emerge as an exporter from 1979 onwards as shown
below, and displayed on Graph 1:

45.       In studying the export possibilities for N fertilizers, it is
assumed that Indonesia has a relative advantage compared to Japan and the
Republic of Korea -- its major Asian competitors for N fertilizers exports
-- in meeting the import needs of neighboring countries such as Malaysia,
the Philippines, Thailand and    Viet Nam, because of Indonesia's large
resources of low-cost feedstocks for N production combined with modern pro-
duction facilities and freight advantage. As for potential competition
from the Middle Eastern countries, it is assumed that those countries would
be better off by concentrating on meeting the import needs of countries
other than Indonesia's neighbors. For example, the present transport cost
per ton of fertilizer to Manila from Jakarta is about US$10 less than from
the Persian Gulf countries.
46.       Tables 12 and 13 show the. TVA projections of production and demand
of N fertilizers in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the former Republic
of Vietnam, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. The production and
demand projections for Indonesia are already given. Based on the data from
these tables, it is forecast for the surplus deficit of N fertilizers in
those countries will be as follows:

1975 (est.)      1980      1985

47.       The above table shows that Indonesia and its four immediate
neighbors will be in deficit of N fertilizers over the next ten years by
400-650,000 tons annually. Indonesia's surplus will represent about 25%
the total deficit of its four neighbors. Its comparative advantage mentioned
before plus an active market policy should enable Indonesia to capture that
market. As for the East Asian region as a whole, Japan, Korea and Taiwan
will largely fill out the remaining deficit. However, what Japan's pro-
duction will be is not clear: because it is not expected to build new
plants and its existing plants are reaching old age, its production may
well decline. At the same time, China, which now accounts for as much as 65%
of Japan's fertilizer exports, has plans to build several fertilizer producing
units: It is expected that the Japanese N fertilizer production will adapt
to the market situation in China and in South East Asia.
Fertilizer Distribution
48.       Fertilizer marketing in Indonesia is carried out by Government
approved importers/distributors including local producers like PUSRI and
Petrokimia. Until 1970, P.N. Pertani was leading distributor of both local
and imported fertilizers. However, in recent years, the Government has been
encouraging local producers to market their products as well as imported
fertilizers, while allowing P.N.. Pertani and other established importers/
distributors to continue their operation.  The share of N and P 205 fertil-
izers sales by PUSRI's Marketing Division has increased significantly over
the past few years, while PUSRI's marketing of K 20 fertilizers remained
marginal, as shown in the table below:

49.       The Government controls not only fertilizer distribution but also
fertilizer prices. The main purpose of the price control is to subsidize
fertilizer sales to farmers and keep foodgrain prices low in a bid to check
inflation which has been a serious problem in Indonesia. The retail price of
urea - both local and imported -- is fixed at Rp 80,000 (US$193) per product

Page 20
ton for the BIMAS users and Rp 120,000 (US$289) per product ton for the
others while the current import price of urea -- the most popular fertil-
izer used in the country is about US$120-170 per product ton. For the
retail fertilizer price, 8% is the margin of sub-distributors and retailers
and 22% is the margin for imported distributors. The Government purchases
all the local production of urea at a fixed price before allocating it
for distribution. This price was very low in the past, making it difficult
for local producers to earn a reasonable return on investment. However, the
Government has increased its purchase price by stages from Rp 28,200 (US$68)
per product ton in 1972 to Rp 63,900 (US$154) in 1975. The purchase price
is fixed on the basis of c.i.f. Java. Therefore, the producers have to bear
the cost in transporting their product to port go-downs in Java the leading
fertilizer consuming area.
Credit
50.       Over 60% of the fertilizer is consumed in Indonesia in areas
covered by two programs for promoting intensive cultivation, especially for
rice: the BIMAS (Mass Guidance) program and the INMAS (Mass Intensification)
program. Under the BIMAS program, farmers having less than 5 ha of land
are provided with short-term credits at 1% interest a month in the form of
a package subsidized inputs supplemented with extension services to promote
the proper use of these inputs. The INMAS program in practice represents
the ordinary agricultural extension program for the distribution of subsi-
dized inputs to farmers who are either ineligible for the BDMAS program
(either because they have progressed efficiently as BIMAS farmers, or be-
cause they have more than 5 ha of land) or who do not want to make it as a
BIMAS credit because of the associated red-tape and control. In 1974, INMAS
participants were obliged to go through the same procedures as the BIMAS
farmers, as part of the Government's further control for N fertilizer dis-
tribution, but were charged a higher rate interest -- currently 1.5% a month
-- than the BIMAS farmers.
51.       The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is now the sole credit agency with
full responsibility for financing the BIMAS program. Since the program
started on a trial basis, with fully irrigated rice, in 1969-70, certain
crops and rainfed rice have been added as eligible activities for BIMAS
financing. The growth of the BIMAS program is documented in Tables 14 and
15. BRI processes loan applications in offices set up in each village unit.
Village unit without the BRI offices are covered by mobile units. Farmers
participating in BIMAS and INMAS programs have to receive vouchers for
inputs from BRI officers and draw supplies against them in village "kiosks"
operated by private retailers and the village unit cooperatives (BUUDs and
KUDs). It is the Government's policy to promote the BUUDs and the KUDs
as the main source of supply inputs for BDMAS and INMAS farmers. There
has been a lack of trained personnel to organize the operation and the
BUUDs and KUDs require considerable strength before they could become
efficient suppliers.

52.       The table below shows the BIMAS program realization for rice over
the past five years and the targets for the next four years:

53.       The ambitious credit target set by the Government of Indonesia for
1979 is is US$345 million for rice alone, and covers a total area of 8.1 mil-
lion ha. This gives a measure of the emphasis the Government currently
places on the program and of the considerable resources which it is prepared
to make available for its implementation. In recent years, new crops have
been added; their importance, though still marginal compared with the rice
program, is increasing rapidly:

Total         19.2   259.3   342.1   143.7   3,328.3   7,071.5
The rate of growth of the BIMAS program in the future will depend on the
availability of fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides, and the avail-
ability of extension personnel and the speed with which BRI succeeds in form-
ing the village units. The number of village units was 538 in 1970, and
2,585 in 1975; it is expected to reach 5,000 by 1980. Also the total BRI
staff of village units which was 7,722 in 1975 is anticipated to reach
20,000 by 1980.



ANNEX 3
Page 22
54.       In addition to the BIMAS program, the BRI is responsible for INMAS
program for foodcrops, which is a scheme for the distribution of subsidized
inputs to farmers who either cannot, or do not wish, to borrow under the
BIMAS program. As the BLMAS farmers, the INMAS farmers must go to the BRI
village or mobile units to obtain the vouchers with which to acquire subsi-
dized inputs from distributors; most farmers pay cash for these vouchers
while some others borrow from the BRI at 1.5% a month for this purpose.
However, the total volume of loan made to BIMAS participants remains low,
because strict controls have been imposed on this program since October
1973 to stop the black marketing which had been going on.
55.       The BRI's involvement in financing fertilizers goes beyond the
financing of farmers purchases of fertilizers. First, all imports of ferti-
lizers for the BDMAS and INMAS programs must be financed by BRI. The import-
ers must take a 10% down payment and then can obtain BRI financing for 90%
of the amount of the letter of credit. Second, when the fertilizers are
received, most of the BRI import loans are transformed into a fertilizer
inventory support loan. However, the fertilizer distributor must then in-
crease its equity to 30% as the maximum credit available from BRI is 70%
of the value of the fertilizer stocks.
PUSRI Marketing
56.       Initially, PUSRI was marketing most of its products through P.N.
Pertani.  For example, in 1964, the first year of operation, PUSRI marketed
about 90% of its production through Pertani and sold the rest through its
marketing organization. The percentage of production sold through Pertani
declined gradually during 1964-1970, with PUSRI assuming the entire responsi-
bility for marketing its own products in 1970, and at the same time, becoming
the most important distributor and importer of fertilizers. It is not ex-
pected that upon completion of PUSRI IV, PUSRI's marketing efforts should
be substantially modified.
57.       In 1974, PUSRI's marketing of imported fertilizers was nearly
three times greater than its production. In 1975, however, as PUSRI urea
production was gaining momentum, imported fertilizers market that year by
PUSRI was down to 70% of its own production. But at the same time, PUSRI
imported large amount of fertilizers, as part of the stockpiling program
of the Government. As already noted, the Government allows a margin of 22%
to PUSRI for serving as an importer/distributor. This margin is inadequate
under the current system of credit sales because it takes about 10 months for
PUSRI to realize its receivables. Meanwhile, PUSRI has borrowed short-term
funds from banks at an interest of 1 to 2% a month. As a result, PUSRI's
marketing operation used to be carried at a financial loss to the company.
However, the Government has undertaken since 1974 to make up PUSRI's marketing
losses through cash advances as long as the existing distribution control
system continues.



ANNEX 3
Page 23
58.       About 80% of PUSRI's own production was sold to Java in 1975.
This percentage is expected to decline as the volume of production by PUSRI
increases and as it increases it sales to other islands of Indonesia, espe-
cially Sumatera and Sulawesi. In 1980, it is estimated that only 38% of
PUSRI's production will be distributed in Java.

ANNEX 4-2
INDONESIA: PUSRI IV FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
PRODUCTION PROCESS AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Production Process
1.        The rated capacity of the plant will be 1,725 TPD of urea, i.e.,
570,000 TPY assuming 330 days of operation in a year. Actual output, if
a 90% capacity utilization is maintained, will be about 510,000 TPY. The
intermediate ammonia production facilities are sized on the basis that all
ammonia produced will be converted to urea.  The ammonia unit will have a
1,000 TPD rated capacity (330,000 TPY).
2.        Gas from PERTAMINA and STANVAC fields will be used for both process
and fuel and will be supplied to the plant at a minimum pressure of 400 psig
as required for direct steam reforming without further pressure boosting.
It will be the responsibility of PERTAMINA to supply and install the
necessary gas pipeline up to the works from the existing high pressure
transmission line.
Average composition of the gas is expected to be as below:
Methane                       72.6% vol.
Ethane                         6.0% vol.
Propane                        5.5 vol.
Butane and Higher              4.4% vol.
Carbon Dioxide                10.8% vol.
Nitrogen                       0.7% vol.
Gross Calorific Value    1150 BTU/SCF
The gas is almost sulphur free. The total sulphur content of the gas is
expected to be lower than 8 parts per million (ppm). Liquified hydrocarbons
will be removed in the fields so that the inlet gas will be practically free
of entrained liquids. Provisions have been made to install a liquid separator
at the plant inlet battery limits. Details of the gas requirements and reserves
in South Sumatera are given in Annex 4-5.
3.        Synthesis gas for ammonia production is produced from the feed gas
in a series of steps beginning with a primary reforming with steam. Here,
desulfurized gas is combined with superheated steam in an amount approximately
equal to a 3 to 1 steam/carbon ratio. The combined steam at a pressure of
approximately 500-550 psig is then preheated to about 950 degrees F and passed
through catalyst-filled 25/20 chrome-nickel alloy tubes suspended in the
radiant section of the reformer. In passing through the tubes, the hydrocarbon
components, mostly methane, are partly converted to carbon oxides and hydrogen
and exit at a temperature normally in excess of 1,500 degrees F. The partially
reformed gas then flows to a secondary reformer where it is mixed with pre-
heated air in a quantity necessary to reform the uncoverted hydrocarbons and
at the same time provide the required amount of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis.
Air required for the secondary reforming step is supplied from a centrifugal
steam-turbine-driven compressor.



ANNEX 4-2
Page 2
4.        Reformed gas from the secondary reformer now containing less than
about 0.)% methane is cooled in waste heat boilers down to about 700 degrees
F prior to introduction to the high temperature shift converter where part
of the carbon monoxide content of the gas is converted to carbon dioxide
by reaction with steam with an equivalent production of hydrogen. To
complete this conversion of carbon monoxide, the gas after cooling flows
through a bed of zinc oxide for removal of trace amounts of sulfur and then
into a second stage low temperature shift converter where the carbon monoxide
content of the gas is reduced to less than 0.5 percent.
5.-       The raw synthesis gas now contains essentially hydrogen, nitrogen,
carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and goes
through a series of purification steps to provide an ammonia synthesis gas
with a hydrogen to nitrogen ratio of 3 to 1. In the first step, carbon
dioxide is removed from the gas by scrubbing with activated potassium
carbonate solution. Then, the remaining carbon oxides are removed by con-
version to methane by reaction with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel
ba-se catalyst. The final synthesis gas then contains in addition to nitrogen
and hydrogen, less than about 10 ppm of carbon oxides, the maximum which can
be tolerated by the ammonia synthesis catalyst, and small amouLts of methane
whILich are harmless and are continually purged from the ammonia synthesis
system.
6.        The carbon dioxide absorbed by the potassium carbonate solution is
removed from the solution by heating the rich absorbent in a stripping tower.
The recovered carbon dioxide is subsequently reacted with ammonia to form
urea. The composition of the natural gas is such that the quantity of carbon
dioxide produced in the gas reforming process described is sufficient for
urea production.
7.        In the synthesis of ammonia the nitrogen-hydrogen mixture is
compressed to a pressure of about 2100 psig by a steam turbine driven
centrifugal compressor, with recycle gas containing approximately 11 percent
ammonia being admitted to an interstage wheel. The compressed discharge gas
after water cooling is then refrigerated and the condensed ammonia is removed
in a liquid separator. Then the gas which now contains only about 2 percent
ammonia is reheated by heat exchange and passed to the ammonia converter.
This vessel is of special design and contains an activated iron base catalyst
to promote the synthesis reaction and special provision for removal of the
reaction heat developed so as to maintain optimum reaction temperature. The
converter effluent gas is cooled from the reaction temperature of about 900
degree F by heat exchange with incoming converter feed gas and preheating
boiler feed water before recycling to the synthesis gas compressor as
described above.
8.        Iiquid ammonia produced in the process is transferred directly to
the urea unit for production of urea or transferred to storage.
9.        In the production of urea, ammonia and carbon dioxide are reacted
at pressure of about 3,000 psig and at a temperature of about 360 degrees F
to produce ammonium carbamate, an intermediate product which is subsequently



ANNEX 4-2
Page 3
dehydrated to form urea. An excess of ammonia is used for the reaction and
the dehydration reaction does not proceed to completion. Therefore, the
reaction products are urea, ammonium carbamate, free ammonia and water
formed during the dehydration reaction. The reaction products flow from the
urea reactor to first and second stage decomposers where the pressure is
reduced and heat is applied to convert the ammonium carbamate back to
ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia and carbon dioxide are then
redissolved by countercurrent absorption and recycled back to the reactor
as carbamate solution. The excess awmonia is condensed and returned to the
reactor with fresh ammonia feed. The final urea solution is concentrated
by evaporation of the water under vacuum conditions where crystalization of
the urea occurs. The wet crystals are centrifuged to remove most of the
water, dried by contact with hot air and transported pneumatically to the
top of the prill tower. There, the dry crystals are heated to the molten
state and sprayed downward through the tower where the prills are formed.
The prills collect on a fluidizer cooler at the bottom of the tower where
they overflow to a vibrating screen to remove oversize material. The urea
product leaving the screen is transported to the bulk storage building or
to the bagging station. The urea product will contain less than 0.5 percent
biuret.
Plant Facilities
10.       PUSRI IV will be built adjacent to PUSRI II and PUSRI III, partly
on land already prepared for PUSRI III and partly on land recently purchased
for PUSRI IV. This additional land requires sand filling and piling. The
main parts of the project are: (1) a natural gas pretreatment section for
the removal of heavy hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and sulfur compounds from
the feed gas; (2) a 1,000 TPD ammonia plant; (3) a 1,725 TPD urea plant;
(4) an ammonia storage tank; (5) cooling towers for recirculating plant
cooling water; (6) water treating facilities designed to produce high-purity
demineralized water; (7) a gas turbine generator designed to produce 15 MW
of poIwer, with facilities for heat recovery for steam generation; (8) a bag-
making plant with a capacity to produce 15 million bags a year; and (9)
expansion of the existing jetty to facilitate loading of PUSRI IV products.
Pollution Control
11.       Special attention will be given during design and specifications
for the facilities to minimize the emission and/or discharge of noxious waste
materials. 14herever possible, these materials would be recycled within the
process units. Further, the design of the process units will be in accordance
with Japanese and U.S. standards with respect to the composition of liquid and
gaseous effluents. Under these conditions and with the added advantage of
having a clean, almost sulfur-free gas feedstock, it is expected that the
proposed project will have little or no harmful effects on the environment.

Total gas reserves in the area (as proven, probable and possible)
are estimated at 1,862 BSCF, adequate to meet PUSRI's as well as other user's
need over the entire life of the projects.
2.        The gas availability from all fields as of January 19751/ is
as follows:
1/ PERTAMINA, January 1975 estimates. It must be noted that above reserves
are different from previously reported reserves, as additional data have
become available since then. Future periodical reservoir evaluation,
currently under way, may further change the present figures.

Gas Supply
3.        PUSRI I receives its gas requirements from STANVAC gas fields
under a 20-year contract which expires in 1983. A new gas gathering and
transmission system to meet the gas requirements of PUSRI II has been
developed by PERTANINA at a total cost of about Rp 16 billion (US $39
million), partly (US $13.1 million), financed by part of an IDA credit
(193-IND-US $35 million). According to the original plan, the pipeline
was to supply 42 NMCFD to PUSRI II and 34  MSCFD to two refineries and
two power plants at Palembang. However, because of the PUSRI III plant,
PERTANINA was instructed by the Government to upgrade the existing system
by looping the pipeline from Simpang to PUSRI III plant. Moreover the
two power plants were not connected, in order to increase the gas availa-
bility for PUSRI.
4.       PUSRI IV gas requirements will be met through an integrated gas
system, which has been developed by PERTAMINA. This integrated gas system
will supply PUSRI II, III and IV as well as the other users in the area,
with the exception of PUSRI I whose gas needs will continue to be supplied
by STANVAC. The system will be implemented in three phases: gas fields
closest to the consumption area (including the ones already in operation)
will be the first to be connected and used. As the reserves of these
fields are exploited, new fields further away will be connected. The
investment cost will therefore be spread over a long period of time. The
three phases will include:
1st phase (197h-1976) - looping of the existing pipeline and
addition of one 1350 HP compressor at Cambai. Develop-
ment of PERTAMINA's Benuang and East Benakat fields and
of STANVAC's Rambutam field, and addition of compressing
capacity.
2nd phase (1977) - looping of existing pipeline and development
to PERTAMiINA's Betung field and STANVAC's Nau and Teras
fields.
3rd phase (1978-1993) - development of remaining gas fields:
Musi Block, Kuang, Pagar Dewa and Prabumenang. Addition
of compressing capacity.
PERTAMINA will act as the executing agency of the integrated gas project and
through contractors and its own Gas Division will carry out the project
implementation. Decisions concerning equipment and services procurement,
however, will be subject to approval by a steering committee, formed by
representatives of the Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs, Industry
and Mines Ministries.
5.        The estimated investment cost of the integrated gas project (not
being financed by the Bank) is very preliminary at this stage, because it
is not possible to determine accurately in advance the further investment



ANNEX 4-5

in drilling required to maintain gas deliverability. The drilling program
will be fixed after a comprehensive reservoir engineering survey is carried
out.  This drilling program refers to the 3rd phase (1978-1993) of the project
and its investment will be spread over 15 years. The Government will finance
*the cost of the integrated gas project partly with its own funds, with most
of the foreign exchange financed by supplier credit.

ANNEX 4-6
INDONESIA: PUSRI IV FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
TRAINING
Manpower Considerations
1.       The large expansion program undertaken by PUSRI will place heavy
demands on the organization at a time when management and staff are already
fully engaged with ongoing operations. PUSRI's training record is good.
However, the advent of PUSRI III and IV, plus the fact that the Government
has asked PUSRI to provide the staff and training facilities required to
establish a national fertilizer industry, make it necessary for the training
facilities to be expanded and the programs made more efficient.
2.       PUSRI's present staff is about 2,600 and is expected to grow
60%    in the next three years.  Recruitment needs are fully recognized
and on the Production side (where lead time is long because of training)
recruitment for PUSRI III is well advanced and for PUSRI IV is scheduled
to begin in January 1977. The manpower estimates up to 1978 are given
in Table 1.
TABLE 1 - Present and Projected Staffing

Total                           2,600           1,5h0           4,140
3.       Recruitment is not a serious problem except for qualified (graduate)
accountants. Accountants come from two sources in Indonesia -- the commercial
academies (two-year post-secondary business schools) and a few of the
universities, where a four-year course in Business Administration (but no
specialized Accounting degree) is available. In 1973 there were only 750
qualified accountants in the country, of whom 600 worked for the Government.
PUSRI now has ten graduate accountants on its staff and needs 20 more by
the end of 1977. Realistically, PUSRI can expect to recruit four or five
graduate accountants during that period, and most of the needed sub-graduates.
However, ten of the present sub-graduates on the staff have the ability to
fill graduate positions after about two years of additional training, aid
the following action was recommended to management:



ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
(a) Train ten selected sub-graduates already on the PIJSRI
staff and ten selected new sub-graduate recruits to
become the working equivalent of graduate accountants
over a two-year period.
(b) Improve retention of present and future accountants by
adding to the present compensation package of this
category. This prsposal requires proof of need, which
Triould be provided by a limited compensation study
conducted by an Indonesian consultant. This would not
be a manpower survey or a full salary survey, but a
study to identify any categories of staff where com-
paratively low compensation is holding back recruitment
seriously or causing major retention problems. Such a
study might provide the basis for updating the compensation
of staff accountants (and perhaps others) in addition
to adjusting the "scarcity allowance" and the usual
heavy fringe benefits.
Detailed Training Requirements and Programs
4.       Training carried out so far to meet the operational needs of
PUSRI I and II has never been formally evaluated, but the fact that the
plants operate efficiently indicates that no major changes in training
policy are needed. Rather, the facilities and programs will need to be
improved so as to meet the new demands outlined in pars. 1. The same
is true for staff concerned with marketing, distribution, finance and
administration. Training requirements are described below for the three
categories of staff which make up PUSRI's total operation.
(a) Production
5.       Operation and maintenance of the plants in Palembang occupy about
three-fourths of total PUSRI staff at present, a proportion which is
expected to remain approximately constant as new plants come on stream.
Altogether, over 1,000 additional production staff will be required by
the end of 1978 and recruitment is under way which will provide the lead
time necessary for training before the opening of PUSRI III in March 1977
and of PUSRI IV in January 1979. Taking existing staff and future recruits
together, the number and categories to be trained over the next three
years is estimated in Table 2.

1/ This group of administrators is classified with Production instead of
Finance/Administration because their work is directly devoted to the
plant in Palembang. Other administrators requiring training appear
in Table 4.
6.       The training envisaged for the PUSRI III and IV production staff
is essentially the same as that for PUSRI II except that more of it will be
conducted in plant because of the existence of PUSRI II. Training of PUSRI
II operating and maintenance superintendents was carried out by the M.W.
Kellogg Company in collaboration with the Toyo Engineering Corporation in
the headquarters of these companies and in other plants (in the USA and
Japan) and in Australis. The training of maintenance personnel was also
conducted abroad by equipment suppliers. In the future, however, PUSRI II
will be used as the training ground for the superintendents, while
maintenance personnel need only go to supplier's shops abroad whenever a
new type of machinery is introduced. As with the training for PUSRI II
before it came on stream, new staff will be hired for PUSRI III and trained
to take the places of experienced PUSRI II staff who will then be moved to
PUSRI III. Selected graduates and sub-graduates in management and
administrative fields connected with production, will be sent abroad for
short periods of observation and will attend short courses conducted by



ANNEX 4-6
P,-ge 4
the Institute for Management Education and Development (LPPM), which will
continue to provide the instruction in Palembang. Medical personnel
working in the plants will spend 18 months abroad, part of it in formal
education and training.
(b) Marketing and Distribution
7.       Training for marketing and distribution personnel has so far
followed a logical approach which has apparently been effective. First,
headquarters personnel are trained in marketing principles nnd procedures
by PUSRI's marketing consultants (Agrar-und-Hydrotechnik), as well as by
senior PUSRI staff and outside training agencies. This training is then
disseminated to staff in regional offices, who in turn train distributors
(private businessmen), who in turn train retailers. To handle the
marketing and distribution of the new PUSRI III and IV output, the same
method of training will be used, but four groups will require special
attention: retail outlets, warehousemen, bulk terminal staff, and new
ship management and operating personnel.
8.       For the first three of these groups a series of short courses
has been planned in such a way that the consultants and experienced PUSRI
staff can handle the instruction. This is not possible, however, in the
case of the shipping personnel. The training of this category of staff
requires a large and varied program in a field that is partly new to
PUSRI. When PUSRI III comes on stream, the corporation will own and
operate its own fleet of three special fertilizer bulk carriers. The half-
dozen current staff members in the Bulk Shipping Section of PUSRI's
Jakarta office will have to be doubled by late 1976 and about 25 new
officers will need to be trained to join the fleet. PUSRI's shipping
consultant (Mollers' of Hong Kong) has worked out an acceptable training
plan involving themselves, Price Waterhouse Associates (PWA) and four
other consultants and institutions in Indonesia and abroad, including
the shipyards of construction. Short courses and on-the-job training
are planned in the following fields: operations, crewing, accounts and
records, stores and spares, documentation, and general subjects such as
insurance. Officers and crewmen would, of course, be already qualified
when recruited, but the senior officers would require special training
in operating bulk urea vessels. They in turn would train junior officers
and crewmen. It should be added that PUSRI does have experience in short-
based operation of chartered vessels in the field of scheduling,
communications, and accounting, for example, but this is far short of the
capability required as owners, managers, and operators of their own
vessels.
9.       Taking existing staff and future recruits together, the numbers
requiring some training over the next three years are estimated in Table 3.

_/ Numbers not available by categories of personnel.
(c) Financial and Administrative Staff
10.      Training of financial staff has been conducted by the Price
Waterhouse resident consultant with the assistance of PUSRI staff. The
method is based upon comprehensive operations accounting manuals and
construction cost manuals for PUSRI that were prepared by PWA in 1971
and 1972. This approach, with adaptations to allow for organizational
changes made in 1975, will be continued. A conversion course will be
given to update existing staff. In addition, new accountants will be
given a familiarization course and new sub-graduates will be trained on
the job in their special parts of the system. A course in Finance for
non-accounting managers has been proposed for about 120 managers and
assistant managers of cost centers.
11.      The problem of recruiting accounting personnel was described in
para. 3, and a possible solution outlined. With a requirement to recruit
four graduate accountants in the last quarter of 1975 and eleven more
in 1976, the consultants estimate that actually PUSRI will be able to
recruit only four or five because of competition. The only way to meet
the shortfall is to upgrade, by intensive training, a number of existing
sub-graduate accounting staff to the point where they cnn perform the
duties of a graduate accountant. The present consultants (PWA) are
willing to undertake such a training program in-house and are equipped
to do so. Financial provision for such training is included in the
breakdown of training costs in Table 7.
12.      Taking existing staff and future recruits together, the numbers
in this category requiring some training over the next three years are
estimated in Table 4.

13.      For the administrative staff who are not specialized in Finance,
no systematic training programs exist. However, numbers are small, and
short courses are available in local institutions (such as Personnel
Administration at LPPM) plus English language training can fill the need
satisfactorily.
(d) Training for Non-PUSRI Staff
14.      Largely as a means of retaining its own experienced staff, PUSRI
plans to offer training programs for staff of other nitrogenous fertilizer
plants expected to come on stream in the next few years. A few operations
and maintenance personnel at the sub-professional level have already
received some training in the PUSRI plant. Other nitrogenous fertilizer
plants a. planned by the Government are :
(a) P.T. Kujang (West Java), 570,000 tons, opening mid-
1979;
(b) East Kalimantan, 570,000 tons, opening mid-1980;
(c)  North Sumatera $70 ,000 tons, opening not before early 1981
The bulk of the training requirement for staff to man these plants will be
on the production side, and will be carried out in the Palembang plants and
Training Center, preceded by the same type of contractors' training abroad
as was given to operators and maintenance staff in PUSRI II, III, and IV.
Following this training, personnel will be able to return to their own
plants for a few months of on-site pre-commissioning training. Similarly,
marketing and distribution personnel will be trained in small numbers at
the Jakarta and regional offices of PUSRI and will be encouraged, in turn,
to train staff in their own branches and also the distributors. Key
financial personnel will also be trained in small numbers at PUSRI's
Jakarta headquarters. Table 5 shows the total estimated numbers expected
to be trained by PUSRI for other fertilizer plants.

15.      Estimates of the training needs of the phosphate fertilizer industry
have not been included because the new plant (scheduled to open in 1979) is
located at Gresik on the site of the present Petrokimia urea plant. Whatever
training is available at Palembang is available at Gresik on a smaller scale
and this should largely meet the requirement.
Existing Training Facilities at PUSRI
16.      In Palembang, the PUSRI I and PUSRI II operating plants are of course
themselves the chief training facilities. They include two ammonia plants,
two urea plants, water and electric utilities, a chemical laboratory, and
bagging and loading facilities. PUSRI III will provide, in early 1977,
another set of similar facilities of essentially the same design but with
larger machinery. Workshops at these plants are adaptable for training,
and control rooms are spacious enough for participants and observers. However,
in Palembang there is no Training Center; classroom space is widely dispersed
around the plants and is barely sufficient to meet present training require-
ments. Training aids are primitive and scarce. Overhead projectors are
used, but the transparencies are not designed for quick and retentive
learning, but are simply reproductions of complex system diagrams extracted
from the operational manuals. The plant workshops which are used for
on-the-job training, do not have special training equipment such as
cutaway machines. In Jakarta the number of staff under training is small,
and present facilities are adequate for t1e training of the financial and



ANNEX 4-6
Page 8
administrative staff. The basis for the training of the financial staff,
especially the accounting staff, is the detailed "Manual of Accountants",
prepared for PUSRI by PWA. A two-volume "Manual of Expansion Accounting"
is also used for training in accounting for new construction projects.
The system is sptisfactory, but additional special trnining aids Pre
required.
17.      At present there are no regular full-time Indonesian instructors
in PUSRI. Instruction has been performed by (a) plant production personnel,
with the Plant Superintendents responsible for training in the process of
their own plants, (b) suppliers' and contractors' expatriate personnel, and
(c) local educational and training institutions.
hat-onal Fertilizer Production Training Cente
18.      In order to estimate the additional physical facilities required
to meet the increased training needs of PUSRI, a calculation was made for
all categories of staff, of the man-months of classroom/workshop time
involved. By far the greater portion of training will continue to be done
on the job, but this cannot be quantified separately from an employee's
regular work and no separate facilities are required to conduct it.
Table 6 summarizes the estimated classroom and workshop training require-
ment, including training to be conducted outside the organization both
locally and abroad.

19.      To meet this demand in the short term (through 1978) and to
ensure adequate facilities for both the retraining of existing personnel
and the orientation training of newly-recruited staff in the long term, a
National Fertilizer Production Training Center is proposed. At first
this will be confined to nitrogenous fertilizer, with phosphate probably
added later. Its facilities would be located in two Training Centers, one
at Palembang to be used chiefly for the training of Production (operation
and maintenance) personnel, and one in Jakarta for the training of all
other personnel.
(a) Palembang: The classroom portion of in-house training
would be brought together 2in a Training Center located
on a plot of about 3000 M adjacent to PUSRI III and
convenient to PUSRI II and IV. It would provide 280
places and permit 8 simultaneous classes in basic
process theory, with demonstrations and simulated
practice.  The facilities proposed are as follows
6 classrooms of 40 places each
2 simulator rooms of 20 places each
4 offices for Training Superintendent, 2 Assistants,
Part-time Instructors, and 1 Clerical Assistant
1 room for training aids
1 room for reproduction and storage of training
materials and office for reproduction assistant
1 small library
1 wash room
1 common room
2
The gross overall construction area of the building would be about 1,200 M
Normal furnishings and air-conditioning would be provided. Sporadic courses
(such as management training by outside instructors) could be held outside
the Training Center, in space currently borrowed for training purposes. No
proposal is made at this time-,as to a lwnguage laboratory or a residential
building for visiting trainees.
(b) Jakarta: No construction work will be needed to create
a simple Training Center in one of the headquarters
buildings. Additional training aids will be required,
however, although most of the training materials are
already available and in use.
Instructors
20.      The short-term shortage of Indonesian instructors for the Palembang
Training Center will be solved by entering into a contract with the prestigious
Institute of Technology, Bandung (ITB), to provide faculty members to teach
basic process control. This solution was discussed in Bpndung with the two



ANNEX 4-6
Page 10
professors who would be in charge of the training operation and also with
PUSRI representatives. The mission approved in principle the proposal
and negotiations will start before June 1976. This would fill the most
important single gap in present training methods in PUTSRI: the absence
of training manuals and other materials needed for efficient instruction.
A team of eight instructors would prepare appropriate training manuals
and later spend two days each per month in Palembang teaching those
subjects and exposing plant training staff to professional methods. The
approach ITB proposes is sound and ITB will train at least one PUSRI
trainer. As far as the training of accounting staff is concerned, the
present capability of the four main consultants (Kellogg, PWA, Agrar-und-
Hydrotechnik, and Mollers') will be increased by the addition of a PWA
trainer for two years to provide the upgrading training for sub-graduates
in the accounting field mentioned in para 11, whilst, at the same time,
training a PUSRI staff member to eventually assume this responsibility.
Present Training Organization
21.      The Training Section consists of eight persons, half professional
and half clerical. It is located within a 44-staff Personnel Bureau which
is part of the Organization and Personnel Department. This is the only
Department which reports directly to the President without going through
either of the three Directors (see organization chart). In spite of this
advantageous location within the administrative structure, the Training
Section does not take leadership in training matters, as training decisions
are in the hands of line officers and the Training Section handles mainly
Logistical and record-keeping work. At the time of the mission's visit the
Section was in the process of moving to Jakarta.
Proposed Organization for Training
22.      In order for the expanded training activities in PUSRI to succeed,
it is necessary for the Training Section to be re-organized. A fraining
S;uperintendent should be appointed from among the engineering staff,
responsible through the General Manager of the plant in Palembang to the
T'echnical/Production Director in Jakarta, who will continue to report
directly to the President; this would give the Training Superintendent
added status, and enable him to coordinate all training matters within
the organization.
23.      The number, levels, and functions of a strengthened training staff
f'or the Training Superintendent should be worked out in detail after the
decision to appoint a Training Superintendent is made. The present staff
of the old Training Section could be incorporated into the Training
Superintendent's unit, with most members continuing their logistical nnd
record-keeping work, which will necessarily increase es the training
requirement grows.



ANNEX 4-6
Page 11
Cost Estimates for Training (Table 7)
24.      Training on the job cannot be costed unless attributable personnel
have to be added for training purposes. Therefore, while training constitutes
a considerable part of the duties of the expatriate consultants (especially
those involved in the M.W. Kellogg and the PWA contracts), it cannot be
costed. Also excluded here is the estimated cost of other training that is
included in contracts for construction and commissioning of PUSRI III and IV
and which will be included in similar contracts for the Kujang and East
Kalimantan plants. Within this category is included training at suppliers'
facilities, at contractors' head offices, at plants similar to the ones
under construction, and in-plant pre-commissioning training. The estimates
in Table 7 cover direct costs that should be budgeted for by PUSRI. There
would be an offset from fees which will be charged to other organizations
for training provided by PUSRI. The direct costs of this added training
program, both non-recurrent and recurrent, are estimated to be US$1.7
million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange element of US$880,000
should be financed by the Bank. These costs include physical and price
contingencies and would be spread over three years, with about 42% of the
Bank-financed portion payable during 1976, 29% during 1977, and 29% during
1978.
Summary of Recommendations
25.      The general recommendation  is that ongoing training should be
continued along present lines but increased in quantity (to prepare for
operation of PUSRI III and IV and for operation of non-PUSRI nitrogenous
plants) and in quality (to maximize retention of information and skills
ard. minimize time devoted to training). The program envisages the same
facilities being used at PUSRI for both non-PUSRI and PUSRI staff. To
these ends, specific recommendations are made.
(a) Manpower
26.      To help alleviate the shortage of graduate accountants and to
identify other possible recruiting bottlenecks, an outside (Indonesian)
consultant should be engaged to survey a few specified categories of
personnel in PUSRI, to be determined by the management, with the object
of learning whether PUSRI's compensation package is sufficient for
competitive recruitment and, if not, to recommend what changes should be
made.
(b) Training Requirements and Programs
27.      Numbers to be trained should be about 3,800 over three years; the
"other staff" are from other nitrogenous fertilizer companies planned for
the near future.

Total:                     1,161      1,143       1,488
These would receive on-the-job training for the bulk of their time, but for
purposes of scheduling and of estimating needed facilities and costs, the
man-months of classrrom and outside   PUSRI training were estimated (Table 6
above).
28.      Methods to be used are essentially the same as those used now, with
the following important changes :
(a) Production Staff. The classroom portion of the training
would be improved substantially by establishment of a
National Fertilizer PAroduction Training Center. The
larger of two training centers would be constructed at
the plant site in Palembang; the training staff would be
augmented by instructors from the ITB and possibly
elsewhere; training nanuals would be produced; and
advanced training aids would be introduced.
(b)  Marketing and Distribution Staff.  One new group of
employees - those in ship management and operation -
will require somewhat different methods of training,
locally and abroad, which are to be applied by a
separate consultant wtho will bring other consultants
into a training program that has already been outlined
for PUSRI.
(c) Finance and other Administrative Staff. One group of
employees - graduate sccountants - will be in such short
supply that they will have to be augmented by 15 or 20
sub-graduates specially trained to do the work of
graduates. This calls for the only additional expatriate
assistance recommended in this report: one consultant
for two years, using advanced training aids in addition
to methods already practised in PUSRI.
29.      Facilities should be augmented in three ways:
(a) For the proposed National Fertilizer Production Training
Center, constructing and equipping an eight-classroom
Training Center at Palembang and a two-classroom Training
Center at Jakarta.



ANNEX 4-6
Page 13
(b) For training in general management and specialized
management, and for supervisory training, increased use
of the LPPM.
tc) For possible use in specified fields, investigation of
three other local institutions: The National Productivity
Center in Jakarta, the University of Indonesia's Manage-
ment Institute, and the management training facility of
the Ministry of Manpower.
(c) Organization for Training
30.      The present Training Section would be incorporated into a new Training
Bureau headed by a Training Superintendent appointed from among engineers
on the Production staff. He would have at least three full-time professional
assistants in addition to the present training staff and would report,
through the General Manager of the plant in Palembang, to the Technical/
Production Director in Jakarta.
(d) Cost
31.      The direct costs of this added training program, both non-recurrent
anJ recurrent, are estimated to be about US$1,700,000 equivalent, of which
the foreign exchange element of about US$880,000 should be financed by the
Bank. These costs include physical and price contingencies and would be
spread over three years, with about 40% of the Bank-financed portion payable
during 1976, 30% during 1977, and 30% during 1978.

3. Urea Price
The Government purchases all the production of local urea at a
fixed price, on a c.i.f. Java basis. The current price (since November
1974) is Rp 63,910 (US$154) per ton, of which about Rp 8,000 (US$19.3) per
ton is the cost of transporting fertilizer to Java. Thus, the ex-factory
price works out to Rp 55,900 (US$134.7) per ton. The transportation cost
is projected to decline to Rp 4,970 (US$12) per ton 1977 with the commis-
sioning of the Fertilizer Distribution Project. Therefore, the ex-factory
price would increase to Rp 58,930 (US$142). This price has been used to
project the Company's production revenue from 1977 onwards.
The Government has raised the retail price of urea in September
1975 by 33% from Rp 60,000 (US$144.6) to Rp 80,000 (US$193) per ton. This
applies to both locally produced and imported fertilizers sold to BIMAS
farmers. For non-BIMAS farmers, the urea retail price is higher at Rp 120,000
(US$289) per ton.
4. Input Costs
The costs of all inputs except gas are expressed at constant prices
prevailing at the end of 1975 and include real increases in labor and overhead
costs. The gas supply to PUJSRI I is carried out under a fixed price contract
and for PUSRI II as well as PUSRI III and PUSRI IV would be supnlied under a
formula which links the gas price to the operating costs (including financial
charges) plus 3.5 US cents per MSCF gas to cover PERTAMINA's overhead, thus
allowing for a gradual decrease in the gas price as the burden of financial
charges declines with debt repayments. The total cost of the gas gathering
and distribution project to serve PUSRI II as well as PUSRI III and PUSRI IV
is estimated at Rp 69.31 billion (US$167 million) and the investment is as-
sumed to be spread between 1971 and 1987.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 2
Gas Price: Natural gas is supplied to PUSRI I by STANVAC
at the fixed price of Rp 79 (about 19 US cents)/MSCF. In the case
of PUSRI II, PUSRI III and PUSRI IV, an average gas price of Rp 250
(US 60 cents)/MSCF has been assumed.
Gas ger Ton of Urea: It is assumed the old plant, PUSRI I,
would require 50 MSCF per ton of urea ccupared to 34.8 MSCF per ton
by PUSRI II, PUSRI III, and PUSRI IV.
Catalysts and Chemicals: The proposed PUSRI III and PUSRI IV
projects with their large units of ammonia and urea would require less
catalysts and chemicals per ton of product than PUSRI II and PUSRI I.
It is assumed that PUSRI III and PUSRI IV would require such items worth
about Rp 623 (US$1.5) per ton of urea compared to Rp 1,050 (US$2.5) per
ton by PUSRI III and Rp 1,370 (US$3.3) per ton by PUSRI I.
Bags: With respect to polypropylene bags, the import price
nearly doubled to US 50 cents per bag during 1974-75  FPUSRI is expected
to start manufacturing such bags from 1977 onwards. The price for each
of these bags is also assumed to be US 50 cents for PUSRI.
Maintenance Materials: The following table shows the maintenance
materials per ton of urea in the PUSRI I, II, III and IV:
PUSRI IL/        PUSRI II          PUSRI III           PUSRI IV

onwards
/1    A real increase of 11.5% in maintenance material costs is assumed for
PUSRI I.
Labor: The average base salary of PUSRI workers in 1975 was
Rp 60,000 (US$144.5) per month.  The average gross salary per worker that
year was Rp 90,000 (US$217). An 11% real increase in gross salary is
assumed for 1976 based on PUSRI estimate. For subsequent years, a 3%
real increase is assumed. The labor force of PUSRI I is 1,500 compared
to 700 for FUSRI II and the projected figure of 550 for PUSRI III, and
850 for PUSRI IV.



ANNEX 6-1
Fage 3
Overhead: Overhead costs including insurance of property is
assumed to be twice the labor costs.
5. Depreciation
The operating life of the project is assumed to be 12 years and
a straightline depreciation over that period is assumed. No depreciation
is charged on land and the initial working capital.
6. Taxes
PUSRI is allowed to carry forward losses for five years for tax
purposes. Further, there is a 5-year tax holiday on the profit of new
projects.
7. Marketing Department
Sales Price: Marketing department sells urea as well as triple
superphosphate (TSP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and complex (NPK) ferti-
lizers. The average price per ton was Rp 61,300 (US$148) until the end
of 1975, when the fertilizer prices were increased by the Government. As
a result of the increases, the average selling price of PUSRI has gone up
to Rp 83,000 (US$200) per ton. This price has been used for projections
from 1976 onwards.
Cost of Sales: Includes cost of acquiring the products marketed
and moving the products to warehouses outside the customs area of main ports
("second line warehouses"). In 1975, the average cost of sales per ton was
Rp 53,100 (US$128). This is projected to increase to Rp 63,910 (US$154) with
effect from the end of 1975 as a result of the changes in Government selling
prices to distributors like PUSRI.
Regional Marketing Cost: Includes costs of moving products from
the "second line warehouse" to the point of sale and costs of storing the
product plus administrative costs of operating PUSRI's regional marketing
offices. It averaged US$11.25/ton in 1975 and the allowance for this has
been raised to US$29.4 /ton at the end of 1975.
Corporate Marketing Costs: Cost of operating the Jakarta marketing
office.
Administrative Costs; About 50% of the administrative costs of the
Company are allocated to the marketing department.
Financial Charges: Interest on long-term debt for fertilizer
distribution projects.

RATES OF RETURN
Production Build-Up
1.       The ammonia/urea units as well as the bag-making plant of
PUSRI I V are expected to go into production on February 15, 1978.
About 80% of PUSRI IV production would be transported in bulk and
the rest in bags. The capacity of the PUSRI III bag-making plant
would be expanded by 15 million bags to 35 million bags to meet
PUSRI IV needs as well.
2.       With technical assistance from experienced foreign firms,
PUSRI IV fertilizer facilities are expected to achieve high capacity
utilization as follows: first year, 75%; second year, 80%; and from
third year onwards, 90%. The following table shows the production
build-up in the PUSRI TV facilities:

No shadow prices used as labor costs are a small percentage (10%)
of production costs excluding financial charges and depreciation.
4/   See Page 2 of this Annex for the basis of calculation.
5/   The capital costs are assumed to be the same for financial and economic
rate of return calculation because there are no duties and taxes on
equipment, and the Rupiah is a freely convertible currency.
