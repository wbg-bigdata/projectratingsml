A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The objective of the project is to assist the Government of Mauritania in testing appropriate methods to
determine how to safeguard and enhance the cultural heritage (CH) of Mauritania
The project would support the conservation and valorization of cultural heritage assets through restoration
and preservation of archaeological and historic sites, ancient manuscripts and libraries, and would-
contribute to the revitalization of economic activity in these areas through the creation of small scale
enterprises and by capitalizing on tourism potential. Moreover, popular events such as music festivals,
presentations of oral traditions, poetry contests, and traditional dance exhibitions may be held and, together
with the production and sale of artisanal objects, could provide important and sustainable links between
cultural preservation and income generation. The project is also aimed at setting up an appropriate
institutional and financial framework to elaborate the CH strategy and operationalize it.
The decision to process the project as a LIL was made because of the strong capacity building elements,
the pilot nature of individual components for which viable technical, financial, and social solutions need to
be tested and developed, and the need for experimentation with respect to the involvement of international
private foundations, international and local NGOs, local communities, and groups of artisans and
craftsmen.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The Cultural Heritage LIL will test approaches to cultural strategy formulation and management,
protection and rehabilitation of cultural assets, promotion of cultural tourism and the craft industry to
support poverty reduction through income generation and the creation of employment opportunities. The
success of this project will be determined not only by the testing of approaches to cultural development and
management, but also by the evaluation of these approaches.
The following indicators would serve as performance benchmarks for the proposed LIL. In particular, the
project would:
*   Use cultural heritage conservation and management strategies as well as regenerate ancestral
traditions, cultural expressions and artisanal skills as a means to generate social and economic
benefits.
*   Set up an institutional process facilitating the formulation of a national CH strategy, enabling the
selection of cultural operations to be initiated with the participation of CH stakeholders and
potential beneficiaries.
*   Establish within 6 months, a Steering Committee to assist in formulating a CH strategy and select
cultural initiatives to operationalize this strategy, and within a year, a Cultural Heritage Fund
(CHF) to finance cultural heritage activities.
*   Build the capacity of stakeholders (both public and private) to undertake successful projects and
activities and to transfer acquired know-how through networks.
*   Strengthen the capacity of existing CH institutions to enable them to assist in implementing CH
initiatives as selected.

Develop and: implement appropriate models for cost-effective site inventory, conservation and
management; Identify, document and disseminate good practices for developing these models.
* In the long-term, support cultural initiatives to promote social cohesion and stimulate
income-generating opportunities.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 16595            Date of latest CAS discussion: 05/21/97
The necessity for investing in cultural heritage development is not explicitly identified in the current CAS.
The Bank agreed to consider providing support in this area at the specific request of the Government which
proved its commitment in organizing in December 1999 a National Conference for the promotion of CH,
.aimed at linking CH activities and knowledge and social and economic development. The approach
proposed in this LI is consistent with the conclusions of this Conference as well as with the CAS
objectives of broad-based growth and natural resource management, particularly with respect to capacity
building, rural-focused social interventions, and poverty alleviation through the empowernent of local
communities.
Cultural heritage could serve as a powerful tool for social cohesion, while at the same time, providing
revenue opportunities for the general population, thereby contributing to sustainable economic
development. Cultural heritage includes both tangible (natural sites, historic monuments and movable
properties) and intangible (the living culture) assets. One of Mauritania's greatest competitive advantages is
the plethora of unique sites and cultural assets dispersed throughout the country. However, in a poor
setting, these assets are often neglected, and must be developed, maintained and exploited for the benefit of
local communities. The cultural heritage of Mauritania developed over several millenia. It includes
numerous prehistoric sites, which are unfortunately being looted by foreigners or Mauritanians for whom
the sale of relics of the past(cut flints, pottery works, tools, etc.) constitutes an income. The historic sites
are better known but are abandoned, except in the case of emergency rehabilitations. These include cities
like Azougui from which the Ahnoravides left to conquer Morocco and Spain, or Tegdaoust and Koumbi
Saleh, which were key cities of the Ghana ernpire in the Middle Age. The holy cities of Chinguetti,
Ouadane, Tichitt and Oualatta are registered as 'World heritage" by UNESCO. Mauritania CH also
includes ancient, prestigious libraries and archives which contain exhaustive documentation on the
historic, economric, cultural and social past of Mauritania, but may vanish if no action is taken to preserve
them. Over the centuries music and poetry also attracted crowds but are being lost with time and should be
preserved as well as nomad and crafts skills. Expressions of artistic traditions are at risk of being
transformed into "airport culture" to meet the demands of a limited tourist market Activities related to
cultural heritage and preservation can therefore lead to the creation of employment, generation of
much-needed revenues, and ultimately the empowerment of local communities to develop their vision of
economic and social development. Employment will arise not only from the implementation of the LIL and
its sub-projects, but mainly from the resulting links of mutual reinforcement to the tourism industry.
Moreover, the local tourism will continue to grow as a result of improvements in the plamning and
conservation of historic and natural sites. There has been some growth in the last few years: intemational
arrivals in 1999 are estimated at approximately 12,000, which reflects a great potential over the next
decade given the variety of tourism products available and the growing popularity of "discovery" tourism
In order to take stock of the situation, a National Conference on Mauritania CH, held in December 1999,
brought together more than 500 participants including national and foreign experts known as specialists in
Mauritanian cultural heritage, international organizations, donors and most of the Mauritanians involved in
- 4 -



cultural policy-making. The conference, well covered by national and international media, achieved the
following objectives:
*   The Mauritanian Cultural Heritage and its features, tangible and intangible, were defined. The
range of the heritage to be protected and promoted was also defined.
*   Actions undertaken by the Government, the private sector and development agencies were
inventoried. Cultural policy- makers and donors also discussed ways to enhance cooperation.
*   Institutional and financial constraints which prevent cultural policies from better management of
cultural heritage were identified.
*   Economic issues to be addressed through cultural tourism and the craft industry, and initiatives
that contribute to economic development and poverty reduction were identified.
*   Educational and academic initiatives were defined in order to contribute to a better integration of
cultural heritage within education, training and research.
*   The role of local communities in promoting national cultural heritage was discussed.
The Conference helped define a national strategic framework for the management of Mauritanian cultural
heritage, which takes into account the legislative, economic, social and cultural factors contributing to a
sustainable economic development, and enhancing social stability and reducing poverty. The current
proposal reflects this strategic framnework, as discussed by the Council of Ministers on March 30, 2000
(see Annex 12).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The main sector issues with regard to cultural heritage conservation, promotion and management in
Mauritania are:
e   the role of culture in poverty alleviation efforts;
*   the need to integrate a cultural dimension into local economic and social development plans;
3   the rapid deterioration of many culturally significant assets;
3   the need to strengthen the nascent institutional base for the sector to prevent the loss of cultural
heritage assets; and
*   the coordination of multiple stakeholders' interests in cultural heritage management.
In developing countries, culture may be considered a luxUwy ill-afforded by the majority of the people.
Mauritania is one of the poorest countries in the world with nearly half of its population living on less than
100 dollar per year. However, cultural heritage has important social facets and can bring about economic
growth. With the existence of two main ethnic groups (Moores and Afro-Mauritanians) in the country, each
with its own past, a national vision for cultural conservation and development can serve not only to protect
diversity, but also to foster national identity. Moreover, a widely supported national identity will ensure
social cohesion and political stability. To break the vicious circle of poverty, cultural identity and economic
objectives are not mutually exclusive, but rather dependent on each other. In addition, cultural identity
lends personal and commnunity comnitment to income-generating activities and garners a sense of pride,
which in turn generates more economic activities and benefits. For exarnple, artisanal products of a high
quality and significant to the country's cultural, identity form a major part of the tourist experience, thus
providing the impetus for market expansion, job creation, and revenue generation.

Although culture featured in local development strategies only a few decades ago, culture consciousness
has dropped off the agenda of local authorities and communities. This was compounded by centralization of
power and decision-making, leaving little opportunity for responsibility and planning at local levels. This
has lead to a rapid deterioration of many culturally significant assets.
Despite the country's best efforts, theinstitutional base of cultural heritage development is very weak. At
the central level, a clear vision of the necessary institutional framework -- including a clear strategy, the
legal and administrative rules and regulations, and incentives to promote cultural development initiatives -- -
is not yet in place. Several key Government structures are involved in CH protection: Ministry of Culture
and Islamnic Orientation (competent Ministry both for religionand culture), the University which should
organize research and training about CH (training of guides, inventories, publications, etc.), the
Mauritanian Institute for Scientific Research (IMRS), the Foundation of Historic Cities, the Ministry of
Tourismn, the Ministry of National Education, the Foundation of the Banc d'Arguin, etc. This institutional
diversity, the absence of coordination, and the weakness found within all of these structures are a constraint
for strategy formulation and implementation.
Currently, several initiatives are financed by bilateral or multilateral cooperation; the Spanish
cooperation has undertaken rehabilitation works in Oualata; the German Cooperation is financing the
development of craft industry; the Roussel-Uclaffe Foundation is financing micro-filing of manuscripts and
UNICEF has intervened in Tichitt to imnprove the water supply. The European Union also intends to
intervene in Chinguetti, and the French Cooperation which is funding CH research and training activities --
mainly through technical assistance -- will develop activities favoring the "hving" heritage. UNESCO is
providing expertise to the Foundation of Historic Cities, including the protection of manuscripts. None of
these initiatives are coordinated. In fact, if donors and foreign sponsors are eager to invest in Mauritania
CH, they are reluctant to do so until a national strategy exists which includes all groups and potential
beneficiaries, and which contains transparent financial and implementation procedures.
3. Learning and Development issues to be addressed by the project:
a) The success of this project depends on the willingness and efforts of all parties to cooperate and
include potential beneficiaries to achieve common objectives.
At the central level, a change in attitude is necessary. The idea that a culture project would fall under the
sole responsibility of one ministry (e.g., Culture) must evolve into a realization that culture is a
multi-faceted sector and must bring to bear resources and expertise from various sectoral ministries, in
particular tourism, education and environment. In addition to this intra-governmental partnership,
relationships must be forged and strengthened with the private sector, NGOs, civil society and
universities/training institutions.
In particular, public authorities should catalyze the cultural dynamism as it is, rather than try to control it.
This support requires a clearly defined good coordination between institutions and executive management,
as it cannot be ensured within the existing institutional framework. On the other hand, when initiatives to be
financed appear to be the result of a real need, it will be much easier to mobilize donors' interest.
Community participation is therefore a necessary pre-requisite to the success of all development. While
Government has an important role to play in collaboration with its partners in defiming the broad objectives
and framework, it must recognize that economic priorities have to be established by local communities.
This will increase personal commitment and investment, as well as ownership and pride; thus ensuring
sustainability of cultural projects.

b) To achieve common objectives, good practices for cultural heritage, when documented and
disseminated, lay the foundation for further investments to fuel economic growth. Due to the innovative
nature of this sector and the Government's and the Bank's limited experience in this domain, the project will
place a premium on learning experiences for problem-solving.
In this context the major objectives that should be achieved through project implementation are:
*   The establishment of the institutional system (CH Board, CH Fund, CH Steering Committee,
Permanent Secretariat, and the statutes and procedural manuals for them) during a period of one
year, at the most, given the experimental nature of the project, over the three years of the project
life.
*   Transparent management with regard to a project which aims at mobilizing funds other than IDA
-- particularly funds from foundations, private sponsors, or both. This transparency will result
from a relative independence of decisions from administrative and political governing bodies, from
the involvement of private donors in the funding decisions, and from an independent fund
management that allows at any time the individualization of accounts and their audit.
*   Strengthening cultural institutions so that they can act more as service providers than contracting
authorities. These institutions will promote cultural initiatives which will include local
communities. A system of contractual ties must be established between the promoters, the local
communities, and the funding institution. The promoters should meet their obligations in term of
results, and the cultural bodies should honor their obligations with regard to the support and
monitoring they provide (typical specifications).

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
There will be three major components in the project (a detailed description of the objectives and the content
of each of the components can be found in Annex 2).
*   A cultural heritage protection component will finance the inventory of activities of research,
preservation (museums, manuscripts, etc.) and rehabilitation works (buildings, sites, etc.). Training
activities will enhance capacities in this sector (preservation architecture, archivists, etc.).
*   A  cultural heritage promotion component including the development of tourism  and the craft
industry. Funds will be directed to non-permanent cultural initiatives (festivals, publications,
exhibitions guide books, micro-credit for local communities and craft industry cooperatives,
professional training).
*   A cultural heritage management component aimed at establishing an appropriate institutional
and financial framework to elaborate and operationalize the CH  strategy with respect to the
coordination of Ministries, the inclusion of all potential beneficiaries and the strengthening of
existing cultural institutions and laws.

Priority Program of activities for the first year
Because the SC and CHF will be established during the first year of the project, a priority program of
activities has been agreed upon by the Government. This program includes activities which are emergency,
rehabilitation or protection; terms of reference for institutional audits; and living culture activities whiclh
will facilitate the testing of the project procedures. The priority program is included in the financing of the
three components, according to their objectives and is attached in Annex 14.
2. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project implementation. To implement project activities, the Government, within the structure of the
cultural institutions involved, will establish an institutional and financial system that will enable CH
coordination and inclusion of all stakeholders. In this regard, the establishment, during the project, of the
following entities was agreed upon by the Council of Ministers held on March 29, 2000:
A National CH Board (Conseil National Pour la Sauvegarde et la Valorisation du Patrimoine) chaired
by the General Secretary of the Presidency. The Minister of Culture and Islamic Orientation will be its
Vice President. It will provide broad guidance on policy and strategy formulation. The Board, whose
establishment is a condition of effectiveness, will meet quarterly to ratify work programs selected by the
SC.
The Steering Committee for the Promotion of Cultural Heritage will also meet quarterly and will
include CH experts, but also stakeholder representatives to Teflect cultural and ethnic diversity. It will
screen all proposals and appraise their quality on the basis of established eligibility criteria. The
decision-making authority on selection and financing will be entrusted to the committee. This imnplies that it
be granted sufficient autonomy. Based on the experience gained, the SC will assist the National Board in
the formulation of CH policies. The SC will be established with the approval of the NCHB, which will
adopt its statutes with regard to its composition and procedures. SC statutes will be deemed satisfactory by
IDA. This commnittee will include local and foreign experts, repTesentatives of cultural promoters, of
cultural institutions and IGOs such as UNESCO.
The Permanent Secretariat (SP) of the Steering Committee. The role of the SP will be limited to project
implementation. The operating costs of the SC and SP will be supported by IDA and others donors which
wish to support Government policy. SC and SP will be staffed according to their roles and responsibilities.
A cultural heritage fund (CBl) will be established and funded by interested donors (including sponsors,
private foundations) to finance operations selected by the SC. This fund will be managed by the SP.

3. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
The SP and SC will implement a systematic and detailed monitoring and reporting system, focusing on both
the outputs and outcomes of the project as measured by the monitoring indicators. Monitoring and
evaluation will be the responsibility of an M&E officer employed by the SP. The system should allow for
an effective evaluation of: (i) the project's delivery mechanisms, implementation procedures and
institutional arrangements; (ii) performance effectiveness evaluated against the project's development
objective and impact indicators (identified in Annex 1); and (iii) the potential replicability of project
activities on a wider scale. Progress towards project outcomes will be evaluated during project supervision
and during the mid-term review to be held no later than December 2001.
The mid-term review will determine the extent to which the project is performing against the objectives set
for it, and will cany out a preliminary assessment of the potential for wider scale replication.
Preparation of an implementation comnpletion report will be initiated by the Bank prior to the project
Closing Date in conjunction with the preparation of the Government's own evaluation report.
D. Project Rationale
[This section is not to be completed in a LIL PAD. Rationale should be implicit in paragraph B: 3.]
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
[For LIL, to the extent applicable]
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
* Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
The project is expected to generate a range of benefits arising from: (i) experience gained from various
partnerships in cultural heritage conservation and management; (ii) imnproved planning and site
interpretation to accommodate conservation needs and tourism interests in cultural and natural sites; (iii)
growth and poverty reduction associated with better access to local and regional markets for artisanal
crafts; (iv) conservation of cultural assets which mnight otherwise have been lost; (v) community
involvement in site conservation and management; and (vi) imnproved institutional capacity to formulate and
implement cultural initiatives.
Initiatives under the three components are expected to be relatively small-scale and will seek to optimize
resources by developing partnerships with domestic and international organizations such as UNESCO,
World Monuments Fund (WMF), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the World Tourism organization, the Agha
Kan Foundation, and others.
Site conservation activities are expected to use local building materials and labor-intensive methods. The
project component targeting institutional strengthening and capacity building will contribute to longer-term
sustainability.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)
- 11 -



[For LIL, to the extent applicable]
Due to the nature of the LIL with respect to its size and emphasis on learning and innovation, the monetary
and non-monetary benefits will not be analyzed in the comprehensive way nonnally associated with more
traditional Bank investment projects. As a pilot operation, the LIL will test a variety of approaches for
providing resources through several institutional arrangements and experimenting with potentially
profitable income-generating activities (through the CHF).
Because of large-scale poverty in each of the regions, it is not feasible to expect a full repayment of the
public investment. Nonetheless, efforts of partial cost-recovery will be tested through entrance fees and
community contributions (in labor and in-kind), and mandatory levels of financial participation in cultural
initiatives.
3. Technical:
[For LIL, enter data if applicable or 'Not Applicable']
The site conservation and management component of the project will involve technical feasibility studies,
environmental and social analyses, and strategic planning. These studies might include activities related to
archeological investigation, building stabilization, drainage improvement, and infrastructure development.
The LIL will also revive traditional skills such as stone cutting, woodworking, silk production, etc.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The project will be implemented by the Permanent Secretariat of the SC. In order to preserve project
sustainability, the Direction de la Culture in the Ministry of Culture (MCOI), the Institut de la Recherche
Scientifique (IMRS) and the FNSVA, inter alia, will be audited during the first phase of the project They
will then be reorganized in such a way that they be able to provide services to cultural promoters and
support the CH momentum created by the project.

environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Not applicable
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The project is consistent with the CAS objectives of empowering local communities by involving them in
the management of their cultural heritage (tangible and intangible) so that they may genuinely contribute to
the socio-economic development of the country. Despite its very strong national Islamic Afro-Arab
traditions, rich multi-racial, multi-ethmic and multi-lingual heritage, Mauritania, like many other developing
countries, faces the difficult challenges of nation-building and social development. The project will
contribute toward the dynamic processes of social change underway in the country, strengthening the
communities' capacity to take stock of the striking commonalties in their cultural heritage, while validating
the beauty of their regional diversity in human, natural, and cultural resources -- a wealth, which if
exploited adequately, could enhance the promotion of national solidarity and sustainable economic
development. The proposed participatory approach underpins the Govenmment's recognition and
conmitment to invest in the development of Mauritania's rich cultural assets, with a view to advancing
social cohesion and national solidarity while reducing poverty.

Annex 2: Project Description
MAURITANIA: Cultural Heritage Project
Comvonent 1: Site Conservation and Management (US$2.40 million)
The project will provide resources for the development of appropriate models of cost-effective site
conservation and management. Specific areas of conservation and management to be examined include
zoning, planning, rehabilitation, exploitation, visitor interpretation, and maintenance.
Inventory and research, inter-alia:
*   *To make an inventory of institutions, organizations, committees and NGOs involved in cultural
policy in Mauritania.
*   Creation of a data base (SIG) of Mauritanian archeological sites.
*   Inventory of ancient cultural objects that are the most exceptional and warrant a particular
protection.
Building rehabilitation in ancient cities and archeological sites. Pilot operations will help to revitalize
ancient cities by designing master plans and rehabilitating key buildings, which would be used for
developing tourism and craft activities. Archaeological sites will be protected from looting and additional
research will be carried out. Rehabilitation works will be executed in compliance with the UNESCO
rehabilitation program and the FNSVA action plan.
Manuscripts and archives preservation. The inventory, preservation and diffusion of rare manuscripts
will rely primarily on projects prepared by traditional library owners' associations. Experimental
operations will be conducted in Tidjikja and Boutilimit. These operations can be further replicated in
others cities.
Training. Includes training of archivists, curators, manuscripts specialists, record keepers, etc. The funds
for this training are intended for: (i) defining the curricula; (ii) paying trainers' fees; and (iii) financing
necessary educational material.
Studies. The project will undertake a series of applied research activities, reviewing the relevance and
value of cultural assets in key sectors: Agriculture, Education, and Health, Nutrition and Population.
Below are the proposed study areas:
(a) Education (Oral traditions and rural libraries).The objective of this study will be to explore the
extent to which cultural assets could be used as powerful instruments for developing better
educational tools, enhancing cultural identity and developing it in the school curriculum.
(b) Health, Nutrition and Population. The study will focus on the impact of culture on the delivery
of primary health care services (family planning, nutrition, sanitation).
- 25 -



(c) Intellectual property and indigenous knowledge. The intent of the study is to analyze local
communities' knowledge, problem-solving attributes, coping mechanisms and strategies, and the
degree to which these are in danger of disappearing as new development models are introduced in
Mauritania.
(d) Legal reform and development effectiveness. The study would emphasize the particular
value-set of Mauritanian culture: an Islamic foundation combined with a Franco-modem
judicial-administrative setting.
Comuonent 2: Support to Cultural Initiatives. (US$1.50 Million)
The objective of this component is to provide demand-driven support to cultural initiatives aimed at
promoting social cohesion and identity, and stimulating income-generating opportunities for local
commnunities. This objective would be achieved thmugh grants from a CHF. Proceeds from the CHF would
be made available to the CH promoters on a competitive basis and would be managed by the Permanent
Secretariat (SP). To reach out to potential beneficiaries, and screen and approve project proposals, a
Steering Committee (SC) would be established, comprised of experts and representatives of stakeholders
and beneficiaries. Project promoters, including local groups (such as NGOs, artists, women's groups,
artisans, etc.) and partnerships of interested parties would be invited to submit proposals which would be
selected according to principles, Criteria and procedures acceptable to IDA.
Project proposals should conform to the following fundamental principle-promoting economically feasible
initiatives that are culturally relevant and consistent with local development plans. Initiatives should
result in greater capacity, expertise and know-how that can be transferred to future activities. The CHF
grants procedures would require project promoters to mobilize resources and seek additional funding from
private sources.
Areas eligible for support encompass all forms of cultural expression or representation. Broad categories of
acceptable initiatives would include:
*   support to artisanal activities with a focus on reviving traditional skills (stone carving, silk
production, etc.), strengthening existing skills (woodworking, paper, embroidery, etc.), improving
methods of production to ensure better product quality and mix, and expanding markets
(distribution, promotion, selling points, etc.);
*   promotion of living culture, including dance and theater, music (vocal and instrumental), oral
traditions (fables, stories and poetry), local customs (ancestral rituals and ceremonies), and
ethnographic artifacts;
*   education of the public and visitor interpretation, including development of signs, brochures and
pamphlets, training of tour guides, creation, enhancement or both of museums; media campaigns
and school books; and
*   other activities that support discovery tourism, e.g., eco-tourism, adventure travel and cultural
tourism.
Possible content of proposals, selection criteria, disbursement of funds and other pTocesses would be
broadly defined in the procedural manual but will be detailed by the SC, thus formulating CH priorities and
implementation procedures. In particular, SC will favor operations contributing to economic and social
development. It will seek to promote the private sector and community-based organizations.
- 26 -



Tourism. The main challenge is currently to adapt the country's supply to growing tourist demand through
a tourism strategy which promotes the socio-cultural identity of the country, preserves the cultural sites,
and makes cultural finding activities the main strategic thrust, without undermining the ecological balance.
A Tourism Master Plan is a prerequisite for better management of the sector. A first master plan is
currently funded and is being designed thanks to the German Cooperation. The IDA project could finance
complementary studies, such as detailed regulations for tourism. In addition, some support actions could be
eligible, including: (i) Mauritania's participation in forumns and tourist shows around the world; (ii)
discussion and formulation of a national charter for tourism; (iii) establishing a permanent framework for
consultation between the Government and tourism promoters; (iv) a tourism directory with labeled
reception sites; (v) films, advertising brochures, CD-ROMs, guides about Mauritanian products; and (vi)
training of guides, tourism managers, etc.
Craft industry and training for craftsmen. To organize the craftsmen's profession with particular
attention to the traditional craft industry. In that respect, training will be organized that not only encourages
high quality, traditionally made products (safes, leather carpets, etc.) but will help create: (i) more
abundant tourist products, and replicates prehistoric objects, limiting their looting; (ii) "modem" products
to meet local and tourist needs with production/reproduction workshops; and (iii) the promotion of
traditional calligraphy to protect ancient manuscripts by supporting specialized associations. The project
will directly finance the rehabilitation of several "Craftsmen Houses"(Maison des Artisans) in which
artisans will make their products.
The purpose of the micro-credit component is to promote cultural activities which include the participation
of these communities. This micro-credit should support craft industry cooperatives in the modernization of
their production tools and provide funds for the procurement of raw materials in the initial phase.
Training and the micro-credit will be managed by BAPEM (Bureau d'appui aux petites entreprises en
Mauritanie) and its affiliate CECA (Caisse d'Epargne et de credit des artisans) which, together with the
financial and technical support of GTZ is expected to successfully implement such activities in selected
areas. The project will allow BAPEM and CECA to expand their activities toward zones (e.g., Senegal
river, historic cities) in which craftsmen cooperatives are in dire need of support.
Specific activities for the most vulnerable communities. In addition to local communities, cooperatives
and cultural associations supported by BAPEM and CECA, the project will earmark part of its resources
for one of the most vulnerable and poorest communities of Mauritania -- Ihraguen communities in the
National Park of Banc d'Arguin in the North, and the community of the Diawling park in the South --
located in fragile areas where environmental restrictions prevent them from earning a living. Project
financing will therefore be essentially devoted to the design and implementation of ecological tourism
strategies.
"Living" cultural activities. These will include festivals, forums, communications activities, exhibitions,
publications of poem compilations, media campaigns, films, internet sites, etc.
Component 3: Institutional Stren!thenine and Capacity Buildiniz. (US$1.16Million)
This component is designed to provide assistance for the institutional framework and strengthening of
cultural institutions, and will include:
- 27 -



(i) Establishing NCHB, SC, SP, and CHF; providing support in areas of project management,
finance and administration, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and other skills.
(ii) Training and study tours for implementing agencies and cultural initiatives promoters, both
in-country as well as internationally. Study tours would include visits to neighboring countries
that offer successful examples of cultural heritage management and tourism.
(iii) Public awareness programs and new marketing approaches that would involve media and NGOs,
and would raise interest in cultural issues leading to the creation of a cultural development vision
in the new millenniuna
(iv) Monitoring and evaluation of all activities due to the nature of the learning and innovation loan.
Elements of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) program would include technical and financial
audits, beneficiary assessments, Bank supervision, and independent reporting. Participatory
monitoring would be undertaken by the SC.
(v) Improving the legislation of the heritage "protection" (protection regulations of the historical and
archaeological heritage, ratification and pronmulgation of international convention aimed at
heritage protection, revision of Law 72 160 dated December 31, 1972, related to the safeguarding
and the development of national, historical, prehistoric, archaeological heritage, and improving its
implementation.
(vi) Organizational audits of existing cultural institutions: Ministere de la Culture, IMRS University
and Fondation Nationale de Sauvegarde des Villes Anciennes(FNSVA).
(vii) Strengthening the capacities of the four institutions listed above, according to the missions they
would have to carry out for supporting the demand-driven cultural heritage strategy.
Description detaillee des composantes essentielles
Du projet "Protection et valorisation du Patrimoine Mauritanien"
Composante I - Protection du Patrimoine (2,4 Millions de Dollars)
a) Sites archeologiques et historiques
Depuis le Colloque sur le Patrimoine culturel mauritanien qui s'est tenu a Nouakchott les 29, 30
novemnbre et ler decembre 1999, les principaux sites prehistoriques et historiques qui ont fait l'objet de
recherches scientifiques (fouilles archeologiques), ou qui ont ete inscrits au patrimoine mondial (villes
anciennes) ont ete visites. D'autres sites, consider6s conune secondaires, meritent egalement le maximtum
d'attention (neolithique des dhars Tichitt et Oualata ; greniers gangaras du Tagant, sepultures
preislamiques, villes anciennes de Rachid, de Qsar el Barka, de Togba ; residences de l'epoque coloniale,
etc. I1 est facile de mesurer leur 6volution sur une longue duree, face aux effets du climat, a l'abandon des
populations, ou a la pr6dation des collecteurs d'objets culturels.
Diagnostic: n1 convient tout d'abord de dissocier les sites prehistoriques des sites historiques.
Les vestiges pr6ihistoriques (structures d'habitats, objets en pierre), abandonn6s depuis des
- 28 -



millenaires, se trouvent paradoxalement en surface en raison du lavage des sols par les pluies, et n'en sont
que plus soumis a la collecte du touriste de passage. Ainsi des sites de premiere imnportance, comme El
Beyyed, dans l'Adrar, sont pill6s et ne peuvent plus faire l'objet d'etudes statistiques. Il en est de meme
dans d'autres secteurs, jusque-la inconnus des chercheurs. Des agences de voyages etrangeres proposent
meme a leurs clients des circuits avec ramassage de bifaces et de pointes de fleches...
Les vestiges historiques concement des cites qui ont ete exhumres a l' occasion de fouilles
archeologiques (Tegdaoust, Azougi, Koumbi Saleh), ou qui ont periclite du fait de la modification des
ciTcuits conumerciaux (Chinguetti, Ouadane, Tichitt, Oualata) ou des conflits locaux (Qsar el Barka,
Rachid et Tinigui). Pour les fouilles, les batiments les plus remarquables, qui avaient ete consolides lors de
la fermetures des chantiers il y a vingt-cinq ans, pr6sentent des degradations qui s'accntuent a chaque
saison des pluies. Des arbustes (callotropis) poussent dans les ruines, accelerant par leurs branches et leurs
racines la dislocation des murs. Le visiteur qui a fait parfois un long detour pour venir admirer ces
ruines, ne peut m8me pas en ramener la photographie.
Les villes anciennes proprement dites presentent un probleme plus global en raison de la
juxtaposition de batiments abandonnes et de batiments habites. Les parties abandonnees ne l'ont pas ete
brusquement, certaines parties d'habitation ayant servi pendant un temps plus ou moins long d'entrep6ts ou
de greniers. La proxinite de quartiers encore habites a reduit nombre de batiments en miines a 1'etat de
dscharges publiques, rendant encore plus presente cette sensation de d6sinteret qui touche des maisons
dot6es souvent d'une belle architecture et de beaux decors (niches triangulaires par exemple).
Objectifs de la composante
L'etude minutieuse des sites prehistoriques permet d'incrire l'histoire du pays dans la longue dur6e
de celle de l'humanite qui, en Mauritanie, remonte a plus de 700 000 ans dans le Nord. Les villages de la
region de Tichitt sont, de leur cote, a l'origine des grandes communautes urbaines et sont uniques en
Afrique. ls convient 6galement de signaler l'existence de sites lies a l'invention des techniques (metallurgie
du cuivre a Akjoujt, du fer sur le Fleuve). Ces sites ne constituent pas seulement des 6lements
indispensables a l'elaboration de l'histoire du continent africain. L'etude du mode de vie des populations
qui y vivaient offre les cles necessaires a la comprehension du phenomene de la desertification qui a debute
dans la region il y a six millenaires et qui affecte aujourd'hui douloureusement nomades et sedentaires.
Comme toujours en prehistoire, ces recherches sont intimement liees aux, sciences de la terre et du climat.
Les sites historiques, quant a eux, portent sur les vestiges d'anciens comptoirs caravaniers et de
lieux de rassemblement de pelerins pour La Mecque. Des l'essor du commerce caravanier, a l'aube de 1'
islam, ces cites ont inscrit le pays dans la communaute musulmane. Les fouilles qui ont ete menees dans les
anciens comptoirs, les recherches dans les bibliotheques universitaires (compl6ments indispensables a 1'
elaboration des theses des chercheurs), et dans les manuscrits collectes en Mauritanie, sont indispensables a
la connaissance des routes transsahariennes, et, par la-meme, a la dynamisation des relations entre le
Maghreb et les pays au sud du Sahara, dont la Mauritanie se trouve etre le lien incontournable.
Ce milieu, combien fragile, aussi riche pour l'histoire que pour une meilleure connaissance des
phenomenes climatiques est tout d6signe pour susciter un tourisme de qualite. Celui-ci, a 1'enrichissement
purement materiel du pays peut ajouter celiui d'echanges plus culturels, appliquant a l'ensemble de la
Mauritanie la devise de Ouadane: richesse materielle et richesse spirituelle. C'est pourquoi le
developpement de l'eco tourisme est imnportant. Celui-ci a d'ailleurs commence a s'im-poser: trekking,
retraites spirituelles, circuits de centres religieux pour les musulmans, tourn6es a chameaux.
- 29-



Mise en oeuvre
Cet eco-tourisme passe par la remise en etat de batiments anciens remarquables, la visite de
bibliotheques traditionnelles, une fois les manuscrits proteg6s, l'amenagement de petits musees locaux
(objets anciens, copies artisanales, livres d'information), la publication de livres de qualite, la formation de
guides, la mise a disposition d'auberges en accord avec le style de vie locale (tentes de preference a des
maisons en dur). Ainsi, les touristes viendront en Mauritanie pour des raisons propres au pays, respecteront
mieux son cadre grand et austere, ainsi que ses vestiges, si essentiels pour la connaissance de son passe et
de son devenir.
La FNSVA, qui regroupe les associations locales soucieuses de la preservation des 6lements les
plus int6ressants de leurs cites est la plus a mene de coordonner les efforts allant dans ce sens. Toutefois,
cette action ne doit pas rester l'oeuvre de quelques-uns. Elle doit s'etendre a l'ensemble de la population et
commencer par la formation d'animateurs charges d'animer, selon des techniques modemes, des groupes de
personnes motivees ou interessees par leurs activites (artisans). Le succes des differentes operations dans
les villes anciennes peut dependre autant de ces anirnateurs, plus proches de la population, que de la
personnalite qui soutient localement le projet concemr.
La protection des sites peut d6buter par les ecoles (et meme dans l'enseignement religieux, interesse
au premier chef par le respect des livres) et porter sur l'urgent et l'essentiel: le nettoyage de toute matiere
non degradable des ruines et de l'environnement des villes anciennes. Les touristes eux-memes peuvent y
etre associes. Des exp6riences concluantes ont ete men6e ailleurs, en Europe et en Afrique, et constituent
une bonne motivation des populations. Ce type d'action est spectaculaire et rassure les bailleurs de fonds.
Sa mise en oeuvre demande peu de temps et peu d'argent.
b) Inventaires et recherches
Les activites d'inventaire et de recherche feront l'objet d'un programme trimestriel. Elles devront
etre en nombre lirnit, le projet n'etant pas concu pour se subtituer aux activites normales de l'IMRS ou de
l'Universite Les termes de r6f6rence des etudes ainsi que les CVs des consultants pressentis devront
obligatoirement avoir fait l'objet d'un examen de la Commission consultative - aucune etude ne pourra etre
entreprise en dehors de cet avis favorable.
Les activites d'inventaire viseront a 6tablir un etat des lieux du patrimoine avec cartes, SIG, ou
releves photographiques a l'appui. Elles ne visent pas a financer des 6tudes academiques. Ces inventaires,
du fait de leur imnportance devront etre attribuees par Appel d'offres.
On peut cependant citer les etudes suivantes qui s'imposent d'emblee parce qu'elles peuvent servir
de cadre indispensable a toute action dans ce domaine:
*   Recensement des institutions, Organisations non gouvemementales, organisations diverses et
comites interesses en Mauritanie par la politique culturelle.
* Creation d'une base de donnees (SIG) des sites arch6ologiques mauritaniens.
*   Inventaire et numerisation, a partir du fonds de I'IMRS, des objets culturels anciens exceptionnels,
et qui meritent une protection particuliere, etc
*   Dans le cadre de l'inventaire des sites prehistoriques (paleolithique, neolithique, protohistoriques -
Gangara, Bafour - periode du cuivre et du fer), il convient de preciser qu'on ne possede pis de
donnees pr6cises sur le Tagant, les Hodh (la region de Koumbi Saleh, en particulier), le Fleuve et le
- 30-



Nord. Des missions sur le terrain sont donc necessaires. Pour eviter la multiplication des missions
de prospection, il faut lier les diff6rents domaines (sites prehistoriques et historiques).
*   Etudes sur la maniere dont le Patrimoine peut etre int6gre au processus educatif, de maniere a
renforcer la coh6sion sociale des l'6cole. A ce titre, le role des traditions orales et des bibliotheques
traditionnelles seront examin6es a la lumeire de ce qui se passe dans les Mahadras, pour faire le
lien avec 1'enseignement fourni par lrecole.
*   Une analyse de la place de la culture dans la mise en oeuvre des services de sante de base, que ce
soit la sante familiale, la nutrition etc, sera entreprise, pour ameliorer l'efficacite des services de
sante de base.
*   Enfin, une etude concernant les sources juridico- philosophiques du systeme judiciaire Mauritanien
devrait egalement permettre de comprendre la meilleure facon dharmoniser les deux traditions
culturelles ayant donne naissance au droit Mauritanien, ceci pour faciliter une appropriation
complete des r6formes entreprises.
Programme d'interventions d'urgence
Au rang des activites d'inventaire et de recherche, il convient de mentionner tout particulierement
les interventions d'urgence. Ces demieres portent sur des sites prehistoriques de surface menaces par des
collecteurs d'objets, et sur des batiments ou monuments en cours de degradation sous l'effet des pluies, et.
Archeologie prehistorique Privilegier d'urgence la zone d'EI Beyyed (paleolithique) dont
l'inventaire n'a pas ete fait et qui est parcouru par les circuits touristiques. De meme, il faut inventorier
d'urgence le Dhar Oualata et son baten riche en sites neolithiques et paleolithiques.
Archeologie historique Couper les arbustes qui ont pousse dans les parties fouillees de Tegdaoust,
de Koumbi Saleh, et d'Azougui, en particulier les mosquees et les quartiers d'habitation. En attendant une
restauration plus consequente, consolider le mihrab et les piliers de la mosquee de Tegdaoust, ainsi que les
deux colonnes du site principal. Faire de m8me a Koumbi Saleh. Ce travail d'entretien des sites peut etre
surveille par les prefectures. Chaque saison des pluies accentue ces degradations.
Villes anciennes:
Pour les villes anciermes, qui s'appretent a recevoir la saison prochaine plus de touristes qu'en
1999, il faudrait envisager une action de nettoyage. De plus:
*   Tichitt : faire un releve photographie et topographique urgent (avant la nouvelle saison des
pluies) des murs et des pans de murs menaces.
*   Ouadane: verifier la solidit6 des murs (notamient au sonmuet) bordant les rues empruntees
par les visiteurs.
*   Chinguetti: mrmes remarques que pour Ouadane.
*   Qsar el Barka et de Rachid: v&rifier et consolider les piliers menaces des mosquees.
*   Ouallata: Organiser un circuit de visite de la ville.
Schkema directeur des villes anciennes et restauration des bfitiments historiques
- 31 -



Une des priorit6s, est la preparation d'un schema directeur pour chacune des quatre villes. Pour
toutes les cites anciennes, prevoir un lieu (bibliotheque traditionnelle ou eco musee) dote d'une
carte-itin6raire et d'une notice sur la ville (l'ideal serait d'y yendre aussi quelques livres). Pose d'un
panneau dans une des rues attenantes aux mosquecs dormant un plan et des infonnations sur ces batiments
que les non musulmans ne peuvent visiter.
Parmi les batiments qui pourraient etre restaures, on peut mentionner:
*   Chinguetti: R6habilitation de l'ancien fort et de ses annexes sur la rive gauche de l'oued pour en
faire un eco musee et un centre pour les cooperatives artisanales de la ville ainsi qu'un centre de
formation aux activites touristiques et artisanales. Amenagement du quartier de la mosquee
(desensablement et balisage).
*   Ouadane  balisage touristique a partir de la rehabilitation des trois portes traditiormelles et
amenagement pour la visite de 1'ancienne mosqu6e (consolider les pilier, nettoyer le mihrab des
pierres eparses).
*   Tichitt : Apres les pluies destructrices de 1999 qui vont susciter l'edification de nouveaux
batiments, mettre sur pied un mecanisme de surveillance architectural (style de Tichitt). Creation
d'un centre polyvalent pour le developpement des ressources naturelles. Appui a la rehabilitation
des Mahadras traditionnelles. On peut egalement envisager la creation d'un petit observatoire de la
desertification avec un batiment destin6s aux chercheurs de passage, travaillant ou s'informant sur
la region. En realite, Tichitt avec son cadre exceptionnel (geologie, prehistoire , histoire) devrait
etre declare parc national et inscrit au patrimoine mondial conmue site naturel.
*   Oualata: creation d'un office du tourisme et de l'artisanat par la restauration d'une maison
ancienne.
Rehabilitation des sites archeiologiques
Des structures qui avaient fait l'objet d'une restauration conservatoire lors de la cloture des
chantiers de fouilles archeologiques necessiteraient certains travaux de consolidation, notamment;
9   Tegdaoust: balisage du site.Eco mus6e portant sur l'arch6ologie en Mauritanie et en particulier
sur les fouilles de Tegdaoust (photos, objets) dans la r6sidence de Tamchakett, bientot abandonn6e
par le prefet qui doit disposer d'un batiment neuf. Une partie des batiments pourrait etre affectes
au tourisme (auberge), une autre a des activites cormunautaires (coop&atives).
*   Koumbi Saleh: 6difier un mur discret pour empecher les chevres de labourer le sol de la mosquee,
et detoumer les eaux de ruissellement. Toutefois, la motivation des autorites et des habitants du
village proche du site (500 m) sur l'inportance du site reste une tiche essentielle.
*   Azougui : surveiller le developpemnent des jardins qui menacent le perimetre fouille et 1'extension
prevue de ces fouilles.
*   Site ndolithique d'Akreijit: prevoir un balisage discret (peinture blanche sur des rochers) pour
signaler la rampe d'acces au village ancien sur la falaise, et un panneau explicatif.
c) Protection et diffusion des manuscrits anciens
Pendant la priparation du projet, un nornbre significatif de proprietaires de bibliotheques
- 32 -



traditionnelles ont et rencontres, a Chinguetti, a Tijikja (Association de 18 proprietaires), a Ouallata
(Centre de preservation de manuscrits realise avec l'appui de la Cooperation Espagnole) et Boutilimit
(Bibhiotheque de la famille Cheikh Siddya, sans doute l'un des fonds les plus importants et les plus
valeureux). Ces contacts ne representent qu'un pourcentage de ce qui existe, eparpil1e dans les villes
historiques ou non, mais ils ont permis de faire un constat de la situation, et des objectifs a poursuivre dans
le cadre de la composante correspondante du projet
Le diagnostic: Malgre les multiples appels a la conservation des manuscrits mauritaniens, appels
aussi largement m6diatises que peu suivi d'effets, tres peu de choses ont 6te faites a grande echelle pour la
protection des manuscrits mauritaniens, a part l'operation de Oualatta financee par la Cooperation
Espagnole. L'Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Scientifiques (IMRS) a commence depuis plusieurs
annees un travail de micro-fichage et de cataloguage, mais qui reste confidentiel et ne constitue pas une
strategie ordonnee de conservation, de cataloguage et de diffusion. Les manuscrits micro filmes y sont d'
ailleurs d'un acces difficile (autorisations, manque de lecteurs de micro films etc). Parallelement, il semble
que sa politique d' acquisition de manuscrits se soit heurtee a 1' absence de ressources et a la reticence, sinon
a la resistance des proprietaires de manuscrits qui n'entendent pas se defaire de leurs fonds, par crainte que
leurs manuscrits ne disparaissent.
L'un des obiectifs priotitaires du Laboratoire d'Etudes et de Recherches Historiques (LERHI)
dependant de l'Universite de Nouakchott, est d'elaborer une strategie et de se doter de moyens, dans le
cadre de ses projets CAMPUS de recherche, pour permettre a ses professeurs-chercheurs de developper une
capacite d'expertise de haut niveau en ce qui concerne les manuscrits, en particulier pour ce qui est de leur
evaluation et des meilleures conditions de leur diffusion aux chercheurs. Cette expertise pourrait etre mise,
le moment venu, a la disposition de cette composante.
A part la constitution de quelques veritables bibliotheques, riches de plusieurs centaines de
manuscrits, et dont les proprietaires ont entrepris a leurs frais un travail de protection et de reproduction,
on constate l'existence de nombreux petits fonds de quelques dizaines de manuscrits, qui sont conserves
dans des conditions extremement precaires qui rendent difficiles leur conservation. Par ailleurs, les
sp6cialistes mauritaniens rencontr6s s'accordent a dire que tous les manuscrits ne sont pas d'egale valeur et
qu'il convient de faire rapidement un tri entre les documents qui presentent un interet au point de vue de
leur substance ou de leur calligraphie et ceux qui ne valent que par leur anciennete. Beaucoup de ces
manuscrits ne sont en fait que la copie i la main de documents tres connus dans le monde arabo-musulman,
et que 1' on retrouve souvent sous forme d'imprimes dans toutes les grandes bibliotheques. Plus interessants
sont evidemment les manuscrits du "Fonds Mauritanien" (dominante de production juridique, d'exegese ou
de compilation de textes classiques, mais aussi des avis (Fetwa et Newazel) centres sur des evenements qui
se sont deroul6s en Mauritanie et comportent de ce fait un interet historique et sociologique evident), ainsi
que les manuscrits arabo-musulmans rares ou inexistants en dehors de la Mauritanie Enfm certain fonds
ont accumutls des documents d'archives historiques de la periode precedant la colonisation ou qui lui sont
post6rieurs, (courriers, documents juridiques) et qui sont des originaux indispensables a la recherche
historique. I1 y a naturellement dans cette composante, comme probablement dans toutes les autres, des
cuvres originales, novatrices, qui meritent d'etre ni-ses en exergue. Apres le droit et ses sources (Coran,
Hadith et les traditions du prophete), la grammaire, la rhetorique, la litterature, la po6sie, la prosodie, le
<<Tasawoof (ou sagesse) et l'histoire constituent la majeure partie du stock restant.
Cependant, en attendant l'inventaire de ce fonds, tout essai de typologie et d'hierarchisations
demeurera hasardeux et incertain.
S'il est indeniable que le fonds Mauritanien a besoin d'etre protege et sauvegarde, c'est au niveau
- 33-



des publications eventuelles que des priorites devraient etre etablies. Dans un premier temps, les aeuvres a
caractere historique ou sociologique, les documents d'archives, tout comme l'ensemble des contributions
novatrices, devraient etre dans la mesure du possible, mises a la disposition des chercheurs.
Le reste devrait faire l'objet d'un tri opere par des specialistes qualifies pour en programmer
ulterieurement la publication, des lors que les moyens n6cessaires seraient disponibles.
Pour ce qui est des ouvrages classiques arabo-musulmans, leur sauvegarde dans l'ensemble serait
fort utile. L'accent devrait toutefois etre mis sur ceux d'entre eux presentant un caractere de raret6 faisant..
de la Mauritanie le seul endroit ou ils se trouveraient depos6s. La Mauritanie pourrait tirer avantage, en
termes d'image de marque et de relations publiques, d'une telle situation et de l'edition 6ventuelle de ces
tresors perdus.
Les conditions de conservation sont g6n6ralement precaires, allant du rangement ordonn6 dans des
boites d'archives disposees sur des etageres, a un amoncellement de manuscrits depareilles dans des
cantines. Quand un local special existe, il n'est proteg6 ni contre les inondations, les incendies, ou les
termites. Le degre d'hydromrtrie n'est pas controle, sinon artisanalement (seaux d'eau pendant les periodes
les plus chaudes dans un coin de la bibliotheque). Beaucoup de manuscrits proteges sont sinplement
empiks les uns sur les autres dans des enveloppes. La manipulation des documents les plus anciens est
evidenument prejudiciable a leur conservation. Le cataloguage, quand il est fait, ne repond g6neralement pas
aux normes scientifiques documentaires, et surtout ne permet pas de constituer une base de donnees
nationale regroupant les fonds et archives de la Mauritanie. Enfin certains cataloguages importants
(inventaire par exemple de C. Stewart pour la bibliotheque ould Harun a Boutilimit a ete fait sur un logiciel
dont le report sur CD est devenu impossible a cause de son anciennete - il reste cependant un modele du
genre).
Objectifs de la composante: Les manuscrits mauritaniens constituent un t6moignage indiscutable
et precieux de l'attachement des Mauritaniens a leur histoire et a leur savoir. Dans le Monde
arabo-musulman, ils constituent la marque originale d'un peuple nomade dont les biens les plus valeureux
6taient constitues par ces manuscrits quelquefois anciens de plusieurs siecles (on a vu un manuscrit unique
au monde d'Averroes par exemple). ls doivent faire l'objet d'une politique de conservation non pas tant a
cause de leur anciennete, mais A cause de leur contenu, et de son interet pour la recherche et la diffusion de
la connaissance, litteraire, religieuse, scientifique, linguistique ou artistique (calligraphie). L'attachement
legitime des propretaires a leur fonds, transnis au cours des gen6rations, exige que toute politique de
conservation soit faite en liaison avec ces propretaires,et sans depossession. Cette politique doit etre la plus
pragmatique possible, pour rester au niveau des besoins imrnmdiats plut8t que de consacrer des sommes
importantes qui risqueraient d'etre dilapidees dans des operations ausi sophistiquees qu'ingerables etant
donne la dispersion des documents.
Les objectifs de cette composante sont donc de (i) de favoriser le regroupement des proprietaires de
manuscrits en associations chargees de la mise en oeuvre de la strat6gie de conservation et de diffusion tant
au niveau local qu'au niveau national (ii) de faire l'inventaire des manuscrits existants (iii) de proteger,
sauvegarder et restaurer les manuscrits et (iv) de publier, reproduire, centraliser et diffuser et diffuser les
manuscrits consickres comme utiles a la connaissance pour en rendre l'acces le plus facile possible aux
chercheurs.
Mise en euvre de la composante: dans le contexte rappele plus haut, le projet financerait des
actions qui sont detailks ci-dessous, pour autant que des associations de propretaires soient constitiu6es.
Cela signifie qu'aucune action ne sera financ6e au b6n6fice exclusif d'un propretaire individuel. Les
- 34 -



regroupements faniihaux seront assimiks aux associations (Famille Cheikh Siddya a Boutilimit par
exemple) pour autant que ces regroupements rassemblent au minimum un niillier de manuscrits. Ces
associations seront tenues de presenter un projet adapte aux circonstances propres de la communaute et au
type de bibliotheque concemres. Les projets seront evalues au point de vue de leur calendrier, besoins
exprimes, et cofits par le Cornite d'orientation avant d'etre transmis au Corite National pour la
Sauvegarde et la Valorisation du Paitnmoine Culturel Mauritanien.
Leprojetpourrafinancer:
La rehabilitation, dans chaque ville, d'un local ( securise et climatise avec un generateur electrique
independant) de l'association des proprietaires de bibliotheques traditionnelles, dans lequel se
tiendront les activit6s d'inventaire et de cataloguage. Le projet mettra immndiatement a disposition
des proprietaires qui estimnent que leurs nianuscrits seront muieux proteg6s dans ce local, des
element de rangement dans une piece reservee a cet effet dans le dit local. Les marches de travaux
seront passes par les associations dans le cadre de l'Avant Projet Sommaire (APS) fourni dans le
projet, sous la supervision du responsable manuscrits du comnite d'orientation. Les APS seront
finances par le projet sur le budget etudes".
La formiation (sous l'egide de l'IMRS de LERHI dans des conditions a elaborer) et le salaire de
deux documentalistes/archivistes par association. Ces agents seront charges de faire l'inventaire
des fonds existants parmi les membres de l'association selon une nomenclature approuvee par 1'
IMRS et I'UNESCO. Ds pourront egalement, en tant que de besoin, faire des operations de
reconstitution de manuscrits depareilles. La selection des archivistes devra avoir recu 1' accord du
SP et de I'association beneficiaire.
IUne fois cet inventaire effectue, le projet financera une expertise qui hierarchisera les documents en
fonction de leur interet. Cette expertise associera les propriftaires mais devra etre appuye par des
experts nationaux (LERHI, IMRS) et 6trangers specialistes de manuscrits (UNESCO, Institut de
Monde Arabe, Fondation Agha Khan, Cheikh Zakhi Al Yamani, Institut des manuscrits de la Ligue
Arabe, L'ISESCO etc).
Des elements de rangement (armoires metalliques, boites-archives etc)  seront fournies aux
proprietaires qui en feront la demande et en nombre correspondant aux manuscrits estimes de
valeur. Les documentalistes/archivistes feront la formation des proprietaires pour ce qui conceme
le rangement de ces manuscrits et les conditions optimales de conservation, y compris protection
contre les predateurs.
Une fois cet inventaire effectue (sur un support permettant la mise en place au niveau des
Associations et a l'IMRS et a LERHI d'une base de donnees nationale) la reproduction des
documents les plus importants sera effectue soit par "scanning, soit par photo digitale - et les
documents seront archives sous forme de CDs Roms, avec possibilit6 d'impression photocopie a la
demande, et avec un systeme de recouvrement des couits aupres des institutions et chercheurs
interesses. Pour ce faire, des ateliers de reprographie, dote de materiels simples et robustes seront
installes dans les locaux des associations gui ont franchi les etapes precedentes Un contrat d'
entretien sera passe lors de 1'achat du materiel de reproduction.
Une utilisation de ce mat6riel pour des fins ne concerant pas les manuscrits sera sanctionnee par I'arr8t
irmmediat du frnancement des documentalistes archivistes.
- 35 -



L'Universite de nouakchott organisera la formation des archivistes locaux, tandig que le LERHI et
lIMRS compileront les inventaires sous forme de CD-roms pour diffusion aux instituts de
recherche dans le monde, y coipris en faisant un site WEB sur les manuscrits mauTitaniens.
Risques: les risques les plus evidents sont: (i) la rehabilitation de locaux inadapt6s, (ii) la lenteur
du cataloguage, (iii) la contestation des proprietaires de la hierarchisation des manuscrits en leur
possession, (iv) la difficulte de faire collaborer l'IMRS et LEHRI, (v) les d6sacords eventuels entre
detenteurs, (vi) les difficultes de les amener a placer leurs fonds dans un local cominun, (vii) la securisation
des locaux communs et des manuscrits en cours de deplacement, (viii) les difficultes de selection des
propositions d'edition, (ix) les problemes hies a la maitrise de la chaine de l'edition, et (x) le d6faut d'
entretien des mat6riels de reprographie. Pour y pallier, le projet, s'assurera de la qualite des APS. Par
ailleurs le Comite designera des experts indiscutables pour evaluer l'interet des manuscrits. Une claire
delimitation des missions de l'IMRS et de LEHRI sera oper6e a l'occasion de l'audit organisationnel de ces
"agences", et les appuis donnrs a celles ci dependront des missions precises qui leur sont attribu6es. Enfin,
tout apport financier cessera pour les associations incapables de tenir en l1'tat leur materiel.
Indicateurs deperformance: ils pourraient etre essentiellement
* Le nombre d'associations reconnues et le nombre de proprietaires regroupes au sein de ces
associations
Le nombre de manuscrits catalogues sur CD Rons par association, et reprographies.
* Le nombre de manuscrits convenablement proteges a l'issue de l'operation, au bout de trois ans.
L'accroissement, sur trois ans, du nombre de chercheurs ayant eu acces aux manuscrits souhaites
* La mise en place, en collaboration avec LERHI, d'une structure de preparation a l'edition
* L'elaboration de criteres pour l'edition (datation, matiere, rarete, public cible, etc), et la recherche
d'une formule de partenariat avec une maison d'edition
* L' edition de collections (historiens, chroniqueurs, "Rahalat" grammairiens, prosateurs,biographies,
encyclopedies, etc)
Composante 2- Promotion des initiatives culturelles (1,50 million de Dollars)
a) Artisan at:
Diagnostic: Le secteur de l'artisanat evolue dans des conditions de travail difficile et precaires.
L'outillage et l'equipement restent insuffisants puisque les artisans n'ont guere acces au cr6dit. L'epargne
reste faible, l'artisan vit au jour le jour. Jusqu'a une periode tres r6cente, cet artisanat etait exclusivement
reserve a l'usage quotidien, et s'il i'est encore, malgre l'evolution de la societe mauritanienne, il est en
perte de vitesse considerable, ne repondant pas aux nouveaux marches, notammnent celui du tourisme, en
plein developpement. II n'est en effet ni competitif au niveau de la qualite ou des suivis de production.
Patrimoine mauritanien a part entiere, I'artisanat traditionnel se d6valorise ou meme disparait. Ces
manques mettent en peril la survie des artisans, et n'apportent pas d'avenir professionnel serieux a des
jeunes createurs potentiels.
La coop6ration allemande (GTZ) en collaboration avec la Direction de l'Artisanat du
Gouvemement Mauritanien travaille depuis quelques ann6es sur la promotion et l'am6lioration du secteur
de 1'artisanat. Ce travail est realise parle projet BAPEM (Bureau d'Appui aux Petites Entreprises en
Mauritanie) mis en place en 1993. Le travail du BAPEM vise a:
*   promouvoir et developper les entreprises artisanales
*   ameliorer les performances professionnelles
- 36-



* former en organisation du travail et en gestion des ateliers
* favoriser a partir des initiatives de base, l'Pmergence d'une organisation artisanale
o   encourager l'6pargne et faciliter l'acces au credit pour permettre l'autofinancement
Etant donn6 l'experience acquise dans ce domaine par le projet BAPEM, il est propose de faire de
ce projet le maitre d'oeuvre de la composante artisanat du projetde valorisation du Patrimoine Cultrel
Mauritanien, prevue sur une duree de 3 ans. Cette responsabilite lui sera confiee par le Comite
d'Orientation, a des conditions definies en accord avec le Ministere du Commerce, du Tourisme et de
l'Artisanat.
Problemes: Ils peuvent etre regroupes sous les categories suivantes:
* Qualite des produits
* Commercialisation, diffusion
*   Organisation
* Moyens financiers insuffisants
La qualite des produits qui n'est pas toujours satisfaisante montre un manque de formation et
d'outillage et l'inexistence d'un controle de qualite ou de label. Le choix des objets est de plus en plus
limite, certains savoir-faire et anciennes fabrications disparaissent totalement (ex. bijoux). Les produits
sont mal adaptes avec une variete insuffisante qui fait preuve de peu de cr6ativite. La production est inegale
aussi bien en termes de quantite qu'en qualite et manque de suivi et de standardisation, a quelques
exceptions pres (ex. tapis MATIS).
Les problemes de commercialisation et de diffusion varient selon les produits et regions. Les
points de vente sont insuffisants ou mal connus. I1 y a pas de formation en matiere commerciale.
L'organisation et la gestion des ateliers est insuffisante. It n'y pas d'organisation dynamique
capable d'initier des changements ou de promouvoir l'artisanat
Le man que de moyens financiers des artisans ne leur permet pas de faire des investissements ou
avoir une tresorerie suffisante pour assurer leurs approvisionnements.
Objectifs: La composante Artisanat du projet de valorisation du Patrimoine Culturel prevue sur
une duree de trois ans comportera les objectifs suivants: L'offre des produits artisanaux sur le marche est
amelioree en terme de: qualite, standardisation quantite et adaptation a la demande des march6s
Les moyens et les actions sont mis en place pour assurer une bonne promotion et
commercialisation des produits:
-      presentation et promotion des produits artisanaux
-      amelioration etlou creation de points de vente
-      organisation etlou participation a des echanges et manifestations
-      am6lioration des connaissances et des pratiques commerciales
* Les artisans maitrisent mieux l'organisation et la gestion de leurs ateliers etlou groupements
* Les organisations professionnelles des artisans sont representatives et participent a la
promotion de l'artisanat:
-      amelioration de la production
-      amelioration des capacites de gestion
-      amelioration de la commercialisation
* Augmenter les ressources financieres pour les artisans

-      en augmentant le nombre d'organismes de credit (CECA)
-      en mettant a leur disposition des fonds supplementaires
-      en participant au soutien et a la perennisation des caisses
Mise en oeuvre: Conformexment a la mise en procedure du projet du Patrimoine Culturel le BAPEM
fournira un programme de travail semestriel au Secretariat permanent. Ce programme sera realise en tenant
compte des suggestions du Cornite scientifique notamment pour garder une bonne coherence avec les autres
composantes du projet Patrimoine Culturel (ex. optiniiser les synergies entre la composante Tourisme et la
composante Artisanat). En cas d'activites non-programm6es mais demandees par les artisans le BAPEM
pourra les integrer dans son programme de travail apres en avoir informe le Secretariat permanent.
Objectif 1: inventaire des besoins ressentis et observes de formations techniques. Mise en place de
formations techniques. Credit pour outillage complementaire. Mise en place d'ateliers de creativite. Visite
des foires (nouveaux modeles et echanges avec d'autres artisans). Mise en place de normes de qualite et
label, avec les organisations professionnelles. Recherche de solutions aux problemes d' approvisionnement.
Les secteurs principaux seront: bijouteries, artisanat d'art, tapis, nattes, groupements feminins (teinture,
couture, henne etc.). Les activites mettront aussi un accent particulier sur l'organisation de l'apprentissage.
Objectif 2: Enquete (par des etudiants, lycee commercial., universites) sur les besoins et demandes du
marche. Edition de catalogues d'objets (ex. tapis, bijoux et objets d'art mais aussi mobilier et coffres etc.)
et des depliants, A terme: creation de sites Internet. Participation/organisation d'exposition vente et foires.
Activite de publicite (tv, radio, joumaux) Mettre en place et/ou retablir des points de vente (a coordonner
avec la composante <creation de maisons d'artisans>). Formation commerciale (marketing, presentation,
accueil, etc.). Mise en place d'un appui (formation et conseil) aux reseaux de conmmercialisation (ex.
MATIS) capable de rassembler et contr6ler des pToductions 6parses pour repondre a la demande en nombre
(cf prealable obligatoire a toute demarche Internet)
Objectif 3 : Formation en gestion/organisation des artisans, Conseil aupres des artisans et des
groupements, Encadrement et formation des emprunteurs. Appui sur les organisations professionnelles des
artisans
Objectif 4: Aide a la mise en place des organisations professionnelles au nouveau Schema National.
Sensibilisation, appui technique aux creations de fed6rations et chamnbres, formation des elus. Mise en
place de procedures de fonctionnement. Appui/conseil par la presence d'un animateur (pour Union, Caisse
CECA etc.) pour la sensibilisation. Lien avec la composante <Maison des Artisans>> pour des locaux
utilises. Appui a la definition de progranmme de travail des organisations professionnelles en incluant
notarnment une participation active de celles-ci a toutes les actions pr6citees
Objectif 5: Appui et consolidation aux caisses existantes. Creation de 4 caisses nouvelles. Deux villes
anciennes (Chinguetti et Ouadane) pourraient avoir acces aux fonds de credit par la caisse d'Atar.
Integration au r6seaux U CECA (Unions des caisses CECA), traitement informatique des donnees
mensuelles a NKT. Appui aux nouvelles caisses par un animateur sur place. Formation des nouveaux
dirigeants des caisses. Dotation en equipement et materiel (cf. <<Maison des Artisans> pour local CECA).
Mise a disposition d'un fonds de credit. Appui pour obtention des fonds BAD et du soutien du projet
AMINA (BAD) et du reseau APROMI, Association des Professionnelles de la Microfinance (PNUD).
Pour la pereimisation des nouvelles CECA et unions d'artisans il faudra prevoir un appui
- 38 -



complementaire au dela des 3 ans prevu de la composante. L'experience faite dans le cadre du projet
BAPEM a prouve que la consolidation et perennisation de telles structures ne seront possible qu'a longue
terme. Le BAPEM  au terme du financement par la coop6ration allemande sera dote d'un statut d'
organisation/ONG de droit niauritanien et pourra continuer a assurer la gestion de fonds supplementaires
et le suivi et consolidation des structures nise en place.
Dans le cadre de la realisation de locaux d'accueil pour les artisans, BAPEM interviendra pour aider a
la definition de programmes et fera part des besoins de locaux commerciaux et de locaux pour les caisses
de credit et d'epargne.
Besoin en personnel: Les objectifs et activites cites plus haut en avant pourront etre realises et controles
en partie par le personnel et le chef de projet du BAPEM. Le recrutement du personnel suppl6nmentaire
suivant sera n6cessaire: 1 coordinateur charg6 des activites du projet valorisation du Patrimoine Culturel,
un secretaire/comptable et 6 animrateurs. Ces aninateurs joueront le role d'appui pour la mise en place des
Unions et la iiise en place et gestion des CECA et l'organisation des fornations et le suivi-conseil aupres
des artisans. Des personnes-ressource (locaux, regionaux, internationaux) apporteront leur expertise pour
des actions plus specifiques (formation, creativite, marketing, etc.).
Regions: La composante Artisanat couvrira les regions suivantes: Gorgol, Adrar, Gidimaka, Odhis,
Trarza, Brakna, Nouadhibou. Les activites seront coordonnees avec le travail du projet BAPEM qui
intervient dans les villes de Nouakchott, Kaedi et Atar.
En dehors des caisses d'epargne et de credit (CECA) deja existantes dans ces trois villes dans le cadre
du projet BAPEM cette proposition prevoit la cr6ation de 4 caisses nouvelles dans les differentes regions.
Le projet cooperera dans la mesure du possible avec d'autres structures d'appui deja existantes (AFVP,
World Vision et autres)
Risques
*   Difficult6s d'approvisionnement en matieres premieres
*   D6veloppement du tourisme insuffisant
*   Non acceptation de la fornation par les artisans
*   R6sistance au changement (qualite, normes de fabrication)
*   Difficultes d'adaptation aux contraintes du systeme epargne/cr6dit
*   Risque de remboursement inconIplet des credit
Indicateurs de performance
*   Plusieurs points de vente sont rentables et satisfont la demande, surtout du secteur du touisme
*   De nouveaux produits ou varietes de produit sont disponible sur les marche
*   Des norrnes et label de qualite sont rnises en place
*   Le nombre d'outils d'inforrnation et de promotion (catalogues, depliants etc.) disponibles.
*   Le nombre de manifestations (exposition de vente, foires etc.) rialisees.
Suivi et perennisation : Le suivi des actions et des indicateurs de performance se fera par le
travail du coordinateur en cooperation etroite avec le projet BAPEM et ses methodes et instruments de
suivi. Le futur statut du BAPEM d'organisme de droit mauritanien pourra assurer au dela du projet de
valorisation du Patrimoine Culturel la perennisation et appui aux structures creees, mais cela suppose la
disposition de fonds pour assurer un cofinancement de ses activites (en complement de la part prise en
charge par les artisans eux-memes.

b) Appui au Tourisme Culturel
Diagnostic: Le tourisme est une vocation recente de la Mauritanie, pays de longue date enclave et
manquant des infrastructures elementaires, routieres, sanitaires ou hotelieres. Plusieurs e1lments ont
progressivement modifie cet etat de fait et "propulse" la Mauritanie sur le marche touristique international
D'abord la quasi-fermeture au tourisme saharien de l'Alg6rie du fait des problemes de securite rencontres
dans ce pays, l'orientation de plus en plus forte du sud Marocain vers un tourisme de masse, ce qui
detourne du Maroc les adeptes d'un tourisme de decouverte, et l'image d'un pays encore vierge vehicuk
par des manifestations largement mrdiatisees comme le Rallye Paris-Dakar. Ce changement s'est
materialise par   l'arrivee de societes touristiques ayant des liens avec des tours-operateurs etrangers,
(Allibert, Nouvelles Frontieres, etc) la creation de soci6tes touristiques proprement mauritaniennes (Dont la
SOMASERT, fihiale de la SNIM), et la multiplication de petites societes ne disposant le plus souvent que
de quelques guides et de vehicules en location. La croissance rapide de ce marche suscite aujourd'hui chez
les apprentis promoteurs touristiques des espoirs de profits incompatibles avec la taille du march6 et le
caractere de tourisme d'elite souhaite officiellement par les autorites mauritaniennes.
Par ailleurs, I'absence de toute reglementation, d'un Schema Directeur du Tourisme, d'un code
deontologique entre promoteurs rationalisant un tant soit peu la concurrence, de toute structure de
concertation Etatl Promoteurs de tourisme, risque, si l' on n'y prend garde, de dormer la priorite au profit a
court terme au detriment de la qualite, seule a meme, dans im secteur aussi volatile que le marche
touristique, de preserver le secteur et d' en autoriser le d6veloppement.
En partie grace a un financement allemand, les autorites mauritaniennes ont entrepris, avec l'appui
d'un cabinet specialise international, la redaction d'unSchbma Directeur National du Tourisme. Celui-ci
devrait contenir toutes les reconniandations habituelles d'un tel document, depuis les itineraires a
privil6gier, des suggestions de protection, la r6glementation des investissements, la fiscalite touristique etc
etc
Objectif: Dans ce contexte, l'objectif d'une sous-composante "Tourisme" au Projet Patrimoine
Culturel vise essentiellement a faciliter la mise en oeuvre d'un Plan National d' action pour le
developpement d'un tourisme de qualite et ainsi permettre une adaptation progressive du secteur sans
sacrifier la qualite des prestations fournies.
Sans prejuger de ce qui fera le contenu de ce plan d'action, il est d'ores et deja possible de prevoir
le fmancement des activites suivantes:
*   Au niveau de la reglementation:
-  Mise en place d'une fiscalite touristique locale et nationale incitative
-  Mise en place d'une reglementation de protection des sites (procedure de classement)
-  Systeme d'homologation des promoteurs touristiques au vu d'une"Charte du tourisme"
-  La mise en place de syndicats d'initiatives dans les villes historiques
*   La mise en place d'un "Conseil National du Tourisme".
-  Regroupant des repr6sentants de la profession et des Tepr6sentants de l'administration pour
discuter des problemes propres au secteur, et mettre en place un systeme d'evaluation de 1'
offre de produits touristiques.
*   Forums Intemationaux
- 40-



-  Le fmancement de la repr6sentation de la Mauritanie dans des Forums touristiques
intemationaux pour diffuser l'image du tourisme Techerch& par la Mauritanie
*   La formation
- De guides
-  De gestionnaires touristiques
-  Des fonctionnaires travaillant dans ce secteur
*   Des documents d'informnations
-  Films, videos, CD roms, sur les produits touristiques mauritaniens
(une serie de guides est en cours d'alaboration avec un financement Cooperation
Francaise)
Mise en oeuvre de la composante: des la finalisation du Schema Directeur National du Tourisme
en Mauritanie, un Plan d'action, reprenant l'ensemble des rubriques evoqu6 plus haut, sera elabore et
listera les actions a entreprendre d'urgence. Tout ou partie de ces actions seront, apres avoir e  chiffrees,
proposees par le Secretariat Permanent au Comit6 Scientifique pour evaluation, puis au Conseil National
pour approbation de fmancement.
Risques: La reglementation sera inoperante sans une forte volonte politique de faire de ce secteur
un secteur de pointe au niveau de la qualite. En particulier, la discrimination entre societes etrangeres, de
longue date imnplantees dans ce secteur, et les societes mauritaniennes qui souvent "decouvrent" ce marche
peut etre une tentation de l'Etat souhaitant proteger les interets mauritaniens. Cette discrimination irait
directement a l'encontre de la mise en place d'une offre touristique de qualite. n conviendra donc de veiller
a ce que les conditions de la concurrence soient equitables.
Indicateurs de performance: Elaboration d'un Plan National d'Action suivant la finalisation du
Schema Directeur et fmancement de tout ou partie de ces actions en fonction de leur priorit6.
c) Activites Culturelles "vivantes".
Il s'agit d'initiatives culturelles vivantes qui seront financees a partir du Fonds de Valorisation du
Patrimoine. La participation financiere du promoteur sera un element important d'evaluation des
propositions ainsi evidemment que rexperience du promoteur de la proposition dans ce domaine.
Sans que la liste en soit limitative, il pourra s'agir de:
1. Festivals, forums, activites de conmmunications, expositions
2. Promotion des traditions orales
3. Publication, films, sites internet, etc
4. Concours de theatre, joutes de poesie,
5. Concerts
6. Appui a la publication de recueils de poemes
7. Participation a des conferences internationales sur le patrimoine culturel, etc
Composante 3 - Renforcement des Institutions (1,16 millions de Dollars)
L'une des taches imnmediates du Conseil National du Patrimoine et du Comite d'Orientation sera
d'explorer les voies et-moyens permettant de mieux faire participer la Direction de la Culture au MCOI,
l'Institut de la Recherche Scientifique (IMRS), I'Universite de Nouakchott et la Fondation Nationale des
- 41 -



Villes Anciennes (FNVA) a la niise en oeuvre de la politique culturelle. L'eligibilite des initiatives
culturelles a un financement sera en particulier conditionn6e par la qualite de la prestation proposee par les
institutions existantes pour assurer le succes de leur objectifs. La p6rennite de toute action en matiere
culturelle depend en effet etroitement de son ancrage dans le systeme institutionnel existant, pour autant
qu'il soit adapte aux besoins.
Une analyse des complementarites et des synergies possibles entre le dispositif institutionnel decrit
ci-dessus et les acteurs de la politique culturelle sera entreprise et sera i la base de leur renforcement, afin
qu'elles jouent pleinement leur rble dans la mise en oeuvre de la politique culturelle.
Pour ce faire le projet financera unaudit organisationnelsous l'autorite du CNP qui fera un " Etat
des lieux >> des institutions existantes: pour (i) definir les mnissions de ces institutions eu egard a la politique
culturelle (PC) telle que voulue par le Gouvernrnent dans sa Communication en Conseil du 30 Mars 2000,
(ii) analyser le role de chacune de ces institutions dans le contexte d'un acconipagnement de la PC plutot
que d'une tutelle et (iii) definir une articulation de ces institutions entre elles pour une mise en oeuvre
efficace de la politique culturelle.
Cet << audit > devrait se faire pour l'ensemble des acteurs en meme temps. n sera fait a partir de
Termes de References proposees par le Secretariat permanent, et evalues par le Comite d'Orientation. Ces
termes de references devront obligatoirement coniprendre une phase de recomnmandations - qui, une fois
approuv6es par le CNP - fourniront la base d'un plan d'action, declinee en activites, en fonmation, en
attribution de moyens humnains ou materiels, etc

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
. MAURITANIA: Cultural Heritage Project
Procurement
Procurement of Goods and Equipment will follow Bank Guidelines on Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,
January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999. Selection of Consultants willbc based
on Bank Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, revised
September 1997 and Jamnary 1999. Mauritania's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any
contrary provisions in local regulations.
The project will bc implemented by the Secretariat Permanent du Comitn National Pour la sauvegarde et la valorisation du
Patrimoine Mauritanien (SP) headed by the Project Manager. The SC is overseen by the Comite National Pour la
sauvegarde et la valorisation du Patrimoine Mauritanien (NCHB) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development,
responsible for coordinating donors activities in Mauritania. The Ministry has already extensive experience with managing
Bank projects and its staff is familiar with IDA procedures. However, given the volume of consultant contracts envisaged
under the project, particularly during the first year of implementation, the SP will be assisted by a (i) Accountart/Financial
Management Specialists and a (ii) Procurement Specialist to monitor procurement activities and ensure timely project
execution.
In Mauritania, all public procurement of works, goods and services on behalf of the state, government organizations, public
enterprises and local govermments should bc procured in accordance to the general rules established by Decree n. 93-011 of
January 10, 1993. Article 56 of this Decree establishes the Central Procurement Comnuission ("Commission Centrale des
Marches") which is in charge of the procurement of all contracts with a contract value equal or exceeding 10,000,000 UM
(appruximately USD 50,000). The Country Pmcurement Assessment Review of February 1999 and an Institutional
Development Grant have both addressed problems with the capacity of the permanent Central Procurement Commission
and provided for its future reinforcement In view of the above, procurement under this project will be carried out by the
Procurement Conunission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED). This Procurement Commission
will work closely with the Project Manager and the Procurement Specialist within the SP. It will expeditiously handle all
procurement matters for the project.
A General Procurement Notice was published in the Development Business and will be updated anmnally for all outstanding
procurements. A timetable listing all procurement: steps will be prepared by the borrower as a condition of effectivenness.
A detailed procurement plan of goods and services is annexed to the Manual of Procedures.
During appraisal, the Govemment submited: (i) the Manual of Procedures including target time periods for various
procurement phases; (ii) the procurement plan for the first year of project implementation; (iii) the program of a one-day
training on the Manual of Pmcedures for ail stakeholder involved; and (iv) the draft contract to recruit the procurement
specialist into the SP, to work closely with the Special Procurement Commission.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the proper monitoring of procurement. The Govemment gave assurances
that it will: (i) use the Manual of Procedures a finalized version of which was submitted and discussed during negotiations;
(ii) use the Bank's standard bidding documents and bid evaluation reports for International Competitive Bidding; (iii) use
the Banks standard request for proposal, evaluation reports and model contracts for the consultant services; and (iv) apply
the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the Manual of Procedure.
The Manual of Procedures was approved during negotiations and was referenced in the Development Credit Agreement.
The Govermment has agreed with the principle that the Manual of Procedures would only be modified with prior IDA
approval. The procurement plan will be updated on regular basis, in particular during semi-annual reviews to compare
target times and actual completion. The Govemment wil also give assurance during the negotiations that it will take the
necessary measures to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following targets periods mentioned below:
- 46-



Procurement phases:                  Maximum time frame:
- Preparation of bidding document   6 weeks (3 weeks for small contracts)
- Preparation of bids by bidders     6-12 weeks (3 weeks for small contracts)
- Bid evaluation                     4 weeks (2 weeks for small contracts)
- Signature of contracts             2 weeks
During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts transmitted to IDA for review
will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan. Procurement confirmation will be collected and recorded as
comprehensive quarterly reports by the Permanent Secretariat: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the
total program, including best estimates of allowances for contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated procurement
actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award and experience with completion time and completion costs for
individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement

2. Prior review thresholds (Table B)
- 48 -



2.1 Goods and works
All contracts for procurement of goods and works costing more than USD 50.000 per contract will be subject to, IDA prior
review. All other contracts will require post review. The review process is expected to cover about 55% for works and 60%
for Goods of the total value of the amount contracted. During the first year of the project, all contracts costing more than
USD25,000 will be subject to IDA prior review. Al contracts awarded by sole source method requires IDA prior review.
2.2 Services and training
Prior review will be required for consultancy services valued at more than USD 30,000 equivalent per contract with firms
and at more than USD 10,000 per contract with individuals. The project audit in any case will be subject to prior-review.
The technical evaluation report will be submitted for IDA non-objection before the financial envelops are opened. All other
contracts wil be subjected to post review. However, this exception for prior review will not apply to amendments of
contracts with firms mising the contact value to USD 30,000, amendments of contracts with individuals raising the contract
value to USD 10,000, to services procured by single-source selection and to assignments of critical nature as detennined by
IDA. The review process is expected to cover 70% of the total value of the amount contracted for consultant services.
Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels wiU apply to about one in three contracts a year.
The project will finance training in archives, documentation, guides, architecture, etc and other relevant fields in the
country and abroad. Programs containing names of candidates, cost estimates, courses, period of training and institutions
selected would be reviewed by IDA at the same time ti reviews quaterly programs of activities submitted to the NCHB. The
Government will also submit a final report not later than three months after the training is completed.
2.3 Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
The IDA credit will be disbursed over a period of three years, taking into account that the Credit's closing date will be 6
months after the completion date. As long as disbursements are made under traditional disbursements procedures, (as
opposed to PMR based disbursements) they would be fully documented at the time of submission of withdrawal
applications, except for expenditures made against Statemrent of Expenditures (SOE).
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs)
Withdrawal applications shall be fully documented for all expenditures against which credit disbursements would be made,
except for the following contracts for which credit disbursement would be based on Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
certified by the Project Manager, (a) goods under contacts costing less than USD 50,000 equivalent each; (b) contacts of
consulting firms costing less than US $30,000 equivalent each or with individuals costing less than US $10,000 each; (c)
incremental operations costs; and (d) training. Documents supporting the SOE shall be retained by the SP and made
available for review as requested by auditors (including technical audits) and by the World Bank supervision missions.
Special account
Traditionnal disbursements: In order to expedite disbursement and ensure that funds for the project are available as needed,
the Government would open and maintain a Special Account for IDA share of eligible expenditure in a Commercial Bank
acceptable to IDA for the duration of the project. The authorized allocations of the Special Account will be USD 500,000
representing about 4 months of project expenditures. IDA will make an initial deposit of USD 250,000 once the credit is
declared effective and the SPP prepares and submits a withdrawal application for the said amount to the Bank. The
remaining balance will be made avaitable as soon as cumulative disbursements reaches SDR 500,000. The Special Account
will be managed by the Project Manager who will be also responsible for certifying disbursement requests.
PMR based disbursements: Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal of an amount of the Credit, the Association
- 49-



shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into the Special Account an amount equal
to the lesser of. (a) the amount so requested; and (b) the amount which the Association has determined, based on the Project
Management Report accompanying said application, is required to be deposited in order to finance Eligible Expenditures
during the six-month period following the date of such repot; provided, however, that the amount so deposited, when added
to the amount indicated by said Project Management Report to be remaining in the Special Account, shall not exceed the
equivalent of Dollars seven hundred thousand ($700,000).
Government counterparts (USD 0.51million)
The Government's counterpart funds needed to cover 90% of local operating expenses including project audit and 10 % of
goods and consultant services will be deposited by the Government in a Project Account at a Commercial Bank acceptable
to IDA. The Government will make an initial deposit of UM 22 miUion (approximately USD100,000) representing about a
year of project expenditures which will be a condition to project effectiveness, and will subsequently replenish the account
on a yearly basis.
Financial Management
During appraisal an action plan for the establishment of a financial management system has been agreed on between the
Bank and the Secretariat Permanent (SP). According to this plan, a system for cash management, accounting, internal
conitrol and financial reporting would be fully in place prior to project effectiveness. The SP will establish a financial
management system, acceptable to IDA, which will provide the SP and IDA with accurate and timely information regarding
resources and expenditures. In addition, before effectiveness a (i) full-time project accountant/financial management
specialist will be recruited, and (ii) an external audit finm will be contracted. The financial management system will include
accounting, financial reporting and auditing elements.
Accounting/Financial Management
During appraisal a certified financial management specialist on the project team has assessed that the internal account
controls for the project are set out in the financial procedures of the Manuel of Procedures which is satisfactory for
providing reasonable assurances that accounts are properly recorded and resources safeguarded. An action plan will be
proposed to set up the financial management system prior to effectiveness. It will be required that (i) a detailed description
of the admninistrative, accounting and financial management system be annexed to the Manual of Procedures, (ii) a
compliant financial management software be purchased for the SC and (iii) its personnel trained in using it. The consultant
assisting the Government in the preparation of the Manual of Procedure will assist the SP in the above tasks strictly
following the time-based action plan annexed to the Manual of Procedures. Setting up the financial management system
and the purchase of the appropriate software are both conditions to effectiveness.
Financial reporting
The SP will provide quarterly activity reports, and will submit them to NCHB with proposed quaterly program of activities.
The annual financial statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with * generally accepted accounting
principles in Mauritania and will include at least (i) a summary of sources and uses of funds, (ii) project balance statement,
and (iii) a statement of the special account The financial statements will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year.
During appraisal it was assessed by a certified financial management specialist on the project team that the project satisfies
the Bank's minimum financial management requirement (see above). However, the project does not have in place an
adequate project financial management system that can provide with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information
on the status of the project using Project Management Reports (PMR) based disbursements. While the assessmernt has found
that the PMR procedures would not be appropriate for the Project initially, there is a procedure to ensure that the systems
put in place are operating effectively. The monitoring and evaluation process will include quarterly activity reports, which
are consistent with the PMR requirements. A time-based action plan has been designed to strengthen the financial
management system and to develop no later than eighteen months after project effectiveness a system acceptable to IDA for
- 50-



the preparation of quarterly PMRs. The financial, procurement and output monitoring systems will be reviewed as part of a
supervision mission eighteen months after effectiveness to assess when exactly it would be appropriate to move to PMR
disbursements.
Auditing
The financial statements of the project will be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The auditor
will provide an opinion on: (i) the project's financial statements; (ii) statement of expenditures; (iii) special accounts; and
(iv) a management report on internai controls outlining any recommendation for improving intemai accounting controls
identified as a resuit of the financial statement audit. The selection of an appropriate auditor is a condition to effectiveness.

* First year tresholds
The project will be managed by the Permanent Secretary (SP), who has fiduciary reponsibilities. He is assisted in
his task by a procurement agent (PA) and an accountant. The awarding of contracts is the responsibility of the
Procurment Commission within MAED. The manual of procedure, which will be adopted during the negotiations,
specifies the responsibilities of each of the parties involved and the profile of the persons who will be chosen.
The credit is a LIL. Therefore the activities will be innovative and not locked in from the beginning. This requires
that the management, policy and control bodies have a significant experience in the implementation of projects
(especially those involving the Bank). Participation in the decision-making process by representatives of civil
society (associations, cultual promoters, etc.), who are not used to being involved in decision-making in
Mauritania, will put the managers of the project under considerable pressure. Moreover, the activities of the project
are of modest dimension (rehabilitation of small buildings, protection of manuscripts, support for rnicro-projects,
organization of cultural activities, etc.), which means that the value of contracts will be low. Despite this the
impact of the success of these operations is important for the future (confidence of the promoters and beneficiaries,
emergency protection actions, apprenticeship in participation, etc.).
The office of the Secretary-General of the Presidency has no experience in project management. The Permanent
Secretariat is a new body which, despite the care taken in setting it up, will not immediately have sufficient
capability to manage, without support, the activities foreseen in the project.
In the light of the preceding remarks the threshold for prior review of contracts will be rather low ($ 50,000 US for
works and supplies and $ 30,000 for consultancy services) and will be even lower during the first year ($ 25,000
- 53 -



US for works and services) in order to penmit the bodies responsible for management to acquire the experience
necessary for the best procedure. Despite this the percentage of contracts undergoing prior review will not exceed
60% for those involving works and services and 70% for those irvolving consultancy services
1Thresholds generally differ by country and project. Consult OD 11.04 "Review of Procurement
Documentation" and contact the Regional Procurement Adviser for guidance.

et ont permis d'aboutir A des propositions et des orientations efficientes A propos du dispositif
institutionnel A adopter en vue d'une meilleure gestion du patrimoine;

*     Des actions educatives ou universitaires ont e  definies, pour permettre une meilleure
integration de la problematique culturelle dans l'education, la recherche et la formation.
+     Le r6le des communautes locales dans la valorisation du patrimoine national a et discute.
II- Strategie de developpement du secteur de la Culture et du Patrinoine
Le colloque a permis d'e1aborer un cadre strategique national concerte pour la gestion du
patrimoine culturel Mauritanien qui tienne compte des facteurs economiques, sociaux et culturels,
de maniere A contribuer A un developpement economique durable, A renforcer la cohesion sociale
et A reduire la pauvrete.
Les actes du Colloque, publies A la fin du mois de Fevrier 2000, constituent le document de
r6f6rence de cette strategie dont les principaux axes suivent:
(i) faire emerger les initiatives culturelles de tous les acteurs concernes (institutions, mais
aussi groupes, ONGs, promoteurs individuels, proprietaires de manuscrits, Municipalites etc) en
mue de proteger et de valoriser le Patrimoine culturel mauritanien, afin qu'il continue ajouer
pleinement son r6le au service de l'identite de la societe Mauritanienne. En effet, malgr6 le
dynamisme des acteurs culturels, ce patrimoine court un risque de degradation physique certain (
monuments, manuscrits) ou meme de disparition lorsqu'il s'agit du patrimoine vivant (poesies,
danses, musiques, artisanat, etc.). En outre, les pouvoirs publics se doivent d'accompagner et
d'encourager le dynamisme culturel tel qu'il s'exprime.
(ii) assurer une meilleure coordination entre les institutions et les administrations impliquees
dans la gestion du patrimoine culturel, et proceder aux adaptations necessaires du cadre
institutionnel, le cadre existant ne pouvant permettre une telle coordination.
(iii) Impliquer les beneficiaires dans la definition des besoins et moyens de les satisfair e,
linteret des bailleurs de fonds etant d'autant plus facile a susciter, que les initiatives a financer
apparaitront comme emanant d'un veritable besoin exprime
Cette strategie pourrait etre deployee dans plusieurs domaines. I1 s'agit en particulier de:
La protection du Patrimoine, par la mise en place d'activites d'inventaires, de recherche,
de conservation (musees, manuscrits) et de rehabilitation (batiments, sites etc.). Des activites de
- 63 -



formation permettront le renforcement des capacites dans ce secteur (conservateurs, archivistes
etc.).
*     La Valorisation du patrimoine, qui comprendra la promotion du tourisme et de l'artisanat
a travers des initiatives culturelles non pernanentes (festivals, publications, expositions, guides,
micro credit pour les communautes locales et cooperatives artisanales).
*     L'Amelioration de la Gestion du patrimoine qui visera essentiellement un meilleur suivi,
et une meilleure coordination de la politique culturelle a travers la mise en place d'une legislation
plus adaptee et la mise en place d'un schema institutionnel et financier telle que decrit ci-apres.
III - Dispositif Institutionnel et Financier
Pour parvenir a une meilleure gestion de notre patrimoine culturel, il est propose, sans pour
autant modifier le mandat traditionnel des administrations et des institutions culturelles
concern6es, de mettre en place un dispositif institutionnel et financier destine a faciliter la mise en
oeuvre d'une politique culturelle visant la protection et la valorisation du patrimoine. Dans ce
cadre, les structures suivantes seront mises en place:
--    Un Conseil National du Patrimoine Culturel, qui sera preside par M. le Ministre
Secretaire General de la Presidence, et dont la Vice-Presidence sera assuree par M. le Ministre de
la Culture et de l'Orientation Islamique. n sera charge de definir, d'orienter et de superviser la
mise en oeuvre de la politique de sauvegarde et de valorisation du Patrimoine et d'assurer la
coordination de l'action des differents deartements concemrs. n1 est informe des financements
demandes au titre de la valorisation du Patrimoine et donne son accord sur le programme
propose. Ce conseil, dont les membres sont nommes par decret, sera assiste par un secretariat
permanent dont les missions sont definies plus loin.
--     Une commission scientifique pour la valorisation du patrimoine, composee d'experts
nationaux et internationaux, des representants des institutions et des promoteurs culturels
(Maires, Associations d'habitants, de proprietaires de bibliotheques traditionnelles, de promoteurs
de tourisme, etc.), choisis par le Conseil National en fonction de leur connaissance du patrimoine
Mauritanien. Cette commission aura pour role d'6valuer le bien fonde des demandes de
promoteurs culturels, en particulier pour tout ce qui conceme l'eligibilite au financement par les
bailleurs de fonds interesses et de donner un avis au Conseil National sur les externalites que
pourrait avoir toute action nouvelle sur la preservation du patrimoine. Copmpte tenu du mandat
et de l'interet qu'accorde l'UNESCO au patrimoine culturel Mauritanien, il sera demande a cette
organisation d'y designer des experts etrangers et de participer a l'animation de cette commission,
selon des modalites a definir.
*      Un Secretariat permanent du Conseil National, Structure legere, il aura pour fonction
de preparer les reunions du Conseil National en lui transmettant les deliberations de la
Commission, et de faire les syntheses et rapports que le Conseil lui demandera. I1 aura egalement
a mettre en oeuvre le financement des operations conformement aux decisions du Conseil. Les .
membres du Secretariat Permanent seront nommes, dans les formes appropriees, par le President
- 64 -



du Conseil et son fonctionnement pourrait etre pris en charge par un ou plusieurs bailleurs de
fonds souhaitant appuyer la politique de valorisation mise en place par le Gouvernenent.
*     EEnfin, un Fonds de Valorisation du Patrimoine pourrait etre cree, et alimente par
lesbailleurs de fonds interesses a financer un certain nombre d' operations jugees eligibles par le
Conseil National.
L'une des taches inimediates du Conseil National et du Comite Scientifique sera d'explorer les
voies et moyens permettant de mieux faire participer la Direction de la Culture, l'Institut
Mauritanien de la Recherche Scientifique (IMRS) et la Fondation Nationale pour la Sauvegarde
des Villes Anciennes (FNSVA) A la mise en oeuvre de la politique culturelle.
Une analyse des complementarites et des synergies possibles entre les trois entites du dispositif
institutionnel decrit ci-dessus et ces trois entites devra etre entreprise afin qu'elles jounet
pleinement leur r6le dans la mise en oeuvre de la politique culturelle.
L'eligibilite des initiatives culturelles aux financement, dependra, en particulier, de la qualite de la
prestation proposee par les institutions existantes en vue d'assurer la realisation des objectifs qui
leur sont assignees.
La perennite de toute action en matiere culturelle sera etroitement liee a son ancrage dans le
systerne institutionnel existant, pour autant qu'il soit adapte aux besoins.
Ceci expose', R estpropose au Conseil des Ministres,
>     de prendre acte des resultats du Colloque
>     de ratifier le principe des modalites institutionnelles de coordination et de mise en oeuvre
de la politique culturelle
>     de mandater les responsables du Ministere de la Culture et de l'Orientation Islamique, de 1'
IMRS et de la FNVA pour identifier les synergies entre leurs actions et une politique culturelle au
sens large, ainsi que les moyens indispensables a ces synergies.
>     de donner mandat au Ministre des Affaires Economiques et du Developpement, au
Ministre de la Culture et de l'Orientation Islamique et au Comite de preparation du Colloque pour
preparer les textes correspondants et negocier avec les bailleurs de fonds qui ont manifeste leur
interet, les modalites de leur intervention.
