MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Madagascar - Cotton
Development Project (Credit 1433-MAG: SF 008-MAG)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Madagascar
Cotton Development Project (Credit 1433-MAG; SF 008-MAG)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office.
The project did not achieve its objectives. Madagascar cotton production in recent
years decreased substantially due to a sharp decline in the world market price of cotton and fixed
nominal producer prices combined with devaluation of the local currency. The project is rated as
unsatisfactory, its sustainability as unlikely and its institutional impact as negligible.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) is comprehensive and informative. While no
comments on Parts I and Im were received from the Borrower, it prepared its own Project
Completion Report which is available in the project files. An audit is planned jointly with two other
investment projects in the agricultural sector and an agricultural sector adjustment operation (ASAC).

COTTON DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1433-MAG: SF-008 MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Madagascar Cotton
Development Project for which Credit 1433-MAG in the amount of SDR 7.5 million (US$7.9
million equivalent) was approved on December 22, 1983, and Special Fund Credit SF 008-MAG
in the amount of SDR 9.4 million (US$9.9 million equivalent) was approved on December 22,
1983. Both credits became effective on August 31, 1984, a delay of less than three months.
Credit 1433-MAG was closed on June 30, 1990, two years behind schedule; the last disbursement
took place on July 3, 1991, at which time an amount of SDR 10,012.87 was canceled (0.1
percent of the credit). Credit SF 008-MAG also closed on June 30, 1990, two years behind
schedule; the last disbursement took place on May 24, 1991, at which time the undisbursed
balance in the amount of SDR 25,618.55 was canceled (0.3 percent of the credit). 1/ Parallel
financing in the amount of FF 86.3 million (US$11.3 million) was obtained from the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique. At the time of closing of the IDA credits, FF 49.6 million
(US$6.6 million) had been disbursed from the CCCE loans.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III) was prepared by
staff of the Agricultural Operations Division of the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department,
Africa Regional Office and staff of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP), who
visited Madagascar in June 1991. The PCR is based on project documentation such as the
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreements, project correspondence, supervision reports, etc. The
Borrower was sent a copy of Parts I and III of the PCR on April 3, 1992. However, the
Borrower did not provide a Part II. _/

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MADAGASCAR
COTTON DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1433-MAG: SF-008 MAG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    At the time of project preparation in 1981-82, agriculture contributed about 40% of GNP and
over 80% of export earnings, supporting directly over 80% of a population of about 9 million.
Sector performance had been disappointing during the 1970s. There had been sluggish growth in rice
and livestock production, and a rapid decline in industrial crops, notably sugar and groundnuts.
Production declines were the result of economic policies which increased state intervention and
included the nationalization of processing industries, the establishment of public marketing and
banking monopolies, and enforcement of controlled prices.
2.    Agricultural Development Strategies were reviewed in 1982-83 by the Government following
discussions with the Bank and the donor community; it was envisaged that a more favorable economic
environment, through divestment from unsuccessful parastatals, more incentive producer prices,
improvement of rural infrastructure, and selective support to private enterprises should be promoted.
Also, urgent recovery measures for the rice, cotton, coffee and livestock sub-sectors were planned
for the 1983-85 period. Government policy regarding the cotton sub-sector was fragmented as two
different ministries were responsible for it. The new policy, supported by the Project, aimed at
encouraging production to meet the demand of the domestic textile industry through adequate prices
and improved access to credit for producers.
Project Objectives and Description
3.    The main objective of the project was to increase cotton production in Madagascar in order
to meet domestic cotton fiber demand. This was to be achieved principally through increasing seed
cotton production from 1982 levels of some 26,000 tons to about 45,000 tons, by increasing yields
on existing areas and by extending cultivation through the development of a further 8,000 ha.
Production was to be undertaken by smallholders and large private farmers.
4.    To attain its objectives the project included: (i) provision of equipment and vehicles to
replace and expand existing pools and so improve yields and extend areas planted with cotton; (ii)
construction of workshops and stores to maintain equipment and vehicles, and ensure input supply;
(iii) rehabilitation and maintenance of cotton roads to improve communications for input supply and
marketing; (iv) provision of farm inputs to maintain and improve productivity; (v) adaptive cotton
research and pre-production trials aimed at boosting yields and improving production techniques; (vi)
technical assistance to HASYMA (cotton parastatal) and SAMANGOKY (cotton and rice producing



- iv -
irrigation parastatal), training of their personnel and strengthening of HASYMA's data processing
system; (vii) monitoring and evaluation of project activities; and (viii) studies.
Implementation Experience
5.    Implementation started in 1983 following the successful arrangements for parallel financing
from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE, a French aid agency). Disbursements
from the IDA credits proceeded swiftly until mid-1987 when over 90% of the credits had been
disbursed.  Most of the project activities had progressed rapidly except for the cotton tracks
rehabilitation component which suffered numerous and lengthy delays. Services provided under
technical assistance were generally considered satisfactory and the training component was fairly
comprehensive and particularly useful. A number of studies were financed. As a result of research
supported under the project, three improved cotton varieties have been disseminated since 1992 that
have higher yields and better fiber quality.
6.     While project execution thus proceeded swiftly, with disbursements well ahead of schedule,
two issues arose, which in the end, proved detrimental to the project, to the institution in charge and
to the cotton sector as a whole. First, while cotton production progressed rapidly in the first three
project years from 23,000 tons to over 40,000 tons, it was not immediately realized that this increase
resulted almost exclusively from an extension of cotton cultivation in rainfed areas, often on marginal
lands, while yields actually declined.
7.     Second, the macro-economic environment turned sharply negative for the cotton sub-sector
during implementation. At the time of project preparation, in 1982-83, Government had just
introduced several economic adjustment measures in order to reduce excess demand and thus
inflation, and to liberalize some prices. For the cotton sub-sector, this meant that local textile
companies were free to vary both quantities and prices for cotton bought from HASYMA (although
a mixed Government/industry committee was supposed to review pricing decisions), whereas
HASYMA was obliged to buy all the seed cotton from farmers, and at prices fixed at the beginning
of the planting season. These potential commercial and price risks actually came to bear in 1985/86,
when world market prices fell drastically (from US$1,656/ton to US$1,091/ton); textile companies
supplied themselves largely on the world market, leaving HASYMA with large unsold stocks, which
made the latter financially insolvent. The large devaluation of the local currency in 1987 (by 80%)
again made domestic cotton competitive but, although local fiber prices were well below export parity
prices, the Government obliged HASYMA to supply local mills first (at below world market prices)
before they could export cotton. To date, HASYMA has not yet fully recovered from the financial
repercussions of these policies.
Project Results
8.    On the basis of the PCR mission's assessment of costs and benefits an economic analysis was
carried out on the production sector component, which resulted in an economic rate of return of 5%,
as compared to 30% estimated at the time of appraisal. This discrepancy was caused by the lower
than expected yields, resulting from poor varietal performance and poor ginning outturn, lower than
expected cotton prices and high investment costs relative to production. The project also failed to
set up a viable institution for the cotton sub-sector, as the financial situation of HASYMA has
considerably worsened during the project period and this parastatal is still technically insolvent.



v -
Sustainability
9.     Coton Production. The future of cotton production is threatened by technical, economic, and
institutional factors. Partly due to insufficient research, pest infestation is on the rise, particularly
in the North, which affects both fiber quality and production costs. Thus, the viability of large scale
intensive production is jeopardized; a number of large farms are diversifying out of cotton, to tobacco
in particular. Soil erosion in the South has resulted in decreasing yields, which inter alia also has
affected the viability of rainfed farms; the need to integrate cotton into sustainable cropping systems
is not yet understood by farmers and HASYMA's efforts in this direction are still inadequate.
10.   Institutions. While it is most likely that, well organized, large farms could do without
HASYMA, peasant farms are dependent on its services for credit, input supply, extension and
marketing. In spite of HASYMA's recent, and apparently successful efforts to establish farmers'
associations at village level to take over their share in such services, they will still need an integrated
organization to support them.  Indeed, efficient pest control requires that all growers follow
recommendations on time, which implies that they can find and afford the required chemicals. Thus,
the link between extension, supply and credit appears essential, and for sometime at least, only a
marketing body can realistically offer the requisite credit facilities. The latter, however, does not
constitute a justification for the continued support to HASYMA, as independent producer associations
could take over part or all of its role. HASYMA requires massive capital injections and a major
reorganization to be viable. The present wait-and-see policy, delaying a financial solution, is
precipitating its collapse, with potential harmful effects on peasant farmers.
Lessons Learned
11.    The experience from this project shows that:
(a)    The project was aimed from the beginning at providing more domestically produced
cotton fiber to the local textile mills, as such, it fitted with the prevailing self-
sufficiency and exchange rate policies. Both Government and HASYMA failed to
adjust themselves when these policies changed;
(b)    Liberalization of a sub-sector cannot be introduced in half measures. A situation
where consumer prices are liberalized while producer prices are fixed is a
prescription for disaster. This was the case when HASYMA was faced annually with
falling prices for its fiber, while being held to predetermined prices for the seed
cotton bought from farmers;
(c)    Supervision was insufficient to detect in time the mediocre performance of HASYMA
in the field. The upswing in seed cotton production in the 1983/85 period disguised
the declining yields, which in turn were caused by poor variety performance and poor
plant protection measures. Furthermore, ginning deficiencies led to poor fiber
quality. The continuous presence of a cotton specialist in supervision missions could
have detected these deficiencies at an earlier stage; and



- vi -
(d)   In-depth studies were carried out on the restructuring of HASYMA following the
1986-87 events, with few results despite donor pressure for change. It was agreed,
however, that HASYMA could take independent marketing decisions for its fiber,
and export cotton if it could obtain better prices. Due to the mediocre quality of its
production, this has not yet happened.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name: Cotton Development Project
Credit No.:   1433-MAG; SF 008-MAG
RVP Unit:    Africa
Country:     Madagascar
Sector:      Agriculture
Sub-Sector:  Industrial Crops
2.    Background
The Agricultural Sector
2.1    At the time of project preparation in 1981-82, agriculture contributed about 40% of GNP and
over 80% of export earnings, supporting directly over 80% of a population of about 9 million. The
dominant crop was rice, followed by cassava, with much of the population also dependent on
livestock production. The most important cash and export crops were coffee, which represented
almost half of total export earnings in 1980, and cloves and vanilla which earned another 20%.
Other important cash crops -sugar, cotton and tobacco - were not exported.
2.2   Sector performance had been disappointing during the 1970s. There had been sluggish
growth in rice and livestock production, and a rapid decline in industrial crops, notably sugar and
groundnuts. Madagascar became a net rice importer and rice imports exceeded 350,000 tons in 1982.
Production declines were the result of economic policies which increased state intervention and
included the nationalization of processing industries, the establishment of public marketing and
banking monopolies, and strict enforcement of controlled prices, which acted as a disincentive.
2.3   The Cotton sub-sector, involving some 20,000 families in farm production and about 10,000
persons in the textile factories and garment manufactures, formed a major economic activity in
Madagascar (33% of the value-added in the industrial sector). Production started in 1958 on large
plantations in the northwest (Mahajanga), and developed rapidly after 1968 on smallholdings in the
southwest (Toliara) i/, reaching a peak of 37,000 tons of seed cotton in 1977. Thereafter, price
3/    These two regions are referred to below as "the North" and "the South".

disincentives and supply difficulties contributed to a sharp decline to 26,000 tons in 1982, which was
below the needs of the industry (about 40,000 ton), forcing the latter to import fiber at substantially
higher costs. A parastatal, HASYMA (Hasy Malagasy), was created in 1979 and charged with cotton
processing and marketing, input supply, extension, and sub-sector coordination and planning.
2.4    Agricultural Development Strategies were reviewed in 1982-83 by the Government following
discussions with the Bank and the donor community; it was envisaged that a more favorable economic
environment, through divestment of unsuccessful parastatals, more incentive producer prices,
improvement of rural infrastructure, and selective support to private enterprises should be promoted.
Also, urgent recovery measures for the rice, cotton, coffee and livestock sub-sectors were planned
for the 1983-85 period. Government policy regarding cotton, fostered manufacturing, but not farm
production, there being two ministries for the cotton sub-sector. The new policy, supported by the
project, aimed at encouraging production to meet the demand of the textile industry through adequate
prices and improved access to credit for producers.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1    The project was to support Government's cotton development program, which was aimed at
expanding seed cotton production over a four year period from 1982 levels of around 26,000 tons
to about 45,000 tons, thereby saving foreign exchange expenditures on cotton fiber imports.
Increases in production would be achieved by increasing yields on existing areas and by extending
cultivation through the development of a further 8,000 ha. Smallholders and large private farms
would contribute to these increases in production in about equal proportions. The project included
the following components:
(a)    provision of equipment and vehicles to replace and expand existing pools and so
improve yields and extend areas planted to cotton;
(b)    construction of workshops and stores to maintain equipment and vehicles and ensure
input supply;
(c)   rehabilitation and maintenance of cotton tracks to improve communications for input
supply and marketing;
(d)    provision of farm inputs to maintain and improve productivity;
(e)    adaptive cotton research and pre-production trials aimed at boosting yields and
improving production techniques;
(f)   technical assistance to HASYMA (cotton marketing parastatal) and SAMANGOKY
(cotton producing irrigation scheme in Mangoky), training of their personnel and
strengthening of HASYMA's data processing system;
(g)    monitoring and evaluation of project activities; and
(h)   studies.



4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture (MPARA), with assistance from IDA
missions in 1981 and 1982, and submitted in June 1982 for consideration by the Bank. It was
appraised in November 1982 by the Bank with the participation of a representative from the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The project was scheduled to extend over four years,
and expected to cost US$34.4 million, of which US$7.9 million were to be provided by an IDA
credit, US$9.9 million by an IDA special credit from the Special Fund, US$11.3 million by a CCCE
loan, and the remaining US$5.3 million by the Government and farmers. Most investments were to
be made in the first two years. Monitoring and evaluation activities, and the envisaged studies on
HASYMA's role and performance and on cotton development prospects were to provide indications
as to what further action should be taken. The need for improved subsector coordination and pricing
mechanisms had been observed at appraisal. The establishment of a sector coordination committee
was therefore made a condition for effectiveness, and assurances were received at negotiations that
pricing proposals would be submitted yearly to IDA, and that prices would be maintained at about
90% of border prices.
4.2   Primary responsibility of the project was given to HASYMA. Created in 1979, HASYMA
was seen as fairly professional, albeit managerially weak, and given much autonomy by the
Government. It was financially vulnerable, since the controlled prices for seed cotton and fiber left
little margin to recover processing and marketing costs. The Government was to give HASYMA a
substantial capital injection as condition of credit effectiveness. The Center for Agricultural and
Rural Development Research, FOFIFA, was made responsible for applied research.
4.3   In retrospect, project design had not properly addressed some of the major risks identified
at appraisal. The need for a healthy economic and institutional environment had been understood,
but the measures proposed for price fixing and sector coordination were inadequate and in practice
only rarely followed. In addition, the analysis of project risks did not take into account the country's
rapidly evolving economic situation and ignored the possible effects of the liberalization measures on
the sub-sector and HASYMA.
5.    Project Implementation
General
5.1   The Credit Agreement was signed on March 5, 1984 and became effective on August 31,
1984, a delay of slightly less than 3 months. This delay in effectiveness was the result of the longer
than anticipated time needed to establish the Cotton Sector Coordination Committee (CSCC).
Implementation started in 1983 following the speedy arrangements made for CCCE financing. When
the IDA and Special Fund credits became effective, most project activities, except for the cotton
tracks rehabilitation component, were already operational and progressing rapidly.
5.2    During the project implementationperiod the Malagasy Franc depreciated dramatically against
the US$. The exchange rate changed from around FMG 475/US$ at the time of appraisal, in 1983,
to around FMG 1,500/US$ in 1990. Also, in 1985-86, during project implementation, the world
cotton price fell from US$1,656/ton in 1984 to US$1,091/ton in 1986. This exacerbated the financial
difficulties experienced in the cotton sub-sector.



- 4 -
5.3    The credit was extended twice beyond the original closing date of June 30, 1988 --the first
time to June 30, 1989; the second time to June 30, 1990-- mainly to permit disbursement under the
delayed cotton track rehabilitation and maintenance component. Also, studies reviewing HASYMA's
role and the restructuring of the sector needed to be finalized.
5.4    The last disbursement of Credit 1433-MAG took place on July 3, 1991, at which time an
amount of SDR 10,012.87 was canceled (0.1 percent of the credit). The last disbursement of Special
Fund Credit SF 008-MAG took place on May 24, 1991, at which time the undisbursed balance in
the amount of SDR 25,618.55 was canceled (0.3 percent of the credit). 4/
5.5    Based on financing provided by IDA and CCCE, actual project costs were about 80 percent
of estimated costs (US$27.5 million actual versus US$34.4 million estimated). The project received,
however, an unknown amount of financing from the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for
training (para 5.7) and from the IDA financed Agricultural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1691-MAG) for
agricultural inputs (para 5.5).
Implementation of Individual Components
5.6    Supply of equipment and farm inputs.  Prior to IDA credit effectiveness, inputs and
equipments were procured using funds available under the CCCE loan, which allowed for a quick
start-up of project activities. Tenders for agricultural equipment and trucks for the transport of
cotton, financed under the IDA credit, were adjudicated in June 1985 and the bulk was delivered in
early 1986. Due to financial difficulties experienced by some farmers at the time, part of the
equipment was not taken up. These were sold back, with IDA's approval, to local distributors at
cost. Also, as part of a new policy from HASYMA to delegate services to the private sector, the
trucks were sold to financially viable private transporters, who progressively took over all cotton
transport. Starting in October 1984, farm inputs were procured regularly in early fall for the next
campaign, first with IDA credit funds, then with foreign exchange resources made available under
the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1691-MAG). A planned revolving fund for inputs
was never established. The procurement of the mobile workshops and increased storage capacity for
HASYMA were delayed and finally canceled following the financial difficulties of HASYMA and the
decline in cotton production after 1986. The acquisition of an aircraft for aerial spraying was
maintained, after delays, although there is little evidence that it was ever really needed.
5.7    Rehabilitation/maintenance of cotton tracks. This component suffered numerous and lengthy
delays. The feasibility studies, which could not be completed at appraisal, were finalized by mid-
1985, and the works started in 1986 for the South, and in 1987 for the North. Following the decision
to extend the credit beyond June 1988, the undisbursed funds for track rehabilitation were reallocated
to the maintenance program; two brigades were equipped in 1987/88, but started operating, on a
small scale, only during the summer of 1990. Problems in the implementation of this component
seem to have arisen from insufficient studies, inadequate monitoring of the works, and HASYMA's
lack of experience in road maintenance.
4/    The last disbursements took place more than one year after closing, as a result of
administrative delays at the level of the Central Bank in Madagascar.



5.8    Technical assistance and training. The project employed a total of 11 foreign specialists, of
whom 4 were funded under the IDA credits (Table 6-D). Their services were generally considered
satisfactory, although a number of those experts were seconded to organizations that virtually ceased
to grow cotton (SAMANGOKY, SODEMO), which reduced the impact their contribution could have
had on project objectives. The provision of financial/management experts to HASYMA did not
prevent accounting irregularities and major management problems. Training, mostly funded by the
FAC, was fairly comprehensive (Table 6-E). The IDA funded study tour to Zimbabwe, Mali and
Burkina Faso was particularly useful to initiate the debate on sector restructuring and the
reorganization of extension along a participative approach relying on farmers' associations.
5.9    Research. Although a protocol was signed in September 1985 to define their respective
responsibilities, relationships between HASYMA and FOFIFA were never good; the former taking
over tasks, mainly because FOFIFA was not in a position to undertake them. FOFIFA's contribution
was limited to genetic improvement, a work which was boosted with the secondment of a breeder by
the French Cotton and Textiles Research Institute (IRCT), in 1987. Of the numerous strains
introduced from West Africa, two or three varieties will be disseminated in 1992. Due to their
higher yield, improved ginning output and fiber quality, they could give a boost to cotton growing
in Madagascar. For pest control, HASYMA did much to constantly update control packages through
systematic screening of new formulas. In addition, technical assistance was obtained from AST
consultants (Mauritius) for work on residual effects of pesticides, and on resistance build-up of
Spodoptora littoralis. Pest control research lacked continuity and guidance, and, given the seriousness
of that issue, it is unfortunate that plans to secure a cotton entomologist, first under IDA, then under
FAC funding, never materialized. Also, more research would have been advisable to arrive at more
specific recommendations, particularly for fertilizers, as well as to promote diversification from
cotton monocropping on peasant farms in the South.
5.10   Studies. Between 1987 and 1991, a number of important studies were carried out on
HASYMA's financial situation, on the broader sub-sector situation, and on possible restructuring.
These studies were financed by CCCE, FAC, and IDA. They led to a major restructuring of
HASYMA whereby, a) cotton producers in the north were given the freedom to set up their own
ginning and marketing channels; and b) HASYMA became a mixed company and got the freedom
to market its cotton internationally. However, no financial restructuring was approved which has
serious consequences for the restructuring process, as HASYMA is technically bankrupt.
5.11   Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation plans were only finalized during
supervision missions (July 1985), and the intended baseline survey was never carried out because of
the reorganization of HASYMA in 1985. Instead, starting in 1991, a series of information notes
were prepared for annual reports. These included comprehensive data on production, credit, output
and cultural practices by area. Such data was computerized and statistically analyzed for possible
correlations between practices and yields, demonstrating in particular the importance of early
planting. Little is known, however, of the farming systems in which cotton farmers operate and of
their evolution with the expansion of cotton in the mid-eighties. Thus, an evaluation of direct project
impact is not possible.
5.12   The information collected was not always the most relevant, or was not sufficiently analyzed
for the purpose of drawing strategic indications. For example, it was often mentioned that prices had
been increased for the following season, but with no reference to local inflation and FMG
depreciations. A quick investigative analysis would have sufficed to evaluate the real bearing of the



- 6 -
price change, and make relevant recommendations. More generally, better monitoring would have
highlighted earlier the need for changes in the pricing system, possibly minimizing HASYMA's
losses. Similarly, the declining trend in yields during project implementation should have been seen
much earlier. Actual yields were always much below SAR projections, and this should have triggered
their careful monitoring. It is likely that an analysis of available yield data, including comparisons
between new and old farms, late/early planted fields, etc. would have given the necessary insights
in order to take timely remedial action.
Financial Situation of HASYMA
5.13   As a condition for credit effectiveness, the Government strengthened HASYMA's financial
position with a cash injection and an increase in equity. Initial supervision missions ensured that
prices were fixed at levels which guaranteed positive returns to the company. In 1985, as a result of
a bumper crop, high fixed producer prices, a domestic market in recession, and falling world market
prices, HASYMA was forced to export with high losses, which were aggravated by delays in
obtaining export permits. Production has declined significantly since, but the cost of services and
processing, can no longer be covered by the price differential between fiber and seed coton. Having
also lost heavily on the CCCE loan as a result of foreign exchange risks, HASYMA is now
technically bankrupt. Measures proposed by IDA and CCCE to improve HASYMA's financial
situation, including the formal attribution by Government of counterpart funds to increase its capital,
have never been implemented.
Sub-sector Oreanization and Management
5.14   The Cotton Sector Coordination Committee (CSCC) was created in August 1984, as a
condition for credit effectiveness. It was expected to convene frequently during the first year to
review project goals and operations. After a first meeting in January 1985, the Committee was not
convened again until April 1987, after which it met on average once a year until April 1990.
Discussions were always limited to price fixing, and the Committee never took on the coordinating
role between consumers and producers of cotton, for which it was originally created.
5.15   Pricing system. It was envisaged at appraisal that producer prices would be based on border
prices (about 90% of import parity), and annual price proposals would be presented to IDA for
discussion. When it was realized that the country would soon become a net exporter, IDA missions
in 1984-85 suggested that the reference be changed to export prices. In practice, however, prices
were decided by the CSCC, following recommendations made by HASYMA and discussions with the
textile manufacturers.
5.16   When world prices plummeted in 1985 and 1986 (from  US$1,656/ton in 1984, to
US$1,409/ton in 1985 and US$1,091/ton in 1986), producer prices were kept constant while prices
to the industry dropped, with HASYMA taking the heavy losses. After 1986, when world prices
recovered and the Malagasy Franc underwent a series of devaluations, producer prices were not
sufficiently increased. These artificially low prices were benefitting the local textile industry at the
expense of farmers and HASYMA. However, HASYMA had little bargaining power as the
Governmnent policy was to protect the local industry and to allow exports only when all its needs were
satisfied. In short, HASYMA became the victim of a pricing system, that was fundamentally non-
viable, with fixed producer prices, and varying selling prices.



- 7 -
5.17   Sub-sector restructuring. It was clear, in 1987, that HASYMA's financial problems could
not be settled without major reforms. Both CCCE and IDA pressed HASYMA and the Government
to propose a subsector reorganization and supported or undertook the requisite studies. Discussions
revolved around the need for a central organization, the price fixing mechanism, and cotton marketing
strategies. Until now, Government proposals have been in favor of a status quo, with allowances for
HASYMA to decide freely on cotton sales and pricing policies, and for private producers to
participate in HASYMA's capital and have a say in its industrial and commercial management.
Pending its financial restructuring, HASYMA is merely surviving and staff is demoralized. Many
operators in the sub-sector are determined to reduce their dependency on HASYMA.
6.     Project Results and Impact
6.1    Cotton production. As a result of project activities, which quickly eased farm mechanization,
input supply and transport constraints, and because of initially favorable producer prices, cotton
production increased from 26,000 tons in 1983 to almost 43,000 tons in 1985, close to the final
appraisal target of 45,000 tons. The production increase was entirely due to area increases, mainly
in rainfed areas, and was accompanied by a sharp decline in yields. After HASYMA decided to
retain only the better farmers and limit their area to what they could properly cultivate, production
fell to 27,000 tons in 1987. Thereafter, in spite of an exceptionally good year in 1989, production
has been stagnating at around 31,000 tons. There is no decisive evidence yet that the control on area
expansion has translated into improved yields.
6.2    Farmers' situation. In the North, large cotton farms in the flood recession system represented
over 60% of national production before the project. With mostly stagnating yields and areas, their
present share has slightly declined to about 55%. Without the project, their production would have
certainly regressed further; however, with increasing production costs, particularly for pest control,
their viability remains doubtful, particularly for those still indebted for the equipment bought under
the project. Besides those farms, a new class of peasant farmers (about 2,000) has emerged, which,
under a less intensive flood recession system, produce at much lower cost. These peasant farmers
have directly benefitted from the project.
6.3   In the South, irrigated cotton cultivation, formerly at par with rainfed cotton cropping, has
almost disappeared, mostly to the benefit of rice, where irrigation was adequate. This was the case
on the SAMANGOKY scheme where cotton yields had dropped, due to poor water and pest control,
especially on the large state farms, to below 1 t/ha in 1985. By contrast, rainfed cotton production
increased from 5,600 ha in 1983 to almost 24,000 ha in 1986, with yields dropping from 0.9 t/ha to
0.57 t/ha respectively, during the same period. This uncontrolled development resulted from
attractive prices, pressure from local politicians on HASYMA and credit institutions enrolling
candidate growers with no experience in farming. Since then, areas and yields have fluctuated around
12,000-15,000 ha and 0.7 to 0.9 tlha respectively. A strict selection process was then exercised,
which eliminated most of the smaller farms, and concentrated production on some 4,000 farmers,
raising the average cotton area per farm from less than I ha in 1984 to about 3 ha at present. Little



-8 -
is known of the situation of the 9,000 or so cotton growers who dropped out after a year or two. I/
The remaining growers, although their yields remain generally poor, seem to have less difficulty in
reimbursing their seasonal loans: repayment has increased from 67% in 1987/88 to 87 % in 1989/90.
6.4    Financially, gross margins of cotton produced on large farms in the North have been eroded
from US$416/ha in 1983 to about US$186/ha in 1990 (see Table 4 in Annex). On the basis of the
farm model gross margins to small farms in the South were approximately US$93/ha in 1990 (down
from US$265/ha in 1983).
6.5    HASYMA's financial situation has considerably worsened after a short-lived improvement
in 1983/84. In summary, HASYMA is burdened by excessive debt in relation to assets and
consequently there has been a constant depletion of equity (see Table 2 in the Annex). There are a
number of reasons which appear to have led to this excessive debt burden: inappropriate price
structure, excessive borrowing, inadequate protection against foreign exchange risks on the CCCE
loans, weak management and overcapacity in ginning (65,000 tons). However, as a result of project
activities in training, technical assistance and the availability of some counter part funds, HASYMA's
capacity to service cotton growers, particularly small farmers, has improved.
6.6    The situation of the textile industry worsened sharply during the first years of the project, as
a result of a drop in demand on the local market: annual consumption of fiber per capita declined
from 1.5 kg in 1979 to 1.05 kg in 1985. One of the three major Malagasy textile companies,
Sumatex, had to close down in 1986 _/ and, in spite of significant protection, the situation of the
other two has remained precarious until now.
6.7    Environment. The project had no direct effect on the environment in the North, where the
substantial area expansions envisaged in the Staff Appraisal Report for the large plantations were (and
still are) effectively opposed by villagers and local politicians. The expansion of rainfed cotton in
the South, however, with no crop rotation, no organic restitution and no particular care in tractor
ploughing, has resulted in decreased soil fertility and, locally, in serious soil erosion.
6.8   Institutions. The project clearly failed in setting up viable institutions for the sub-sector.
HASYMA's future is uncertain, and there is no general agreement regarding its possible
restructuring. The Committee created by the project never fulfilled its role, and has virtually ceased
to exist.
6.9    Economic returns. On the basis of the PCR mission's assumptions of costs and benefits, an
economic analysis was carried out on the production sector component. 7/ The analysis resulted
5/    At least officially; in fact, a number of them continue to grow cotton using seeds and
other inputs from registered growers which accounts for, inter alia, lower planting
density than required for both types of planters, and for wild plots where pest
infestation is not monitored.

in an economic rate of return of 5%, as compared to 30% estimated at the time of appraisal. This
discrepancy was caused by lower than expected yields, resulting from poor varietal performance and
poor ginning outturn, declining international cotton prices and high investment costs relative to
production.
7.     Project Sustainability
7.1    Cotton Production. The future of coton production is threatened by technical, economic, and
institutional factors. Partly due to insufficient research, pest infestation is on the rise, particularly
in the North, which affects both fiber quality and production costs. Thus, the viability of large scale
intensive production is jeopardized; a number of large farms are diversifying out of cotton to tobacco
in particular. Soil erosion in the South has resulted in decreasing yields, which inter alia also has
affected the viability of rainfed farms; the need to integrate cotton into sustainable cropping systems
is not yet understood by farmers and HASYMA's efforts in this direction are still inadequate.
7.2    Institutions. While it is most likely that, well organized, large farms could do without
HASYMA, peasant farms are dependent on its services for credit, input supply, extension and
marketing. In spite of HASYMA's recent, and apparently successful efforts to establish farmers'
associations at village level to take over their share in such services, they will still need an integrated
organization to support them.  Indeed, efficient pest control requires that all growers follow
recommendations on time, which implies that they can find and afford the required chemicals. With
the need to often change technical recommendations, the link between extension, supply and credit
appears essential, and for sometime at least, only a marketing body can realistically offer the requisite
credit facilities. The latter, however, does not constitute a justification for the continued support to
HASYMA, as an independent producer association or a strengthened agricultural extension service
could take over part or all of its role. HASYMA requires massive capital injections and a major
reorganization to be viable. The present wait-and-see policy, delaying a financial solution, is
precipitating its collapse, with potential harmful effects on peasant farmers.
8.     IDA Performance
8.1    Details of staff inputs by the Bank during appraisal, negotiation, and supervision, and data
on supervision missions are provided in Part III Table 8.
8.2    The project was regularly monitored in 1984 and 1985, and the supervision missions during
this period were clearly helpful in speeding up procurement procedures, and in getting the difficult
cotton tracks component on the move. However, they failed to see that the increase in production
through area expansion had excessively stretched HASYMA's supervision capacities, which affected
yields and farmers' repayments. The first agriculturalist to participate in a supervision mission came
only in September 1986, two years after credit effectiveness, and too late to sound a warning.
8.3   It was realized early on that local sales were shrinking but this was not seen as a threat, since
exports were thought to be viable. The 1986 world market glut could hardly be foreseen. The real
bottleneck was the price mechanism, which had been designed at a time when the economy was



- 10-
artificially insulated from outside influences. This issue was never seriously reconsidered after
appraisal. It is fair to say that, although this had been seen as crucial at appraisal, it was thereafter
given inadequate attention. Renewed interest on this issue should have been triggered when the need
to export fiber became a reality in 1985.
8.4    Cooperation between the two co-financiers has been most successful in allowing an early start
to the project, which was essential to its objectives. In 1987, both agreed on the need for radical
institutional changes, and financed complementary studies, but delays in the implementation and
sometimes conflicting conclusions or perceptions of such studies did not always permit the co-
financiers to present a firmly united front in their recommendations. IDA, which focused on
production and primary marketing, lacked a global view of the sub-sector and could not effectively
monitor prices and recommend relevant changes.
9.     Borrower's Performance
9.1    The main project implementing agency --HASYMA-- has, given the social, economic and
political context in Madagascar in the mid-eighties, performed its technical responsibilities fairly well,
although not cost-effectively. Supplies were adequate and timely. Difficulties in marketing and
custom tractor services were resolved by gradually delegating such services to the private sector and
successfully promoting draught cultivation. Much was done to take over research responsibilities
from the deficient FOFIFA. The present drive to set-up strong farmer organizations, although late,
is also impressive. The lack of rigor in farmer selection and supervision during the expansion phase,
as well as the still pervasive lenience in quality classification, may be largely imputed to pressure
from local politicians.
9.2    The Borrower has been fairly supportive of the project, particularly during the expansion
phase. However, insufficient attention was paid to the long term effects of the pricing policy. There
is no doubt that the financial difficulties of HASYMA are largely due to the Borrower's reluctance
to reconsider the pricing system, as well as to its inability to take financial remedial action, as
suggested by IDA/CCCE, following the steep drop in the price of cotton in 1985 and 1986. Lengthy
delays in delivering export permits for excess cotton production aggravated the situation.

ANNEX 1

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Assumptions and Methodology
1.    The main quantifiable economic benefits resulting from the project investments have
consisted of increased production of seed cotton. Cotton production is sold, after ginning, to the
domestic textile industry. The PCR mission has assumed that the project has reached full
development. The appraisal estimated annual incremental production of 19,800 tons of seed
cotton attributable to project implementation has not been achieved. The PCR estimate of
incremental annual seed cotton production (Table 6a, Main Text), is based on the fact that most of
the area expansion occurred in rainfed areas and encompassed areas which were not suitable for
cotton farming. Farmers in these new lands were mostly unfamiliar with cotton and thus obtained
lower than average yields. The PCR mission estimates that the incremental annual production
peaked to over 10,000 tons during the years 1985 and 1986, thereafter stabilizing at 5,000 tons
per annum. This is worth about US$3.05 million at the farmgate equivalent import parity price.
2.    There are other benefits which cannot be fully captured within this economic analysis, for
example the forward and backward linkages of regional development in cotton production and
manufacturing areas. Also, other benefits can be derived from research and development
expenditures. Investments in studies in the cotton subsector has resulted in human resource
development which eventually will result in higher productivity and new productive potential
(which could also be transferable to the non-cotton sub-sector).
3.    For the purpose of the economic analysis (see Table 3a, b and c) the foreign exchange
was shadow priced to the US$ at FMG 600 for 1983 and 1984, and FMG 700 and 750 for 1985
and 1986 respectively (the prevailing rates were FMG 430 for 1983; FMG 576 for 1984; FMG
662 for 1985; and FMG 676 for 1986). For the other years (1987-1990) the FMG rates to the
US$ were annual averages and these corresponded to the free and real exchange rates. For the
calculation of economic benefits, the project benefits were valued at the Import-Substitution
Economic Farmer Reference Price. The CIF prices (North Europe annual average price of cotton
of equivalent quality) were obtained from the World Statistics of cotton published in the Bulletin
of the International Cotton Advisory Committee (see Table 3a). Transportation costs were
obtained from various supervision reports and/or other sub-sector studies. Ginning costs were
obtained from HASYMA. Non-economic costs, such as taxes and other transfers, were excluded.
4.    The economic cost of farm production of seed cotton has been estimated by calculating the
total cost of input use per ton of seed cotton. To this cost was added the weighted average cost of
land preparation; labor; on farm transportation; input application; cultural practices; and
harvesting on a per kilo of seed cotton basis.
5.    All the project capital costs, as financed by IDA and CCCE, have been included into the
analysis. The HASYMA contribution to the road rehabilitation component (so-called cotton
tracks) was excluded as benefits to other sub-sectors can also be derived from this investment.

Other Indicators
6.    The project sought to improve the financial situation of HASYMA, the nationalized
parastatal which is the executive arm of the Government, responsible for the cotton sub-sector.
The SAR described the poor performance of HASYMA as being due to both input and output
prices having been low in relation to import parity price levels and the margin between them had
been insufficient to cover costs. It therefore recommended that price fixing should be tied to
border prices in order to reflect external prices and to provide both appropriate rewards and
stimuli for efficiency. This recommendation has not been realized during the last four years
(1987-1990). In Table 1 the nominal protection coefficient (NPC) for cotton lint during project
implementation has been estimated. It appears from the analysis that the Government has been
protecting, during the years 1987 to 1990, the domestic textile industry which is the main user of
domestic cotton. The analysis suggests that the main production objectives may not have been
sustained, due to low producer and fiber prices. The pricing policy adopted has served to
reinforce the position of textile manufacturers whilst undermining the position of producers and
HASYMA. The analysis of Table 3a shows that prices for seed cotton set over the years had
remained at low levels (except for 1985 and 1986) in relation to the border prices.
7.    The financial situation of HASYMA remains precarious (see Table 2). In summary, the
serious problem is associated with an excessive debt burden in relation to assets, and
consequently, the depletion of equity. However, it can be noted that there has been a slight
improvement in total debt to total assets in 1989. This has been mainly due to the revaluation of
the main assets, which increased the total capital worth of the company. Nevertheless, the debt
burden remains at a high level, the normally accepted level being about 50%. It now threatens
the survival of the company. Major problems have arisen from the size of investments (ginning
and transportation equipment) during the early 1980s and a combination of price policy and low
capacity utilization (the highest was in 1986 at 63% capacity utilization) have not permitted the
company to generate sufficient funds to cover operating costs and to service debt. The increase in
FMG value of the CCCE loan as a result of the devaluation of the domestic currency has also
contributed to the poor financial situation.
8.    HASYMA has also been burdened by other losses. Clients who have purchased fiber and
cotton seed and cotton producers who had obtained credits from HASYMA have not paid up. In
the case of fiber, the large majority of losses are attributable to one state-owned enterprise,
SUMATEX. With regards to producers, some of the credit failure is attributable to the drought
of 1986, or to having planted on lands unsuited to cotton production. Other losses amongst
cotton producers result largely from the provision of aerial spraying services on credit that are
subsequently not honored by the beneficiary.
9.    It is doubtful if HASYMA, even with the most optimistic of assumptions concerning the
future, could resolve the financial problems that have developed. The management of the
company has attempted to control costs, improve its delivery etc. However, the issue of high
debt servicing will continue to present difficulties for a long-term solution. In addition, it remains
very doubtful whether HASYMA as a monopoly parastatal company could ever be made to be
cost efficient.

Results
10.   On the basis of the above assumptions the cost and benefit flows of the cotton
development project up to year 2009 result in an ERR of 5% (see Table 3). This is lower than
the appraisal estimate of 30%. The main factor contributing to a lower ERR has been the lower
than expected yields in the extra area under cotton.
11.   The most likely risks associated with the project were, amongst other factors, insect-pests
risks, and the risks associated with the failure of Government to maintain incentive levels of
producer prices. The analysis of Table 3a demonstrates that, over the years, prices set had not
remained at levels approximating the import parity price. The PCR mission identified that
production risks associated with climatic and high pest incidence together with the failure to
maintain adequate producer price incentive levels and the inherent financial difficulties of
HASYMA have minimized the overall impact of the project.
