PROJECT FOCUS, DESIGN AND RATIONALE
A principal objective of the Government of Western Samoa (the
Government) in the energy sectot is to reduce the country's dependence
on imported oil by giving priority to the development of indigenous
energy resources.   In accordance with the Government's policy,  the
Electric Power Corporation (EPC) proposed to construct the Afulilo
Hydroelectric Project (AHEP) which will result in substantial foreign
exchange savings through substitution of diesel-based electricity
generation by hydroelectricity, especially during the dry season when
generating capacities of the existing run-of-river hydropower schemes
are reduced or have to be shut down, necessitating the running of diesel
generating sets which are more expensive to operate. The Project is
designed to provide 4 MW of firm hydro-generating capacity and up to 24
GWh of hydro energy througa utilization of the water stored during the
wet months in the AfuliLo reservoir, thereby making it possible to
reduce the operation of the expensive diesel-based generating sets.
The Project includes: (1) construction of a dam, spillway,
pipeline and surge chamber, powerhouse and tailrace; (ii) provision and
installation of generating equipment and associated auxillary equipment;
(iii) construction of transmission lines; (iv) provision of consulting
services for engineering design and construction supervision; and (v)
provision of the services of a technical review expert.
The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$17.2 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is US$13.59 taillion and
the local cost is US$3.61 million. The Project will be financed by thA
Bank (US$5.4 million), International Development Association (IDA)
(US$3.0 million), an European Investment Bank (EIB) loan (US$1.54
million) and an European Economic Community (EEC) grant (US$5.745
million) for financing the foreign exchange cost and part of the local
cost of the Project. The balance of US$1.515 million will be provided
by the Government and EPC. Implementation of the Project will begin in
January 1987 and it will be completed by October 1990.
The hydroelectric energy from the Project produced primarily
during the dry season (about six months per year) will be fed into EPC's
Upolu power supply system from October 1990. The Project will provide
up to 24 GWh of hydroenergy annually, and a capacity benefit up to 4 MW
for the Upolu sl.item as the energy demand and the load in the system
increase. The Project will benefit the entire population of the country
through relatively lower cost electric power and long-term savings of
foreign exchange. The financial equalizing discount rate (MEDR) and the
economic equalizing discount rate (EEDR) of the Project are estimated at
15.0 per cent and 13.1 percent respectively. The fiuancial internal
rate of return (FIRR) of the Project taking revenue at the existing
tariff as the binefit is estimated at 11.7 per cent and the EIRR at 11.0
per cent. The Project is not subject to any significant technical,
economic or financial risks.
In addition to the proposed loan, a technical assistance grant
of US$200,000 will be provided for strengthening EPC's internal auditing
and accounting capabilities. Besides, the Government will, through use
of EEC grant funds, undertake a revaluation of EPC's assets and a tariff
study, and will arrange for extensive training of a number of Samoans in
engineering with a view to eventually replacing expatriate staff at EPC.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Electricity was introduced in Western Samoa in 1951, and until
1982 it was primarily generated from imported diesel oil. The high cost
of diesel fuel led the Government to take action to reduce the country's
dependence on diesel  fuel  for  electricity  generation.   Because  of
Government  action  taken  earlier,  between  1982  and  1985  three
run-of-river hydroelectric plants with a capacity of 6.9 MW were added
to the Upolu power supply system to substitute diesel-based power
generation during the six wet months of the year. The proposed Afulilo
Hydroelectric Project is designed to displace diesel oil generated
electricity primarily during the six dry months of the year.   ThA
proposed Project will be the first storage hydropower plant development
in Western Samoa.
2.        Following the Government's request to the Bank for financing
for this Project, a Bank Fact-Finding Mission visited Western Samoa in
May 1986, followed by an Appraisal Mission from 8-19 September 1986.
The Appraisal Mission was composed of S. Rungta, Senior Financial
Analyst/ Economist (Mission Leader), A. Ganesan, Project Engineer, D.
Pangestu,  Financial  Analyst,   M.  L.  G.  Faelnar,  Counsel,  and  R.
Casinadter, Staff Consultant on geo-technical matters. This report is
based on earlier studies and findings of the Mission in the field.

II, BACKGROUND
A. Government Energy Policy and Programs
3.        The Government's energy policy aims at the development of
indigenous sources of energy to substitute for petroleum imports,
promoting competitive pricing in oil supply, and conservation of energy
through demand management. The Government, under UNDP/World Bank aegis,
is cooperating with other Pacific island countries in examining and
evaluating current procurement and supply arrangements for petroleum
products in order to develop practical options for promoting competition
in oil supply so as to minimize its import and distribution costs. The
Government's domestic pricing policy for petroleum products encourages
careful use of transport vehicles, the main users of imported petroleum
fuel. The Government is planning to conduct a survey of energy use in
the transport sector with the objective of formulating possible measures
for minimizing energy demand in the sector.
4.        In the electricity sector, the Government's policy aims at
meeting the demand for electricity with a reasonable degree of
reliability at an  economic  price.   The  Government  also has  given
priority to the development of indigenous, renewable energy sources to
reduce dependence on imported diesel fuel and to a continuing program
for improvement of the distribution system in order to minimize
distribution losses. The Government's policy also aims at the extension
of power supplies to rural areas and rural industries as dictated by
economic and resource capability.
5.        Several activities are ongoing in the renewable energy sector
such as the development of a hot air generator which utilizes
agricultural residues for crop drying, and an externally financed pilot
project to be operated by Electric Power Corporation (EPC) for
demonstrating the. feasibility of biomass gasification for rural power
generation in the Pacific region. Solar energy is used in a limited way
for water heating, rural lighting and communication. A comprehensive
study of the energy sector carried out under a Bank technical assistance
granct I/ was completed in September 1985.  The Government's energy
policy and programs mentioned above are in consonance with the
recommendations of this study.
B.   Energy Resources
6.        In Western Samoa, biomass and hydropower are the two main
indigenous energy resources in the foreseeable future, although their
potential has yet to be fully identified and investigated.   The country
has substantial natural forest cover (54 per cent of the land area), and
the Government is pursuing active afforestation programs on both Savaii
and Upolu, aidedl by finance from the Bank 2/ and New Zealand.  No
hydrocarbon deposits in the country have been found as yet. The known
geothermal resources ir. the country are small and too isolated to be
useful. The solar regime is favorable, but at present the economic use
of solar energy is largely limited to water heating applications.
I/  T.A. No. 580-SAM approved on 29 December 1983.  For a list af
available studies, see Appendix 1.
2/   Loan  No.  507-SAM(SF):  Forestry  Development  Project  (US$1.74
million) approved in December 1980.

8.        The data in Table I illustrate the importance of biomass fuels
which accounted for 77 per cent of final energy consumption. Net per
capita consumption in 1983 was estimated at 0.51 toe, which was
comparable to other Pacific island countries such as Solomon Islands
(0.44 toe) and Vanuatu (0.53 toe). The demand for petroleum products
fell from a level of about 35 megaliters in 1980 to 31.7 megaliters in
1981. It has stagnated since then because of the economic slowdown in
the country.   The transport  sector  is  the  largest petroleum user,
accounting  for  65  per  cent  of  the  total  petroleum  used.   Power
generation used another 24 per cent, but the petroleum requirements of
EPC have been steadily declining as the program to increase hydro
generation continues. EPC s petroleum consumption in 1986 is estimated
to be about one-half of that of 1983.  Future petroleum demand is
expected to grow at 2 per cent, biomass demand at 2.5 per cent
(including increased demand for process heating), and electricity demand
at 4 per cent per annum (see para 21).

C. Energy Sector Organization
9.        After the oil price shock of 1973, the Cabinet established the
National Energy Committee (NEC) in 1976 to provide support to the
Government units responsible for energy planning and policy formulation.
From 1976 to 197° the NEC functioned largely as an ad hoc committee with
the involvement as necessary of various government departments and
without a central administration.   In 1979 NEC was expanded, and a
full-time Secretary was appointed to coordinate committee business under
the Prime Minister's Department with the Prime Minister as the
Committee's  Chairman.   However,  after  1982  NEC  conducted  little
business, and activities in the energy sector did not proceed with a
definite policy direction.
10.       In 1984 Cabinet reorganized the NEC. into the Western Samoa
Energy Committee (WSEC) composed of the Prime Minister (Chairman), the
Secretary to the Government (Deputy Chairman), the Financial Secretary-
Treasury, the Director-Agriculture and Forestry, the Director-Economic
Development and the Director-Public Works Department to review and
approve energy policy measures and to decide on principal issues arising
in the energy sedtor. Support to WSEC is provided by a WSEC Working
Group (WSEC-WG) and the Energy Planning Unit (EPU).  The WSEC-WG is
comprised of officers drawn from the government departments whose
principal officers are members of WSEC, and is responsible for the
execution of WSEC's decisions. EPU is attached to the Prime Minister's
Department and has responsibility for energy planning and for
formulation of energy policy. However, EPU currently had only one
staff, which is not adequate for carrying out EPU's functions
effectively. Energy data have not been updated since 1983. The Lank
has urged the Government to strengthen the staffing of EPU and another
Samoan trained in energy is expected to join EPU soon.
D. The Power Subsector
11.      EPC,  a wholly Government-owned  statutory corporation,  was
established in 1972. It is an autonomous body governed by a Board, of
which the Minister of Public Works, who is also the Deputy Prime
Minis.er, is the Chairman. The Board has six other members including
representatives frtu the business sector aud the legal profession.   The
General Manager of EPC has the executive role in supervising and
coordinating the functions of EPC.
12.       EPC is responsible for electricity supply in Western Samoa.
EPC provides about 80 per cent of Western Samoa's electricity; the
balance is provided by a small number of licensees. 1/
Generating Facilities
13.      At  the  end of  1985,  EPC's  installed generating capacity
amounted to 20.9 MW, 2/ comprising a combination of run-of-river hydro
plants (8.5 MW) and diesel plants (10.9 MW) on Upolu Island, and diesel

plants (840 kW) and a gasifier plant (600 kW) on Savali Island (see
Appendix 2). The major portion of EPC's total energy sales (97 per
cent) is done through the Upolu system.  EPC has difficulty in the
maintenance of its diesel plants due to lack of spare parts and trained
technicians.  Several engines now cannot be used continuously at full
load, and EPC has derated its diesel generating capacity by about 3.0 MW
(see Appendix 2).
14.       The Upolu system at present is supplied through a mix of
diesel and run-of-river hydroelectric plants with a total installed
capacity of 19.4 MW. These plants include two 1.8 MW diesel sets 1/ and
one 1.6 MW run-of-river hydro plant at Fale-Ole-Fe'e 2/ which were
financed by the Bank.  Owing to the considerable difference between wet
and dry season river flows coupled with negligible storage, the outputs
of the existing hydroelectric plants are severely restricted during the
dry season. 3/
Transmission and Distribution Facilities
15.       At the end of 1985 EPC's transmission and distribution system
included about 788 route-km of overhead transmission and distribution
lines and about 4.5 km of underground cables.  EPC's trausmisesion
system is standardized at 22 kV with primary distribution at 6.6 kV and
2.2 kY. EPC's system currently has about 22 MVA of substation capacity
(see Appendix 3).
System Operation
16.       A summary of EPC's operations during 1985 is shown in Table 2
below:

17.       Of the combined losses of about 16 per cent, station auxiliary
use and high voltage (HV) transmission losses account for about 5 per
cent, while technical losses at the distribution level including meter
errors account for 6 per cent, and non-technical losses such as
unmetered supplies and meter  tampering for  5 per  cent.   With  the
measures being taken by EPC for improved metering, rigorous inspection,
meter calibrating facilities and additional staff, the total losses are
expected to reduce.
E.   Power Market
18.       About 65 per cent of the population on Upolu Island receives
electricity supply.  During the period 1961 to 1979, electric energy
sales in Upolu grew at about 10 per cent per annum. In 1980 peak power
demand in the Upolu system was 5.8 MW, and energy sales in the Upolu
area was 23.7 GWh against total generation of 31.0 GWh.  The combined
effect of recession and a large tariff increase in 1981 reduced growth
in energy sales to about 2 per cent between 1980 and 1982. Electric
energy sales in the Upolu area grew at 3.9 per cent in 1983, 8.5 per
cent in 1984 and 4.0 percent in 1985, reflecting higher levels of
economic activitj and the growth of medium-scale industries and
commercial establishments on Upolu island during these three years.
Electric supply was also extended to more domestic consumers.   The
relatively large 8.5 per cent growth in electric energy sales in 1984
was due to a large increase in demand from the new Mormon temple. In
1985 the Upolu system peak demand reached 6.26 MW, and energy sales in
that system were 28.71 GWh against total generation of 34.34-GWh, which
represented a system load factor of about 63 per cent. These data are
summarized in Table 3 and details are given in Appendix 4.

'9.       The first full year of electricity supply operations in the
Salelologa system on Savaii Island was in 1979. Immediately following
the introduction of the new supply, II/ very rapid growth in electric
energy sales occurred in the Salelologa system as nuppressed consumer
de-iand was relieved. In 1983 and 1984 energy sales in the Salelologa
system - unlike sales in the Upolu system - were negatively affected by
the country's economic recession.  By 1985 electricity sales in the
Salelologa system had recovered. In 1985 the Salelologa system's peak
demand was 280 kW, and energy sales in that system were 0.82 GWh against
total generation of 1.02 GWh which represented an average system load
factor of about 42 per cent.
20.       1982 was the first full year of metered sales for the Asau
system on Savaii Island. Sales in the Asau system have been growing
fast. In 1985 the sales amounted to 0.267 GWh compared with 0.051 GWh
in 1982. Under assistance from the United Nations Capital Development
Fund, work is underway to extend transmission lines to bring access to
electric supply to some 70 per cent of the Savaii population by 1987
compared to about 58 per cent at present.
21.       EPC regularly reviews and revises its demand forecast.  The
current demand forecast was prepared in 1985 and covers the period
198'-1990. Electrical energy consumption in Western Samoa is dominated
by hotels, industry and commercial enterprises (see Appendix 5).
Developments expected in the near future include upgrading of the
Faleolo airport facilities, a copra oil refinery, two new major hotel
complexes, a fish processing plant and a few large commercial buildings.
The establishment of an industrial free zone and a fruit processing
plant are also envisaged. The completion of even a single major hotel,
e.g., the one promoted by Nauru (326 rooms), will increase energy demand
in the Upolu system by as much as 15 per cent. With these factors in
view, and taking into account historical trends, forecast GNP and
population growth rates of 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, an
income elasticity of demand of 1.5 per cent and some positive price
effect, an average growth rate of about 4.0 per cent per annum in peak
demand has been forecast by the Mission and concurred with by EPC for
the Upolu system during the period 1986-1995. The average system load
factor is expected to remain at about 63 per cent, and system losses are
conservatively assumed to be 15 per cent. On the basis of the above,
the projected demand for the Upolu system is shown in Table 4.  The
energy demand in the EPC system on Savaii Island where a major
transmission line expansion is currently underway, is forecast to grow
at an average rate of about 12 per cent per annum, and is expected to
reach 1.6 GWh by 1990.

for 2x60 kW diesel sets at Asau in the northwestern part of Savaii.
However, these sets were subsequently installed at Salelologa.

F.  Power Development Program
22.       The power development program for the Upolu system for the
period 1986-1995 based on least cost options was pr&epared by EPC with
the assistance of Bank technical assistance Consultants and reviewed by
the Mission (see Appendix 6). The main features of EPC's development
program for the Upolu system are discussed in the following paragraphs.
The Upolu system, though small in size, will feature by 1990 a mix of
generation plants consisting of run-of-river hydro, storage hydro and
diesel plants.  In 1985, the Upolu system had a derated installed
capacity of 16.02 MW, with a wet season firm capacity of 11.22 MW end a
dry season firm capacity of 5.8 MW. The Upolu system capacity and
energy availability is adequate to meet the energy demand during the wet
season, but during the dry season the available firm capacity is
insufficient to meet the peak demand.   Consequently,  the need for
additional capacity for meeting both energy requirements and peak demand
is considered urgent.
23.       Several alternatives for generating energy in the dry season
have been invest!gated with the aim of displacing high-cost diesel
generation. The options considered included substitution of diesel oil
by coconut oil, dual fuel engines to burn a mixture of wood gas and
diesel oil, wood-fired steam turbines, the Afiamalu pump-assisted
storage scheme and the proposed Afulilo hydropower storage schet%e. The
substitution of diesel oil by coconut oil was not actively pursued
because it was found to be uneconomic. The proposed construction of a
wood-fired plant is now considered technically infeasible since a
continuous supply of the required quantity of wood to fuel the plant
cannot be assured. The Afianalu pump-assisted storage scheme was also
found to be uneconomic (see para 31). Consequently, a key feature of
the Upolu system's operations will be the use of the proposed Afulilo
scheme for storage of water during the wet season for use during the dry
season  fot  generating  hydroelectric  energy  to  supplement  the
run-of-river hydroelectric energy supply which would otherwise be
limited by the reduced streamflow in the dry season.



9
24.       By 1991 Upolu system's available capacity is planned to be
increased by 4.0 MW, with a dry-season firm capacity of 8.8 MW and an
expected peak demand of 8.0 MW.  The supply of energy to the Upolu
system will then be largely derived from plants using indigenous
renewable hydro energy sources, with the diesel capacity serving as
standby reserve capacity for operation only during peaking and emergency
conditions.  In 1991 it is estimated that the diesel sets will be
required to produce only about 0.41 GWh.
25.       A 600 kW gasifier/diesel engine generating project for Savai'li
Island is under consideration and is expected to be funded by EEC.
26.       The existing transmission system on Upolu Island has adequate
capacity  to  convey  the  energy  output  of  the  various  generating
facilities to the load centers. Although the 25 km long transmission
line from Apia to Ta'elefaga is a vulnerable link in the system, EPC has
the capability to quickly repair any transmission line fault.  The
proposed upgrading of the transmission line from 22 kV to 33 kV between
Tanugamanono and Lalomauga will enable the voltage in the system to be
maintained at a satisfactory level when transmitting the full power
output of 3.5 MW from Lalomauga and the proposed additional 4 MW output
from Afulilo. However, when the Vaipu basin is developed to produce
another 4 MW output (see para 31), then it will be necessary to
construct an additional transmission line. Meanwhile EPC is undertaking
with its internal resources the rehabilitation of old sections of the
transmission and distribution lines to improve reliability of suppl"
(see para 77). EPC's distribution system is adequate to cope with the
present demand, and will be expanded by EPC with its own resources to
meet the increasing electricity demand.
G.   Project Area
27.       The proposed Project is located on the island of Upolu (see
Map 1). The Afulilo reservoir lies between the Fagaloa Divide in the
north anid the Afulilo south saddle on the Fagaloa volcanics.   The dam
site is at an elevation of about 350 meters. The energy output from
this Project will serve Upolu Island where most of the country's
population lives. This island is also the seat of Government, and most
of the country's industrial and commercial establishments are located in
it. Apia, the capital city of Western Samoa with a population of about
34,000, is located on the northeTn coast in the central part of the
Island.  Aria is the only major urbJn area in Western Samoa and contains
the country's main harbor. Apia is served by an international airport
at Faleolo which is 35 km away. The runway and landing facilities of
the airport have recently been upgraded to meet expected tourist growth
in the coming years. EPC's Upolu system currently serves about 8,150
consumers representing about 65 per cent of Upolu's population.
28.       Western  Samoa's  economy is dominated by agriculture, but
manufacturing  activities,   comprising  food  production  and  light
industry have steadily increased. Most of the manufacturing enterprises
are concentrated at Vaitele, an industrial estate located about eight km
from Apia.   Commercial establishments,  including a number of large
hotels catering to the increasing tourist traffic together with a number
of religious and charitable organizations are sizeable consumers of
electricity in Apia.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objective
29.       The principal objective of the Project, which conforms with
the Government's long-term energy policy, is to develop an indigenous
renewable energy resource for generating electricity at an economic cost
to displace high-cost diesel-generated  electricity.   The electricity
output of the Project will be used largely to supplement electricity
generated from run-of-river hydropower stations during the dry season
when low streamflows reduce electricity output from such stations and
high-cost diesel-generating sets have to be run to meet the requirements
of electricity consumers.
B.        Project Concept
30.       A feasibility study on a proposed first storage hydropower
development scheme in Western Samoa, namely, the Fagaloa-Afulilo scheme
in the Afulilo-Vaipu Basin on the eastern part of Upolu Island was
undertaken  under  Bank  technical  assistance  1/  in  1980.   Such  a
hydropower scheme with significant storage capacity was envisaged to
produce electricity to meet energy shortages which occur during the dry
season when low streamflows restrict electricity production from the
existing run-of-river hydro schemes in EPC's Upolu system.
31.       The Fagaloa-Afulilo hydropower scheme,  as proposed by the
Consultant, Mander, Raikes and Marshall (MRM) of United Kingdom,
envisaged the creation of two reservoirs, one in the Afulilo basin and
the other in the Vaipu basin. However, the economic recession in the
early 1980s resulted in reduced demand for electricity, and it was
decided tu defer further consideration on this scheme until growth in
demand for electricity coul.d absorb the full output of this sizeable
hydropower development  scheme  (about  10 MW).  Moreover,  the scheme
required a very large investment. Therefore, in its place, a smaller
Afiamalu Pump-Assisted Hydropower scheme (4 to 5 MW) based on a
pre-feasibility study carried out by the same consultant (MRM) under EPC
financing was  considered  for  development.   In  June  1984  the Bank
provided technical assistance (T.A. No. 608-SAM) for the preparation of
a detailed feasibility study and design for that scheme. The study,
which  was  completed  in  October  1985,  concluded  that  due  to  thb
hydrological regime of the catchments proposed to be tapped, the energy
generation from the Afiamalu scheme would be lover than estimated at the
pre-feasibility stage (9 GWh against previously estimated 12 GWh). The
Afiamalu scheme would thus be uneconomic and would have inadequate
energy generation to meet currently projected energy demand. In view of
this conclusion, the consultant (MRM) was requested to examine the
economic  and  technical  feasibility  of  implementing  the  earlier
Fagaloa-Afulilo hydropower scheme in two stages.  This examination was
completed by the consultants in January 1986. The consultants concluded
that the development of the Afulilo and Vaipu schemes is technically and
economically feasible, with Afulilo recommended to be developed first
with an installed generation capacity of 4 MW, to be followed, when
T/ T.A. No. 350-SAM approved on 22 April 1980.

requiXd, by the development of the Vaipu basin scheme which would
produce at least another 4 MW of output. At a tripartite meeting of the
Bank, EPC and the consultants in February 1986, it was concluded that
the first stage of the Afulilo-Fagaloa Hydropower scheme, now termed the
Afulilo Hydroelectric Project, would be appropriate in terms of size,
cost and economy for meeting the forecast power requirements of the
powet system on Upolu Island.
C.   Project Description and Scope
32.       The proposed Project envisages development of the Afulilo
basin in order to provide storage for about 10 million cubic meters of
water for generation of electric energy for supplying the power system
on Upolu Island.  A composite dam with a central concrete spillway,
concrete wings and rockfill abutment 82 meters long and 20 meters high
to impound the reservoir with a surface area of 2.5 sq km will be
located just upstream of Afulilo Falls. The center section of the dam
will have a gated spillway with two spillway radial gates 10 m long and
3 m high, with a design flood flow of 150 cubic meters per second. Th-
low level outlets in the concrete section will allow the river flow to
pass during construetion of the main dam. When the dam is completed,
this outlet will be closed by a gate which can be opened to allow the
reservoir to be emptied should this need ever arise.  The hydraulic
discharge will be conveyed through an intake tunnel 60 meters long below
the left abutment, and then through a low-pressure pipeline about 2.5 km
long descending to the south of the falls, then running across the flat
Vaipu basin and over a low saddle through a surge chamber, and then
through a high-pressure pipeline about 1.4 km long along the Fagaloa
Divide which will connect an above ground powerhouse situated in
Ta'elefaga at the Fagaloa Bay with one 4 MW generating unit operating
under a static head of 310 meters (see Map 2). The scale of development
has been optimized taking into consideration various options in
powerhouse locatior,. unit size, and steel pipeline size vs a tunnel
through  the Fagaloa Divide.   According  to an incremental cost and
benefit study, the optimal development would be an installed capacity of
4 MW for generating an annual energy output ranging from about 12.5 GWh
to 24 GWh, depending on system demand.
33.       The Project consists of:
(M) Construction of civil works including a composite gravity
concrete/rockfill dam, an intake structure, an intake
tunnel, a pipeline, a surge chamber, a tailrace, a
powerhouse and a switchyard;
(ii) Installation of electrical and mechanical equipment
including a 4 MW turbine-generator, auxiliary equipment,
a step-up transformer and switchgear; and
(iii) Construction of the transmission lines: 6 km of 22 kV
transmission line from Ta'elefaga to Lalomauga, 12 km of
22 kV transmission line from Ta'elefaga to Lotofaga, 5 km
of 22 kV spur lines, and upgrading of a 28 km section of
transmission line between Tanugamanono and Lalomauga from
22 kV to 33 kV;



12
(iv)  Consulting services for detailed engineering and
construction supervision; and
(v) Services of a technical expert to periodically review the
hydrogeology and dam design during construction.
D.   Feasibility Investigations and Engineering Design
34.       Following a review of the information and data available on
geological/hydrological aspects contained in the feasibility reports on
the Afulilo-Fagaloa hydropower scheme dated October 1983,  September
1985 and January 1986, a Bank Fact-Finding Mission in May 1986,
supported by a geotechnical expert, undertook a further review of the
geological/ hydrological aspects of the proposed Afulilo reservoir. The
Mission recommended additional secondary situ investigation to confirm
the geotechnical soundness of the geological structure associated with
the Project. These secondary investigations have been carried out 1/
and the results have been found to be satisfactory. The Mission
considers the technical design of the proposed water impounding
structures to be appropriate to the conditions which prevail at the
site. The overall design of the scheme is conventional and conforms
with sound engineering practice.
E.   Project Cost
35.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$17.2 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is US$13;59 million
(about 80 per cent) including US$100,000 for recovery of prior technical
assistance cost, and US$100,000 for service and other charges during
construction  on  the  Bank  loan.   The  local  cost  is  $3.61 million
equivalent (about 20 per cent). The Project cost estimate is summarized
in Table 5 (see Appendix 7 for detailed cost estimates). The basic cost
estimate was prepared by the Bank's technical assistance consultant on
the basis of 1986 price levels. It was reviewed and found acceptable by
the Mission.   Appropriate provisions  for physical contingencies and
price escalation have been included in the estimate.
1/   These investigations were carried out partly under Bank T.A. No.
608-SAM, and partly under a Project Preparatory Facility (PPF)
provided by IDA in June 1986 (also see para 36).

F.   Financing Plan and Proposed Loan
36.       The Government has requested the Bank to finance part of the
foreign exchange cost of the Project. It has also requested IDA, EEC
and EIB to co-finance with the Bank a major part of the remaining cost
of the Project.   Based on discussions with the Mission and the co-
financiers, the financing plan proposed for the Project is as follows
(see Table 6):

37.       The Government has requested the Bank for a loan of US$5.4
million from its Special Fund resources which it will on-lend to EPC to
finance part of the foreign costs of the Project comprising civil works,
consulting services, service and other charges during construction on
the Bank loan, and partial recovery of cost incurred on prior technical
assistance, 1/ as indicated in Table 6. The Bank loan will carry a
service charge of one per cent per annum and will have a maturity of 40
years, including a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds of the Bank
loan will be on-lent to EPC at an interest rate of 7.65 per cent for a
term of 25 years, including a grace period of five years. These terms
are consistent with the life and construction Vperiod for the Project.
38.       The IDA credit of US$3.0 million will be on-lent to EPC on the
same terms as for the Bank loan.  EIB funds amounting to US$1.54 million
1/   The feasibility study and the design of the Project were carried
out partly under T.A. No. 350-SAM, and partly under T.A. No.
608-SAM; however the recovery of cost will be from the former T.A.
No. 350-SAM, under which most of the work for this Project was
carried out.



15
equivalent will be lent directly to EPC at an annual interest rate of
two per cent, with a 20-year maturity including a grace period of 4.5
years.   The EEC grant of US$5.745 million equivalent will be made
available to the Government under the terms of Lome III Convention to
finance this Project, and will constitute the Government's equity in
EPC.  The balance of US$1,515,000 in local currency costs will be
financed by the Government and EPC, including US$1.2 million in interest
during construction to be paid by EPC to the Government.
39.       The Government has also requested the Bank for a technical
assistance grant of US$200,000 to finance the foreign exchange cost of
consulting services and two microcomputers required for strengthening
the audit and accounting capability of EPC. The local currency costs
amounting to about US$7,000 will be provided by EPC (see para 52).
G.   Project Implementation
40.       EPC will be the Executing Agency for the proposed Project.
Implementation of the Project will begin soon after approval of the Bank
loan with the invitation for proposals for consulting services.  The
selection of the engineering consulting firm is expected to be completed
by 1 April 1987, following which the prequalification of contractors for
civil works will be undertaken. Contracts for civil works, the turbine
generator and the major electrical/mechanical equipment and transmission
lines will be awarded during 1988.  Implementation of the Project is
expected to be completed by October 1990 with the testing and
commissioning of the hydro generating unit and associated tiransmission
line. The implementation schedule for the Project is given in Appendix
8.
41.       To ensure efficient implementation of the Project, a Project
Office headed by a Project Engineer with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to the Bank will be established within EPC by April 1987.1/
The Project Office will be responsible for monitoring and overseeing
implementation  of  the  Project  and  for  overall  liaison  with  and
coordination among EPC, the contractors and consultants for the Project.
A  firm  of  engineering  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  detailed
engineering (including additional site investigations), preparation of
tender documents, bid evaluation and construction supervision of the
proposed Project. 2/  Also, a technical review expert will be engaged to
advise EPC on hydrogeology and dam design during construction of the
Project (see paras 45-46).
H. Procurement and Consultancy Services
Procurement
42.       Procurement of all goods and services for the Project will be
grouped into suitable contract packages consistent with the financial
plan.  Appendix 9 shows the proposed contract packages.   Under th'
proposed financing plan, it is envisaged that the civil works will form
one contract package, the foreign exchange costs of which will be
financed by  the  Bank  and  IDA,  and  the  local costs by EIB.   The
17  Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 1.
2/   Loan Agreement, Schedule 5, para 1 (a).



16
procurement of goods and services to be financed jointly by the Bank,
IDA and EIB will be undertaken by EPC with the assistance of the
consultant in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
The civil works contractors for the Project will be prequalified.
43.       Procurement of goods and services out of the proceeds of the
proposed grant from EEC will follow procedures set out by EEC, which FPC
and the Mission consider satisfactory.
Consulting Services
44.       A firm of engineering consultants with adequate hydropower
experience and qualifications will be engaged by EPC following the
Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants to assist EPC in the
implementation of the Project in respect of detailed engineering
(including additional site investigations), preparation of tender
documents, bid evaluation, and construction supervision.  The terms of
reference for the consultant are given in Appendix 10. 1/
Technical Review Expert
45.       While no unusual difficulty in construction of the proposed
dam and civil work structures is presently foreseen, the Mission
considers it prudent to have independent professional expert opinion
besides that of the engineering consultant on the design and engineering
of the dam and civil work structures in view of the geological nature of
the dam site and reservoir area. Therefore, it is proposed that an
independent geotechnical expert be engaged by EPC to review the Project
designs and to make periodic inspections during the construction of the
dam and civil work structures for the Project so as to ensure economic
and efficient construction of the facilities.
46.       EPC has assured that the review expert will be appointed
before the award of contract for civil works. Consulting services will
be required for an estimated two man-months, and an amount of US$50,000
is provided for this purpose under the proposed loan. The expert will
be recruited by EPC following the Bank's Guidelines on Use of
Consultants. 2/
I. Land Acquisition and Right-of-Way
47.       Most of the land in the project construction area and the
reservoir is uninhabited and is owned by three or four villages. Since
the villages who own this land will also benefit from the electricity
made available by the Project, the villages have supported the Project
and no difficulty in the release of the land is foreseen.  Some of the
recently settled farmers along with their herds of cattle will be
displaced by the reservoir. The Government has assured the resettlement
of these farmers as appropriate in accordance with customary or otber
rights during land acquisition. The Government and EPC have assured
that the lands needed for the Project will be acquired by April
1/  Loan Agreement, Schedule 5, para 1 (a) and para 2.
T/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 5, para 1 (b) and para 2.



17
1987. As a matter of precaution, however, it has been covenanted that
no contract for civil works will be awarded until the lands and
right-of-way  necessary  for  implementing  the  Project  have  been
acquired.l/ Access road to the dam site will be constructed by the
Government/EPC from their own resources and the work would be completed
on  a  timely  basis  in  accordance  with  the  Project  implementation
schedule.2/
J.   Environmental Aspects
48.       The environmental aspects of the Project have been given due
consideration. The environmental impacts associated with the Project
include the discharge of fresh water from the powerhouse at Ta'elefaga
village into Fagaloa Bay, and possible impaired quality of reservoir
water due to decomposing vegetation during inundation.
49.       I. : Ation will mean loss of habitat within the Afulilo basin
- mostly occupied by lowland swamp vegetation. However, Department of
Forestry officials confirm that no rare or endangered plant or animal
species occupy these areas. The Department of Fisheries has confirmed
that the discharge of fresh water into the Fagaloa Bay will not
significantly affect fisheries.
50.       Provision for watershed management has been included under the
Project which includes monitoring water run-off and sediment loading of
the watershed, and assessing the severity of soil erosion and
recommending soil conservation measures if found necessary. 3/
51.       The site of the powerhouse in Ta'elefaga is at a distance of
about 100 meters across the road from a school. Appropriate provision
will be made in the design of the powerhouse to ensure that the noise
level is tolerable, and that all openings of the powerhouse face away
from the school to minimize the effect of noise from the powerhouse. 4/
Appropriate safety measures will be implemented during construction.
K.   Technical Assistance
52.       EPC's internal capabilities in auditing and accounting require
considerable improvement (see paras 58, 59 and 61). These relate to
accounting and auditing procedures, absence of written guidelines, lack
of trained staff and insufficient computer facilities in the area of
financial management. To overcome the problem of lack of trained staff,
it is proposed that substantial training be provided to EPC staff under
an advisory technical assistance grant from the Bank. The main thrust
of the Bank's technical assistance will be to enhance EPC's internal
control through strengthening of its internal audit unit, preparation of
an audit manual, training of audit staff, improvement of accounting
procedures with regard to payment of accounts and control of cash,
procedures for electronic data processing, documenting the revised
17  Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 2 (a).

accounting system, training of selected staff in revised accounting
systems and procedures, improvement of the management information system
and provision of two microcomputers and associated peripherals. The
total cost of the consultant services of about 12 man-months together
with the cost of microcomputers is estimated at US$207,000, of which the
foreign  exchange  cost  is  US$200,000  and  the  local  currency  cost
US$7,000. It is proposed that the foreign exchange cost be provided as
a grant. The local currency cost will be financed by EPC from its own
resources. The consulting firm will be selected in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference of
the consultants and cost estimates are given in Appendix 11.



19
IV. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A.   History and Organization
53.       The Executing Agency of the Project will be the Electric Power
Corporation of Western Samoa (EPC), which is a government-owned
statutory agency incorporated on 19 December 1972 under the Electric
Power Corporation Act 1972. This Act was further amended in 1980, 1981
and 1984.  Prior to the establishment of EPC, a division in the Public
Works  Department  (PWD)  known  as  the  Electric  Power  Schemw,  was
responsible for power sector operations. Under the Act, EPC has the
functional responsibility for generating, transmitting and distributing
power in Western Samoa.  To carry out its functions, EPC is endowed with
full authority for staffing, operation, maintenance and construction.
B.   Management and Staff
54.       The corporate powers of EPC are exercised by a seven-member
Board which determines the general policies of EPC.   The Board is
chaired by the Minister of Works. The six other Board members of EPC
are the Director df Works (who is also the Deputy Chairman), the
Financial Secretary, the Director of Economic Development, and three
persons appointed by the Head of State, representing the law
practitioners, electricity consumers and the Western Samoa Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. The management of EPC's operations is vested in
the General Manager who is appointed by the Head of State, and reports
to the Chairman of the Board (see Appendix 12 for EPC's Orginization
Chart).   As of the end of August  1986, EPC had a staff of 229,
consisting of 166 engineering/technical personnel and 63 accounting/
adainistrative personnel, which is the same staffing level as of the end
of 1985, but an increase of 4 per cent over the staffing level as of the
end of December 1984. Staff productivity in terms of sales per employee
has increased from 129 GWh in 1984 to 136 GWh in 1986.
55.       Since  its  formative  stages,  EPC  has  experienced  staff
constraints, particularly at the management level due to unavailability
of experienced local personnel since there is severe competition from
overseas and private sectors for the few available qualified Samoans.
These problems have now been partly alleviated. The General Manager's
position is currently held by a Samoan national who was appointed in
March 1986. He was also the General Manager from 1977 to January 1980.
During the intervening period the position of General Manager was filled
by  an  expatriate.   EPC's  technical  operations  are  supervised  and
coordinated by an expatriate Chief Engineer (Operations). The civil and
mechanical engineers of EPC are also foreign nationals, and the position
of  Chief  Engineer  (Development)  is  still  vacant.   The  Operations
Department is organized into three divisions: Production, Utilization,
and Distribution.  The accounting function of EPC is supervised and
coordinated by the Financial Controller who is a Samoan national, and
who was appointed to this position in October 1983. The administrative
and personnel functions of EPC are supervised by the Administration
Manager, also a Samoan national.
56.       For the reason indicated above, EPC has been relying to a
large extent on expatriate staff for filling its senior level
engineering positions. Further, the availability of qualified engineers



20
from  local  sources  continues  to be  constrained by  lack of  local
facilities for higher education in engineering.  In order to attract
Samoans to qualify in engineering, scholarships for overseas education
have been offered on the condition that they serve EPC for a fixed
period on returning from abroad. The Government has requested EEC for a
grant of US$1.0 million with a view to training a number of Samoans in
relevant engineering disciplines so that EPC can become self-reliant in
technical areas (see para 65).
C.   Financial Management
57.       The Chief Accountant who reports to the Financial Controller,
supervises three divisions: Financial Accounting, Systems Accounting
and Inventory Accounting.  Because of the limited experience of the
Chief Accountant, most financial and accounting matters are handled by
the Financial Controller. Efforts are being made to replace the Chief
Accountant with a more experienced accountant.  In addition to the
Financial Controller, there is another qualified accountant, also a
Samoan national, recently graduated from a UK institution who has been
assigned as the project accountant  for the proposed Project.   The
majority of accounting clerks have no qualifications in accounting and
have gained accounting skills mainly through on-the-job experience.
58.       Management of accounts receivable and payroll is satisfactory.
An inventory of office equipment has been completed with the assistance
of an expatriate volunteer. Control of cash and accounts payable needs
some improvement.  An annual inventory has never been cariied out.
Project accounting has also not been maintained. Improvement in these
areas is urgently needed and Bank technical assistance for this purpose
is proposed (see para 52).
59.       Since 1984 EPC has computerized its accounting using a batch
processing service provided by a local computer company.   Lack of
microcomputers and the nature of batch processing, compounded by
insufficiently qualified staff at EPC in preparing the source documents
for computer processing and verifying computer output, have inhibited
timely preparation of EPC's annual accounts and have resulted in delayed
submission by EPC of its audited financial statements to the Bank (see
para 63).
60.       EPC's fixed assets were physically examined and revalued in
1979 by a consultant financed under Bank technical assistance.1/ Since
then EPC has annually revalued its fixed assets using the New Zealand
index for capital goods.   It is now necessary to again carry out
physical inspection, prepare an inventory and undertake a valuation of
EPC's fixed assets. Further, it is also necessary to review the method
for annual revaluation of fixed assets used by EPC and to prepare
appropriate guidelines for the annual revaluation of EPC's fixed assets,
a method of computing depreciation on fixed assets, and the preparation
of Plant Registers. A consultant will be recruited for this purpose

Audit
61.       The Internal Audit Unit of EPC was established in 1982, but is
limited in scope and lacks a proper auditing manual.   The Unit is
staffed by only one person who has no audit qualifications and is mainly
engaged in the audit of fuel consumption, payroll and vehicle
operations.   To  facilitate  proper  control  of  EPC's  assets,  an
appropriately staffed Internal Audit Unit is required. It is therefore
proposed to provide assistance in this area, and the scope of the
proposed Bank technical assistance includes the necessary strengthening
of EPC's internal audit capability (see para 52).
62.       EPC Act No. 20/1972 requires that the Chief Auditor of the
Government of Western Samoa inspect and audit the records and accounts
of EPC's financial transactions. In carrying out the audit functions,
the Chief Auditor may engage the service of another auditor. The number
of qualified accountants at the Chief Auditor's office has been
diminishing as a result of competitive offers by foreign and local
private auditing firms. Because of the inability of the Chief Auditor's
Office to cope with the volume of work, for several years now EPC's
accounts have been audited by a private auditor.   The annual audit
report on EPC, however, has been prepared and certified by the
Government's  Chief  Auditor.   This  auditing  arrangement  has  been
satisfactory and is acceptable to the Bank.
63.       EPC Act No.  20/1972  further provides  that  EPC's  audited
financial statements be presented to Parliament before being made
public. Because of the constraints in data processing (see para 59) and
the need for external auditing and certification by the Government's
Chief Auditor, it takes nine to twelve months for EPC to submit its
audited annual financial statements to the Bank as against the
covenanted period of six months.   A  large part  of  this  delay  is
attributable to the long time taken for data processing during the
preparation of the financial statements. Assistance under the proposed
Bank technical assistance will enable EPC to submit its unaudited
accounts to the Bank within six months and the audited accounts within
nine months after the close of the fiscal year. The covenant relating
to the submission by EPC of its audited financial statements has
therefore been amended accordingly. 1/
Training Program and Career Development
64.       To improve staff performance and to upgrade local staff, EPC
has implemented various training programs, including in-service and
on-the-Job training. Training in accounting for middle-level positions
is available locally; however, technical staff have to be trained
abroad. Funds for training and volunteer specialists from overseas have
been  ptovided  by  several  agencies.   Study visits  to  other  power
utilities in the South Pacific region are also undertaken occasionally.
The training to be provided under the proposed Bank technical assistance
(see para 52) will greatly assist EPC in becoming self-reliant in audit
and accounting.

65.       In addition to Bank technical assistance, the Government has
proposed to EEC to provide in-house and overseas training to the
engineering staff of EPC with the primary objective of making EPC
self-reliant  in engineering  (see para  56).   The program  envisages
engagement of expatriate experts for a period of time to impart in-house
training to EPC staff in various engineering disciplines as well as to
train a selected number of Samoans overseas in mechanical and electrical
engineering  to  ultimately  replace  expatriate  staff  at  EPC.   The
Government has proposed to uzilize the EEC grant of US$1.0 million for
this purpose. This assistance will also include revaluation of EPC's
assets and preparation of guidelines for EPC in the valuation of assets,
as well as a review of the structure and level of EPC tariffs (see paras
60 and 68). In order to formulate the details of the above technical
assistance proposal, EEC will field a mission to determine EPC's needs
in such areas and to draw up a program oi technical assistance in
consultation with  the  Bank.   The  Government  and  EPC have  already
initiated action on this matter, and EEC is expected to complete
formulation of the program by March 1987 and to implement it thereafter
in a timely manner.   Government assurance in this regard has been
covenanted.1/
Tariff Policy and Structure
66.       EPC has a single flat rate tariff for all consumers.  A prompt
payment discount of 5 per cent is granted to consumers paying within 20
days from the date of billing. The current tariff level is 28,1 sene
(equivalent  to about  13 US cents)  per kWh.  The  tariff has been
increased more than threefold since March 1978, from 8 sene per kWh to
28.1 sene per kWh in July 1983 and has remained at this level since.
Compared to other electricity tariff levels in the region, EPC's rate is
among the highest, surpassed only by Kiribati and Fiji.
67.       Upon request from the Government and EPC, the Bank provided a
technical assistance grant for a tariff study in 1978. 2/ The study
recommended the retention of the existing flat rate tariff structure for
commercial, government and domestic consumers, but proposed a two-part
tariff - a kW demand charge and a kWh energy charge, for industries and
hotels.   On  review,  this  recommendation  was  found  to  be  not
cost-effective for the few (ten) industrial consumers and hotels who
would be subjected to the two-part tariff at that time.
68.       At  Fact-Finding  in  May  1986,  the  Mission  and  the  IDA
representative examined the existing EPC tariff structure with a view to
introducing a demand charge and time-of-use tariffs. However, it was
found that the evening peak was caused largely by the domestic lighting
demand and not by industrial or commercial consumers. The load factor
was quite high, and there was not much scope for reducing peak demand.
Therefore, there seemed to be no immediate need to change the present
tariff system.  Nevertheless, the Mission considered that the tariff
structure and level of tariffs needed to be examined more thoroughly in
light of the expanding operation of the Upolu system under the proposed
Project, and the expansion of transmission, distribution and generation

facilities in Savaii. During appraisal, therefore, a study of EPC's
tariff structure and level was agreed to be included in the scope of the
EEC grant assistance requested by the Government (see para 65).
Financial Policies
69.       Financial policies are set by the Board of Directors of EPC in
consultation with the General Manager.  Strategic financial management
decisions such as raising external loans or increasing tariffs are taken
at the highest Government levels on the advice of the Board.
70.       EPC was not liable to pay income tax, stamp duty, customs duty
or  any  other  tax.   This  exemption  status,  however,  was  partially
withdrawn in 1984 1/ with the imposition of a 42 per cent customs and
excise duties on imported fuel.
71.       The financial objectives of EPC as contained in the Act do not
specify any financial performance targets or restrictions on EPC's
operations.   The Act only provides that any profit from operations
remaining after covering past losses, planned capital expenditures, and
creation of necessaty reserves be transferred to the Treasury Fund. The
financial performance targets of EPC are therefore based on the
requirements  laid  down  in  the  loan  agreements  with  financial
institutions. These include a debt service ratio (DSR) of 1.3 times and
a self-financing ratio (SFR) of 20 per cent, both of which are
covenanted in the loan agreements with the Bank.
Past Financial Performance
72.       A summary of EPC's financial performance during the past five
years is shown in Table 7 and detailed in Appendix 13.

73.       Despite  large  tariff  increases  in  the past  and  economic
slowdown, electricity sales over the past five years have grown
continuously although at lower than the historic annual rates of about
10 per cent during the 1970s. During the period 1981-85, net revenue
increased from about WS$4.9 million to WS$8.2 million, or by about 67
per cent. In the same period, total operating expenses increased from
about WS$4.9 million to WS$7.4 million, or by about 50 per cent. The
i/  Under EPC Act Amendment No. 10/1984.



24
factor which contributed most to this increase was allowance for
depreciation which went up by about WS$2 million due to the three
run-of-river plants commissioned during the period 1982-85.
74.       Although the average tariff in 1983 was more than triple the
level in 1978, the generating cost per kWh had increased fivefold during
the same period because of large fuel expenses.  EPC does not fully
benefit from the recent decline in the international fuel oil price due
to the imposition by the Government in 1984 of a 42 per cent customs and
excise duties on fuel oil. Fuel cost represented about 54 per cent of
EPC's operating expenses over the period 1980-85. Net operating income
which was slightly positive in 1981 became negative during the following
three years. With the increase in demand, the proportion of hydroenergy
in the generation mix decreased gradually from about 39 per cent in the
early 1970s to 20 per cent by 1979. After the commissioning of three
new run-of-river plants 1/ since 1982, the contribution of hydroenergy
in the generation mix increased to 70 per cent in 1985, which brough-
about an improvement in EPC's financial performance.  Net operating
income became positive once again, amounting to about 10 per cent of net
operating revenue. However, because of the large investment in the
three run-of-river hydro plants, EPC's interest burden increased during
this period. Interest charges alone in 1985 amounted to WS$1.16 million
against a net operating income of about WS$748,000. In addition, the
depreciation of the Tala against the US Dollar and other currencies
worsened this situation, as EPC bears the foreign exchange losses on
foreign loans. 2/
75.       EPC's accounts therefore have shown net losses during the past
seven years. In spite of this situation, EPC's debt-service ratio has
been satisfactory except in 1983 when the ratio dipped below the
covenanted figure of 1.3 times. The accounts receivable have generally
been equal to about one month's revenue from energy sales.   EPC's
short-term liquidity ratio is also sound, being above 1.0 times;
however, the self-financing ratio covenant of 20 per cent was met by EPC
only in 1985.
Financial Projections
76.       Financial projections .have been prepared based on information
collected by the Mission, and the results of these projections are
summarized in Table 8 below. Appendix 13 provides detailed financial
statements and the related assumptions.
1/ The Fale-Ole-Fe'e (1.6 MW) scheme was financed by the Bank (Loan
lNo. 392-SAM), and the Samasoni (1.2 MW) and the Sauniatu (3.5 MW)
schemes were financed by EEC.
2/ Except in the case of EPC, the Goveroment bears the foreign
exchange losses of all executing agencies in Western Samoa.

77.       It may be seen from the above table that the performance of
EPC should be satisfactory with respect to DSR and SFR. The liquidity
position should also remain sound. In the future EPC will have to meet
its debt-service obligations arising from recent loans for several
hydropower projects and the loan for the Project.  Also, it has to
finance from its internal sources, a modest capital expenditure program
of about WS$3-4 million annually, mainly for rehabilitating transmission
and distribution lines. These two important aspects will affect EPC's
future financial position. It is therefore necessary to retain the two
existing covenants requiring EPC to maintain a minimum DSR of 1.3 times
and an SFR of at least 20 per cent. 1/ These two covenants should
ensure that EPC maintains a sound financial position in the future, and
would also ensure that EPC mobilizes sufficient internal resources for
its capital expenditure program, thereby reducing its dependence on
donor countries and the Government.
78.       The projections also show a gradual but steady improvement in
EPC's net income and rate of return (ROR). EPC has recently added
three relatively large run-of-river hydro plants and will add tho
Project to its system in the near future. These new plants, while
needed to make the system economical, will increase the rate base
substantially. Besides, the diesel plants retained in EPC's books will
continue to be revalued upwards due to Inflation even though they will
largely serve as standby plants. This will inflate the rate base of EPC
further. In light of these factors, it is considered that EPC can be
expected to achieve the normally stipulated rate of return (ROR) of 8
per cent on its rate base only gradually, unless the present tariff of
28 sene per kWh which is already much higher than the long-range
marginal cost (LRMC) of supply of about 23 sene per kWh, is increased
substantially. Keeping in view the above considerations, it has been
agreed that EPC will earn a ROR of 5 per cent by 1990 and 8 per cent by
1995 on average revalued net fixed assets in operation. 2/
79.       Future  depreciation  of  the  Tala  would  result  in  EPC's
incurring exchange rate losses Which will erode EPC's equity base. On
average, over the forecast period, the Government does not expect the
Tala to depreciate by more than 2 per cent per annum. To enable EPC to
1/ Project Agreement, Sections 2.17 and 2.16 respectively.
!I   Project Agreement, Section 2.18



26
prepare its accounts on a firm basis, EPC proposed that its existing
unrealized foreign exchange losses be written off by the Government and
that it pay a 2 per cent annual premium on its outstanding foreign debt
to the Government in consideration of the Government's bearing any
future exchange  loss on foreign loans to EPC.  The Government has
accepted this proposal which was supported by the Bank, IDA and EIB.1/
D.   Implementation Status of Previous Bank Loans
80.       The Bank has provided three loans totalling US$7.15 million
for the power sector in Western Samoa over the period 1973-1984.  In
addition, the Bank has provided six technical assistance grants
totalling US$933,500 to the power sector over the period 1971-1984 (see
Appendix 14 for details).
81.       A Bank loan (No. 132-SAM(SF)) of US$2.3 mill4on for the first
power project was approved on 19 June 1973. A supplementary loan (No.
254-SAM[SF]) for the same project was approved on 18 December 1975.
Both loans were provided from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources on
concessional terms.  Similarly, for the Second Power Project the Bank
provided a loan (No. 392-SAM[SF]) of US$3.45 million on 29 March 1979
from ADF resources.  Both projects have been completed and the loans
have been closed.
82.       A review shows that substantial delays were encountered during
implementation  of  the  two  projects.   As  reported  in  the  Project
Performance Audit Report (PPAR No. PE-145, and PE-153), the shortcomings
in physical completion and operation of the generating plants were
primarily due to the inexperience of EPC and its dependence on project
consultants who were ineffective in supervision. The PPAR also noted
that EPC will continue to need the services of expatriate staff since
local specialized skills and experience are unavailable.
83.       In line with  the  Bank's  policy of  supporting  the  local
construction industry in SPDMCs, the Second Power Project (Loan 392-SAM)
was contracted to a local government-owned construction company. While
the Project was completed as designed with a satisfactory standard of
workmanship, it suffered delays entirely due to delays in civil works
construction. This delay and a substantial overrun on the cost of civil
works resulted from the inexperienced and inadequate management of the
government- owned construction corporation.
84.       In reviewing the project delays and contractor's performance
the PPAR (PE-153) recommended that the Bank's policy of supporting the
local construction industry in SPDMCs may have to be supplemented in
the future with suitable measures for upgrading the technical and
managerial capabilities of local construction firms, e.g., by joint
ventures with expatriate firms which can provide technical assistance to
the contractors. The PPAR also noted that the Bank did not provide
institutional support to supplement or to coordinate the fragmented
assistance from a variety of bilateral sources for training EPC's staff.
17  Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(a).



27
85.       The Mission has taken cognizance of these recommendations
contained In PE-145 and PE-153.  It is proposed to utilize technical
assistance from the Bank and from EEC (see paras 52 and 65) to improve
the institutional capability and performance of EPC. Also, in line with
the recommendation related to local contractors, EPC has agreed not to
prequalify local contracting firms for the Project's civil works
construction unless they form a joint venture with a qualified
expatriate firm.
E. Compliance with Previous Loan Covenants
86.       A summary of EPC's status of compliance with loan covenants is
shown in Appendix 15. EPC's record of compliance with loan covenants
has not been totally satisfactory, especially in respect of maintaining
an SFR of 20 per cent and timely submission of audited financial
statements. The position in regard to the latter is expected to improve
under the technical assistance proposed under the Project (see para 52).
In regard to the former, the financial projections show that with the
reduction in the operating expenses of EPC following completion of the
three run-of-the-river hydropower plants during the period 1982-1985,
EPC will be able tb achieve the covenanted SFR of 20 per cent, even
without a tariff increase.

V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Objectives
87.       To minimize the country's dependence on oil imports is one of
the principal objectives of the Government. In addition, the Government
wishes to replace existing diesel generation units with hydropower, not
only because of the high cost of imported petroleum, but also because of
the increasing cost of maintaining the old diesel generators.   The
Government has successfully displaced diesel generation during the wet
months by commissioning three run-of-river hydro plarts during the
period 1982-85. The Government has given priority to the construction
of the proposed Afulilo Hydroelectric Project which is designed to
displace diesel generation during the dry season. There is an urgent
need to start the construction of the proposed Project since the
wood-fired plant proposed earlier had to be indefinitely deferred due to
technical infeasibility.
B.   Benefits and Beneficiaries
88.       The  AfuRilo  Hydroelectric  Project  will  create  the  first
storage hydroelectric plant in Western Samoa when commissioned in 1990.
Its most important benefit will be to reduce the cost of electricity
supply by displacing the higher cost supply from diesel generatiug
plants, particularly during the dry period of about six months of the
year. The dry and wet seasons are not clearly defined in Western Samoa,
although the last six months of the year are normally the drier ones.
The Afulilo power plant will thus operate off and on throughout the
year, with the run-of-river hydro plants meeting the demand in wet
months and Afulilo serving mainly the base load in dry months. The
Afulilo power plant will have a capacity of 4 MW and although it would
be used fully from the time the plant is commissioned, the Project will
contribute a capacity addition of only 2 MW in 1990 and the remaining 2
MW in 1992. In regard to its energy contribution, the Project will
generate up to 24 GWh annually, but the extent of its absorption will
depend on the Upolu system demand. Based on the demand forecast, it is
estimated that the system can absorb 12.4 GWh i- 1991 and that this will
gradually increase to 24 GWh per annum by the year 2014. The value of
these benefits of capacity and energy provided by AHEP is quantified in
the financial and economic analyses of the Project presented below.
89.       In addition to reducing the cost of supplying electricity, the
Project  will  produce  several  other  benefits.   It  will  save  a
considerable foreign exchange by making it unnecessary to import diesel
plants, diesel fuel, spare parts and the like for diesel plants. It
will also reduce the need for training of maintenance staff required for
diesel plants, an area of particular concern for EPC. The Project will
provide a few more villages access to electricity and will reduce the
transmission losses to some extent as a result of the uprating of the 22
kV line to 33 kV line from the Sauniatu power station. Not the least
among the Project benefits will be the security of supply it will
provide by reducing dependence on foreign supplies of diesel fuel.
90.       The country will benefit the most from a better allocation of
its resources as the Afulilo power plant will make the power supply
system more economical.  The repayment of interest and principal on



29
loans for this Project will average a little over US$400,000 annually.
As against this, the Project will displace annually diesel generation
costs of some US$2.6 million on average.   During the construction
period, the Project will provide much-needed employment for local labor
estimated at 3,000 man-months and will create 20 permanent jobs for
maintaining and running the plant.
91.       The  cost  savings  from this Project will ultimately  also
benefit electricity consumers who constitute about 7,500 families and
1,100 business and other establishments on Upolu Island. This benefit,
if translated into tariff terms, will amount to about eight US cents per
kWh in 1986 prices on the sale of the output from the Project over its
30-year life.l/
92.       A section of the population in a few villages whose lands
would be made available to the Project would also benefit directly from
acquiring access to electricity. The small benefit from displacement of
kerosene on this account has not been quantified.
C.  Financial and Economic Rate of Return
93.       The Project is the least cost addition to EPC's Upolu power
system with a financial equalizing discount rate (FEDR) of 15.0 per cent
compared to the diesel alternative. The capital, fuel, operation and
maintenance costs are those estimated to be actually incurred by EPC.
The financial internal rate of return (FIR) based on the Project cost
and the revenue from the sale of the output of electricity from the
Project at the current tariff of 28.1 sene/kWh is estimated at 11.7 per
cent.
94.       The  main  difference  between  the  financial  and  economic
analysis is that the diesel fuel cost in the financial analysis includes
duties paid by EPC amounting to 42 per cent of the CIF value. Also, the
cost of labor used for the Project is valued at its market wage in the
financial analysis instead of at the opportunity cost of labor which is
used in the economic analysis. The costs and benefits in the economic
analysis are converted into border prices by the use of a conversion
factor. On this basis, the economic equalizing discount rate (EEDR) is
estimated at 13.1 per cent and the EIRR at 11 per cent. The EIRR
reflects only the lower bound of net Project benefits since consumer
surplus is not taken into account in the benefit calculations.  In
addition to these quantified benefits, the Project will also generate
the unquantified benefits mentioned in paras 89-92.  The financial and
economic calculations together with the underlying assumptions are
provided in Appendix 16.
D.   Sensitivity Analysis
95.       Since the Project is designed to make the Upolu power supply
system economically optimal, the EDR is the most important decision
variable. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect on
1J  This is estimated on the basis of an 8 per cent financial rate of
return. At 10 and 12 per cent discount rates, the benefit would be
six and four US cents/kWh respectively.

96.       The  analysis  suggests  that  the  estimated  financial  and
economic EDR are not very sensitive either to an increase in cost or to
a reduction in the output or sales (benefit) of the Project, but that
both EDRs are slightly more sensitive to a change in costs than to a
change in benefits. Sensitivity analysis with regard to the FIRR and
the EIRR of the Project also indicates similar results. The estimated
Project benefits therefore appear to be reasonably robust.
E.   Project Risks
97.       The  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  'the  usual
uncertainties inherent in hydro projects - i.e. hydrological, geological
and similar risks. No unusual or significant risks are anticipated
regarding the technical or environmental aspects relating to the
construction of the proposed Project. However, in regard to possible
higher seepage level than estimated based on investigations carried out
during feasibility studies and the general geology of the area, the
Fact-Finding Mission assisted by a geotechnical expert having examined
the previous reports and data, recommended further site investigations
and studies to obtain additional information from the sub-surface
exploration and revised computer model studies to update the geology,
hydrology and reservoir permeability studies of the 1982 investigation
(see  para  34).   Also,   these  investigations  were  to  minimize
uncertaintities in estimating quantities and the cost of project
facilities. The results of these investigations are satisfactory, and
facilities for monitoring during impounding of the reservoir have been
incorporated in the design which will allow proper water management of
the reservoir.   Further,  as the Project  area  is prone  to seismic
disturbances, adequate provision has been made in the design of the dam
and structures consistent with current engineering practice.
98.       No serious environmental problems are anticipated in regard to
the proposed Project. The likely environmental impacts of this Project
were evaluated by the consultants (MRM) and they have been reviewed by
the Bank.  Their recommendations concerning management of watershed,
water quality, tree clearance, noise abatement and construction safety
have been included in the formulation of the proposed Project.

99.       Risk of delay in acquiring land .or rights-of-way for the
Project is not anticipated as the Government has given firm assurances
that these will be acquired by April 1987, and that any minor
resettlement necessary will be completed during the period of land
acquisition. However, acquisition of land has been made a prior
condition to the award of any civil works contract.l/

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
100.      The  proposed  Project  constitutes  a  key  element  in  the
Government's policy and program to reduce the country's dependence on
oil by giving priority to the development and utilization of indigenous
energy resources as substitutes for oil in the total energy supply. The
Government has accorded high priority to the proposed Project.
101.      The Project is designed to store water in the Afulilo basin
during the rainy season and to produce electricity primarily in dry
months. It will gradually displace up to 24 GWh of diesel generated
energy on Upolu island and add 4 MW of new capacity to the system.
102.      The Project consists of construction of civil works consisting
a dam, an intake tunnel, a pipeline and powerhouse for a 4 MW generating
plant,  and 22/33 kV transmission  lines.   It includes provision of
consulting seivices for engineering design and construction supervision
and the provision of the services of a technical review expert.
103.      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$17.2 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is US$13.59 million and
the local cost US$3.61 million.
104.      It is proposed that the Bank extend an ADF loan of US$5.4
million for a 40-year period including a grace period of ten years to
the Government on the usual terms of one per cent annual service charge.
The Government will relend the proceeds of this loan to EPC at a fixed
annual interest rate of 7.65 per cent for a 25-year term including a
grace period of five Xears to cover part of the foreign exchange costs
of the Project including service and other charges during construction,
partial recovery of cost of prior technical assistance and consultant
services mentioned above.
105.      The remaining foreign exchange cost of the Project will be
co-financed by IDA and EEC. Local costs of civil works will be financed
by EIB. EEC will finance the local costs pertaining to the pipeline,
the electrical and mechanical works and the transmission lines. The
local costs of consulting services and interest during construction will
be provided by EPC from its own internal funds. Local costs for land
acquisition, access roads and part of site investigations of the Project
will be provided by the Government/EPC.
106.      The Government will relend the IDA credit to EPC on the same
terms as that of the Bank. The EEC grant will be made available to the
Government under the terms of the Lome III Convention for the direct
financing of the agreed upon components of the Project, and the loan
from EIB to EPC will carry an interest rate of 2 per cent per annum for
a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 4.5 years.
107.      In addition, a Bank technical assistance grant of US$200,000
is proposed for financing the foreign exchange cost of consulting
services for training EPC staff in audit and other aspects of financial
management. Besides, the Government will, utilizing EEC grant funds,
arrange for consulting services and training of EPC staff to strengthen
EPC's internal capability in engineering and other areas.

108.      In  addition  to  the  standard  provisions  and  requirements
embodied in the Loan Agreement, the following specific assurances have
been obtained:
a)   The proposed co-financing arrangements must be finalized prior
to the effective date of the Loan. [Loan Agreement, Section
6.01 (b) and (c).
b)   All land required for the proposed Project (including rights
related thereto) will be acquired and made available to EPC on
a timely basis prior to the award of any civil works contract
[Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, para 7.
c)   EPC will monitor water run-off and sediment loading of the
watershed, assess the severit' of soil erosion and take
appropriate  remedial  action  for  soil  conservation  and
watershed management [Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 5].
d)   The access road to the dam site will be constructed by the
Government/EPC from their own resources and the work will be
completed on a timely basis in accordance with the Project
implementation schedule [Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 2 (b)].
e)   Prior to the effective date of the Loan, EPC will establish a
Project   Office    headed  by   a  Project   Engineer  with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank, for
overseeing the implementation of the proposed Project and for
overall  liaison  with  and  coordination  among  EPC,  the
contractors and consultants [Loan Agreement, Section 6.01 (d);
Schedule 6, para 1].
f)   EPC will take all  steps necessary to provide revenue to
maintain a self-financing ratio of at least 20 per cent, a
debt-service ratio of at least 1.3 times, and a rate of return
on revalued net fixed assets in operation of 5 per cent by
1990 and 8 per cent by 1995 [Project Agreement, Section 2.16,
Section 2.17 and Section 2.18 respectively].
g)   The foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan on-lent to EPC will
be borne by the Government [Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(a)].
The Government has also agreed to EPC's writing off the
existing unrealized foreign exchange losses on outstanding
foreign loans and will bear the future risk of loss from
exchange rate changes on these loans, IDA credit on-lent to
EPC and the EIB loan for the Project. In consideration of
this, EPC will pay to the Government an annual cha-.ge of 2 per
cent per annum on all outstanding foreign loans.
h)   Without delay, the Government will permit EPC to implement the
recommendation of the tariff study proposed under EEC grant
fianmcing in consultation with and as deemed necessary by the
Bank [Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 41.



34
i) EPC will submit to the Bank its unaudited financial statements
within six months of the close of its fiscal year, and will
submit its audited financial statements within nine months
after the close of each fiscal year [Project Agreement,
Section 2.09].
J)   During 1987 the Government will take action for training,
studies and any other measures required for strengthening the
long-term internal capability and management of EPC including
the following actions: (i) training of Samoans in relevant
engineering disciplines with a view to replacing expatriate
engineering staff at EPC, (ii) training of Samoans in computer
programing and system development In order to strengthen
EPC's electronic data processing capability, (iii) revaluation
of EPC's assets and preparation of guidelines for valuation
and depreciation methods to be used in future, and (iv) a
study of the economic and financial costs including long-run
marginal costs of the supply of electricity by EPC by voltage
level, region and season and a proposed tariff structure and
the level of tariffs appropriate for conditions in Western
Samoa [Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para 3].

pre-construction Investigations at the dam site, and costs
relating to environmental protection which may arise.
Physical contingency for other item is provided at 10 per
cent.
(il) Electrical and mechanical equipmnt will be procured under EEC
grant from EEC countries. EEC/BIB representatives considered
4 per cent as the minmlum forecast annual inflation rate for
EEC countries. Keeping In view the countries most likely to
be competitors for civil works contract, a 4 per cent
escalation rate is considered a minImum estimate. Inflation
factors used for local cost are 9 per cent for 1987 and 8 per
cent thereafter.

ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND FINANCTAL ANALYSES
1)  The use of output from Afulilo Project is based on a 4 per cent per
annum rate of growth in demand.-
2)   The local labor costs have been reduced by 50 per cent to allow for
the difference in market wage rate and the opportunity cost of
labor and have been converted into border prices using a
consumption conversion factor (CC?) of .87.
3)   The fuel cost is based on the World Bank oil price projections of
August 1986. The cost of diesel generators and their maintenance
is based on actual experience in Western Samoa which conforms to
general experience elsewhere.
4)   All taxes and duties are excluded from cost estimates.
5)   In the EIRR analysis, the revenue from the sale of electricity
output from Afulilo is converted into border prices using a CCF of
.87.
6)   In the financial analysis, the costs are as they will be borne by
EPC. The fuiel cost includes a duty of 42 per cent on the CIF
value.
7)   All costs and benefits are in 1986 prices.
8)   In the economic analyses:
(i)  The opportunity cost of land and resettlement costs, being
very small, are ignored.
(ii)  Sunk costs have also been ignored.
(iii)  Consumer surplus has not been taken into account in benefit
calculations, although it may be significant.
9)   Generation from AMulilo, run-of-river (ROR) and thermal have been
estimated by the consultants based on computer simulations as
follows:
