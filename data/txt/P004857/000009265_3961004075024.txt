MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF WESTERN SAMOA
FOR THE AFULILO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed supplemental credit of SDR 0.8
million (the equivalent of US$1.0 million) to the Independent State of Western Samoa is submitted for
approval. The supplemental credit would result in an increase in the amount of Development Credit 1781-
WSO from SDR 2.4 million to SDR 3.2 million. The proposed supplemental credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with the same repayment terms as the original credit and would help finance the ongoing Afulilo
Hydroelectric Project. The project will continue to be co-financed by the Asian Development Bank, whose
staff have supervised project progress since appraisal in 1986, the European Investment Bank, the
Commission of the European Community (EC), and the beneficiary of the credit, the Electric Power
Corporation (EPC). A summary showing the increase in the financing to be provided by each co-financier
is shown in the Financing Plan, and details of the financing arrangements are given in Schedule A.
2.   Country Background. Western Samoa is a small country in the central South Pacific consisting
mainly of two volcanic islands, Upolu, and Savai'i. The population of 160,000 is concentrated on the coastal
fringes of these islands and reliant for transportation on each island's circumferential road. While basic
indicators such as health and literacy are high by developing country standards, the economy is fragile,
reliant on substantial inflows of assistance and remittances and very susceptible to external shocks.
Agriculture and subsistence farning continue to dominate the economy in terms of production and
employment. While the export of traditional tradeables has continued to decline, hastened by the impact of
two recent cyclones, overall export earnings are estimated to have increased in 1992 due to the growing
contribution of the manufacturing sector.
3. Cyclone Ofa and Cyclone Val. From February I to 4, 1990, Western Samoa was struck by Cyclone
Ofa. The South Western Pacific is an area which is susceptible to cyclones; however, those equalling the
intensity of Ofa are very infrequent. In Samoa's case, the worst cyclone previously recorded this century
was the hurricane of 1966 in which winds of 82 knots (94 miles/hour, 43 meters/sec) were experienced; the
last cyclone before 1990 to strike Western Samoa, Gina in January 1989, recorded maximum wind speeds
of 43 knots for one day and caused damage estimated at US$8 million. By comparison, Cyclone Ofa lasted
for four days with maximum wind speeds of 97 knots, and wave heights in excess of 2 meters above normal,
and caused damage estimated at US$140 million - a figure in the same order of magnitude as Samoa's
estimnated 1989 GDP of US$139 million. The number of deaths amounted to eleven. Twenty-two months
later, as the economy was showing signs of recovery, Western Samoa was struck by Cyclone Val which hit
the two islands from December 6-9, 1991. Val was characterized by very high winds which reached 92
knots with gusts up to 130 knots, accompanied by torrential downpours. The damage to natural resources,
agriculture, communications, infrastructure, health and education facilities, public and private structures of
all kinds as well as the lives and livelihood of the people was more than the damage caused by Cyclone Ofa.
Damage was estimated at US$300 million. Of this total, just over 50 percent is the estimated cost of damage
to buildings, dwellings and other structures, and nearly 40 percent was the damage to primary industry,
environment, parks and reserves. Exposed services, such as power supply and distribution networks and
telecommunications services, were very badly damaged. Water supply services suffered damage mainly to
water intakes, which also affected hydroelectricity production, and to water mains where uprooted trees and
landslides ruptured the pipelines. The deaths of 12 persons were attributed to Cyclone Val.
4    The Power Sector. Cyclone Val's high winds caused heavy damage to the electric power system.
There was extensive damage to the transmission and distribution systems of the Electric Power Corporation
(EPC), to its buildings and staff houses and to the raceways of its hydroelectric power stations. In addition,



damage was sustained at the site of the Afulilo Hydroelectric Project which is under construction and
financed in part b) Credit 1781-WSO. Total danage was assessed at approximately US$2.2 million,
including US$1.2 rnillion for the power system and about US$1.0 million (net of insurance) at the Afulilo
project. The overhead distribution systems on both Upolu and Savai'i suffered severe damage. Damage on
Savai'i was more extensive, with all its three high voltage systems affected and over 70 route krn of
overhead line requiring replacement of poles, crossarms, insulators and conductors. About 45 overhead
substations with their transformers and associated protection gear were damaged beyond repair. Damage
to the Afulilo project involved both high wind and water damage to the site works and to the contractors'
on-site offices and housing, and the destruction of 400 tons of cement. In addition, the effect of the cyclone
included the loss by the main contractor of more than three months' working time.
5.   EPC acted with speed after the cyclone had subsided, and restored power to some parts of the capital
and its emergency centers and the hospitals within a few days, but repairs to the damaged system to bring
it back to its pre-cyclone condition will continue for some time. Emergency donor assistance after the
cyclone included three line crews, with vehicles, tools and materials, from the Auckland Power Board of
New Zealand which assisted EPC to restore the power distribution network on Upolu and Savai'i.
6.   Project Objectives. The project's overall objectives, which have not changed since appraisal, are
to support the energy policy of the Government of Western Samoa (GWS) of developing indigenous
renewable energy resources for generating electricity at an economic cost to displace high cost electricity
generated by burning imported diesel at Upolu's diesel power station, which is more complex to operate and
maintain than hydroelectric plant, and which consumes expensive imported spare parts and consumables.
The output of the project will supplement electricity generated by run-of-the-river hydrostations during the
dry season, when output from these is reduced due to low stream flows, requiring diesel generation to meet
the electricity demnand.
7.   The Afulilo Hydroelectric Project Description. The project, as described in the President's Report
(No. P-4499-WSO) for Credit 178 1-WSO dated March 25, 1987, remains essentially the same. The Afulilo
project, which is currently under construction and about 65 % complete, is located in the Upper Salani Basin
some 26 km southeast of Apia. Afulilo will be the first hydroelectric development in Upolu to provide over-
season storage and will substantially increase hydro energy and firm capacity during the dry season. The
project involves construction of a 20 meter high darn, together with a tunnel headrace and penstock to
convey water to a power station with two 2 MW turbine generators located at Fagaloa Bay on the north-east
coast of Upolu. The output from Afulilo will be transmitted to Apia via an existing feeder which is being
upgraded from 22 kV to 33 kV as part of the project. It is estimated that the Afulilo project will add
approximately 24 GWh/year of average energy potential to the Upolu system. Simulation studies of Afulilo,
operating in conjunction with existing run-of-river plant, indicate that more than 60% of the average output
from Afulilo can be generated during the dry season.
8.   Project Cost to Completion. At appraisal in 1986, the project cost was estimated at US$17.2
million. In June 1989, bids for the civil works contract were received which exceeded the appraisal
estimates. Based on the revised estimates, and the civil works bid price, the project cost increased by 55 %
to US$26.6 million. The co-financiers re-confirmed the economic and financial viability of the project in
July 1990, and as a result, the contribution of the EC to the project was increased to US$11.4 million to
finance the extra project cost. The other co-financing arrangements for funding the foreign element of the
project remained as described in the President's Report of March 27, 1987. Changes to the appraised
design, which were approved by the co-financiers, included a larger power house and an oversized penstock
with a bifurcation. These changes were made in anticipation of the next stage of the scheme's development,
which will be the proposed expansion of the plant by the planned 2 MW generator and the Vaipu basin
pumping scheme, which will increase energy production at the power-house by a further 6 GWh per year.



- 3 -
9.   The current estimate of the total project cost to completion, with conmnissioning scheduled for April
1993, is US$30.7 million. The revised total financing required (including interest during construction), is
US$33.2 million, which is US$6.6 million higher than the July 1990 estimate. A breakdown of this 25%
increase is given in Annex 1, as determined by an ADB re-appraisal of the project carried out in September
1992. The Association's staff has reviewed the increase and is satisfied that the extra costs to be borne by
EPC are justified and have been kept to a minimumr. About 24% (US$1.5 million) of the increase has been
directly caused by the cyclone and the redesign of some of the project's components to accomrnodate even
higher wind speeds than had been included in the original design.
10.  Rationale for the Supplemental Credit. The main rationale for the supplemental IDA credit is to
finance the repair and reconstruction necessitated by the effects of the cyclone at the Afulilo facility. The
Association would join ADB and EC on a parallel basis in providing the additional financing necessary to
complete the facility.   This will allow the Association opportunities to contribute to sector policy
development, support institutional development in EPC and help alleviate the adverse impact of Cyclone Val
and with redesign (paragraph 9) protect against the effects of future cyclones on the project. The proposed
operation falls within the policy requirements for granting supplementary loans or credits.
11.  Although it might have been possible to secure additional funds from other sources, it is very doubtful
that this could have been provided in time to prevent interruption of the ongoing project execution. Any
further delays in completing the project would entail partial or total demobilization of contractors and
supervising consultants, which would result in even higher costs. A supplemental credit is therefore
proposed which would help complete the financing plan and ensure full implementation of the project.
12. Economic Justification. ADB has carried out a financial and economic analysis of the project based
on the revised cost estimates and on the same criteria used in the original appraisal report. Based on the
recently increased tariff rates, the financial internal rate of return is estimated to be 10 percent compared
with 12 percent at appraisal. The project's economic internal rate of return is now estimated to be 12
percent compared with 11 percent at appraisal. On a sunk cost basis the financial and econornic internal
rates of return are 21 percent and 24 percent respectively.
13. Completion of the project remains attractive compared with the diesel generation alternative. The
economic equalizing discount rate (on a sunk cost basis) with the diesel alternatives is estimated at 11
percent; the financial equalizing discount rate for EPC being 19 percent. ln addition, the project will (i)
decrease the reliance on an imported fuel which has inherent price uncertainties; (ii) decrease harmful
atmospheric emissions; and (iii) have the potential for future expansion.
14. Project Cost Table and Financing Plan. The revised project costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Procurement has already been completed and was performed in accordance with the
President's Report of March 25, 1987. The revised disbursements from the credit are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Western Samoa are given
in Schedules C and D.
15. Implementation. Construction work on the project commenced in September 1990, and the project
was originally scheduled to commence generation in late 1992. The project will continue to be implemented
for EPC by the existing contractors supervised by a consortium of consultants which has proved to be
satisfactory. EPC has set up a competent in-house project team, including a mature and experienced project
engineer, and competent Samoan project liaison officer and qualified project accountant. If supplemental
financing is provided, and no further force majeure occurs, the Afulilo scheme is expected to be
commissioned in June 1993.

16.  Environmental Impact. Prior to the appraisal of the Afulilo project, its environmental impact was
assessed by ADB-financed consultants and judged by ADB and the other donors, including the Association,
to be satisfactory. The projcct will have little effect on flora and fauna, and the hydro-generated electricity
will reduce the need for diesel generation and thus reduce exhaust emissions in the Apia region.
17.  Benefits, Sustainability and Risk.  The completion of the project will bring about major
improvements to the economy of Western Samoa because with this scheme and the other run-of-the-river
stations, which are currently being rehabilitated, Western Samoa can become virtually self-reliant on an
indigenous renewable energy resource for the country's generation of electricity. The project-specific risk
regarding possible reservoir seepage, identified at appraisal in 1986, which could have jeopardized the
sustainability of the project, was studied further and addressed adequately in the final project design.
18.  Actions Taken and Agreed. Compliance with the covenants of Credit 1781-WSO has generally been
satisfactory, except for EPC's financial performance and the delayed submission to IDA of EPC's audited
annual accounts. The latter is a general problem in Western Sarnoa caused by the additional workload
arising from a change in the fiscal year and the disruptions of Cyclone Val. The Association, under the
Supplemental Credit for the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2132-WSO), has agreed on an
action plan with GWS and project implementing agencies to bring all IDA projects, including the Afulilo
project, into compliance with audit requirements under those projects by September 30, 1993. This
agreement with regard to EPC is being reconfirmed in the legal documents for this Supplemental Credit.
Accordingly, EPC will furnish to the Association by September 30, 1993 audit reports of its accounts for
the period January 1990 to June 1992. Funding has been provided under the Supplemental Credit for the
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2132-WSO) for the Government to engage independent
auditors to assist in completing overdue audit reports.
19. EPC's inability to meet financial performance targets has been due to the delays in completing the
Afulilo facility (which will greatly reduce more expensive diesel power generation) and lack of adjustment
of its tariffs which have not reflected the full cost of electricity production and supply. In 1992 GWS
approved for EPC a tariff increase as well as an increase in the monthly service charge to cover the cost of
production and supply, which will result in an increased income per unit of electricity sold of about 22%.
20. The project is expected to be completed by October 31, 1993, or nearly three years from the original
completion date for Credit 1781-WSO. As a result of this delay, the Amending Agreement for the
supplemental credit will extend the credit closing date to June 30, 1994 and will shift the target dates for the
EPC's annual rate of return on its revalued net fixed assets in operation to 5% in FYs 1994-96 and 8% in
FY1997 and thereafter.
21. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
