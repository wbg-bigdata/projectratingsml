MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Western Samoa
Afulilo Hydroelectric Project (Credit 1781-WSO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Western Samoa: Afulilo Hydroelectric Project
(Credit 1781-WSO, approved in FY87) and its supplement (Credit 1781-1-WSO, approved in FY93). The
summary was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The main text was contributed by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which co-financed the project. The Borrower, the Electric Power
Corporation (EPC) did not contribute to the PCR. The IDA credits totaling SDR 3.2 million were closed
on January 26, 1995, two years after the original closing date, at which time SDR 0.55 million were
canceled.
The main objective of the project was to reduce the country's dependence on imported fuels for
electricity generation through a greater exploitation of the country's hydro power sources. The project
comprised the building of the 4MW Afulilo hydroelectric plant and consultant services for its design,
procurement and construction supervision.
The project met its objectives albeit at twice the expected cost and three years behind schedule.
The main causes of cost escalation and delay were: (i) a need to change the scope of the project based on
detailed engineering designs which were only available after Board approval; and (ii) the repair of damages
inflicted by two cyclones. The financial rate of return is reestimated at seven percent compared to twelve
percent at appraisal even though electricity tariffs were almost doubled. But EPC did not comply with the
covenants on debt service coverage and rate of return on revalued assets (it was always less than 5
percent), and reporting on its finances was deficient. IDA was lax in applying remedies during its
execution, and significant environmental issues are still outstanding.
The project outcome is rated as satisfactory because it met its major objective and the reestimated
economic rate of return is about 10 percent. Sustainability is rated as uncertain, however, since Borrower
financial and management problems may affect project operation and maintenance. Institutional
development impact is rated as negligible given the remaining financial problems and poor operating and
monitoring capacity of EPC.
No audit is planned.

Project Completion Report
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Afulilo Hydroelectric project in
Western Samoa for which credit 1781 -WSO in the amount of SDR 2.4 million was signed on
June 18, 1987, and a supplemental credit 1781-1-WSO in the amount of SDR 0.8 million was
signed on May 26, 1993. The project was co-financed by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), the Commission of the European Community (EC) and the European Investment
Bank (EIB). The credit closing date was August 31, 1993, and the supplemental credit
closing date was August 31, 1994. The credit and supplemental credit accounts were closed
on January 26, 1995, and undisbursed balances of SDR 384.80 and SDR 544,891.69 were
canceled.
Under an agreement between the International Development Association (IDA) and
the ADB, the ADB was responsible for the administration and supervision of the
implementation of the project. This PCR consists of an evaluation summary from IDA's
perspective, prepared by IDA staff, and a project completion report (PCR) prepared by staff
of the ADB subsequent to an ADB project completion mission in August 1994. The ADB
loan and ADB supplementary loan closed on November 15, 1993 and December 31, 1994
respectively.

Project Completion Report
SUMMARY FROM IDA's PERSPECTIVE
Background    The project was jointly appraised by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the
Commission of the European Community (EC), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and IDA in
September 1986, when project costs were estimated to be US$17.2 million.  The financing
arrangements were ADB: US$ 5.4 million equivalent; EC: US$ 4.75 million equivalent; EEB: US$
2.54 million equivalent and IDA: US$ 3.0 million equivalent. ADB agreed to be responsible for
supervision and administration of the project. In June 1989, bids for the civil works contract were
received which exceeded the appraisal estimates (see paragraph 7 of ADB's PCR). Based on the
revised estimates, and the civil works bid price, the project cost increased by 55% to US$26.6
million. The co-financiers re-confirmed the economic and financial viability of the project in July
1990, and as a result the contribution of the EC to the project was increased to US$11.4 million to
finance the extra project cost. ADB and IDA did not increase their lending for the project. Changes
to the appraised design, which were approved by the co-financiers, included a larger power house
and an oversized penstock with a bifurcation, in anticipation of a future stage of the scheme's
development, which will be the proposed expansion of the plant by a planned 2 MW generator and
the Vaipu basin pumping scheme, which will increase energy production at the power-house by 25%
to 30 GWh per year.
Project objectives    The project's overall objectives were to support Government's energy
policy of developing indigenous renewable energy resources (hydropower) for generating electricity
at an economic cost to displace high cost electricity generated by burning imported diesel at Upolu's
diesel power station, which is more complex to operate and maintain than hydroelectric plant, and
which consumes expensive imported spare parts and consumables.
Cyclone damage and the need for a supplemental credit  Two cyclones struck Western Samoa
in 1990 (Cyclone Ofa) and in 1991 (Cyclone Val), with continuous wind speeds in excess of 90
miles/hour. Damage was considerable, and the storms are estimated to have caused over US450
million worth of damage. Damage, sustained at the site of the Afuililo Hydroelectric Project, which
was under construction, involved both high wind and water damage to the site works and to the
contractors' on-site offices and housing, and the destruction of 400 tons of cement. In addition, the
effect of the cyclone included the loss by the main contractor of more than three month's working
time. In September 1992, the project, which was nearing completion was re-appraised by ADB, EC,
EIB and IDA. The joint mission estimated that the costs of the damage inflicted by the storms on
the partly completed works, resulting contractors' delays, increased interest during construction, and



- ii -
redesigns of some structures to protect them against higher than expected wind velocities, would
increase project costs by about US$6.6 million, from US$26.6 million to US$33.2 million. Details of
the estimated project cost to completion, and the arrangements for project financing via an IDA
supplemental credit (SDRO.8 million), an ADB supplementary loan (US$2 million equivalent), and
an increase in EC financing (US$ 1.4 million equivalent) are shown at Tables 1 and 2 of the PCR.
The actual cost of the project, including interest during construction, was US$32.5 million.
Results Based on the tariff rates, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was at re-appraisal
estimated to be 10 percent compared with 12 percent at appraisal. The project's economic internal
rate of return (EIRR) was estimated to be 12 percent compared with 11 percent at appraisal. On a
sunk cost basis the financial and economic intemal rates of return were estimated to be 21 percent
and 24 percent respectively. Completion of the project was judged to be attractive compared with
the diesel generation alternative. The economic equalizing discount rate (on a sunk cost basis) with
the diesel alternatives was estimated at 11 percent; the financial equalizing discount rate for EPC
being 19 percent. In addition the project would (i) decrease the reliance on an imported fuel which
would have inherent price uncertainties; (ii) decrease harmful atmospheric emissions; and (iii) have
the potential for future expansion via the proposed Vaipu pumping scheme. Details of ADB's
estimates of the EIRR (9.7%) and the FIRR (7.4%) at project completion are given at paragraph 23
and Appendix 7 of the PCR.
Implementation Construction work on the project commenced in September 1990, and the project
was originally scheduled to commence generation in late 1992.  At re-appraisal the mission
concluded that if no further force majeure occurred, the Afulilo scheme could be expected to be
commissioned in April 1993. In fact, reservoir impounding began in May 1993, the scheme began
trial operation in June 1993, and was in full commercial production by November 1993.
Environmental impact Prior to appraisal the project's environmental impact was assessed by
ADB-financed consultants and judged by ADB and the donors to be positive. The project was
expected to have little effect on flora and fauna, and the hydro-generated electricity would reduce
the need for diesel generation and thus reduce exhaust emissions in the Apia region.  These
expectations have been realized. The ADB makes some recommendation to the Government at
paragraph 30 of the PCR, which will further help to protect and improve the environment.
Benefits, sustainability and risk  The completion of the project is bringing about major
improvements to the economy of Western Samoa, because with this scheme and the other run-of-
the-river hydroelectric power stations, which are currently being rehabilitated, and are generally less
expensive and easier to maintain, Western Samoa has been able to become nearly totally self-reliant
on an indigenous renewable energy resource for the country's generation of electricity. The project



- iii -
specific risk regarding possible reservoir seepage, identified at appraisal in 1986, which could have
jeopardized the sustainability of the project, was studied further and addressed successfully in the
final project design. The sustainability of this hydroelectric scheme is judged to be very robust.
Compliance with covenants   Compliance with  covenants for credit 1781-WSO  and  for
supplemental credit 1781-1-WSO has generally been satisfactory, except for EPC's financial
performance and the delayed submission to IDA of EPC's audited annual accounts. IDA's and
ADB's covenants with the Government and with EPC are generally similar. The difficulties that
EiPC has in complying with them, in particular because it is difficult for EPC to recruit and retain
staff of a high caliber, are dealt with in paragraphs 24, 25 and 26 of the PCR.
Findings and lessons learned By ceding project administration to ADB and not participating in
supervision missions, IDA was not in a position to exercise quality control. IDA was not intimately
involved in the procurement exercise for the civil works, nor involved in the change in the project
design, which brought about large increases in costs compared to the appraisal estimates. At the
time of appraisal the project design depended on the results of a feasibility report. Some of the costs
and time over-run probably could have been avoided if the financiers had proceeded to project
approval on the basis of a detailed project design, or better still, waited for the results of the civil
works procurement procedure to be known.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Objectives, Rationale and Scope
1.          A principal objective of the long-term energy policy of the Govemment of
Western Samoa has been to reduce the country's dependence on imported fuels through
development of indigenous renewable energy sources. The Afulilo Hydroelectric Project was
formulated in line with this policy to assist the country develop its hydroelectric resources and
thereby displace diesel-electric power generation and also supplement electricity generation
from run-of-river hydropower stations. The Project, executed by the Electric Power Company
(EPC), provided the first storage hydroelectric plant in Western Samoa with 4 MW of installed
capacity.
11. EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Project Components
2.          The Project, based on conventional hydropower plant design, provided for the
following components: (i) a concrete dam with two ungated spillways on either side of a central
column including sluice and intake, (ii) a headrace running through two tunnels (0.5 km and
0.4 km long, respectively), (iii) a surge chamber and a high-pressure penstock, (iv) a
powerhouse with provision for three 2-MW turbogenerator sets and three transformer bays; (iv)
two 2-MW turbine-generators, auxiliary equipment, step-up transformers and switchgear; (v)
power transmission lines; (v) consulting services; and (vi) the services of a technical review
expert (TRE).
B.    Implementation Arrangements
3.          As envisaged during appraisal, EPC established a Project Office to supervise the
day-to-day implementation of the Project. This Project Office was jointly headed by a full-time
local Project Coordinator and an expatriate Project Engineer. Both of them reported directly
to EPC's General Manager. EPC also employed an expatriate Project Distribution Engineer on
a one-year contract to assist with the transmission reinforcement included in the Project.
C.    Project Costs
4.          At the time of Project appraisal in September 1986 the total cost of the Project
was estimated at US$17.2 million (exclusive of import duties and taxes), comprising US$13.6
million (about 80 per cent) in foreign currency costs and US$3.6 million equivalent (about 20
per cent) in local currency costs. The appraisal cost estimate was made in 1986 prices and
was based on an EPC-financed feasibility study.' It included provisions for physical
contingencies and price escalation.

1986.



2
5.          Financing for the Project was originally provided by the Bank, the World Bank,
the European Community (EC), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Government/EPC.
The Bank made a loan of US$5.4 million from its Special Funds resources to finance part of the
foreign exchange cost, including US$100,000 for service charge on the Bank loan during
construction (IDC) and US$100,000 for cost recovery of the prior TAY  The World Bank,
through the International Development Association (IDA), agreed to co-finance the Project by
providing a credit amounting to US$3.0 million. The EC, through its Energy Development Fund
(EDF) facility, provided a grant of ECU 5.8 million (US$5.7 million equivalent) under the Lome
Ill Convention, including US$0.6 million equivalent to finance part of the local currency cost of
the Project, and a TA grant of up to ECU 1.0 million (US$1.0 million equivalent) for consulting
and training services in engineering to EPC. EIB extended a loan amounting to US$1.5 million
equivalent to co-finance a part of the local currency cost of the Project. The Govemment/EPC
financed the remaining part of the local currency cost of the Project amounting to US$1.5
million equivalent.
6.          Design and construction supervision consultants were recruited in June 1987.
Following a review of the report produced by the feasibility consultant, design changes were
found to be necessary. In particular, the following alterations were adopted: (i) integration of
a diversion culvert and a discharge sluice at the dam, thereby avoiding a gated overflow
spillway; (ii) realignment and shortening of the headrace by having two tunnels (instead of one)
with a buried pipeline connecting them; (iii) construction of an underground surge tank; (iv)
redesign of transmission lines to account for higher wind speeds; and (v) enlargement of power
house and penstocks to accommodate a third 2 MW turbine generator in the future. These
modifications would have been considered at Project appraisal if the engineering design had
been finalized at that time instead of being included in the engineering consultant's terms of
reference.
7.          After opening the bids for civil works in June 1989, the appraisal estimates were
found to be inadequate partly as a result of the changes referred to above in the scope of work
envisaged at appraisal. A reassessment of the Project's viability was carried out in September
1989 based on revised cost estimates which increased the Project cost by 55 per cent to
US$25.1 million. However, this reassessment confirmed that the Project remained the least-cost
generation alternative. A revised financing plan was finalized in July 1990 to cover a total
Project cost of US$26.6 million. The increase by US$1.5 million over the September 1989
estimate was due mainly to increased consulting services envisaged. The bulk of the additional
financing required above that arranged at appraisal was provided by EC, the share of which
in the Project financing increased from US$5.7 million to US$10.7 million equivalent. EIB's
contribution increased from US$1.5 million to US$3.2 million while the Government's/EPC's
share increased from US$1.5 million to US$3.6 million equivalent. An amount of US$0.23
million was provided by Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
8.   In July 1992, a Development Partners' Meeting was held between representatives of the
Government/EPC and the five co-financiers in Western Samoa to review the Project. The
Government and the EPC reported that the cost of the Project had increased from the July 1990
estimate mainly because of currency fluctuations, damage and suspension of work caused by
TA No. 350-SAM: Feasibility Study of Fagaloa/Afulilo Hydropower Scheme, for
US$348,000, approved on 22 April 1980.



3
Cyclone Val in December 1991, need to further strengthen transmission lines to withstand wind
speeds up to 200 km/hr, increased piling efforts to meet weak geological conditions at the
powerhouse site and the extended period of engineering consulting services required. A Bank
Reappraisal Mission visited Western Samoa in September 1992 and estimated the Project cost
as US$33.2 million equivalent, consisting of a foreign currency cost of US$28.4 million and a
local currency cost of US$4.8 million equivalent. This represented an increase of US$16.0
million, or 93 per cent, over the appraisal estimate, and US$6.6 million over the July 1990 cost
estimates. Details of the Project costs and financing plans at Project appraisal, (September
1986), revised estimates (July 1990) and at reappraisal (September 1992) are shown in Table

9.    On April 22,1993 the supplementary loan of US$2.0 million from Special Funds resources
was approved by the Board.Y This increased the Bank's financing of the Project cost in dollar
terms to US$7.7 million but in relative terms, the Bank's share in the total Project cost decreased
from 31.4 per cent to 23.2 per cent. The balance of the cost overrun was covered by
supplementary financing of US$1.6 million from EC, US$1.0 million from IDA and US$2.0 million
from the Government/EPC. The Government and EPC were granted retroactive financing in view
of the fact that proceeds of the first loan were expected to run out prior to the proposed
supplementary loan becoming effective. The purpose of retroactive financing was to enable the
Government and EPC to continue payments under the two existing Bank-financed contracts
(consulting services for construction supervision and construction of civil works), thereby

avoiding their suspension. Retroactive financing, was estimated at 40-50 per cent of the
proposed loan amount of US$2 million.

10.         The actual Project cost1' including IDC is US$32.47 million with US$27.03 million
in foreign exchange and US$5.43 million in local currency.  It has exceeded the appraisal
estimate of US$17.2 million by US$15.3 million or 89 per cent, but is lower than the
supplementary loan processing estimate of US$33.2 million by US$0.7 million or 2 per cent. The
commissioning of major equipment under the Project was completed by mid-June 1993 when
trial operations commenced.
D.    Project Schedule
11.          Key Project events are listed in Appendix 1 and a comparison of projected and
actual implementation is presented in Appendix 2. Commercial operations began in November
1993, more than three years behind the appraisal schedule. The delays incurred during Project
implementation are primarily due to: (i) delays in procurement and (ii) delays in construction.
The actual time taken for procurement was three years against the appraisal estimate of one and
a half years. One year was lost between the time of bid opening in June 1989 and the
commencement of contracting for civil works due to the need to have a revised financing plan.
The delays in construction were due mainly to: (i) increased scope of work above that
envisaged at appraisal, including expansion of the powerhouse to accommodate a third turbine-
it    See pages (iv) and (v) - Project data.

generator set; (ii) damage caused by Cyclone Val which made a temporary suspension of work
necessary; (iii) poor condition of public roads to the site; (iv) change in the regulations goveming
the storage of explosives which slowed tunneling work considerably; (v) the sinking of two ships
in October 1991 bearing cement and other construction materials; (vi) breakdown of the cable
crane used for penstock installation; (vii) land disputes which halted work on the Taalefaga-
Lalomauga transmission line and delayed construction of the new 33 kV line to Tanugamanono;
and (ix) the need to clear the reservoir of trees and other vegetation.
E.    Engagement of Consultants and Procurement of Goods and Services
1.    Engagement of Consultants
12.         A consortium of engineering consultants assisted EPC in implementingthe Project.
The services provided by the consultants included the preparation of detailed design, technical
specifications and tender documents, as well as tender evaluation and construction supervision.
An independent expert specialized in the design and construction of hydropower schemes of this
nature was engaged as the Technical Review Expert (TRE) to review and advise EPC and the
Bank periodically on matters concerning Project design and implementation.  Both the
consultants and the TRE were engaged by EPC following the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of
Consultants.
2.    Procurement of Goods and Services
13.         Procurement of goods and services to be financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, and
EIB was undertaken on an international competitive bidding basis in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement of goods and services under the EC grant followed
procedures set out by EC, which were found satisfactory to the Bank. The various contract
packages and their financing are shown in Appendix 3.
F.    Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
14.         The engineering consultants on the whole performed satisfactorily though broader
experience with small-scale hydro plants on their part would have been of further benefit to the
Project. The Technical Review Expert (TRE) advised the consultants on project design aspects
prior to production of tender documents, and also made periodic site visits throughout the
construction stage. The TRE gave useful advice to the consultants conceming project design
aspects. The TRE was critical of the standard of workmanship during his third and fourth site
visits in July and October 1992, but noted a marked improvement in quality during his fifth and
sixth visits in January and June 1993. The civil contractor, though experienced, was unable to
keep-to l.e~'R,ect schedule partly due to weak site management, the poor state of repair of
plant and unL. taffing. Several external factors, including two cyclones in February 1990 and
Recember 199-a.nd a change in the Government's regulations governing the storage of
explosives, also imp;eded progress.
1.          All e, suppliers performed satisfactorily with the exception of the mechanical
contractor for the provision of the emergency gates, the delivery of which was delayed;
considerable site rettification work and replacement of incorrect parts was also necessary.



6
G.   Conditions and Covenants
16.        Appendix 4 gives details of the status of compliance with loan covenants. EPC
has generally failed to comply or only marginally complied with most of the covenants in the
Project and Loan Agreements. One of the covenants that EPC has not fully complied with is that
concerning land acquisition, which required all land for the Project to be acquired and made
available to EPC prior to the award of the civil works contractY  Acquisition of land was
impeded by the complicated system of ownership in Western Samoa, according to which land
does not belong to specific individuals but rather to community entities. EPC has also yet to
take appropriate action over soil conservation and watershed management as outlined in the
Loan AgreementY Furthermore, EPC failed to renew insurance coverage2' for its power plant
and distribution systems prior to its lapsing in August 1992 and only obtained appropriate
coverage in July 1994 (as a condition of effectivity of the Supplementary Loan).A
17.        In respect of financial performance (see Appendix 5), EPC has not been meeting
its rate of return covenant with the Bank (5 per cent rate of return on revalued assets).Y EPC's
rate of return performance in FYI 993 (actual) and FY1994 (provisional) were 2.7 and 3.4 per
cent, respectively, while the projected figure for FY1995 is 1.0 per cent. EPC, has also not been
complying with the covenants on debt-service ratio (less than 1.3 times the estimated maximum
debt-service requirement)§' and on self-financing ratio (20 per cent of capital expenditures).Z'
EPC's five-year average self-financing ratios for FY1991 and FY1992 were 21.9 and 6.4
respectively. Also, EPC has not been fumishing the Bank, on a regular basis, with its unaudited
financial statements within six months and audited financial statements within nine months of the
close of the fiscal year to which they relate, its approved budget for the following fiscal year and
its updated five-year financial projections (including a tariff review) by 30 June of each year, as
required under the Project AgreementY Another significant element in EPC's financial
performance is its delayed payment to the Government of the interest on Bank loans and IDA
loans and the annual 2 per cent foreign exchange risk charge on all outstanding foreign loans.
H.   Disbursements
18.        A comparison between projected and actual disbursements is presented in
Appendix 6. The first disbursement for the original loan (SAM-813) was made in August 1987;
however, due to delays in Project implementation, the last disbursement was in November 1993.
Disbursement of funds under the supplementary loan were held up due to delayed effectiveness
of the loan. The supplementary loan approved on 22 April 1993 was declared effective only on

30 June 1994. Arrangements have been made for the loan account to remain open for a further
six months until all disbursements under the supplementary loan have been effected.
I.    Environmental Impact
19.         An environmental impact study was included in the initial feasibility report. This
study was judged to be less than adequate by the Bank's OENV. A more detailed environmental
impact assessment (EIA) was carried out in 1987 as part of the Project design and, together with
technical studies, formed the basis of the Bank's decision to proceed with Project
implementation. In view of the relative size and cost of the Project, the South Pacific Regional
Environment Programme commissioned a further EIA, which was carried out by the New Zealand
Department of Conservation in December 1991. This assessment noted that a significant
environmental effect of creating the Afulilo storage reservoir was the submergence of the
Punataemo'o swamp forest, an important highland swamp forest in Western Samoa upstream
of the Afulilo dam. However, in respect of downstream effects, it gave an assurance that the
reduced waterflow from the Afulilo Basin was unlikely to have any serious hydrological effect on
the Vaipu swamp, which lies immediately downstream of the dam. Given that the Vaipu swamp
would be the only remaining highland swamp in Western Samoa, the report stressed that any
future expansions of the Project should be preceded by a detailed EIA.
20.         There was no need to relocate any persons as a result of the Project. Land use
alteration was negligible except for the uninhabited Punataemo'o swamp. Extensive clearing of
vegetation in the Afulilo Basin was, however, necessary before impounding of the reservoir could
commence. Residents living near the water discharge from the powerhouse (in the vicinity of
Fagaloa Bay) have complained of increased mosquito infestation, foul smell and reduced fish
catch in the Fagaloa Bay. It is suggested that these and other possible environmental concerns
be addressed by a post-commissioning environmental report, as recommended in the December
1991 EIA.
J.    Project Benefits
21.         The major objective of the Project was to displace costly electricity supply from
diesel generating plants. The Project accomplished that objective through the addition of 4 MW
of storage-based hydropower generating capacity to the existing run-of-river hydropower
generating capacity of 6.3 MW. A review of the Project performance indicates that 18 GWh of
electricity was produced over the 12 months ending on 30 June 1994 (at 51 per cent plant
factor). The Project's electricity output during this period was restricted by inflow needs for
reservoir fill-up (particularly in July and August 1993) and to some extent by the rate at which
power distribution facilities could be expanded to supply suppressed demand. It can be
reasonably expected that the Project output will gradually increase to the appraisal estimate of
24 Gwh a year (68 per cent plant factor) with the easing of operational constraints and better
coordinated operation of the Project with EPC's other hydropower plant as well as with the
thermal power plant.Y

A Bank-financed ADTA to assist such improved coordination is programmed for 1995.

22.         The Project will save foreign exchange by limiting the need to import equipment,
diesel oil and spare parts for diesel power plants. In terms of diesel oil use displaced, the
Project will save the country about US$1.6 million per annum in foreign exchange. Beneficiaries
include about 8,000 families and about 1,200 businesses and other establishments on Upolu
Island. The Project has provided greater access to electricity as well as greater security of
electricity supply with hydro generating plant which is more reliable than diesel generating plant.
During the construction period, the Project provided much-needed employment for local labor,
estimated at 3,000 staff-months. After commissioning in June 1993, the Project resulted in 20
permanent jobs for operating and maintaining the power plant.
23.         A re-evaluation of the FIRR and EIRR was undertaken based on actual Project
costs and other data available at Project completion (Appendix 7). The FIRR was determined
to be 7.4 per cent and the EIRR to be 9.7 per cent. The EIRR and FIRR expected at Project
appraisal were 11.0 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively. The re-evaluated FIRR and EIRR
are not as low as would have been expected, given the substantial Project cost overrun, due
mainly to an increase in the average tariff from 28 sene/kWh at appraisal to 43 sene/kWh at
present.
K     Performance of Borrower and Executing Agency
24.         The performance of the Borrower (the Government) was satisfactory while that of
the executing agency (EPC) was less than satisfactory. Continuing institutional weaknesses at
EPC, including prolonged vacancies in its key engineering and financial positions, resulted in
weak administration of EPC and the Project.
25.         EPC's has failed to comply or only partially complied with a number of the loan
covenants in both the original loan and the supplementary loanY EPC's difficulties in attracting
and retaining experienced and qualified staff contributed to the delay in filling the vacant
Financial Controller's position, as well as delays in the submittal of various financial reports,
including financial accounts, approved budgets and five-year plans. The appointment of new
staff for the position of Government Controller and Chief Auditor in the Government also held up
the release of audited accounts.
26.         Despite three separate increases in the electricity tariff since the time of
appraisal,Y EPC's financial performance has been unsatisfactory (see para. 17). This is
attributable to high operating costs resulting mainly from high levels of outage at EPC's run-of-
river hydro generating plant and weak operations and maintenance capabilities. Further tariff
increases will, however, be required particularly in view of the increasing level of debt that EPC
has to meet.
See paragraphs 16 - 17.
At the time of appraisal, tariff was set at 28.1 sene/kWh and was thereafter increased to
32 sene/kWh in August 1990, 40 sene/kWh in December 1990 and 43 sene/kWh in
December 1992.



9
L.    Performance of the Bank
27.         The performance of the Bank was generally satisfactory. At the time of Appraisal,
the Bank accepted the cost estimates as the most appropriate based on the feasibility study.
Some of the cost and time overrun difficulties may have been avoided if the Bank had proceeded
to Project approval with a detailed Project design in hand. However, the steps taken by Bank
staff to reassess the Project in September 1989, revise the financing arrangements In July 1990,
reappraise the Project in September 1992, and provide supplementary financing in April 1993
to expedite the Project, are noteworthy. There was good cooperation between the Bank, the
Executing Agency and the co-financiers, although the involvement of five separate donor
agencies added an unnecessary level of complexity to the Project. The Bank acted as
administrator of the IDA credit and, in so doing, provided an efficient arrangement that served
to reduce some of the reporting burden on EPC. Bank staff carried out periodic Review Missions
sometimes in collaboration with other donor agencies. These Review Missions assessed the
progress of the Project and were useful in resolving Project implementation problems.
III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.    Conclusions
28.         The Project has been successful. It met the major objective of displacing diesel
electricity based power generation by adding 4 MW of storage-based hydro power generation
and thereby helped the Government to develop its indigenous energy sources and reduce its
reliance on imported diesel oil.  Despite the cost and time overruns encountered in
implementation, the Project is still economically and financially viable with re-evaluated EIRR and
FIRR at 9.7 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively.
B.   Recommendations
Project Related
(i)  Future Extensions
29.        In its power expansion plan for Upolu Island, EPC stated that it plans to install a
third generator-turbine unit in the Taalefaga power house as soon as possible.  It is
recommended that further operating information and analysis should be carried out by EPC
before taking a firm position regarding the addition of the third unit.
(ii)  Environment
30.        It is recommended that the Government undertakes to: (i) prepare a post-
commissioning environmental report, as recommended in the December 1991 Environmental
Impact Assessment made by the Department of Conservation of New Zealand; (ii) carefully
record rainfall and inflow data and establish a Catchment Committee to manage the watershed
of the Afulilo Basin; and (iii) draw up a timetable for completing the payment of approved land
compensation claims.



10
(iii) Financial Aspects
31.         An assessment of EPC's financial performance indicates that the company is
experiencing severe difficulties (see para. 23). To redress the situation, it is recommended that
EPC improve its plant and staff operating efficiency, minimize its thermal power generation and
obtain government approval for continued tariff increasesY In addition, it is recommended that
EPC pursue measures such as the payment of performance bonuses and the introduction of
bonding arrangements to attract and retain specially trained staff. It is essential that EPC ensure
payment of interest on Bank and IDA loans in accordance with the agreed re-lending
arrangements between EPC and the Govemment.
(iv) Institutional Aspects
32.         The piggy-backed technical assistance of US$200,000 provided with the original
loan for the Project had as its objective the strengthening of EPC's financial management and
accounting and auditing systems. The assistance was satisfactorily carried out, although EPC
has found it difficult to sustain the systems and procedures introduced due to rapid staff
turnover. EPC has, however, established systems to: (i) prepare its financial statements and
projections; and (ii) input its billing, inventory and accounting information for batch processing
on a bureau-managed computer. It is recommended that EPC examine the cost-effectiveness
of having its own minicomputer, as recommended by the technical assistance consultant.
General
33.         The Govemment and EPC stressed the difficulty of coordinating loans from several
donor agencies. In particular, the negotiations for supplementary financing were complicated
by the need to meet the requirements of five separate co-financiers. It is recommended that the
Bank, when determining the number of co-financiers of projects in small DMCs, take into account
the terms of financing, the financing gap and the documentation requirements of the co-
financiers. It is essential that the executing agency concerned be fully capable of coordinating
and fulfilling the obligations to the financiers.
34.         The Project commenced commercial operations in November 1993. A mission
for the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) could be scheduled towards the end of 1995.
An appropriate ADTA from the Bank to assist in improving EPC's institutional
performance is programmed for 1995.

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES
A.    FIRR and EIRR
1.    The life of the Project is conservatively assumed to be 30 years.
2.    Energy generation in 1993 is actual. From 1994, generation is expected to
gradually build up to the appraisal estimate of 24 GWh.
3.    Throughout the Project life, station use and losses are assumed at 13 per cent of
total generation output. (The actual five-year average was 12.5 per cent.)
4.    Operation and maintenance cost is assumed at 2 per cent of capital cost.
5.    Average revenue is estimated at 43.31 sene/kWh or US$0.1714/kWh based on:
(i) the tariff of WS$0.43/kWh and the minimum charge of WS$1 0 per month; (ii)
16,746 consumers (1992); and (iii) annual sales of 61.65 GWh (estimated 1992
sales).
6.    Consumer surplus for domestic consumers has been calculated based on: (i) a
kerosene price of 67.9 sene/liter; (ii) a kerosene equivalence factor of 1.7; and (iii)
a consumer surplus (curvature correction) factor of 35 per cent.
7.    Consumer surplus for other consumers (industrial, commercial, etc.) has been
calculated based on the use of a 2.5-kW diesel generator set as alternative to
electricity from EPC. This set is assumed to have an economic life of 10 years,
an annual usage of 1,800 hours, a fuel consumption of 0.4 liter/kWh and a capital
cost of WS$7,900. The diesel price is assumed to be 84 sene/liter and the
consumer surplus (curvature correction) factor at 35 per cent.
8.    The exchange rate is assumed at US$1.00 to WS$2.5259.
9.    The standard conversion factor used to convert market price to border price is
0.9.
