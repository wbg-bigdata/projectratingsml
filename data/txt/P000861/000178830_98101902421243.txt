RECONSTRUCTION IMPORT CREDIT
SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
Borrower:             Republic of Ghana
Executing Agency:    Bank of Ghana
Credit Amount:        SDR 37.0 million (US$40 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard
Purpose:              The proposed IDA Credit would make available US$40
million to help meet the priority import requirements of
the Government of Ghana's economic recovery program.
These funds would be allocated to the procurement of
fertilizers, insecticides, agro-chemicals, agricultural
implements, spares and tools, and truck tires, batteries,
and spare parts in accordance with,,the Government's
foreign exchange budget. Counterpart funds would be
allocated to the recurrent or capital costs of priority
projects included in the economic recovery program.
The risks associated with the proposed Credit are that
the economic policy reforms are not fully implemented,
adequate financing is not provided to sustain imports at
the required level, and the goods procured under the
Credit are diverted away from the ultimate benefi-
ciaries. On the basis of the difficult and far-reaching
measures that the Government has already put in place
under the economic recovery program, the efforts being
made to maximize the flow of external assistance to
sustain imports, and the procurement and distribution
arrangements proposed under the Credit, these risks would
be significantly reduced.
Estimated Period of
Disbursement:         July 1983 - June 1984
Rate of Return:       Not applicable
Appraisal Report:    None
Map:                  IBRD 3112R

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION IMPORT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Reconstruction Import Credit to the Republic of Ghana for the equivalent of
SDR 37.0 million (US$40.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic report entitled "Ghana: Economic Memorandum" was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors in May 1979 (2345-GH) and a special study,
"Ghana: Report on Domestic Resource Mobilization", in February 1981 (3072-
GH). Part I of this Report contains the principal findings of an economic
mission which visited Ghana in November/December 1982 and Part II - The
Government's Economic Recovery Program - is based on a follow-up mission in
March 1983, information provided by the Government in May 1983 and a recent
IMF mission to Ghana. Basic economic data and selected social indicators are
summarized in Annex I.
3.       On December 31, 1981 Flight Lt. Rawlings replaced the Government
headed by President Limann. The ruling junta, the Provisional National
Defence Council (PNDC), initially consisted of military men, trade union and
student leaders, and appeared to be leaning towards an inward-looking
strategy. Recent changes, following a coup attempt in November 1982, have
consolidated the power base of Rawlings and strengthened the more pragmatic
elements in the Council.
4.       Ghana has been beset with extreme economic difficulties over recent
years. The discussion in this part of the Report is centered around the
following questions: What endowments does Ghana possess, what has happened in
the past, and where does the economy stand at present. Part II of this report
describes what is being done to rectify the present situation.
Basic Structural Characteristics
5.       Agriculture is the largest sector of the economy, accounting for 50
percent of GDP in 1980, 57 percent of the labor force and 75 percent of
exports. Industrial production and services account for 17.5 and 32 percent
of GDP respectively. Although Ghana had traditionally enjoyed a fairly high
standard of living compared with most other West African nations, the poor
growth performance of the economy over more than a decade has caused a severe
setback. A declining gross national income in the face of a high population
growth rate has contributed to substantial erosion in real per capita income.



- 2 -
The incidence of absolute poverty has been on the increase and almost one half
of the country's total population is now estimated to live in absolute
poverty. Accompanying the stagnation in the economy there has also been a
worsening of income distribution and growing unemployment.  A,t least 18 per-
cent of the labor force is estimated to be unemp'Loyed and under-employment iS
also widespread.
6.       Although Ghana has in the past devoted considerable efforts to the
development of its human resources and is often credited with a relatively
high level of social development, more recent statistics suggest that Ghana's
basic needs indicators are on par with other Sub-Sahara Africa countries with
comparable income per capita. Ghana's population of 12 million is estimated
to be growing at 3 percent. Despite the growth in health facilities, modern
health services are available only to about one third of the people and only
21 percent of these services are available to rural people. Only 35 percent
of the population have access to safe water. Fifty percent of all adult males
and 70 percent of adult females have had no formal education. Although the
education system is well established and elementary education has been free
and universal since 1962, a significant portion of Ghana's middle-to-high
level manpower has migrated to other African countries and overseas in search
of better living conditions.
7.       Ghana is a typical example of a developing country with primary
commodity export concentration. Cocoa (of which Ghana is now the world's
third largest producer) contributes about 70 to 80 percent of the country's
export earnings and together with timber, gold, manganese and diamonds
accounts for 95 percent of exports. Cocoa purchase in 1982/83 will be around
180,000 metric tons compared to the peak output of 540,000 tons in 1964/65.
Diversification of the export base, although emphasized by every succeeding
Government, has not made much headway during the :Last 25 years.  The decline
in the volume of exports has been the most significant factor underlying
Ghana's poor economic performance.
8.       The basic staple foods are maize, rice, millet, yam, cassava and
plantain. Except for a few years in the early seventies when near self-
sufficiency was reached in basic cereal production, Ghana has been importing
rice and maize (10 to 15 percent of its consumption on average in the last
five years). Yields of the basic staples have been stagnant 1with the major
exception of cassava.  Prolonged drought in 1975-'77 and in 1982-83, inadequate
support services, poor transport facilities and lack of ferti:Lizers and inputs
have contributed to a decline in food production. Domestic output of cereals
is estimated to have declined from 890,000 tons in 1974 to 672,000 tons in
1982.  About 55 percent of the labor force are engaged in farming and nearly
70 percent of the population derive an income from agricultural or related
activities. However, only about 11 percent of the! total land area is
cultivated and divided equally between cocoa and food crops.
9.       Manufacturing in Ghana remains heavily dependent on imported inputs.
Manufacturing contributed 14 percent of GDP in 1971 but this figure has
declined progressively to 9 percent in 1980. Ghana's manufacturing industries
include textiles, steel, tires, oil refining and simple consumer goods. This
sector also provides full and part-time employment; to about 12 percent of the



- 3 -
labor force. As most of the industries are import-dependent for raw materials
and other inputs, the goal of import substitution through industrialization
has not met with much success and has imposed a serious burden on the economy.
10.      Traditionally Ghana has imported its entire petroleum requirements,
mostly in the form of crude oil which is refined domestically and used chiefly
as a source of fuel for the transport sector. Rising oil import prices have
resulted in crude oil imports absorbing an increasingly large percentage of
Ghana's export earnings. Recently, some oil deposits have been discovered and
commercial exploitation has commenced. Production of crude oil is about 2,000
barrels per day equivalent to 7 percent of Ghana's requirements. Hydro-
electric power meets most of Ghana's non-transport commercial energy
requirements.
11.      Mining is the second largest foreign exchange earner after cocoa,
contributing about 10 to 15 percent of Ghana's foreign exchange earnings.
Ghana has a substantial endowment of gold, diamonds, manganese, and bauxite
and production could increase considerably through the rehabilitation of
existing mines and the development of new ore bodies.

-4-
Recent Economic Developments
12.      Despite a relatively well-endowed natural resource base and human
capital, Ghana's economy has been ailing for the past several years.  A
summary of the economic performance trends since 1970 is shown in Table 1.
Prominent among the symptoms have been: declining per capita income, persis-
tent high inf. tion, a greatly overvalued exchange rate, flourishing illegal
economic activities such as smuggling, large public sector deficits, a diffi--
cult balance of payments situation, low productivity, low domestic savings and
declining investment, deteriorating transportation network and other infra-
structure, severe under-utilization of productive capacity, high unemployment;,
a brain drain of skilled professionals, a more skewed income distribution and
much weakened institutions.  The reasons for these difficulties are mani-
fold. Political instability and persistent mismanagement of the economy by
successive Governments, an over-extended parastatal sector, sharp increases in
oil prices and adverse terms of trade for Ghana's major exports are among the
most important factors contributing to this situation.
13.      Real GDP has declined in every year since 1975, except for 1978.
Since that year, real per capita income has declined by about 25 percent and
was estimated at $400 in 1981 at the official highly over-valued exchange
rate.  Per capita food availab ,lity is 30 percent lower than in 1975.  Food
production in 1980 was only 88 percent of the level in 1975. Most basic
commodities, except cereals andl starchy staples, are not available or, if they
are available, can be purchased on:Ly on the black market.
14.      Inflation has been rampant in Ghana since the mid 1970's.  The
consumer price index has increased by an average of about 80 percent per annum
since 1975 and reached the triple digit level in 1981. Large public deficits,
excess liquidity and shortage of goods have all contributed to the general
rise in prices. Price controls have *been extensively employed by successive
Governments but with very little success.  The income distribution conse-
quences of inflation have been quite severe for fixed wage earners and cocoa
farmers while traders, import licensees, speculators and farmers with market-
able crops have been the main beneficiaries. There has been some moderation
in inflation in 1982 and the ccnsumer price index is estimated to have risen
by 30 percent as compared to 116 percent in the previous year. This decline
in the rate of inflation was brought about by extraordinary measures such as
demonetization to siphon off excess liquidity, sealing of borcders, severe
restraint on Government expenditure! and monetary growth.
15.      The overvalued exchange rate (which was adjusted only in April 1983)
had acted as a strong disincentive to production for exports. Exports were
discouraged as the cost of their production far exceeded the price received at
the official exchange rate.  Over-valuation also resulted in Ea wide variety of
illegal and unproductive economic activities.  Domestically-produced and
imported goods were smuggled to the Ivory Coast and Togo for sale against the
hard CFA with tremendous losses (estimated unofficially at over $100 million
per annum) to the country's external account.



- 5 -
16.      Under a program of stabilization begun in 1978, Government expendi-
tures were cut by about one third in real terms in 1978/79, 1/ and the budget
deficit was reduced to 5 percent of GDP compared with 12 percent in the
preceding year. However, this improvement was short-lived and could not be
sustained during the subsequent years. The increase in the minimum wage in
November 1980 and a serious shortfall in revenues widened the deficit to 04.7
billion or 10 percent of GDP in 1980/81. Cocoa duties fell dramatically to 5
percent of total revenues in 1980/81 from 47 percent in 1978/79. The collapse
in cocoa revenues was due to the fall in cocoa prices in the world market and
an overvalued exchange rate compounded by acute difficulties in evacuating
cocoa and increases in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board's (GCMB) marketing costs.
In addition, the Government tax base had narrowed as excise and sale tax
assessment was based on official controlled prices of commodities which were
much lower than actual transaction prices. Similarly, import duties were
assessed on the c.i.f. value converted at the official exchange rate while
actual sales of imported commodities took place at much higher black market
rates. The tax-GDP ratio in 1981 declined to about 10 percent of GDP which is
about half the average of similar countries in Africa.
17.      In 1981/82 the government deficit amounted to about  05 billion, i.e.
50 percent of the total estimated expenditures of 010 billion or equivalent to
the total revenue collection. The deficit during the last six months of 1982
was, however, contained at 02.5 billion or almost the same proportion as the
preceding 12 months. In real terms and as a ratio of current GDP, the deficit
went down but this was achieved at a substantial cost. The wage/non-wage
ratio of recurrent expenditures became more skewed while development expen-
ditures as a proportion of total Government expenditures declined
significantly.
18.      The financing of the budget deficits has been the main source of
credit and liquidity expansion in the Ghanaian economy. In 1977 alone the
money supply increased by 60 percent. Following the 1978 stabilization pro-
gram the growth of money supply was held at a more reasonable 29 percent in
1979. But by 1980 the tight rein on monetary policy began to slip. Net
domestic assets of the banking system rose by 29 percent with net claims on
Government rising by 33 percent; money supply rose by 34 percent. The same
pattern was followed in 1981: money supply rose by 55 percent, domestic assets
of the banking system increased by 63 percent and net claims on Government
went up by 63 percent.
19.      The balance of payments difficulties continued to worsen.  Given the
negligible capital inflows, the level of imports and service payments were
perforce held to the level of export earnings. Capital inflows almost dried
up because private capital was shy due to political uncertainties; commercial
lending was not feasible due to accumulation of large arrears and lack of
creditworthiness while official aid was reduced due to lack of action on
macroeconomic policy. Export earnings in 1981 were estimated to be 33 percent
lower than in 1980 ($766 million as compared to $1.1 billion). Continuing
decline in the real value of producer prices and the shortage of consumer
1/   Through 1982 the fiscal year was July-June.



- 6 -
goods in rural areas acted as ifurther disincentives to agricultural production
and contributed to the smuggling of foodstuffs and cocoa to neighboring
countries where consumer and other goods were available.  International
recession also contributed to this poor export performance.  Because of weak
demand, world prices of cocoa recorded a steep fa:Ll in recent years and prices
of other primary exports were equally unfavorable.  Other major "xports -
gold, bauxite, diamonds, and timber - also declined in quantitie_. The
international oil crisis also hit Ghana hard.  Imports of crude and petroleum
products preempted almost one half of the country's export earnings.  The
foreign exchange problems have resulted in the accumulation of external pay-
ments arrears which have damaged Ghana's creditworthiness and its access to
foreign capital markets. The current account balance showed a small surplus
in 1979 - equivalent to 0.3 percent of GNP - but has since registered
increasing deficits, amounting to around 0.7 percent of GNP in 1982.
20.      While the current account deficit is low, it masks the fact that the
decline in the level of imports has created chronic and extremely acute short-
ages of raw materials, spare parts, investment and consumer goods in the eco-
nomy. The import-GDP ratio in Ghana was 20 percent in 1974 but had declined
to only 3.6 percent by 1981 (at; the official exchange rate), signifying an
overall stagnation in production and consumption. Production in the
manufacturing sector has been curtailed to only one fourth of the installed
capacity due to shortage of spare parts, components and impor-ted raw mater-
ials. There has also been a sharp deterioration in the physical infrastruc-
ture, especially roads, railways and the transport fleet. Shortages of fuel,
lubricants and spare parts have immobilized a large part of the trucking and
road maintenance fleet and badly affected the export mining and forestry indu-
stries as well as the efficiency of the ports. It is estimated that about 70
percent of the road vehicle fle!et is presently out of service while more than
one third of Ghana Railway Corporation's locomotives are awaiting spare parts
for major repairs or overhaul.  Road maintenance operations have come to a
virtual standstill and the entire r oad network is deteriorating rapidly and is
already unusable in many places.
21.      In comparison with many African countries, Ghana had originally a
large reservoir of skilled and trained manpower.  In recent years, there has
been a tremendous exodus of teachers, doctors and other professional workers
to other countries where salaries and living conditions are better. It is
reported that approximately one thi-rd of all secondary school teachers have
migrated to Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries.
22.      A growing imbalance is emerging between the quality and output of
skilled manpower and the economy's skilled manpower requirements.  The outflow
of managerial and professional personnel has further thinned the administra-
tive talents in the Civil Service while redundancy and overstaffing is a
problem at lower echelons. The GhaLnaian public administration has been demor--
alized by relatively low salaries, an economic system which has penalized thema
severely compared with other segments of the society, and uncebrtain and
adverse working conditions.  There are problems o:f quality and motivation at
the senior level.



- 7 -
23.      Capital formation was quite rapid during the 1950's, probably
excessive, but became increasingly negative thereafter. By the 1970's, gross
investment averaged only 8.9 percent of GDP suggesting that net investment may
even have been negative. Gross investment is currently estimated at an extra-
ordinarily low 5 percent of GDP as compared to 21 percent for Sub-Sahara
Africa as a whole. In an inflationary environment with very little scope for
productive investment opportunities and negative real interest rates, domestic
savings were also low - about 5 percent of GDP (the average for Sub-Sahara
Africa is 23 percent). Savings deposit rates of 8 to 9 percent provide inade-
quate incentives to savers facing inflation rates in excess of 30 percent.
The binding constraint is, however, availability of foreign exchange rather
than domestic resources for investment.
24.      Ever since independence, state enterprises in Ghana have been
assigned a large role in production and distribution of goods and services.
However, their performance has been distressing both in terms of their output
and their financial record. They have generated serious pressures on fiscal
and monetary policies. The main problems are inefficient management, Govern-
ment control over prices, lack of required inputs, machinery and spare parts,
heavy overhead expenses on redundant labor, too frequent changes in top
personnel and lack of strict accountability.
Economic Developments in 1982/83
25.      As noted earlier, the new Government took some extraordinary measures
soon after it came to power to contain budgetary deficits, monetary growth and
inflation. However, export earnings continued their downward slide and
declined to $875 million in 1982 ($1160 million in 1980). Consequently,
imports had to be curtailed to a level of $694 million, down by 35 percent
from the 1980 level.   This is less than $60 per capita, or about half the
corresponding level for Senegal and one fourth for the Ivory Coast. The
foreign exchange shortage combined with the closing of the border dried up
supplies of raw materials and spare parts, and reduced production levels
throughout the economy. The non-oil imports in 1982, in nominal value, were
lower than the 1974 level. The situation was further exacerbated by an excep-
tionally poor harvest caused by inadequate rainfall, and a shortfall of
332,000 tons of cereal production, a steep fall in world cocoa prices, and the
influx of the Ghanaian citizens who returned from Nigeria.
26.      It is estimated by the Ghanaian authorities that about one million
persons have returned from Nigeria. Although the initially elaborate system
of registration and demographic and economic data collection broke down
quickly, the authorities have been able to form a fairly accurate assessment
of the regional distribution of the returnees. Seventy percent of these
people have returned to Ashanti (32%), Eastern (18%), Central (12%), and
Western (10%) regions. Only 10 percent are reported to be staying in the
Greater Accra region. Limited sample surveys, however, indicate that in
Nigeria the majority of them were involved in non-farm occupations such as
fishing, artisans and domestic help. These particular groups may drift into
Accra, Tema, Kumasi, Takarodi, and other large urban centers in pursuit of
jobs.



- 8 -
27.       The requirements of the additional 10 percent of the population who
returned from Nigeria have added severe pressures on the food availability
situation.  Shortages in the economy became more widespreiad and acute, and
market prices of foodstuffs have shot up in recent months.  Absenteeism on
farms, mines and offices became more pronounced, with adverse effects on
productivity that was low to begin with. To make things wors,e, the inadequate
rainfall in 11' ,2 also lowered the Volta Lake Reservoir to an historical low,
resulting in the shutdown of three out of five potlines of VA" CO Aluminium
Smelter, thus further reducing foreign exchange earnings. Wh:ile the unit
export value of cocoa in 1982 was $1594/ton, it was $2179/ton in 1981,
representing a decline of 37 pe!rcent.
Short Run Outlook and Medium Term Prospects
28.       On April 21, 1983 the Government announced the intro(duction of a
short-term stabilization program and its budget for FY83, and invited the IMF
to negotiate a standby arrangement to provide financial support for the
program. The program, which is described and analyzed in Part; II of this
Report, is centered around an exchange rate adjustment through a system of
exchange bonuses and surcharges.  It also includes fiscal, monetary and
production policies as well as certain institutional reforms.  While the
stabilization program would, with adequate external assistance, provide some
relief from the present crisis situation, it has been conceived as a first
step in a longer term economic recovery program aimed over time at returning
the economy to a more satisfactory growth path.
29.       To make the program successful a substantial infusion of foreign
exchange for increasing the overall level of imports is essential. Also
improved allocation of these imports is required to appreciably augment the
supply of basic consumer goods, raw materials and spare parts to sharpen the
supply response of mining, manufacturing, timber and agricultural activi-
ties. A program to rehabilitate the road, ports, railway and transport infra-
structure of the country will also need substantial external support. The
other tasks that need to be accomplished include improvement of parastatal
operations, a review of the role of the private and public sectors in the
economy and strengthening Government capacity for planning and economic
management.
30.       Ghana's growth prospects beyond the stabilization and rehabilitation
phases will depend to a considerable extent on the determination of the
Government to sustain the kind of economic policies indicated in the economic
recovery program and on an investment plan that fulfills the key requirements
of the economy. The speed of this transition process will depend upon the
Government's ability and willingness to implement the reform program despite
the fact that some of its features may not be universally popular.
31.       Should the Government succeed in maintainiLng a more realistic
structure of prices and costs and a viable exchange rate, restrain growth in
public consumption, improve public revenue performance, reduce strong infla-
tionary tendencies associated with large public sector deficits, and make a
concerted drive to expand production and exports, particularly of cocoa and
minerals, through more appropriate price incentives, support services and more



-9-
assured supplies of necessary inputs, it should be feasible to achieve rates
of real growth in excess of 4 percent per annum (or one percent per capita)
after 1985/86. With sustained improvement in economic management, the economy
is capable of even higher rates of growth. However, the attainment of even a
modest rate of growth after 2-3 years of implementation of the stabilization
and rehabilitation programs will be a major turn around. It will require that
Ghana's own efforts be supported by an augmented flow of external assistance
to overcome the present external resource constraint. External capital flows,
both official and private, have slowed down to a mere trickle in recent years
for the reasons described above. New loans and grants from all bilateral and
multilateral sources in 1982, for example, amounted to only $45 million. Net
transfers from all external sources were still lower - $38 million. The
latter amount was sufficient to finance only 6 percent of the country's
already depressed imports. For a country of the size, population and poten-
tial of Ghana, this amount is totally inadequate. As analyzed in paras.
50-59, Ghana's needs for external capital will be substantial over the next
few years and will call for a major effort on the part of the donor community
provided Ghana continues to demonstrate good economic performance and prudent
economic policies. The external capital has to come largely from official
sources. Unless such concessional assistance is forthcoming, the possiblity
of a successful stabilization program and an economic rehabilitation program
would be seriously diminished and could adversely affect the country's
stability.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
32.      An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was concluded in March 1974. Under this agreement, all payments
due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations, are to be
paid over a period of 28 years beginning 1982, after a grace period of 10
years, at 2-1/2 percent per annum. Ghana's medium and long-term external
public debt outstanding and disbursed at end-1981 is estimated at US$978
million. The debt service ratio of public and publicly guaranteed medium and
long-term debt is about 9 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services
and is expected to rise modestly after the grace period on the rescheduled
debt expires. Arrears on Ghana's short-term debt increased from US$245
million in 1977 to US$489 million by end-1978. By December 1980 these arrears
had declined to US$332 million. However, 1981 saw a relapse with arrears
increasing by $142 million. By the end of 1982, the short term arrears had
accumulated to $570 million. The economic recovery program aims to reduce
these arrears in a phased manner.
33.      Ghana is relying on official sources for the bulk of the external
capital required to support its development program, and relatively little of
its medium and long-term borrowing is on commercial terms. Consequently, Bank
loans and IDA credits disbursed together represented about 11 percent of the
estimated country's total public external debt at end-1981. Service payments
on Bank loans and IDA credits in 1980 accounted for 21 percent and 2 percent
respectively of the country's external debt service. The share of the service



- 10 -
payments on Bank loans 1/ has increased in recent years as other sources of
non-concessional lending to Ghana have been almost phased out and bilateral
loans contracted in the sixties were rescheduled. The share of service pay-
ments to the Bank is projected to decline to 17 percent by 1985. Net trans-
fers from the Bank Group to Ghana during the last decade have averaged $25 to
$30 million per annum and was 'less than $10 million in 1982. Bank Group
commitments, on a per capita basis, have amounted to $1.76 durii, 1977-82 and
Bank Group lending has dropped to less than a project a year during this
period.
34.      Ghana's extremely difficult economic conditions and its vulnerability
to fluctuations in cocoa export earnings, make it desirable that future debt
service obligations be kept as low as possible. Consequently, Ghana will have
to depend upon IDA resources for Bank Group borrowing over the next few
years.  This is also consistent with Ghana's relatively low per capita
income. At the same time, to help ensure a more adequate flow of foreign
exchange resources to the coun-try, it would be appropriate to finance a
portion of the local costs of projects.
PART II - THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
35.      The economic recovery program announced on April 21, 1983 was
designed to initiate the process of correcting structural imbalances and reha-
bilitating the economy to pave the way for restoration of economic growth in
the country. The main objectives of the program are to realigfn relative
prices in favor of production eLnd the export sectors, to reduce the Government
budget deficit and thereby the underlying inflationary pressures, and to
facilitate the flow of imports to ease the severe foreign exchange constraint
faced by the economy.
36.      A summary of actions taken and to be taken by the Government is shown
in Table 2. The main elements of the program are discussed in the following
paragraphs.
Exchange Rate Adjustment
37.      The Government has introduced a multiple exchange rate system based
on payments of bonuses on exchange receipts and imposition of surcharges on
exchange payments. On both the receipts and payments side, transactions are
divided into two categories. A bonus and surcharge rate of 990 percent,
calculated on the basis of the exchange rate of 02.75 = US$1, is applied to
one category of transactions, and a bonus and surcharge rate of 750 percent is
applied to the other category of transactions. Thus, the multiple exchange
rates resulting from the system are 029.975 = US$1 and 023.375 = US$1 as
compared with the previous exchange rate of 02.75 = US$1. The weighted
average exchange rates for payments and receipts transactions are about
1/ The last Bank loan granted to Ghana was for a power project in
1977.



- 11 -
025 = US$1. This change, representing a devaluation of approximately
810 percent in local currency terms and reflecting purchasing power parity
movements, would bring the value of the cedi close to what it was in 1972.
The bonuses and surcharges are applied at the authorized dealers of foreign
exchange, and the system is operated to ensure that the Bank of Ghana does not
incur losses in its exchange transactions over time.
38.      An important decision taken by the Government is to follow an
exchange rate policy whereby the two effective exchange rates are adjusted
periodically so that the real purchasing power of the weighted average
exchange rate in terms of the currencies of Ghana's major trading partners
would be maintained. It is the intention of the Government to unify the mul-
tiple rates at a realistic level by mid-1984. In pursuance of this objective,
the lower rate (presently 023.375 = US$1) will be depreciated faster than the
higher rate (presently 029.975 = US$1).
Agricultural Pricing Policy
39.      To stimulate the production of export and food crops, the Government
has increased the producer price of cocoa from 012,000 per ton to 020,000 per
ton, effective May 1983, and has already increased the minimum support price
for maize and rice to 05,000 per ton and 013,000 per ton respectively, and
palm oil to 025,000 from 017,000 in 1982.
40.      Subsidies on insecticides and sprayers for cocoa farmers would be
gradually phased out. Subsidies on fertilizers have been reduced from 50
percent of the farm gate price to 20 percent. The Government gave assurances
that it would, by October 31, 1983, review with the Association its program to
gradually phase out the remaining subsidies on fertilizers (Section 3.06 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement). There are no subsidies in existence
on any other agricultural inputs.
41.      The Government has announced its intention to maintain cocoa prices
at a level that will ensure adequate incentives to producers. To this end,
assurances were received from the Government that it would review annually the
prices paid to farmers for the purchase of cocoa and, in consultation with
IDA, adjust such prices to maintain adequate incentives and announce such
adjustments sufficiently in advance of the beginning of the cropping season
(Section 3.08 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). In addition, the
Government intends to implement comprehensive and far-reaching measures aimed
at reducing the current level of marketing costs of the GCMB.
Petroleum Pricing
42.      Petroleum product pricing has been inadequate over the last decade
due to a grossly overvalued cedi. Petroleum product prices are controlled by
the Government at the ex-refinery, wholesale and retail levels . As the
action on the exchange rate would imply an immediate pass-through of prices to
consumers of an unmanageable magnitude, the Government considers it necessary
to maintain a consumer subsidy on petroleum prices on a temporary basis.
However, an upward adjustment of about 100 percent has already been made in
petroleum retail prices and further adjustments will be made periodically,
phasing out the subsidy completely, not later than 1984.

Infrastructure Pricing
43.      Road haulage rates have been raised from 85 pesawas to 2 cedis per
mile in the case of bulk cargo and 2.5 cedis in the case of wet cargo. At
negotiations assurances were received that road transport tariffs would be
adjusted at least once every six months to maintain adequate financial incen-
tives to road transport operators (Section 3.07 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). Increases in domestic telecommunication tariffs of 325
percent, and external telecommunication of 127 percent have been approved by
the Government, and postal rates have been increased by 365 percent.  Railway
freight and passenger tariffs have also been increased by 380 percent and 100
percent respectively and electricity tariffs by nearly 40 percent. In addi-
tion, water supply tariffs have been increased on average by 150 percent. The
Government has indicated its intention to make further adjustments to tariffs
when the effects of the recent macroeconomic policy measures on the financing
of the utilities have been assessed more fully.
Fiscal Policy
44.      Ghana's tax base has been seriously eroded by persistent
overvaluation of its currency and a large divergence between official (the
base at which taxes are assessed) and market prices (at which the actual
transactions take place). The 1983 budget announced recently by the Govern-
ment, reflects the impact of new exchange rate adjustments and attempts to
restore the tax bases. Taxes on international trade, mainly import duties,
would increase from 0789 million in 1982 to 08.4 billion in 1983. Taxes on
domestic goods and services are also projected to double as a result of price
adjustments. The absorption in official channels of goods and services,
currently passsing through the parallel market, would also help expand the tax
base. The schedule for tariff rates on imports has also been simplified and
reduced to only three rates, zero for oil, 25 percent and 30 percent. The
overall result of these measures is that Government revenues are expected to
rise from 05.3 billion in 1982 to 014.6 billion in 1983.
45.      Despite the phenomenal growth in Government expenditure in the past
few years, public sector wages have not kept pace with the cost of living.
The real wage index had declined to 21.6 in 1981 from 100 in 1975. The 1983
budget proposes to improve this situation by awarding a 60 percent increase on
average in the salaries of civil servants. The increase in wages and salaries
of public sector enterprises would average 25 percent. The Government is also
committed to eliminate subsidies to public sector enterprises and intends to
keep a tight restraint on other Government expenditure. The daily minimum
wage has been increased from 12 to 22 cedis representing a 75 percent rise.
46.      The above revenue and expenditure measures are projected to lead to a
reduction in the budgetary deficit from 04 billion in 1982 to 03.6 billion in
1983, i.e. equivalent to 20 percent of total expenditures compared with 43
percent in 1982.



- 16 -
Monetary and Credit Policy
47.      The envisaged reduction in the budgetary deficit will also have
favorable consequences for monetary and credit policy. The lowering of the
public sector share in total credit availability will liberalize credit tc the
private see-or.  Ceilings on nel domestic assets and on net credit to the
Government would be specified as performance criteria under the proposed Fund
standby arrangements. These ceilings would make adequate allowances for
financing of imports.
Import Programming
48.      A large increase in the inflow of non-oil imports, i.e. from US$350
million in 1982 to US$750 million in 1983, is essential to sustain the econo-
mic recovery program. The e!ffectiveness of the exchange rate adjustment would
depend upon how quickly imported inputs, raw materials and supplies of con-
sumer goods increase domestic capacity utilization and provide incentive goods
to cocoa farmers and mine workers.  At the same time, import tariffs forming
more than one half of total Government revenues will be the main determinant
of Government's budgetary deficit and, in turn, the money supply objectives.
Thus, a careful assessment of import needs, evaluation of r-esource availatil-
ity, allocation of imports among competing uses, and timely phasing of the
import program is of overriding importance.  The Governmen; has reviewed its
import program for 1983 in consultation with IDA in the light of the require-
ments for the economic recovery program and has assigned priority to imports
for export production, revenue-generating industries and food. The Government
is committed to take early and appropriate steps to strengthen the institu-
tional capacity for planning, programming and monitoring of the import program
to avoid short-term disruptions and dislocations in the economy.
Balance of Payments and External Capital Requirements
49.      The requirements of external capital t;o support the Government's
reform package have been assessed for a period of three years. In the export
sector, adequate price incentives will have a strong positive effect.  How-
ever, it is unlikely that substantial increases in export earnings will emerge
immediately. Cocoa exports, which generate over half of foreign exchange
earnings are likely to respond only gradually. Infrastructure constraints,
inelastic world demand, and agronomic problems related to past neglect suggest
that a phased supply response is likely, with production and exports increas-
ing by perhaps 5-10 percent per year for the next few year's after 1983/84. A
more vigorous recovery is projected for the mining and timber sectors. An
adequate supply of inputs to gold mining should generate more than a
25 percent increase over two years, with further substantial increases likely
for the near future. The new exchange rate should make some timber exports
immediately profitable, with further gains requiring rehabilitation of the
lndustry over the next 2 years with an investment of about $60 million.
Export earnings in this sector are expected to increase from $5 million to $75
million during this time, i.e. equivalent to the actual export volume attained
in 1975.



- 17 -
50.      Although the exchange rate action will have an immediate and
favorable impact on export earnings from gold and timber and to a somewhat less
extent for cocoa and other sectors, a more complete recovery of the export
sectors will depend on substantial amounts of capital to finance their import
needs. Exports of goods are thus expected to increase from about $591 million
in 1983, to about $960 million in 1985 with continuing recovery thereafter.
51.      In evaluating import requirements, priority has been given to the
export sectors to ensure resource generation for a sustained recovery. Allo-
cations for the cocoa sector have been essentially limited by the institu-
tional capacity to effectively distribute and utilize imports and this has
played a role in allocations for the other export sectors. There is, however,
a very great need for supporting infrastructure and services (particularly
transportation) which can only partially be met through an import program of
prudent size, given likely amounts of concessional aid. Thus, for at least
the next few years, constraints in these sectors will continue to impinge on
growth. In addition, some allocation needs to be made for food imports, while
some imports for domestic industry are required for a balanced recovery and to
provide "wage goods" for the economy.
52.      The size of the import program is thus limited by export earnings,
likely commitments of aid, and the need to build up reserves and to reduce
arrears which at end 1982 totalled $580 million. However, a minimum import
program of about $1.0 billion f.o.b. ($1.1 billion CIF) is needed to begin the
reconstruction program with sufficient momentum. This would be equivalent to
about 30 percent of GDP in 1983, and would be comparable to the 1980 import
bill, which had been financed largely with export earnings.
53.      The proposed import program for 1983 allocates about 39 percent of
resources to the commodity producing sectors, 32 percent to transportation and
petroleum, 23 percent for other sectors, and about 6 percent to food imports.
The allocations for the productive sectors are directly related to production
targets. Petroleum imports would continue at the constrained levels of the
recent past until more resources are available. However, price increases are
expected to improve the allocation pattern.
54.      The proposed pattern of import requirements for 1984 and 1985 does
not vary markedly from that of 1983. Food import requirements are expected to
decline as domestic production increases in response to fertilizer and other
imports. The allocation for timber, fishing and livestock are expected to de-
cline gradually as immediate rehabilitation needs are satisfied. The amount
for cocoa and manufacturing is projected to increase slightly as bottlenecks
are removed and production is increased. The program would continue to
severely constrain petroleum, construction, and other sectors.
55.      Since 1980, export earnings have declined by almost 50 percent from
$1.1 billion to an estimated $591 million for 1983. As shown in Table 4,
Ghana would require gross capital inflows of $809 million in 1983 to finance
its import program, reduce the short term arrears, discharge its debt servic-
ing liability, and build up some modest reserves. Taking into account that
only $82 million is available as disbursements from existing loans and credits
and from other capital flows, the additional capital requirements are

estimated at $727 million. Ghana expects to receive $150 million under an oil
credit from Libya and $20 million under the STABEX. An amount of $290 million
is envisaged under the standby arrangements and Compensatory Financing Facil-
ity from the IMF. The proposed Credit would provide $40 million, and other
donors' assistance is envisaged at $40 million. The remaining capital
requirement of $187 million is expected to be met from private and/or official
sources.
56.      While a substantial current account deficit is estimated for 1983,
the supply response of the export sectors (see Table 3 above) should subse-
quently generate additional resources and reduce the current account deficit
to about $440 million in 1985. To achieve this reduction, imports in real
terms would need to be held to about the same level as in 1983. Were it not
for the extreme shortages throughout the economy, an alternative strategy of
keeping imports lower in 1983 and gradually increasing them during 1984 and
1985 would have been reasonable. However, a more modest import program for
1983 would keep imports below their 1980 levels (in nominal terms) and would
be inadequate to generate the needed supply response.
Evaluation
57.      The above elements of the economic recovery program constitute an
important first step. As stated in para. 28-29 above, a comprehensive econo-
mic rehabilitation program for the next three to four years is needed to
enable Ghana to enter a stage from which it can resume economic growth in an
orderly manner. The stabilization and rehabilitation efforts, if successfuly
carried out, should at least help restore production and income levels in
Ghana to the levels that existed a decade ago. Proper preparation must, how-
ever, be made during this period on future sectoral programs, project identi-
fication, feasibility and pre-investment studies, and training of planning
personnel so that a viable investment program can be developed for implementa-
tion immediately following the rehabilitation phase. At the same time, the
current concerns at the highest level in the Government to strengthen and
reorganize development administration and economic management should be trans-
lated into action as early as possible in order to provide increased stability
and certainty among the civil servants and professionals.
58.      The new exchange rate arrangements restore the competitiveness of
Ghana's exports as of the present provided the accompanying fiscal, monetary
and trade policies are successfully implemented by the Government and provided
the pervasive shortage of goods and commodities, inputs and raw materials can
be attacked by liberal imports and physical rehabilitation of essential infra-
structure and productive facilities. The proposed exchange rate and producer
price changes in the cocoa sector are adequate to provide incentives but they
need to be supplemented by supply of essential consumer goods, insecticides
and sprayers, to produce the desired results. In the mining sector the
exchange rate adjustment is sufficient to restore the profitability of the
companies but, in addition, managerial and institutional reforms are
required. Workers' incentives in the form of food provision and import of
spare parts and essential equipment would have to accompany these measures.
Timber and log exports are also likely to be restored to the 1975 level,
provided the management of state-owned companies is strengthened and the



- 20 -
functioning of the Timber Marketing Board are oriented towards promotion
rather than passive regulations and controls.  The effects in the manufactur-
ing sector are not likely to be visible for some time as the import-intensity
would adversely affect the existing industrial cost structure under the new
exchange rate regime. It will take some time before a restructuring takes
place in the industrial sector,
59.       The exact magnitude o0f the expected increases in tax revenues
resulting from exchange rate reform is difficult to estimate at this junc-
ture. Besides administrative problems in putting the new system into opera-
tion, the revenue yield would depend critically o]l the volume of foreign
exchange avpiTh ble, the compos'ftion of imports, price elasticity of demand for
imported goods, and the speed at which the transactions are shifted from the
parallel maricet to official channels. If foreign assistance is inadequate, cr
if the import licensing system and foreign exchange allocation1 mechanism are
not streamlined concomittantly, the import target may not be attained, thus
causing severe shortfall in Government revenues.
60.       The Government intends to pursue cautious monetary and credit
policies, consistent with the program to be supported by a one-year standby
arrangement from the Fund. Credit policy is geared toward accommodating the
expected increase in imports and the acceleration in economic activity.  With
June 1982 estimates as the base! morLth, a maximum expansion in net domestic
assets of some 05 billion is envisaged for the 12 month period up to June
1984, or about 29 percent of money stock at the beginning of the period.  In
addition, net domestic assets of the banking system will be allowed to exceed
this maximum in between the twelve month period so as to meet the seasonal
credit needs for cocoa financing and to accommodate the initial jump in demand
for credit from importers and local manufacturers arising fromi the large
changes in the exchange system and the increase in the volume of imports.
Thus, the money supply expansion for FY83 will be large, but for the twelve
month period through June 1984, broad money is projected to increase by only
9.6 percent.
61.       The country' s economic ills are complex and the adjustment process to
modify the course of the economy will require some time. Some transitory
problems are likely to surface until the relationships between prices, costs,
incomes and production are established and the impact of existing distortions
is eased out of the system. Income redistribution will take place and produ-
cers of exports and import substitutes are likely to benefit from these mea-
sures at the expense of speculators, traders and import licensees.  The
Government's income will also rise in the initial stage relative to the pri-
vate sector and therefore, the composition of the Government's development
budget assumes importance.  If the Government allocates the increased income
to relaxing the key constraints in infrastructure and the productive sectors,
the transition process would become smoother. Therefore prudent management of
Government resources would be an essential element of the economic recovery
program. The other important factor is the availability of external finances
to soften the adverse impact of the drastic reform measures and to provide
finance for accelerating the inflow of imports so essential for the successfu:l
implementation of the recovery program. Curtailment of monetary growth and
improvement in local food supplies, the increased volume of imports, careful

husbanding of budgetary resources and physical rehabilitation of infrastruc-
ture, should generate the necessary impulses for bringing about the necessary
turn-around in the economy. The risks of failure of the program lie in a lack
of political commitment and willingness to run the full course, in attempts to
abort or modify the program ir. the wake of emerging transitory problems, in
the continuation of an uncertain political and economic envirorn:nt and, most
importantly, in less than the required availability of external resources to
support the program.
62.      Of the various problems that would remain unresolved despite the
implementation of the economic recovery program, two merit special mention.
First, the current shortages and excessive price levels of goods and commod-
ities in the country can be attributed to three closely interrelated factors:
(a) overvaluation of the currency; (b) low levels of domestic production and
import availability; and (c) price controls.  The new exchange rate regime and
increased volume of imports may minimize the interaction of the first two
factors. However, continuation of general price controls and state monopoly
in trading and distribution of goods may block movement towards premia-free
price levels and price expectations. The situation could be exacerbated if
the import supplies needed to drive down prices from their current level were
not forthcoming. Increases in domestic production capacity would also take
some time before it can augment the supply of local goods and thus affect
price levels.
63.      The second area of major concern has to do with the limited capacity
of institutions involved in economic activities in Ghana. The supply of mana-
gerial and technical skills reqjuired to operate the vast system of parastatals
and state monopolies is already well below the current requirements of the
economy, both in quantity as well as quality.  The Government is aware that
the presently enlarged and demoralized public service is an impediment to
economic recovery and has embarked on redeploying redundant workers to
productive employment while trying to improve the compensation system in order
to attract and retain a qualif:ied work force. The Government has also set up
high-level committees to restructure and streamline the public institutions
and has begun to analyze the problems of parastatals with a view to
formulating clear policy objectives, strengthening central monitoring and
enhancing their management and financial accountability.  However, given the
extemely difficult economic conditions and the need to cope with immediate
issues of economic stablization, it will tale some time before any significant
results can be achieved and progress on institutional reforms can be made only
gradually. In the meanwhile, the Government has to ensure that the existirng
institutions are not overstretched or overburdened, and the establishment of
new institutions, on an ad hoc basis, should be carefully avoided.
PART III - RECONSTEUCTION IMPORT CREDIT
Bank Response
64.      At the conclusion of its discussions with the IMF in February 1983, a
Ghana delegation led by the Secretary of Finance initialled a memorandum of
understanding with the IMF staff which outlined the main features of an eco-



- 23 -
nomic recovery program that were incorporated into the budget announced on
April 21, 1983. During the delegation's February visit, the Bank was asked to
reactivate its lending program in Ghana and to formulate a program of assi-
stance to underpin the stablization measures and begin the process of
rehabilitating Ghana's productive assets.
65.      In response, the Bank agreed to proceed with a credit for a Water
Supply Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance project which was approved by
the Executive Directors in March and a credit for an Energy Project, which was
approved by the Executive Directors in May, both of which were well advanced
but had been held in abeyance pending evidence of progress on economic reform
measures. While these projects have important institution-building, rehabili-
tation and development objectives, it is clear that project and sector lending
by themselves would not achieve the rapid transfer of resources which is re-
quired to sustain the economy during the stabilization and rehabilitation
phases of the economic recovery program. Accordingly, the Bank agreed to
explore the possibility of including a quick-disbursing Reconstruction Import
Credit (RIC) in the lending program to help finance the import of essential
requirements of the agriculture sector and transport industry, the two areas
of activity where a quick infusion of resources is necessary to engender a
positive supply response. On the assumption that the economic recovery pro-
gram progresses satisfactorily and to provide further support for the pro-
gram's major reform measures, the preparation of an Export Rehabilitation
Project (ERP) which had begun in 1981 will be continued. The Government's
program assigns the highest priority to reversing declining production in key
export industries (cocoa, mining, timber), and the proposed ERP, which has
been included in the FY84 lending program, would provide financing for spare
parts and materials for these industries, address critical policy and institu-
tional issues which have adversely affected output, and provide assistance to
rehabilitate essential supporting infrastructure. Parallel with these lending
activities, the Government has sought our support for its efforts to streng-
then economic management in the areas of development planning, project prepar-
ation and appraisal, project monitoring and evaluation and upgrading stati-
stical services. The Government has also requested that a diagnostic study of
the parastatal sector be undertaken with a view to helping the Government
prepare a strategy to rationalize the sector as a whole; this would include
the development of criteria against which the performance of enterprises would
be measured, steps to improve the efficiency of parastatals through greater
accountability and improved monitoring, and the disposal of enterprises whose
activities more properly belong in the private sector and, where necessary,
closures. A technical assistance project for these purposes is now under
discussion with the Government. Other productive assets in need of
rehabilitation are discussed in Part IV of this Report.
Background to Reconstruction Import Credit
66.      A Bank mission visited Ghana during March 7-29, 1983, to appraise the
proposed Reconstruction Import Credit. Prior to the mission's arrival, the
Government of Ghana had carried out a substantial amount of preparatory
work. Two task forces had been established to assess the immediate priority
import needs of the agriculture and transport sectors, identify the benefi-
ciaries and the target groups, review the existing institutional capacity for



- 24 -
procuring, distributing and delivering imported goods and to recommend
supporting policy measures that could facilitate efficient and prompt utili-
zation of the proceeds under the proposed Credit and other assistance from
external donors. The work of the task forces was reviewed by the appraisal
mission and the Government of Ghana and agreement was reached on the priority,
of imports, sectoral and commodity allocations, and the mechanisms for imple-
mentation, pr--urement and distribution. Eligibility criteria for the benefi-
ciaries were also laid down. Negotiations were held in Accra on May 18-20,
1983 with a Government negotiating team led by Dr. E. Asumang, Director of
Research of the Bank of Ghana. There is no separate staff appraisal report
for the proposed Credit. A Credit Summary is at the fron-t of this report and
supplemental data are contained, in Annex III.
67.      It is clear from the previous sections of this report that the
Government's request for quick disbursing non-project assistance is well
justified. Ghana's economic efficiency has steadily decreased over the past
several years. The proposed Credit; would help reestablish the flow of imports
for the productive sectors thus contributing to the Government's short-term
economic recovery program by helping strengthen its capacity to carry out the
policy reforms which are critical to its reconstruction efforts.
Relations with IMF
68.      At the request of the Government, an IMF mission visited Ghana during
May 1 - May 25, 1983 to negotiate, ad referendum, a stabilization program
which would form the basis for a one-year standby agreement. The mission
returned with a letter of intent, initialled by the Secretary of Finance and
the Governor of the Central Bank which will be submitted shortly to the
Executive Directors of the IMF with the proposed standby agreement. The
Government has also requested a dralwing from the compensatory financing
facility which is being examined by the IMF staff. Bank and Fund staff have
collaborated closely during all phases of the development of the economic
recovery program and in the formaulation of the proposed Credit.
Objectives and Description
69.      The primary purpose of the RIC is to provide immediate assistance for'
urgent transport and agricultural needs to support the Government's economic
recovery program. Specifically the proposed Credii would:
(a) finance essential agricultural inputs for the Government's economic
recovery program, by financing the import of certain hey inputs such
as fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, and sprayers, agricultural
tools, spare parts and tires for agriculture machifnery; and
(b)  help remove critical transport bottlenecks which have adversely
affected production and marketing of fooderops, cocoa and timber
products and the movement of people in Accra and to and from rural
areas by financing the import of tires, batteries and spare parts for
trucks and buses.



- 25 -
70.      The needs in agriculture and transport are larger and more urgent
than would normally be the case because of the totally inadequate allocation
of foreign exchange for these purposes in the late 1970s. Given the current
situation, it is in the areas indicated above that the funds provided under
the proposed Credit can be used to the greatest advantage for the development
of the agricultural sector and the removal of the transport bottlenecks.
71.      The amount of the immediate import requirements of the transport and
agricultural sectors has been estimated at US$250 million (US$200 million for
the transport sector and US$50 million for the agricultural sector.) Around
70 percent of the vehicle fleet is estimated to be off the road, including
more than 40 percent which require only tires. The proposed Credit would
cover about 16 percent of the immediate needs of these two sectors.
Allocation of the Reconstruction Import Credit
72.      The proposed IDA Credit of US$40 million would be divided about
equally among the transport and agricultural sectors. Specifically the Credit
would be allocated: (a) in the agricultural sector, to imports of insecticides
and sprayers for the cocoa industry (US$8 million), fertilizers (US$5.2 mil-
lion), other agrochemicals namely, weedicides and pesticides (US$2.5 million),
tools and equipment (US$2.5 million), and spares for agricultural machinery
(US$1 million); (b) in the transport sector, to imports of tires (US$13.3 mil-
lion), spare parts (US$4.2 million), batteries (US$0.8 million), retreading
materials (US$0.4 million); (c) consultant services and office equipment and
supplies (US$0.7 million); and (d) unallocated (US$1.4 million).
73.      Table 5 summarizes the sectoral allocation, the agencies responsible
for distribution and the ultimate beneficiaries.   In the transport sector
funds would be allocated to the private trading houses and to public corpor-
ations involved in agriculture and passenger transport. The private trading
houses would receive 79 percent of the total allocation to service a large
number of private trucking companies and operators, while the share of the
public sector corporation would be 21 percent. Imports of tires would be
allocated in proportion to the estimated tire requirements of each
organization as shown in Annex IV.
74.      In the agricultural sector, fertilizers, agrochemicals, tools and
equipment would be mainly distributed in the maize and rice growing areas of
the country, in accordance with the priority given to these two staple
crops.  Fertilizer would be distributed, as in the past, by the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) through its regional and district agricultural offices.
Since this is a rather limited base from which to serve the mass of small-
holders, the Government has agreed to enlarge the number of sale points by
appointing commercial organizations and cooperatives as agents for MOA. Agro-
chemicals would be distributed through the existing retail outlets of such
chemical companies as Bayer, ICI, Shell, etc. Tools and equipment and spares
for agricultural machinery would also be made available through existing
channels of distribution which include both private and public sector shops.
Insecticides and sprayers for the cocoa industry would be distributed by the
Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board (GCMB).



- 26 -
75,      The proposed Credit would finance the procurement of 780,000 gallons
of the insecticide GAMMALIN and 20,000 sprayers for the cocoa sub-sector. The
above insecticide, together with the insecticide UNDEN purchased under STABEX
would allow GCMB to carry out a spraying program (in the ratio of 50:50 UNDEN
and GAMMALIN) over one million acres of cocoa farms (i.e., 25 percent of total
cocoa farms in the country) during the current cropping season. If spraying
is successfully carried out, t:e incremental cocoa production in 1984 could
bring an additional $34 million in foreign exchange. Further details on the
agricultural sector are containaed in Annex V to this report.
Counterpart Funds
76.      Local currency counterpart funds generated by the sale of foreign
exchange provided by the Credit would be deposited into a counterpart funds
account in the Bank of Ghana. The Government has given assurances that such
counterpart funds would be utilized to finance part of the recurrent or
capital cost of priority projects included in the economic recovery program
(Section 3.05(c) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).

Financing
77.      The Government has recently embarked on a major effort to secure
additional financing to support the Reconstruction Import Credit as well as
the more general needs of the country for imports under the economic recovery
program (Table 4, page 21). This effort has involved both multilateral as
well as bilateral agencies. The African Development Bank has indicated its
intention to support the Government's recovery program and the RIC with
financing totalling some $20.0 million. In addition, CIDA (Canada) is
considering a request from the Government to provide financing of up to $5.0
million either in association with the proposed Credit or directly to the
Government for other high priority imports.
Credit Administration and Management
78.      The proceeds of the proposed Credit would be made available to the
Bank of Ghana (BOG) under a subsidiary agreement between the Borrower and BOG
(Section 3.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement), and BOG would
have overall responsibility for the implementation and administration of the
proposed Credit. Execution of the subsidiary agreement would be a condition
of Credit effectiveness. A Technical Committee, headed by the Director of
Research (BOG) and consisting further of representatives from the Ministries
of Finance, Transport, Agriculture, Trade and a Project Coordinator, has
already been established by the Government to coordinate, monitor and super-
vise all Credit activities (Section 3.03 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). It would be supported by a Project Unit in the BOG, headed by the
Project Coordinator with adequate full-time staff assigned specifically for
this purpose by the BOG, along with appropriate facilities and support ser-
vices (Section 2.03 of the draft Project Agreement). The Technical Committee
would in particular review all import applications submitted by importing
agencies to ensure that they are eligible for financing under the proposed
Credit, that they are in line with the Credit allocation to sectors and com-
modities (as described in para. 72), with the type and volume of services
provided by the applicant and that specification of goods are correct and
reflect respective scarcities.
79.      Upon recommendation of the Technical Committee, the BOG would enter
into an import agreement with the importing agency concerned and the Ministry
of Trade would automatically and expeditiously issue an import licence. The
Technical Committee would also be responsible for monitoring progress of the
proposed Credit. During negotiations, assurances were received that an Inter-
ministerial Committee, headed by the PNDC Coordinating Secretary and consist-
ing further of the Secretary for Finance and the Governor of the BOG, would be
established to provide interministerial coordination and policy guidance on
all Credit related matters (Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). The Interministerial Committee may coopt the Secretaries for
Transport and Agriculture as required. The procedures for implementation and
administration of the Credit are described in more detail in Annex VI and
incorporated in Schedule 1 to the draft Project Agreement.



- 28 -
Procurement
80.      To help ensure that the procurement of goods to be financed out of
the proceeds of the proposed Credit is handled in. the most expeditious manner
and that goods reach Ghana with the minimum of deLay, the Government will
retain external procurement agents., satisfactory to the Association (Section
3.04 of the c% -ft Development Credit Agreement). The procurement agents,
whose costs, estimated at $500,000, would be financed out of the proposed
Credit, would also provide the services of the Project Coordi:aator who, in
addition to acting as head of the Project Unit, would also maintain close
liaison between the BOG and the procurement agents.  Employmeat of the
procurement agents is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
81.      The procurement agents would be authorized by the BOG to handle all
public sector procurement (e.g., insecticides, sprayers, fertLlizers) and
procurement of all tires, except in specific cases agreed betwfeen the BOG and
the Association.  Private sectc,r procurement would be handled by trading
houses and private companies.  Procurement under the proposed Credit will be
in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and
IDA Credits." With respect to public sector procurement and purchase of tires
the Technical Committee and the procurement agents will ensure that, as far as
possible, orders are bulked across the sectors and importing agencies. All
individual supply contracts of US$1 million and above will be subject to
international competitive bidding (as modified for structural adjustment and
program loans). Purchases of less than US$1 million by the public sector will
normally require not less than five quotations from reputable suppliers.
Proprietary items may be purchased directly.  Procurement of Less than US$1
million by the private sector will normally be done through normal commercial
channels. The Technical Committee may also allow direct purchasing for con-
tracts below US$100,000 when a demonstrated urgency so requires. Contracts of
less than US$20,000 will not be entertained under the Credit except for office
equipment and supplies. All awards of contracts of US$500,000 and above by
the procurement agents will be subject to prior approval by the BOG. All
imports financed under the Credit will go through pre-shipment inspection by
an inspecting agency contracted by the BOG (Schedules 1 and 2 of the draft
Project Agreement).
Disbursement and Retroactive Financing
82.      Disbursements will be made against the CIF costs of eligible imports,
subject to documentary evidence that expenditures had been incurred on or
after signing of the proposed Credit, and against the foreign exchange costs
of services provided by the procurement agents. To facilitate disbursements,
a special account will be established by the BOG with a foreign correspondent
bank satisfactory to the Association (Section 2.02(b) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). Establishment of this account would be a condition of
Credit effectiveness. An amount of US$5 million would be withdrawn by the
Government from the credit account and deposited into the special account upona
effectiveness of the Credit Agreement. On receipt of satisfactory evidence
that expenditures financed out of the special account were eligible for
financing and that goods were purchased in accordance with the agreed procure-
ment procedures, the special account would be replenished by IDA through
further disbursements.



- 29 -
83.       In order that procurement arrangements under the proposed Credit are
put in hand without delay, the Government has established the Project Unit and
has appointed a Project Coordinator. It is recommended that the costs of the
services of the Project Coordinator and essential office equipment and
supplies not exceeding $50,000 in total, incurred after May 1, 1983 but before
the date of the Development Credit Agreement, be eligible for financing out of
the proposed Credit.
Accounts, Audit and Evaluation
84.       The Bank of Ghana will maintain records and separate accounts,
including the counterpart funds account (para. 76) in respect of the project
(Section 3.01 of the draft Project Agreement) and have these accounts and
financial statements audited each fiscal year by auditors acceptable to the
Association. The audited accounts and records and the auditors' report will
be furnished to the Association not later than four months after the end of
each fiscal year (Section 3.02 of the draft Project Agreement). The Bank of
Ghana will also maintain records adequate to record and monitor the progress
of the project (Section 2.06(a) of the draft Project Agreement) and, with the
assistance of the Borrower, prepare and furnish to the Association a comple-
tion report on the costs and benefits resulting from the project (Section
2.06(c) of the draft Project Agreement and Section 3.09 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
85.      The main benefits from the proposed Credit are that Ghana would be
able to import essential spare parts and inputs required by the most critical
sectors of the economy and thus enable the Government to cope with immediate
and urgent problems in starting the long overdue process of economic reco-
very. Assistance to the transport sector would keep about 3250 trucks on the
road for 8-12 months and about 500 buses on the road for 4-6 months relieving
the present constraint to evacuation of foodstuff from the hinterland, to
distribution of fertilizers to the interior and to the movement of export
commodities to the ports and people. In the agricultural sector, the supply
of fertilizers mainly to maize and rice farmers would result in a 25 percent
increase in output. Spraying of cocoa, if carried out in time, can reduce the
incidence of capsid infestation, increase national cocoa production, and bring
an additional $34 million in foreign exchange earnings in 1984. The provision
of cutlasses, hoes and other agricultural tools under the Credit will help
some of the returnees from Nigeria to establish themselves in the farming
sector.
86.      While the proposed Credit would finance only 4 percent of the total
import program for 1983/84 and 8 percent of the proportion of imports
requiring external financing, it would act as a signal to the international
donor community to provide assistance to Ghana in support of its economic
recovery program. As has been stated before, international support on a much
larger scale than in the past is necessary for the success of the economic
recovery and rehabilitation programs. In conjunction with the IMF, this
assistance will also strengthen the capacity of the Government to carry out
further policy changes. By supporting reforms in the fertilizer pricing and



- 30 -
freight tariff, the RIC would also contribute to overdue changes in areas that
are important for sustaining the economic recovery efforts.  Finally, the
proposed Credit is expected to generate a substantial amount of counterpart
funds which could be used by th1e Government to complete priority development
projects included in the recovery program.
87.      The principal risks would be that the Government is unaule to
implement effectively the economic recovery program or that it may modify andc
alter it in midstream or take other policy actions that are counterproductive
to the attainment of its main objectives. Another risk is that a serious
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange could further reduce import;
levels and delay recovery. Another set of potent:Lal risks would arise if the
goods and commodities imported under this Credit did not reach the intended
beneficiaries and users and were diLverted for other purposes.  There is also
some risk if, because of the Governiment's inability to close *the financing gap
in the balance of payments, there :Ls a continuing scarcit;y of supplementary
imports (e.g. fuel, lubricants; whlch are required to ensure efficient utili-
zation of imports provided undetr the credit.  However, on the basis of the
difficult and far-reaching measures the Government; has alreadr put in place,
its efforts to maximize aid flows 1o sustain an adequate leveL of imports, and
the assurances obtained regarding the procurement and distribution of goods to
be financed out of the proposec. Credit, these risks would be substantially
reduced. The benefits to be derived from IDA's association w-Lth the
Government's recovery program far outweigh the potential risks.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
88.      Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in
Ghana, the Bank has made 10 loans totalling US$190.5 million and 18 credits
totalling US$219.0 million. Ghana is also a beneficiary of a Bank-financed
regional clinker project covering three countries (Togo, Ivory Coast and
Ghana). There are no IFC investments. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1983 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
89.      Power generation and distribution represents the largest share of
past commitments (30 percent) and the sector has been assisted by three power
generation projects and three power distribution projects. Bank Group in-
volvement in the sector started in 1962 with the Volta River project which
included the construction of the Akosombo dam, the country's first hydro power
plant (912 MW) and the transmission grid. The project also helped to create
the Volta River Authority (VRA), the power generating company. Subsequent
Bank involvement in power generation included the 'Volta River expansion pro-
ject in 1968 and Kpong Hydroelectric project in 1977. In power distribution
three Bank Group operations (in 1968, 1971 and 1977) helped to establish and
expand a low voltage distribution network and create the Electricity Corpora-
tion of Ghana (ECG), the power distribution company. Cofinancing was a major
operation in our lending to the poweDr sector and involved a nwnber of donor
agencies including Arab Funds, EIB, EDF, CIDA, DLF,, US Exim Bank, and ECGD.
Alongside power generation and distribution, agriculture has been a major



- 31 -
focus of Bank Group lending, receiving 25.2 percent of the Bank Group's lend--
ing to Ghana. The lending program in agriculture has covered fisheries
(1969), Eastern Region cocoa (1970), sugar rehabilitation (1973), livestock
development (1974), Ashanti Region cocoa (1975), oil palm (1975), Upper Region
agricultural development (1976) and Volta Region agricultural development
(1980). The main thrust of the Bank Group's lending operations in agriculture
has been to assist the country in achieving greater self-sufficiency in agri-
cultural production, particularly food and raw materials for agro industries,
and rehabiliating the cocoa subsector. Earlier Bank Group projects in the
sector were directed towards development of specific subsectors with emphasis
on smallholder development, while starting in late 1970's, more emphasis has
been given to a broad-based integrated agricultural development. Two such
projects are currently under implementation, one in the Upper Region and the
other in the Volta Region which aim at increasing agricultural production and
farm incomes and the standard of living of a large number of smallholders by
introducing improved farming technology, providing farm support services and
developing rural infrastructure. Major donor agencies which provided cofi-
nancing in our agriculture sector operations were ODA, IFAD and BADEA. The
Bank Group is also executing a UNDP-financed technical assistance project
designed to strengthen the management and operation of the Ghana Cocoa Market-
ing Board (GCMB).
90.      Transportation is the third most important sector in Bank Group's
program in Ghana (23 percent of commitments). Projects financed in the sector
include three road projects (in 1973, 1975 and 1980) and a railway rehabili-
tation project approved in 1981. The road projects focussed initially on
rehabilitation and reconstruction of part of the country's main trunk road
system but, in light of rapid deterioration in the entire road sector prin-
cipally due to acute shortages of imported inputs, later emphasis was placed
on emergency maintenance to keep roads open for agricultural and export
traffic. An ongoing railway project which is cofinanced with ADB seeks to
remove the present transport bottleneck to Ghana's traditional exports (cocoa,
timber and minerals), for the movement of which railways has a comparative
advantage. A telecommunications project currently under implementation aims
at improving and expanding domestic telephone services in Accra and major
urban centers. In the field of water supply two projects (in 1969 and 1974)
have helped increase and improve the water supply in the Accra/Tema
metropolitan area and adjacent rural areas. The first project helped expand
the water supply distribution network and sewarage system in the Accra/Tema
area and the second project which was cofinanced with ADB and CIDA included
construction of a reservoire at Weija, a treatment plant and a transmission
pipeline. A third water supply project was approved by the Executive Directors
in March 1983 to help carry out emergency repairs and maintenance on the pipe-
line from Kpong which presently provides two thirds of the Accra water
supply. The project also includes substantial technical assistance to
strengthen the management and operations of the Ghana Water and Sewerage
Corporation and to increase its capacity for improving water supply,
especially in the rural areas. In the manufacturing sector, two DFC
operations (in 1975 and 1979) have financed investment projects in
manufacturing and agro-industry undertaken by small and medium enterprises.
The main emphasis of Bank Group lending in this sector has been to encourage
enterprises using raw materials and which are capable of contributing to



- 32 -
foreign exchange earning and savings.  A related objective for the DFC
projects was to strenghten the institutional capacity of the National
Investment Bank (NIB), Ghana's main development finance institution. The
second DFC project which includes cofinancing under a EEC Special Action
Credit is providing foreign exchange working capital to help increase capacity
utilization of priority enterprises, in addition to long-term capital invest-
ment.  An ene  y project aimed at strengthening Ghana's technical capacity to
accelerate petroleum exploration was approved by the Executive Directors in
May, 1983.
91.      The seriouis economic difficulties which the country has experienced
in recent years have adversely affected implementation of a number of Bank
Group-financed projects. The dwindling revenue base of the Government has
constrained its ability to finance the local costs of projects, and the lack
of foreign exchange has resuilted In a severe shortage of imported materials
and spare parts required for the operation and maintenance of projects; the
mass exodus of qualified Ghanaians to neighbouring countries, and demorali-
zation, absenteeism and low productivity among the remaining work force have
also adversely affected project performance. The unusually adverse conditions
surrounding Bank Group f-inanced projects and their generally poor performance
have been described in greater detail in the Project Performance Audit
Reports. Overall, the main conclusion of the Reports was that macroeconomic
and sectoral policy cornstraints were the major factors responsible for poor
performance of the audited projects. Because of delays experienced in the
implementation of a number of Bank Group projects in Ghana, the disbursement
performance is falling behind appraisal estimates. Annual gross disbursements
have averaged about 25 percent of outstanding loan/credit commitments and as
of March 31, 1983 US$122.4 million remained undisbursed. The Bank Group has
held periodic implementation reviews with the Government to identify steps
which could be taken by Borrowers and the Bank Group to accelerate disburse-
ment on ongoing loans and credits.
92.      The lack of foreign exchange has had a particularly damaging effect
on the condition of the road network and the operation of the Ghana Railway
Corporation. An adequate transportation system will be a critical component
of the Government's economic recovery program both for the movement of exports
and the distribution of goods and production inputs. Implementation of the
Third Highway (Emergency Road Maintenance) Project (1980) should now begin to
improve and the Railway Rehabilitation Project (1981), which did not become
effective until late 1982, will start the process of bringing idle capacity
back into operation through the provision of spare parts and materials.
93.      During the next year or so, while Ghana's economic recovery program
unfolds, it would be prudent to retain some flexibility in our program of
assistance in order to respond to changes in the behaviour of the economy and
the emergence of new priorities0
94.      The principal objectives which will guide the formulation of our
assistance program to Ghana are- (a) to support the adoption of policies
designed to reverse the downward trend in the economy and return it to a path
of growth; (b) to help rehabilitate and improve capacity utilization of the
country's existing assets; (c) to stimulate agricultural and industrial pro-



- 33 -
duction, particularly for export promotion and efficient import substitution;
and (d) to improve the country's essential infrastructure (transport, water,
power) so as to relieve major bottlenecks to increased production. We also
plan a substantial increase in our economic and sector work to broaden and
deepen our understanding of the constraints which are likely to impede the
recovery process, to provide direction to our future lending program and the
design of project components. In both our lending and economic and sector
work attention will be given to ways of strengthening the institutions respon-
sible for economic management and development spending.
95.      The Government of Ghana has requested the Bank Group to reactivate
its lending program in support of its economic recovery program (Part II of
this Report) and to help muster external assistance through co-financing and
more generally in the context of strengthened aid coordination. The extent to
which the Bank Group can provide financial, technical and other assistance,
act as a catalyst in attracting co-financing and in bringing together donors
and other aid institutions in a concerted effort to increase the flow of
external resources will be conditioned by the performance of the Government in
carrying through its economic recovery program.
96.      In addition to the proposed Credit and the export rehabilitation and
technical assistance projects discussed in para.65 above, a more broadly based
program of rehabilitation of the country's economic assets will be required.
In the near term IDA would support a program to rebuild the network of trunk
roads including a major bridge reconstruction component, and provide assist-
ance to rehabilitate the power distribution system and the oil refinery. In
agriculture, further assistance to the development of oil palm production is
envisaged as well as for cocoa given the overwhelming importance of this crop,
at least in the short term, for foreign exchange earnings. In brief, projects
with major rehabilitation components are likely to absorb the bulk of Bank
Group resources for the next few years as these are likely to show the highest
benefits and quickest returns. For the outer years, the Bank will begin to
examine prospects for new productive investments including support for educa-
tion, health and other important activities in the social sectors.
97.      Finally, in response to the Government's request, the Bank has agreed
to reactivate our resident mission in Accra by appointing a Resident Represen-
tative to fill the position which has been vacant for almost three years. The
Resident Representative took up his assignment on April 15, 1983.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
98.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Ghana
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank of Ghana and
the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 34 -
99.      In addition to the special conditions of the Development Credit
Agreement, which are set forth in Section III of Annex III of this Report, the
conditions of Credit effectiveness would be: (a) execution of a subsidiary
agreement between the Republic of Ghana and the Bank of Ghana; (b) establish-
ment of the special account, and (c) employment of the procurement agents.
100.     I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply  w-h the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
101.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed deve-
lopment credit.

Credit No. 531      Oil Palm Project; US$13.6 million Credit of Marth 5, 1975;
Effective Date: June 24, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1983
Planting programs have been satisfactorily completed with a total of
about 5,200 ha as per original target. Problems had been encountered in
finalizing acquisition of 1,000 ha of land needed to complete the project.
These were, however, solved even though compensation of farmers is lagging
behind. Problems of mill contract and related foreign exchange shortfall were
also resolved and the 15-ton ffb/hr oil mill commissioned in November 1982.
The construction program of workers' housing, however, continues to be slow
due to lack of building materials. A brick and tile plant is now being in-
stalled which would help overcome the shortage of building materials. The
credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1983. An advance on the
Project Preparation Facility has been approved for continuing the IRHO man-
agement contract and other essential activities through February 1984, by
which time a follow-up project is expected to be presented to the Board.
Loan No. 1181       Ashanti Region Cocoa Project: US$14 million Loan of
December 23, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Project consists of replanting and maintaining hybrid cocoa in the
Ashanti Region. Cumulative planting to date is about 38,000 acres (excluding
abandoned farms), out of the combined Bank and BADEA appraisal target of
42,500 acres. The major difficulty met by the project's efficient management
has been insufficient farmer response due to an unattractive producer price
for cocoa. The project's planting program was also severely affected by the
1977 drought which caused heavy losses in newly replanted areas, and made a
second replanting in 1978 necessary. The project also faced problems of fuel
shortages, labor migration and procurement of nursery raw materials. In
October 1981, when the project had achieved about 91 percent of the appraisal
target, it was decided, with the agreement of the Government and the Bank, to
terminate planting activities and aim at consolidating the planted areas
through an appropriate maintenance program. The loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by end June 1983.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1291-T    Upper Region Agricultural Development Project:
US$21 million Loan of June 28, 1976; Effective Date:
April 11, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project has two principal aims: raising agricultural production
and hence farm income, and establishing permanent farm support; sS-qtems. The
recent situation in Ghana, characte!rized by severe breakdowns irn communica-
tions and services, severe shortages of most basic commodities, and budget
cuts, has severely affected the project.  The problems have been compounded by
poor management performance which has led to inadequate maintenance of much of
the equipment, loose store controls and poor staff' morale.  The project is now
under new management and, following some revision and scaling down of objec-
tives, progress has been made in several important; areas. However, in the
last year, the Government's inability to procure adequate quantities of ferti.-
lizer, due to a severe shortage of foreign exchange, has severely affected
project objectives. However, this year the Government imported about 48,000
tons of fertilizers for the whole country, of which 10,500 tons have been
allocated to the project. This will meet 60 percent of project objectives, a
considerable improvement over 1982.
Credit No. 1009    Volta Region Agricultural Development Project: US$29-5
million Credit of April 22, 1980; Effective Date:
March 31, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project, which is in its third year of implement;ation, seeks to
raise agricultural production and farm incomes in the Volta Region of Ghana
through the provision of basic agricultural services. The project is being
implemented by the Regional Office of the Ministry of Agriculture. A Farmers"
Services Company has been established and key project positions have been
filled. The project has been affected by the Goverment's inability to obtain
fertilizer needs. The project distributed only 540 tons of fertilizers in the
1982 cropping season, which was inadequate to meet the estimated pre-project
recurrent fertilizer needs of 7,000 tons. However, for the 1983 cropping
season the Government has made available 6,100 tons, a considerable
improvement over 1982.
Loan No. 1180       National Investment Bank Project:  US$10 million Loan
of December 23, 1975; Effective Date: March 2, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project provides for a US$10 million loan to the National
Investment Bank (NIB) to help finance industrial, agro-industrial and tourism
development projects. The loan has progressed satisfactorily with about
US$0.1 million remaining uncomm:itted (to take care of price increases under
approved sub-loans) and approximately US$9.2 million disbursed. The insti-
tutional and procedural improvements introduced under the project have had
positive effects on NIB's operational performance. However, the deteriorated
economic situation has led to generally low production levels and the failure
of some projects. The quality of NIB's portfolio has suffered, and loan
arrears have now reached a level that jeopardizes the institution's viability.

Loan No. 1122       Telecommunications Project:  US$23 million Loan of June 10,
1975;  Effective Date:  January 23, 1976;  Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
Project completion is expected around June 1984, about five years
behind schedule. An action plan has been prepared by a recent supervision
mission with the agreement of GPT and the Government to ensure timely comple-
tion of the project. Progress on the physical execution of subcomponents is
generally in accordance with targets set in the action plan. Of the 16
buildings, 7 have been completed and the others are expected to be ready
between March and June 1983. Installation work on the microwave systems has
commenced and installation work on the exchanges is programmed to commence in
May/June 1983. To improve GPT's financial situation tariff increases of 325
percent on domestic and 127% on external services have been approved in June
1983.
Loan No. 1182       Second Highway Project:  US$18 million Loan and US$10
Credit No. 594      million Credit, both of December 23, 1975;  Effective
Date: March 30, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The project includes assistance to (i) Ghana Highway Authority (GHA)
to strengthen maintenance management and planning, execute a four-year mainte-
nance program including comprehensive training, reconstruct 16 miles of road,
and study feeder road needs; and (ii) the Bank for Housing and Construction,
with related technical assistance, to enable them to onlend to domestic con-
tractors. The output of GHA's force account maintenance has been disappoint-
ing, because of a shortage of spare parts, supplies and fuel, as well as
delays in releasing Government's capital budget. BHC has transferred equip-
ment under hire-purchase arrangements to 28 contractors and approved sub-loans
to two quarry companies totalling US$6.8 million. The regravelling undertaken
by contractors is more satisfactory than GHA's work, but a substantial number
of contractors are in arrears in their repayments to BHC. The Third Highway
(Emergency Maintenance) Project provides further assistance. The road con-
struction component is expected to be completed by mid-1983; the credit was
closed on March 31, 1983, but disbursements of remaining credit proceeds are
expected to be completed in the next 2-3 months.
Credit No. 901      National Investment Bank Project:  US$19 milliom IDA
EEC/SAC No. 7       Credit and US$6 million EEC Special Action Credit of
October 26, 1979; Effective Date: May 14, 1980;
Closing Date: December 30, 1983
Under the project the Government of Ghana onlends to NIB US$24.2
million, of which US$12.2 million are being utilized to finance capital
investments, and US$12 million (including US$6 million EEC Special Action
Credit) to finance imported raw materials and spare parts. Beneficiaries are
manufacturing enterprises, agro-industries and related services. US$0.5
million will be utilized by the Government to finance consulting services for
its export program, and US$0.3 million are being utilized to finance technical
assistance for NIB. Sixty working capital sub-loans totalling US$10.9 million
and 30 capital goods sub-loans amounting to US$6.9 million have been approved.

Page 5
Disbursements amount to US$5.1 million. Project implementation was initially
delayed, mainly due to difficulties experienced by NIB in selecting viable
projects in a completely distorted economic situation, staff constraints,
unavailability of foreign exchange matching funds to be provided by the
Government, adverse Government interest rate policies, and other administra-
tive bottleneck-X. The Bank recently agreed to waive the matching funds
requirement an& the project is now progressing more satisfactorily.
Credit No. 1029    Third Highway (Emergency Maintenance) Project:  US$25
million Credit of August 27, 1980; Effective Date:
November 4, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project includes reactivation of Ghana Highway Authority's (GHA)
road maintenance works through the provision of spare parts, equipment, and
related technical assistance to domestic contractors by a line! of credit
through the Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC). The project also in-
cludes assistance to the domestic trucking fleet by the provision of spare
parts through BHC. Spare parts for GHA and domestic contractors have been
procured and some equipment has been repaired preparatory to resuming mainte-
nance works; additional technical assistance has been recruited to speed up
repairs. The project is proceeding very slowly due primarily to delays in
releasing the Government's maintenance budget, and low productivity and morale
in Ghana caused by low wages and severe macroeconomic difficulties. However,
the output of maintenance works by contractors is improving gradually.
Credit No. 1170    Railway Rehabilitation Project: US$29 million of July 20,
1981; Effective Date: December 22, 1982; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.
Project implementation has just begun and a good progress is being
made in procurement of project equipment and materials. The Government
approved 380 percent increase in freight tariffs in June 1983 to improve
finances of the Ghana Railway Corporation which is executing the project.

RECONSTRUCT1ION IMPORT CREDIT
Assistance to the Transport Sector
The Problem
1.       Ghana has a relatively well developed transport system compared with
other countries in West Africa, comprising an extensive road network, a rail-
way, lake transport, two ocean ports and three major airports, all of these
concentrated in the South where the bulk of the population is situated. The
system generally met the country's needs until the mid 1970s. While the short-
age of foreign exchange has adversely affected the operations of all sectors,
its impact has been especially severe on the transport sector which depends on
a continuous supply of imported spare parts and supplies to maintain its
existing facilities and to keep its vehicles and equipment operating. As a
consequence the system has deteriorated sharply in recent years, and transport
capacity cannot satisfy demand, evena though demand has fallen due to Ghana's
economic difficulties. For example, part of the 1981 cocoa crop was not
evacuated until 1982 due to a shortage of trucking and rail capacity. The
shortage of fuel in the interior is primarily due to a lack of fuel trucks.
Mineral exports have fallen in part due to a shortage of rail capacity, while
port demurrage charges are increasing due to the deterioration of port ser-
vices. The condition of the transport system thus constitutes a serious
obstacle to Ghana's economic recovery.
Modal Priorities
2.       The cost of rehabilitating the entire transport systera is beyond what
can be provided by the proposed RIC, or by any other financing which is likely
to be available in the short run. (Credit funds would therefore be con-
centrated on the most immediate short-term needs, with the objective of
keeping the transport system functioning and thereby giving Ghana a chance to
earn foreign exchange and begin its rehabilitation program.
3.       For example, in the case of the road network, Ghana Highway Authority
(GHA) "guesstimated" in 1981 that US$1.5 billion was required to improve
14,000 km of "trunk" roads to good condition. IDA is providingP assistance for
road maintenance and rehabilitation under the Second and Third Highway
Projects; approximately US$10 million remains to be disbursed, the principal
constraint being absorptive capacity. No funds were provided under the
proposed Credit for road works becaUse project funds are available and because
the road network deters, but in most; instances does not yet prevent road
transport.
4.       Ghana Railways Corporation (GRC) is an important carrier of bulk and
semi-bulk traffic for export. In 19I82, GRC carried about one half of the
cocoa crop (106,000 tons), all bauxite and manganese exports (298,000 tons)
and one third of timber exports (64,000 tons). GRC is severely constrained by
a shortage of foreign exchange, manaLgement deficiencies, inadeq[uate personnel



- 47 -                            Annex IV
Page 2
policies, and declining revenues. The Bank Group is assisting GRC under the
Railway Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1170-GH, $29.0 million (AFDB $13.0 mil-
lion), 1981) which is just now getting underway. Therefore, no funds were
provided for GRC under the proposed Credit.
5.       Port operations are also constrained by the shortage of foreign ex-
change, inadequate management and personnel policies, poor organization and
declining traffic and revenues. Ghana has two ocean ports: Tema, which
handles most imports and about half the cocoa exports, and Takoradi which
handles most other exports. Total traffic declined from 5.8 million tons in
1977 to about half that amount at present. However, in spite of the decline
in traffic, the average ship's waiting time has increased to 4-5 days,
demurrage charges are increasing, and some ships are said to be avoiding
Takoradi because of expected delays and safety problems. However, the ports of
Tema and Takoradi are functioning, and appear to be a lower order constraint
to the transport system than road vehicles, as discussed below. Given the
limits on the RIC, the Bank is considering providing assistance to the ports
under the proposed Export Rehabilitation Project (ERP).
6.       The most serious transport constraint at present appears to be the
shortage of operable road vehicles. The problem is due almost exclusively to
Ghana's shortag of foreign exchange, and the fact that in the past the Govern-
ment has allocated an insufficient amount for spare parts. For example, motor
trading houses had requested to import $580.5 million worth of vehicles and
spare parts during the three years FY 1980-82, of which only $18.5 million
(3.2%) was granted. As a consequence around 70 percent of Ghana's 92,000
vehicles are off the road including more than 40 percent which require only
tires. It appears that of the order of $200 million would be required to
rehabilitate the entire fleet, which could not be made available under the
proposed Credit. However, road vehicles, particularly trucks, are a critical
input for all phases of agricultural production, and for virtually all export
industries, except bulk minerals. Since the economic return from increasing
vehicle capacity is high, about $20 million in RIC funds were allocated for
road transport operations, as discussed below.
Trucking Component
7.       Because of the magnitude of the road vehicle problem, and the objec-
tive of improving the transport of agricultural commodities and exports, $18.2
million in Credit funds would be allocated to trucks belonging to public cor-
porations engaged in agriculture or exports ($3.8 million), or to the private
sector ($14.4 million). The use of funds would be limited to trucks over
three tons which are roadworthy, or could be made roadworthy without major
repair. Some 3260 trucks were estimated to meet these requirements, of which
79 percent belong to the private sector (Table 1). One set of tires for each
of these trucks was estimated to cost about $6.6 million, and would last only
about four months due to intensive vehicle use and very poor road condi-
tions. Because tires are in such short supply, and in order to simplify
project administration, $13.3 million or 74 percent of available funds would
be allocated to buy two sets of tires for eligible trucks. The remainder
would be allocated for one set of batteries per truck ($0.8 million), and fast
moving spare parts ($4.2 million).



Annex IV
- 48 -                            Page 3
8.       Tires would be procured in bulk by international competitive bidding
by the Government and distributed to the public corporations, or sold to par-
ticipating trading houses for re-sale to private sector truck owners. Spare
part purchases would be procured directly by the respective public corpora-
tions and trading houses. Funds for the private sector would be allocated
among the majco trading houses in proportion to vehicle population and size
(Table 2).
9.       Trading houses would sell tires and batteries to any private sector
truck owner, and spares to owners of their brand of trucks. All goods would
be sold on a first-come/first-served basis, and trading houses would not be
permitted to require that vehicle repairs be done in their shops. Purchasers
would be required to show a valid road worthiness certificate and insurance
certificate. Purchases would be noted on the back of the insurance certifi-
cate to avoid double purchases for the same vehicle. Trading houses would be
required to stock some goods up-country in order to ensure a wide geographica'l
coverage. Trading houses would be required to sign an import agreement with
the Government covering the above arrangements. T'hese arrangements would be
administered or monitored by the RIC Technical Committee (Annex VI).
Bus Tires
10.      Passenger transport is also severely constrained by the shortage of
operable vehicles. For example, workers in Accra are reported to be spending
two to four hours a day commuting, thereby disrupting office and factory
operations. The principal prob:Lem is a shortage of buses. In particular, 100
buses owned by the State Transport Corporation, 166 buses owned by the Omnibus
Services Authority, and 240 buses olwned by the City Express Service were off
the road for lack of tires only in April 1983. In order to improve the
efficiency of the work force, and save the high cost of operating smaller
passenger vehicles, the project includes $0.6 million for one set of tires for
each of the above buses.
Tire Retreading
11.      Tire retreading costs abou-t $30 per tire in foreign exchange, or
about one-seventh of the average cost of a new tire. Retreading can double
the life of a tire if the work is done properly. Retreading is successfully
carried out by three small private domestic companies, which, however, lack
sufficient foreign exchange for imported materials., The proposed Credit
therefore includes $0.4 million for imported retreading materials, which will
be sufficient to retread about 13,300 tires and is within -the companies'
capacity to carry out.
Domestic Tire Company
12.      It is proposed to import $13.3 million in tires under the proposed
Credit.  However, tires are manufactured in Ghana by the publicly-owned Bonsa
(formerly Firestone) Tire Company.  The factory is said to be able to produce
tires at one-third of the foreign exchange cost of imported tires, excluding
equipment depreciation. The Government has stated that it is committed, as a
matter of policy, to using the Bonsa Tire Company in lieu of the wholesale



- 49 -                           Annex IV
Page 4
importation of tires at high foreign exchange cost. However, the Bonsa
factory suffers from serious managerial and technical deficiencies. In
particular, the factory lacks qualified managers and engineers, and the
electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems in the factory have deteriorated
due to lack of maintenance to the point where around $5-10 million is required
for their rehabilitation. As a consequence production has declined from a
peak of about 330,000 tires in FY1978 to a projected 63,000 tires in FY1983.
13.      Ghana will need to spend around $35 million each year on tire imports
if Bonsa ceases production, which is likely to happen without some form of
intervention. This is about $19 million more than if the factory operates
efficiently, since the factory can provide about 80 percent of the domestic
requirements at one third the foreign exchange cost of imported tires. The
Government is anxious to rehabilitate this company as quickly as possible in
order to reduce foreign exchange outlays on tire imports. The Government
requested that $400,000 be set aside in the proposed Credit to help finance
the most urgent needs of the company. Should the company demonstrate the
financial, technical and managerial feasibility of its rehabilitation
proposals to the satisfaction of the Technical Committee and the Association,
an amount of $400,000 would be reallocated from Category 5 of Schedule 1 of
the Development Credit Agreement to a new category established for the purpose
against which the Technical Committee may authorize purchases by the company.

GHANA
THE AGR]ICULTURAL SECTOIR
Background
1.       Ghana has an area of about 238,000 km2 and a population of about 12
million, of which nearly 70 percent live in the rural areas. Socio-economic
infrastructure and basic amenities are generally poor in rural areas; only 14
percent of the rural population have access to safe water, 2 percent have
electric light, and only 21 percent of the country's health establishments are
in rural areas.
2.       About 22.7 million ha (97 percent of total area) is land surface, of
which 11 percent (2.6 million ha) is under cultivation, 10 percent under re-
served forests, 24 percent unreserved forests, and 55 percent under bush-
fallow. The most fertile soils are in the forest belt which covers one third
of the country (but is inhabited by two thirds of the population) and spreads
over the sourthern and central regions. This zone has an annual rainfall of
1,300 - 2,100 mm and is well suited for growing a wide range of crops (cocoa,
oil palm, rubber, maize, rice, plantain, rootcrops, soybeans and tobacco).
The remaining two thirds is savannah, of varying agricultural value and part
of which is generally better suited for extensive grazing. MaiLn crops in the
savannah zone are: millet, sorghum, yam and maize (in sufficient rainfall
areas), cotton and groundnuts.
3.       Half of the total land area under cultivation is producing cocoa and
40 percent is used to grow food crops. As average population dlensity is about
50/km2, there is no overall scarcity of land. However, land use is limited by
several ecological constraints (poor soil fertility, high erodability, poor
drainage conditions and erratic rainfall), and, in certain parts of the forest
belt, particularly in the Central and Eastern Regions, where population
density reaches 100/km2, by population pressure.
4.       According to the 1970 agricultural census (the last conducted in
Ghana) 68 percent of the agricultural holdings in Ghana were less than 2.5 ha
in size, while only about 18 percent were over 4 ha. The level of agricul-
tural technology is rudimentary: hand cultivation coupled with few or no in-
puts is the main production technique in the country. It is estimated that 50
percent of food production goes to satisfy the food needs of the farmer's
family. Despite significant investment in agricultural machinery, mechanized
farming is relatively unimportant. However, demand for mechanized land pre-
paration, and for mechanized services for harvesting on the relatively large
farms in the Northern Region, appears to be quite strong.
Sector Production and Contribution to GDP
5.       Agriculture, including livestock, fisheries and forestry, contributes
about 51 percent of GDP and accounts for 65 percent of employment. Cocoa is
the most important single crop accounting for more than 60 percent of export
earnings.  Other crops and livestock contribute about 62 percent of the GDP



- 53 -                          ANNEX V
Page 2
produced by the agricultural sector while cocoa, forestry and fishing contri-
bute 24 percent, 11 percent and 3 percent respectively.
6.       The two major categories of foodcrops are cereals and starchy staples.
Ghana produces about 700,000 tons of cereals annually. Maize, constituting
about 50 percent of total production, is cultivated in all regions, although
the bulk comes from the Volta, Eastern, Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo Regions.
Other cereals are rice, also an important staple food, millet and sorghum.
Annual production of starchy crops is estimated at about 4 million tons,
nearly 50 percent of which is cassava, the remaining being divided among
plantain, yams and cocoyam. Production of other foodcrops (grains, legumes,
vegetables and fruits) is limited, although growing conditions are favor-
able. Industrial crops such as cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, and rubber are
still minor crops. Oil palm is mainly grown in mixed stands of small planting.
Established commercial projects consisting of a nucleus plantation and out-
growers cover less than 15 percent of the total area under oil palm estimated
at about 150,000 ha. (Agricultural production and areas under cultivation are
shown in Statistical Tables 1 and 2). 1/
7.       Ghana's livestock industry is relatively undeveloped in all compo-
nents except poultry, which has grown rapidly over the past ten years. Short-
age of feed and feed ingredients is currently a major impediment to poultry
expansion. The national cattle herd is estimated at about 800,000 head, the
bulk of which is in the Northern and Upper Regions. Estimated domestic catch
of fish is about 200,000 tons, of which 180,000 tons is marine fish production
and 20 percent comes from Lake Volta. Fish is mainly caught in inshore
waters, while deep sea fishing is still relatively unimportant.
Performance and Trends
8.       Agricultural programs in recent years have received much publicity.
"Operation Feed Yourself" was one of the main planks in the economic program
of the military Government which was in power from 1972 to 1979. The civilian
Government which took over power in the fall of 1979, launched in 1980 an
"Action Program for Agricultural Production for 1980-81".  Numerous reports
and lengthy studies have been prepared on Ghana's agricultural sector, includ-
ing a very comprehensive report prepared by FAO in the mid-1970s and an agri-
cultural sector review conducted in 1978 by the World Bank. A considerable
part of Bank Group lending to Ghana has gone into agricultural projects. The
generally accepted aim of the various programs has been to help the country
attain self-sufficiency in food production and to provide a supply of raw
materials for the country's industry and export crops to earn foreign
exchange.
9.       Despite the many programs, the performance of the agricultural sector
has been disappointing. Cocoa production has steadily declined and production
of most foodcrops has fallen below the levels reached in the early 1970s.
1/   MOA statistics have, however, to be interpreted with great caution
as their quality has deteriorated considerably in recent years.



- 54 -                            ANNEX V
Page 3
Last year, in particular, food production fell to an all-time low partly as a
result of the drought. Food prices have risen sharply in the last several
years and some areas have suffered from acute food shortage. The only notable
success has been an increase in the productive capacity for o.il palm, but the
impact in terms of production from the recently planted trees has yet to be
realized.
10.      As a consequence of this poor performance, the Government has con-
tinued to strive towards the development of a program for agricultural produc-
tion. In December 1982 it launched the "One Year Crash Agricultural Program"
as part of its economic recover-y program. The program aims at; increasing
production of Ghana's two important staple foods, rice and maize, bringing it
possibly to its 1980 level.
Constraints and Policy Issues
11.      The main causes of the poor performance of the agricultural sector
are: the lack of basic agricultural tools and inputs; the bottlenecks in the
supply of transport services, producer pricing policies in the case of cotton,
bast fibers, sugar and, until recently, cocoa that have constituted a strong
disincentive to farmers; and the overall impact of inefficient; institutions
which have failed to give proper support to small farmers who are the backbone
of Ghana's agriculture.
12.      The decline in the transportation services has affected many aspects
of agricultural production and marketing. Agricultural production is affected
directly by difficulties in the supply of inputs and in the evacuation of pro-
duce. Agricultural extension officers have become increasingly immobilized
and those working in more remote areas have become increasingly cut off from
supervision. Lack of spare parts for transport vehicles and poorly maintained
roads coupled with an acute shortage of tires, make it difficult for the
middlemen to reach many of the producing areas. The resultant uncertainty as
to the marketing possibilities in turn greatly influences the pattern of pro-
duction by reducing geographic specialisation and shifting production towards
areas with relatively good access to the major urban centers. Returns to
farmers in more distant areas are greatly reduced and prices to consumers
increase. Difficulties in the evacuation of cocoa and foodstuffs have forced
the Government to engage in costly "task forces" to try to get produce out of
the rural areas. The proposed qredit would address the transport constraint
through the provision of foreign exchange for tires, spare parts and batteries
for the trucking industry.
13.      An additional impediment to speedy recovery of the agricultural sec-
tor is a serious disarray of the sector's institutional framework. The agri-
cultural sector is served by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the Ministry
of Rural Development and Cooperatives (MRDC) which was created in 1980, and a
number of boards and corporations.  MOA, which is responsible for the formula-
tion and implementation of the GJovernment's agricuLtural policy is a very weak
institution, overstaffed at the lower echelons but with insufficient qualified.
people at the higher echelons. MOA has undergone several reorganizations
since Independence. The latest one, which took place in 1975, has created an
overly centralized organization which, coupled with a lack of planning, policy



_ 55 _                          ANNEX V
Page 4
coordination and preparation, has contributed to the difficulties the sector
is currently experiencing. In spite of recent attempts to decentralize the
operational structure of the MOA, the institution continues to remain highly
centralized. All operational decisions are taken in Accra. The disadvantages
of such a system in a situation where communications are bad are obvious:
long delays occur in decision-taking and headquarters is unfamiliar with local
issues; there is little operational flexibility in the use of resources in
reponse to sudden problems; and lack of responsibility at the local level does
not provide a challenge to the staff. The present administration is currently
working on a plan for the decentralization of the Ministry which would place
authority and responsibility in the regions and create a policy-making body at
the center. Details of this plan are not yet known.
14.      Many agricultural inputs have been heavily subsidized explicitly in
addition to the implicit subsidy involved in any import when a currency is
overvalued. These subsidies, besides weighing heavily on an already over-
burdened budget, have mainly had perverse results, such as encouraging the
diversion of part of the supplies across the border to countries where higher
prices exist. Also, subsidies have mostly benefitted large farmers. Fer-
tilizer subsidies have recently been reduced from 50 percent to 20 percent of
the cost price, while subsidies on insecticides and spraying equipment are
still very high (about 80 percent of the cost price). Although the Government
has indicated that it intends to phase out subsidies completely, it is
concerned about the dramatic increase prices of fertilizers, insecticides and
spraying machines will experience with the exchange rate adjustment and fears
that if price increases are not gradual, farmers might reduce their use of the
inputs. The Government has given assurances that by October 31, 1983 it will
prepare and review with IDA a program for the gradual removal of the remaining
20 percent subsidy and take all measures necessary to remove the subsidy in
accordance with the program.
The Export Subsector - Cocoa
15.      The decline in Ghana's cocoa production (from a peak of 560,000 tons
in 1956/66 to on all-time low production of 220,000 tons in 1981/82) has coin-
cided with the sharp increase in the total world cocoa output (mainly from
Ivory Coast and Brazil) and falling world prices. These prices were in
February 1983 $1850 per metric ton, which is about half the 1977 peak of $3790
per metric ton. The deterioration of the cocoa sector has had a marked in-
fluence on the deterioration of the national economy, given the overwhelming
reliance on cocoa for export earnings. An improvement in the performance of
the cocoa sector is, therefore, an essential element, at least in the short-
run, of any program aimed at the recovery of the economy.
16.      The causes behind the deterioration of the cocoa sector are many.
Failure to increase adequately the cocoa producer price in the face of in-
creasing domestic inflation, and the consequent lack of incentive to maintain
and expand production (and increased incentive to smuggle the crop out of the
country), is a key issue. But there are also other important issues which
need to be resolved: an acute shortage of insecticides and spraying equipment
as well as of other essential production inputs, competition from foodcrops,



ANNEX V
- 56 -                            Page 5
shortage of transport and storage. The sector is also in dire! need of insti-
tutional reform. The World Bank has been working very closely with, and
assisting the Government, in defining a strategy for the rehabilitation of the
sector. A comprehensive cocoa sector study was completed in 1980. In the
same year consultants Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (PMM) carried out, with funds
provided under a Bank project, a study aimed at recommendations for the im-
provement of the GCMB. Subsequently, under a UNDP-financed and Bank-executed
project, a PMM team carried out an organizational study and helped the Govern-
ment to draw up a detailed action program designed to remove logistic bottle-
necks in such critical areas as cocoa evacuation, storage, vehicle and
workshop management and improvement in port handling operations.
17.      While the issues affec ting the cocoa sector will be addressed under
the proposed Export Rehabilitat:ion 'Project (ERP), -the RIC aims mainly at
addressing the priority needs of the industry for the current year. The most
immediate need for cocoa producl,ion is insecticides and spraying machines.
GCMB uses mainly two insecticides: lUnden and Gammalim both currently imported
from Europe. 1/ GCMB estimates a m:Lnimum requirement of about 2.6 million
litres of the two insecticides ('to be applied at a 50:50 ratio), which would
enable spraying of one million acres of cocoa farms, and 20,000 spraying
machines to replenish the system andl provide for the necessary replacement.
The total amounts of insecticides oIn stock or likel]y to be available in 1983
are 1.5 million litres of Unden (imported under STABEX) and 360,000 litres of
Gammalin.  This leaves a shortfall of 780,000 litres of Gammaline.  The
proposed Credit would provide the foreign exchange needed to import the
spraying machines and to cover the shortfall in insecticides.
The Fooderop Subsector
18.      Output of foodcrops was very poor in 1982, mainly as a result of
inadequate rainfall. MOA statistics, although not very reliable, provide
however an order of magnitude of' the shortfall in food production.

Page 6
19.      Given zne present low level of yields of most foodcrops and the
general availability of land, there is scope for production increases, both
through yield improvement and area expansion. Current market prices for food-
crops are very high and this should be an incentive for farmers to plant more
of those crops   However, important preconditions for higher food production
are: improved storage capacity; timely and adequate supply of inputs such as
fertilizers, chemicals, seeds; and a drastic improvement in the support ser-
vices.
20.      The current storage capacity is estimated at 131,555 metric tons.
Storage capacity will be increased by another 70,000 tons, when construction
work on new silos or conversion of existing warehouses for grain storage would
be completed. Storage facilities for perishable foodcrops are non-existent.
Improved seeds are produced by the Ghana Seed Company, which is currently re-
ceiving technical and financial assistance from USAID. The company supplies
only 10 percent, 37 percent and one percent of the seed requirements for
maize, rice and groundnuts respectively. Vegetable seeds are currently being
imported with USAID funds. The Government forbids the import of seeds for
other crops. Most farmers currently produce their own seed requirements. It
is expected that when the proposed $10 million USAID Seed Company project gets
off the ground in 1984 the supply of selected seeds will improve considerably.
21.      Imports of fertilizer have varied dramatically over the years de-
pending on the country's availability of foreign exchange. There is a limit
of the quantity of fertilizer the country can absorb in view of the handling,
storage and loading constraints at the Tema port and the inadequate trans-
portation and distribution facilities up-country. Seventy thousand tons of
fertilizer have been imported or are expected to be available for the two 1983
cropping seasons and the Government is having difficulties in distributing the
fertilizer which has arrived so far (45,000 tons). Chemicals (mainly weedi-
cides, pesticides, and crop protection and storage chemicals) are currently
being procured and distributed by private commercial companies (Shell, Basf,
Reiss & Co., ICI) through their own network. The quantity of chemicals which
has been imported in the country so far is very small and only large and
medium size farmers have access to it while village level distribution is non-
existent. The demand for weedicides has increased considerably lately as a
result of the high cost of labor.
Priorities for Import Requirements
22.      It is evident that the success of an agricultural program in Ghana
does not only depend on developments within that sector but also on the avail-
ability of foreign exchange to (i) remove the bottlenecks in the supply of the
transportation services, and (ii) ensure an adequate supply of basic inputs
such as cutlasses, hoes, jute and polythene bags, fertilizers, insecticides
and spraying machines and other agrochemicals, and tools, equipment and spare
parts for agricultural machinery. These inputs and transportation services

are critical to increasing productivity in the agricultural sector.  With the
increase in supplies of these inputs there is, of course, a need to review
input pricing, subsidy policy as well as other issues which have constrained
agricultural development in Ghana.
23.      An improved input supply should enable a recovery in the production
of the agricultural sector and with increased food supply the inflationary
pressure on food prices will ease up and more foreign exchange can be diverted
from the import of foodstuff to the import of raw materials, spares and equip-
ment for the export sectors. Without, however, this initial investment pro-
gram it is difficult to envisage any other result than the continued stagna-
tion of the agricultural sector.
24.      The needs of imported inputs are both much larger and more urgent
than would normally be the case because of the very restricted supply of
foreign exchange allocated to these purposes in the late 1970s. The preceding
table provides a summary of the Government's most immediate requirements for
the agricultural sector. These requirements are already beyond what can be
provided by the proposed RIC, or by any other external financial source which
is likely to be available in the short run. IDA funds would be therefore con-
centrated on those inputs which could be used to the greatest advantage for
agricultural development. In the cocoa subsector, the RIC would help relieve
the most immediate constraint to an increase of cocoa production by financing
the import of insecticides and spraying machines. In the foodcrop subsector,
the Government's immediate program is to increase production of rice and maize
bringing it possibly to the 1980 level. In view of the many constraints
affecting the agricultural sector, this modest program makes a lot of sense.
US$7.7 million in RIC funds would be allocated for fertilizers, weedicides and
pesticides. Specifically, the proposed Credit would finance the import of
about 25,000 tons of fertilizer and about 300,000 litres of chemicals (mainly
herbicides and pesticides). An amount of $2.5 million would be allocated for
basic tools (cutlasses and hoes), jute and polythene bags, chain saws, knap-
sack sprayers, and maize shellers, and $1.0 million for spares and agricul-
tural machinery.

RECONSTRUCTION IMPORT CREDIT
Proposed Project Implementation Mechanism
1.       The overall responsibility for the implementation and administration
of the proposed Credit will rest with the Bank of Ghana (BOG).
2.       A Technical Committee (TC) will be established, headed by Dr. E.W.
Asumang, Director of Research (BOG) and consisting further of representatives
from the Ministries of Finance, Transport, Agriculture, Trade and an externally
recruited Project Coordinator acceptable to the Association who would be
financed under the Credit. It will be supported by a Project Unit headed by
the Project Coordinator with adequate full-time staff assigned specifically
for this purpose by the BOG, along with appropriate facilities and support
services. It will coordinate, monitor and supervise all project activities.
3.       An Interministerial Committee headed by the PNDC Coordinating
Secretary and consisting further of the Secretary for the Ministry of Finance,
and the Governor of the BOG will be established to provide interminsterial
coordination and policy guidance.  The Interministerial Committee may coopt
the Secretaries for Transport and Agriculture.
4.       The procurement process will start with aLl Importing Agencies
(Ministry of Agriculture, Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board, Motor Trading Com-
panies, etc.) submitting Import Applications to the TC. These Import Appli-
cations will be standardized lists of goods to be imported, indlicating detail-
ed specifications, expected CIF prices and the total amount applied for in
US$.
5.       The TC will review the Import Applications to ensure that they are
eligible for financing under the proposed Credit, that they are in line with
the Credit allocation to sectors and commodities, with the type and volume of
services provided by the applicant and that specifications of goods are cor-
rect and reflect respective scarcities.  The TC will review and decide upon
these applications within eight working days from their submission.
6.       After review of an Import Application, the Project Un:Lt will prepare
an import agreement which will be signed by the Governor of the BOG and an
authorized signatory of the importing agency. The Import Agreement consti-
tutes a commitment of the BOG to finance the expected foreign exchange costs
of specified goods. The agreed list; of detailed specifications will be at-
tached to the import agreement which will further indicate the total amount
allocated to the Importing Agency, and describe the duties of lhe Importing
Agency, regarding procurement and distribution of goods.
7.       The Ministry of Trade will automatically issue the Import Licenses
within five working days of receipt of a copy of the Import Agreement.



Annex VI

8.       Procurement will be limited to goods from Bank member countries,
Switzerland and Taiwan. Procurement agents acceptable to the Association will
be authorized by the BOG to handle all procurement procedures and place all
orders with suppliers, except as otherwise agreed between the BOG and IDA.
The Project Coordinator will act as a liaison person between the BOG and the
procurement agents.
9.       The procurement procedures applied will be in accordance with the
"Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" (as
modified for Structural Adjustment and Program loans). The Technical Commit-
tee will ensure that, as far as possible, orders are bulked across the sectors
and Importing Agencies. All individual supply contracts of US$1 million and
above will be subject to international competitive bidding. Purchases of less
than US$1 million by the private sector will normally be done through normal
commercial channels. Purchases of less than US$1 million by the public sector
will normally require not less than five quotations from reputable suppliers.
Proprietary items may be purchased directly. The TC may also allow direct
purchasing for contracts below $100,000 when a demonstrated urgency so re-
quires. Contracts of less than US$20,000 will not be entertained under the
Credit. All awards of contracts of US$500,000 and above by the procurement
agents will be subject to prior approval by the BOG. All imports financed
under the Credit will go through pre-shipment inspection by an inspection
agency specified by the BOG. Prior review by the Bank of procurement pro-
cedures used and procurement decisions will be required with respect to con-
tracts of US$5 million or more.
10.      Before orders are placed, the Importing Agency will make arrangements
with its bank for a guarantee in favor of the BOG, covering the CIF value of
goods to be ordered and applicable import surchages. Cedi payments will be
made upon receipt of goods into a counterpart funds account to be established
by the BOG for the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance will use
these funds for priority development projects included in the economic re-
covery program. All local charges, like duties, transport and handling fees,
will be financed by the Importing Agency directly.
11.      Disbursements will be made against the CIF costs of eligible imports,
subject to documentary evidence that expenditures had been incurred on or
after signing of the Credit, and against the foreign exchange costs of ser-
vices provided by the procurement agents. To facilitate disbursements, a
special account will be opened by the BOG with a foreign correspondent bank
satisfactory to the Association. Establishment of this account will be a
condition of Credit effectiveness. An amount of US$5 million will be with-
drawn from the Credit Account and deposited by IDA in the special account upon
effectiveness of the Credit Agreement. On receipt of satisfactory evidence
that expenditures financed out of the special account were eligible for finan-
cing and that goods were purchased in accordance with the agreed upon procure-
ment procedures, the special account will be replenished by IDA through
further disbursements.

12.      After payment, the procurement agents will send all original docu-
ments to the BOG. The BOG will maintain auditable records of the special
account, the counterpart funds account and of all other transactions.
13.      Before a tranche of the special account is fully utilizad, the BOG
will send copies of the import agreements concerned, copies of suppliers'
contracts in appropriate cases, ev:idence of payments and evidence of shipment
to IDA, together with a request to replenish the special account.  IDA re-
serves the right not to make disbursements if submitted documents are not in
accordance with the Development; Credit and Project Agreements or procurement
and disbursement guidelines of IDA,.
14.      The TC will make every possible effort to ensure expeditious and
efficient distribution, adequate pricing and utilization of goods according to
agreed Project objectives. To control the distribution of goods for the
transport sector, it will establish a simple but effective system of certi-
fication (against original insurance policies and roadworthiness certifi-
cates). To control adequate pricing, it will ensure that retail prices agreed
upon with the importing and distributing agencies are published in local news-
papers. To control the utilization of goods, it will carry out systematic
spot-checks.
15.      The Project accounts to be kept by the BOG will be audited annually
by recognized auditors acceptable to IDA. Audit reports will be made avail-
able to IDA not later than four monLths after the end of each f'iscal year.
