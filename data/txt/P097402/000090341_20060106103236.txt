A.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1.       Mainsector issuesand Government strategy

Pakistan i s making slow progress towards the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Pakistan's health indicators remain poor relative to its Gross Domestic Product per capita o f US$652
including high fertility (4.1 children per women) and infant mortality (77 per 100 live births). Factors
intrinsic to the health sector contribute significantly to the above situation, which include: low and
inefficient public spending, inadequate management capacity, and poor quality o f services inpublic and
private sector.   The Government o f Pakistan (GOP) i s trying to address the above challenges by
implementing a medium-term human development strategy, outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) and the Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF). The strategy envisages an
increased public investment in the health sector to strengthen the health systems and improve quality o f
health care inpartnership with the private sector.

2.       Country assistancestrategy and healthrelatedobjectives

(Document # 24399-PAK, Latest CAS discussion: April 28,2004 (Document #28262-PAK)
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports the PRSP with an aim to reduce poverty through
implementation o f pro-poor and pro-gender equity policies. Inthe health sector, the CAS objective i s to
improve access to health care by strengthening immunization, communicable disease control systems,
maternal and child health programs and improving governance by supporting the devolution initiative.
The project supports the CAS objective o f improving equity by ensuring coverage o f children in poor
households. The poor with low health status and immunization coverage and residing in unhygienic
conditions are at a greater risk o f contracting polio. Disability resulting from polio limits a child's ability
to benefit from education and employment opportunities, and puts additional burden on poor families and
the health system for rehabilitation and care.

3.       Sector issuesto be addressedby the project and strategic choice

The project will support the World Health Organization (WHO)-launched Global Polio Eradication
Initiative (GPEI). GPEI i s the largest public health initiative that has successfully eliminated polio from
all but 6 countries' with only 1258 and 1262 cases reported globally in 2004 and 20052respectively.
Despite the progress, the situation remains fragile as during2004/05, there were polio outbreaks in eight
countries following importation and re-establishment o f virus transmission. Polio virus transmission in
endemic countries remains the last hurdle for a polio free world as a single infected child can put entire
world's children at risk.

Pakistan initiated Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) in 1994 as part o f its routine Expanded
Program on Immunization (EPI). National Immunization Days (NIDs) were strengthened in 1999 with
introduction o f house to house immunization. Subsequently sub-national immunizations (SNIDs) rounds
to target high risk districts in addition to cross border activities with Afghanistan and Iran were
commenced.      But, continued low intensity transmission o f wild polio virus (WPV) required further
intensification o f efforts (increase in number o f rounds and days per round) during 2003-2005. Overall
Program's achievement i s reflected in declining number o f polio cases, from tens o f thousands per year in
the 1980s to 1803 in 1993 (Graph 1). Since 1993 the number o f cases has further declined to 53 in 2004
and only 19polio cases in20052, 25% lower than inthe first nine months o f 2004.

Palustan i s most likely to interrupt WPV transmission by the end o f 2005. This, however, will be
confirmed after a 12 month transmission free period during which isolated cases may appear. Pakistan
will continue to implement SIAs for at least three years following the last confirmed case until the
country i s certified polio free.

Pakistan's polio eradication strategy focuses on: (i)Reaching and maintainingthe highest possible routine
immunization coverage (80% minimum) with at least three doses o f OPV; (ii)         SIAs (NIDs) to deliver
supplemental doses to all children under-five; (iii)  Mop-up and outbreak response activities around any
new case; (iv) Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance system to detect and investigate every case in
children under 15 years o f age and all suspected cases o f polio regardless o f age; (v) Community
mobilization and an awareness campaign; and (vi) Use o f monovalent OPV for some rounds instead o f
trivalent OPV to enhance type specific protection against Type 1polio virus.

Ofthe three types o fpolio viruses, Pakistan has eradicated Type 2 and 3 viruses. At present all confirmed
cases are due to Type 1 polio virus. In line with GPEI and Technical Advisory Group (TAG)
recommendations Pakistan will also use monovalent OPV rather than trivalent OPV in some rounds o f
NDs. The monovalent vaccine provides significantly better type specific immunity and also facilitates
protection by reducingwild polio virus excretion.

Operationalizing S I A i s a challenging task which immunizes over 30 million children in each round.
SIAs are being effectively implemented with 97% o f the target group immunized during 2004 and 2005
rounds. A fully functional AFP surveillance system provides regular quality data to help identify districts
with virus circulation and is used as a guide to modify program strategies as needed. Information from
the AFP system has identified 13 o f 120 districts as high risk due to WPV transmission in 2005,
decreasing from 39 high risk districts in 2001. WHO, with its 115 national and international staff, and
UNICEF with its provincial field staff provide technical support. Inaddition, technical advice i s provided
by TAG, consisting o f internationalandnational experts. The TAG duringthe last review concurred with
the GOP andtechnical partners that Pakistanis close to interruptingthe transmission in2005.

Strategic Choices:      Interruption o f polio virus transmission and eradication are difficult to achieve
through routine immunization services as there i s usually l o w zero-conversion rates among children living
in developing countries (e.g. inPakistan, 3 doses of OPV results in zero-conversion to Type 1virus in
only 60% o f children on average) and l o w coverage by routine services. The only effective strategy i s
highquality SIAs ensuringcoverage o falmost all ofthe targetedpopulation. InPakistan, SIAs havebeen
effective inimmunizing about 97% o f the targeted population during the last three years even inhard-to-
reach populations e.g. Northern Areas and Azad Jamuu and Kashmir have not reported any case o f polio
since 2000. As Pakistan i s close to interrupting transmission, the proposed project will ensure
continuation o f the SIAs to stop transmission and eradicate polio successfully.

IDAhas supported PEIinPakistanthroughthe IDAbuy-down arrangement with the Partnership for Polio
Eradication Project including a supplementary credit during 2003-05. The arrangements in the first
project have worked well, ensuring timely availability o f OPV for SIAs. Project implementationhas been
rated satisfactory and progress towards achieving Project Development Objectives rated as highly
satisfactory. As in the original project, the proposed project will use the IDA buy-down mechanism,
which will transform the IDA credit to grant terms upon satisfactory project implementation. This i s
preferred over a normal IDA credit because the decision to eradicate polio i s a decision and responsibility
o f the global community, and not only o f the last few polio-endemic countries. Also the IDA buy-down
mechanism will convert the credit into a grant only on satisfactory implementation, will encourage the
government to focus on implementationandresults.

IDA will finance only the OPV procurement as there is financing gap for OPV procurement with only
partial financing expected from the Government o f Japan. Other components o f the program are well
financed by the Government and other development partners.

4.       Rationale for Bankinvolvement

PEIhas been a major national effort since 1994, and has been actively supported by several development
partners.   Through WHO and UNICEF, development partners are providing grant funds for the
operational costs and surveillance. As eradication came closer, additional financing was needed to meet
the vaccine requirements. To address this need the IDA buy-down financing mechanism (Annex 10) was
developed by the Bank inpartnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), UnitedNations
Foundation (UNF) and other technical partners, following a request from the Global Polio Eradication
Technical Advisory Committee. Funds provided by these partners will "buy-down" the cost of IDA
Credits into grant terms to support polio-endemic countries. The Polio Eradication Trust Fund, financed
by BMGFand UNFandmanagedbythe WorldBank, is already established. The Trust Fundwill pay the
service fee for the Credit during implementation and buy down the net present value o f the IDA Credit
when the projects are successfully completed. The trust funds are already financing the original and
supplementary credit for Pakistan. Pakistan needs to continue SIAs for another three years and requires
additional resources to meet the vaccine requirements for 2006-2007. IDA will meet this financing gap.
Through the partnership, the partners are also able to access rigor o f Bank's project preparation and
supervision in support o f their efforts for polio eradication.

B.       PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.       Lendinginstruments

The proposed lending instrument is Sector Investment Loan through an IDA credit with a special
provision for third party funded Trust Fundto purchase the credit at its net present value once the Project
has been successhlly completed inaccordance with the terms o f the financing agreement.

2.       Project developmentobjective

The project development objective i s to assist Palustan's effort to eradicate polio through supply o f the
Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) for the country's supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) during 2006-
07. The Second Partnership for Polio Eradication Project (SPPEP) i s part o f the WHO) led multi-country
effort, and will contribute to a global public good, i.e., the eradication o f polio from the world. SPPEP i s
a follow-on project o fthe Partnership for Polio EradicationProject.

3.       Key performanceindicators

The indicators to measure project performance (see Annex 3) include:


                                                        5

    0   Timely arrival o f the OPV at the central stores o f the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI),
        Islamabad; (Target: at least five weeks before each o f the SIAs);
    0    S I A coverage inthe targeted population (under-five children) ineach o f the four provinces during
        2006 and 2007 (Target 85%); and
    0   Number o f confirmedpolio casesreported(Target Zero Case).

Vaccine arrival will be measured through EPI's Vaccine Arrival Reports (VAR). S I A coverage will be
measured through a cluster sampling survey using standard WHO methodology which will also measure
vitamin A coverage. The number o f confirmed polio cases i s measurement o f success o f PEI and will be
reported through the existing Acute Flaccid Polio (AFP) Surveillance System. Achievements o f the
targets for the first two indicators will be a trigger for the IDA buy-down. The details o f key indicators
for measuring the achievement o f the development objective are described inAnnex 3.

4.       Project component
(See Annex 1for a detailed descriptionand Annex 4 for project cost)

SPPEP will support PEI, which has three components: (a) OPV procurement, (b) supplemental
operations; and (c) surveillance. SPPEP will assist GOP to interrupt virus transmission, decrease the
number o f polio cases with the ultimate aim o f eradicating the disease with an IDA support o f US$ 46.7
million. SPPEP will provide financing for only the first component, Le., procurement and supply o f OPV
and its effective use duringSIAs during2006-2007.

IDA will finance the procurement o f OPV though UNICEF, which is an established agency for vaccine
procurement. UNICEF i s already procuring the OPV for Pakistan's immunization program as well as
under the first project. Given the very tight supply and demand o f OPV during the final stages of the
global eradication effort, UNICEF has been designated by the global polio eradication partners to be the
sole procurement agent for OPV.

Pakistan will conduct six rounds o f N I D s in 2006 and four rounds in 2007. In addition, four mop-up
rounds in 2006 and two mop-up rounds in 2007 will be planned in areas with evidence o f virus
circulation. The estimated OPV needed for the SIA during the project period i s for approximately 461.3
million doses at an estimated cost o f US$61.4 million (Table 1). IDA will finance OPV procurement for
US$46.7 million, US$12.8 million will be from the Government o f Japan and with remaining US$1.9
million expected from the GOP.

The second component o f PEI Le. supplemental operations consists of: (a) maintenance o f cold chain; (b)
social mobilization; and (c) training. All implementation arrangements are in place for these operations.
The National, provincial and district units are supported by WHO and UNICEF through international and
national staff to support and oversee the activities inthe field. The system functions well, and during2004
and 2005 an average coverage o f about 97% o f the targetedpopulation has been achieved.

The third component supports surveillance, including laboratory and epidemiological surveillance. The
surveillance system i s fully functional and data i s regularly reviewed by TAG in collaboration with
Government counterparts and technical partners. Each district regularly reports above the global standard
on key indicators including timely collection o f stool samples, 60 day follow up etc. The data from
surveillance and assessments o f the quality o f campaign comprise the monitoring and evaluation system
for PEI.

             Table 1: Oral PolioVaccine Requirementand FinancingRequired2006-2007




The total budgetneeded for SIAs during2006-07 is about US$100.4 million (Table 2), o f which US$61.4
million i s needed for OPV procurement. IDA will only finance component 1 i.e. procurement o f OPV.
The Government o f Japan i s expected to finance US$12.8 million for OPV procurement; and IDA will
finance   the remaining gap o f US$46.7 million. The cost o f supplemental operations and surveillance
(US$39.0 million) will be financed by WHO and UNICEF.

5.        Lessons learned and reflectedin the project design

The proposed project will implement a tested design implemented by the original project. Inaddition, it
reflects lessons learnt from IDA-supported Health, Nutrition and Population projects in Pakistan and in
the South Asia region including: (i) to keep the design simple and well-defined -- IDA support will
                                     Need
focus on a single component o f PEI; (ii) to use the regular structures for program management rather
                                         need
than Project Management Unit the project will use existing structures implementing EPI; (iii)
                                 -                                                                 Need to
coordinate with the development partners     -the project has been developed in close collaboration with

feedback - the project seeks to achieve polio eradication through focused, large-scale campaigns that
development partners; and (iv) Improve monitoring and evaluation and the value and timeliness o f

utilize surveillance and monitoring data as the basis of planning.

6.        Alternativesconsideredand reasons for rejection

The project will implement a tested design, which i s being implemented inpolio projects inPakistan and
Nigeria. The first project piloted the design successfully and in light o f a clear financing gap for OPV,
therefore other project alternatives, such as financing a different component, some or all o f the
components o f PEI, were considered and rejected in favor o f financing the OPV procurement.            In
addition, the alternative o f procuring the vaccines through the government was also considered and
rejected.   The project's financing arrangements agreed upon by the partners, envisage procurement
through UNICEF, due to very tight supply and demand o f OPV duringthe final eradication efforts.

C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1.      Partnershiparrangements

The World Bank's Health, Nutrition & Population Sector Anchor established a partnership with BMGF,
UNF and technical partners UNICEF and WHO to assist polio eradication by providing countries with
IDA financial resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The BMGFand UNF agreed to provide
funds to IDA-administered trust fund (the Polio Eradication Trust Funds or PETFs) that will buy down
the debt incurred by recipient countries for successful implementation o f polio eradication projects
(Annex 10).     Partnership arrangements are also in place with UNICEF and WHO to undertake
procurement o f OPV and a performance audit to determine if the IDA funds achieved their intended
results uponproject completionrespectively.

2.      Institutional and ImplementationArrangements

SPPEP as the original project will be implemented and monitored through the existing structures o f EPI
which i s already implementing PEI. EPI program implements the routine immunization program across
Pakistan through an elaborate management arrangement at the federal, provincial and district levels. To
ensure timely procurement and supply o f the OPV to EPI, and to monitor its effective use, the following
implementation arrangements are already inplace:

Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs): As in the original project, the proposed project will
support a single component of procurement, supply and use o f OPV. The OPV will be used inthe SIAs
which are organized and implementedas follows:

   MinistryofHealthimplementsPEIthrough EPIinclose collaborationwithWHO andUNICEF. The
   National ProgramManager, EPIi s responsible for the PEIat the Federal level.

   A WHO team consisting o f Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-seconded senior
   epidemiologist, a senior program administrator, an NID controller, an EPI expert, a statistician, a
    social mobilization expert and a logistician provide technical support to the National Program
   Manager, EPI.

   At the Provincial level, the DirectorProvincial Program Manager EPIheads the program under the
   guidance o f the Director General Health Services.

   At the District levels, Executive District Officer (Health) (ED0 (H)} supervises the EPI activities.
   ED0 (H) is supported by the officer responsible for EPI and other Officers working in the District
   Department of Health in each facility. The District team undertakes detailed micro-planning for each
   round ensuring all systems are functional for the SIA campaign. In addition, the District team
   calculates and verifies the target population, number and location o f NIDposts, cold chain needs, and
   ice requirements. This process i s supported by WHO and UNICEFprovincial and district-based staff.

   MOH i s responsible for the procurement, storage and supply o f vaccines, cold chain equipment,
    syringes, needles and transport for the routine and PEI. The Provincial Departments o f Health bear
   the cost of staff,    training, health education, stationary, petrol, oil and lubricants, and other
   contingencies. WHO and UNICEF assist by supplying the cold chain equipment, vehicles and
   technical assistance.

   Coordination Committees at the federal, provincial and district levels include government officials o f
   related departments, local political and social leaders, and representatives o f the NGOs and donors.



                                                     8

    A national level Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee (IACC), chaired by the MinistedSecretary
    Health, has the overall responsibility for coordinating the SIAs. Similar committees function at the
    provincial level chaired by the provincial SecretariesDirector General Health Services.           The
    Provincial Committees are responsible for specifying tasks, developing check lists, monitoring
    progress o f planning and critical steps, delivering clear and simple messages to the community,
    compute vaccine requirement, and ensuring that the cold chain i s effectively functioning. The role o f
    the provincial Director/Program Manager EPI i s to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate the SIA.
    At the district level, Coordination Committees are chaired by the ED0 (H), and attended by the
    Deputy Commissioner. These Committees meet monthly, and more frequently close to the actual
    campaigns.

    The mass media, religious and community leaders play a key role inraising awareness and mobilizing
    the public. School teachers, community members and Lady Health Workers are all involved in
    administering the oral vaccine.      UNICEF provides strong support to the social mobilization
    component o f the campaigns.

Surveillance: Surveillance quality in Pakistan has achieved and maintained international standards for
quality in key indicators since 2000 and i s fully functional. This i s largely due to the deployment o f
WHO supported Surveillance Officers throughout the country, now totaling nearly sixty. Their main
activities include continued active visits o f key reporting sites; advocacy meetings with physicians,
unregistered health care practitioners and faith healers; and training workshops for district surveillance
coordinators and vaccinators. Surveillance goes through periodic international quality reviews.

Procurement: The procurement arrangement agreed under the original project will be continued.
UNICEF will be the sole procurement agent for OPV due to very tight supply and demand o f OPV during
the final stages o f the global eradication effort. OPV will be procured and supplied to GOP under an
agreement between the GOP and UNICEF. A draft agreement for the purpose has been drafted.
UNICEF's international procurement division, based in Copenhagen, will undertake the procurement
following UNICEF's procurement procedures. National Program Manager, EPI will be responsible for
receiving the OPV at the National Institute o f Health (NIH), Islamabad and for its in-country storage,
distribution, administration and use.

Vaccine requirements are forecast by the National Program Manager EPI with technical support from
WHO and UNICEF. This i s based on the latest estimates o f the population o f children under-five years,
and the number o f rounds and doses to be given per child during a given year. The requirements are
endorsed by the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee (IACC) and TAG based on surveillance data. For
2006 and 2007 the program has forecast the requirements o f OPV as 461.28 million doses including 276
million doses for 2006 and 185-28million doses for 2007.

FinancialManagement:

The project would support a single component i.e. provision o f oral polio vaccine (OPV). UNICEFwould
procure vaccine for GOP for which the Bank would make direct payments to UNICEF. Financial
management arrangements would be the same as used for the parent project. WHO and UNICEF will
manage their share o f project expenditure using their own financial management systems including
internal and external audit. UNICEF would open a separate ledger account for this purpose inits books o f
account. GOP would maintain inventory records in respect o f vaccine received and utilized. EPI Cell
would provide to IDA a) OPV arrival reports; and b) a quarterly financial management report (Sources &
Uses o f Funds) including OPV received and its utilization. UNICEF would also provide to the Bank a
statement o f funds received from the Bank andpayments there from on a six monthly basis.

UNICEF's internal controls on use o f funds, procurement o f vaccine and utilization thereof are
considered adequate and no audit reports would be required inrespect o f the project as was the case inthe

                                                     9

parent project. There are no significant unresolved financial problems in respect o f the parent project
except delays in submission o f utilization reports. However, the delays did not have any impact on
implementation o f the project. The implementing agency has assured that there would not be any delays
inreportingfor the follow upproject.

Disbursements would be made under a blanket Withdrawal Application for the full amount o f credit.
UNICEF would submit cost estimates to GOP on a six monthly basis on the basis o f which payments
would be made by the Bank to UNICEF.

As in the parent project, upon completion WHO will conduct a performance audit o f the project within
three months o f project closing. The performance audit will report on timely vaccine procurement, use
and coverage o f children immunized. The report will be submitted to GOP with a copy to IDA. The
WHO report will be used by IDA to trigger the IDA buy down. Details o f financial management
arrangements are contained inthe attachedannex.

3.         Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

Existingsystems o f monitoring and evaluation established for PEI and SIA are fully functional. SPPEP
will notrequire any new monitoring or evaluation mechanism. The existing system includes:

    SIA coverage i s monitored by an analysis o f tally sheets recordingthe number o f children immunized
    against the number in the target group. The 1998 population census figures are used along with
    growth rate projections to arrive at a fairly accurate target group number.
    Output monitoring o f SIAs quality and coverage is undertaken at the provincial and district level
    usingDistrict monitoring teams consisting o f WHO, UNICEF and GOP staff. These teams monitor
    the quality o f SIAs inhigh-riskand other selected districts.
    S I A outcome i s monitored at the national, provincial and district level through the AFP surveillance
    system.
    TAG meets periodically and assesses progress. It analyses the polio eradication situationandprovides
    recommendations to give strategic directions to the operations. These reports along with the periodic
    assessments o f the SIA quality are also usedfor monitoring and evaluationpurposes.
    Upon completion, WHO will conduct a performance audit o f the project within three months o f
    project closing. The performance audit will report on timely vaccine procurement, use, and coverage
    o f children immunized. The report will be submitted to GOP with a copy to IDA. The WHO report
    will be usedby IDAto trigger the buy down.

           Sustainability

SIAs will end with polio eradication and there will be no need to sustain these. Polio eradication benefits
are infinite  because the disease will be extinct, unless a man-made mistake or disaster makes it reappear.

development partners and technical agencies who are klly committed to eradicate the disease inPakistan
and globally.

5.         Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

The main risk i s delay in achieving polio eradication nationally and also internationally. In addition, for
reasons that are not well understoodpertaining to the complex biology o f entero-viruses, polio may not be
eradicated despite best efforts and high coverage o f SIAs. This will require additional efforts and
financing. Untilglobal eradication i s achieved, all countries will need to maintainpolio immunization.

Delay inachieving polio                   S          transmission. As commitment to polio eradication
eradication nationally and also                      remains high, support for additional efforts from the
international1y                                      global community i s most likely.

1.       Economic and financial analyses

Economic
Usingstandard public finance criteria, public involvement in and financing o f SIAs to eradicate polio is
well justified. Control o f an infectious disease i s an example o f a public good for health with high
externalities.

Between 1988 and 2005, external sources will have provided US$4 billion to polio-endemic countries for
eradication efforts, including OPV procurement, surveillance and operational costs for SIAs. External
resources are also used for the certification and containment processes, advocacy and resource
mobilization, documentation, meetings and administration. Resources are being channeled to polio-
endemic countries by bilateral funding through WHO and UNICEF and direct bilateral funding. Efforts
are also being financed by national resources to pay for petrol, social mobilization, training and other
activities and non-monetary commitments such as the time spent by volunteers. Between 1988 and 2005,

                                                     11

it has been estimated that polio-endemic countries will have contributed more than US$2.35 billion in
volunteer time alone for PEI. These calculations do not account for the opportunity cost o f the public
sector staff and volunteer time.

In order to achieve global eradication, the focus in 2005-2006 is to ensure the interruption of polio
transmission. As of July 2005, a total o f US$200 million was still needed globally to implement the
planned activities to reach that objective. Nigeria, India and Pakistan, which accounted for 78% o f polio
cases worldwide in2004, account for 55% o f the financial requirements for that period.

Normal cost-benefit analysis does not easily apply to disease eradication, particularly at the level o f any
given country. While the costs o f eradicating the last cases o f polio are very highinrelation to the very
low burden o f the disease, the benefits o f successful eradication are infinite. To illustrate that point, for
instance, a recent WHO report3estimates the foregone treatment and rehabilitation costs after polio has
been eradicated globally could exceed US$1 billion annually.

Financial
Polio Eradication i s financially supported by bilateral donors and private donor agencies mainly through
WHO and UNICEF. Pakistan provides about 50% o f the financing, mainly through financing human
resources and associated recurrent costs. The project will only support the procurement o f the OPV. The
quantity of vaccine procured will depend on the national strategy, regularly updated in light o f
surveillance data.

As it is evident from the recent outbreaks in African and Asian countries through importation, there
remains a risk that transmission may not be fully interrupted and eradication will be delayed. This would
require financing for additional efforts, for which there i s strong commitment within the global
community.

Financial sustainability i s not an issue since SIAs will end with achievement o f eradication. The improved
surveillance system set up for poliomyelitis i s already being expanded to cover other diseases and i s likely
to be integrated inthe health system.

2.        Technical

Polio eradication i s possible because: (a) there i s no animal reservoir for the disease; (b) the virus has a
limitedpersistence inthe environment; (c) there is no long-term carrier state; (d) permanent immunity is
provided following infection; and (e) a safe and highly effective vaccine i s available. The global target
of polio eradication by 2000 has been delayed due to persistence o f WPV transmission. Pakistan i s most
likely to interrupt transmission and meet the Global Strategic Plan's revised target o f 2005, but sporadic
cases still might occur in 2006. The significant risks to eradication include: (a) l o w coverage o f the
routine immunization program; (b) delay ininterrupting transmission and eradication; and (c) uncertainty
about continued funding.

Pakistan will need to develop a strategy for polio immunization post-SIAs after achieving polio free
status. TAG will provide input into strategy development in line with global recommendations from the
Global Advisory Committee for Polio Eradication. The project team during implementation will ensure
that the strategy i s designed in light o f global recommendations and measures including financing are
available for its implementation.

Earthquake in AJK and NWFP - Implications for PEI: NWFP province (five districts) and AJK

effort i s underway. There has been complete disruption o f health care provision as the health system has
been paralyzed, especially inAJK. The areas affected are not endemic for polio with no case reported in
AJK since 2000 and last case from NWFP in2004 was an imported case. Inaddition, SIA coverage and
routine immunization especially inAJK have been high. The technical partners and the GOP concur that
that the risk o fpolio transmission inthe effected areas i s low and unlikely to change. There i s likely to be
some negative impact on coverage o f SIAs in districts o f NWFP and in A X and disruption of
surveillance system. However, to ensure that the area remains low risk and avert a polio epidemic,
preemptive OPV immunization has already been initiated targeting all children intented villages, children
attending field hospitals and through mobile team in accessible area. In addition, AFP surveillance has
been included as part of sentinel surveillance started ineffected areas. N I D s planned for November 2005
will proceed as planned inNWFP and Rawalkot District o f AJK but will only target tented camps, field
hospitals and accessible areas inMuzaffarabadand Bagh.

3.        Institutional

The existing institutional arrangements for PEI have been effective as evident by an average S I A
coverage o f 97% o f the targeted population and inreaching certification-level for AFP surveillance (one
case of AFP per 100,000 population under 15) and approaching the international standard for collection of
adequate diagnostic specimens from at least 80% o f AFP cases within 14 days o f onset o f paralysis. The
project will continue to use existing arrangements during SIAs at all levels between the public sector,
international agencies, NGOs and community groups. The program holds consultations with partner
NGOsand community groups which actively participate insocial mobilization activities.

Executing agencies: The project will be implemented through the existing federal, provincial, and
district structures already managingthe EPIprogram. The program will implement the PEIwith technical
support from WHO and UNICEF. No new structures will be created. The provincial and District
Departments o f Health through their EPI units will continue to implement SIAs. The Bank will work
closely with the partners and will keep informed o f the relevant institutional issues.

4.        Fiduciary

Procurement issues: OPV will be procured through a sole source agreement between UNICEF and
GOP. The Bank has accepted that UNICEF will use its ownprocedures for the procurement and delivery
o f the OPV as in the original project. UNICEF and GOP have agreed the text of a draft agreement for
procurement o f OPV. There are no significant procurement issues.

Financial management issues: The project does not require direct involvement o f the Borrower in the
disbursement o f the IDA credit. As the IDA funds will be transferred directly to UNICEF, there are no
significant financial management issues. Assurance that the Bank's fiduciary requirements are met,
especially that funds are used for the purpose intendedwith due regard to economy and efficiency, will be
obtained through the measures discussed in Annex 6 and addressed in the OPV agreement to be entered
into by the Borrower and UNICEF. Upon receipt o f a direct payment request from the GOP, IDA funds
will be transferred to UNICEF for the procurement o f OPV. UNICEF's regular financial management
system and auditing procedures will be used for this project. The Borrower i s not required to undertake
annual audits; the Association retains the option to request for an audit.

Beside technical support, WHO manages financial support fiom donor agencies. These funds provide a
large part o f the financing for operational aspects o f the SIA. It i s expected that WHO will have adequate
funds to facilitate project implementation. This aspect will be assessedduringappraisal.




                                                       13

5.       Social

The proposed project aims to benefit under-five children including vulnerable and neglected groups by
providing polio immunization.            Poor families, particularly their children, would be the primary
beneficiaries o f the project. Quantitative studies have found low utilization rates at public health facilities
catering to the poor. Qualitative assessments o f other health projects indicate that lack o f physical access
to services i s a problem in some areas. While wealthier groups can purchase health services from the
private sector, the poor are unable to afford these services and continue to rely on traditional practitioners.
The project would address these issues in respect o f polio eradication by developing specific strategies
and by using surveillance data to reachthe "hard-to-reach" populations.

PEI has established a framework for on-going participation largely through the IACC. This mechanism
includes representatives from: (a) key government ministrieddepartments; (b) multilateral agencies
(UNICEF and WHO); (c) bilateral agencies including the Government o f Japan, the Netherlands, EU,
DFID, USAID, CDC, WB etc.; (d) NGOs; and (e) community mobilization and media experts. The
IACC meets regularly to review needs and strategies o f the nationalpolio eradication program, and assess
the performance o f supplementary immunization activities.

PEIhas achieved success for the last few years by placing highpriority on mobilizing participation o f the
beneficiaries, communities and other stakeholders. Local politicians and religious leaders are regularly
sensitized and contribute by mobilizing local communities. Non acceptance o f vaccination i s very low.
The EPI holds consultations with partner NGOs and community groups which actively participate in
social mobilization activities for SIA. NGOs groups are represented in the IACC mechanism described
earlier, and participate with government representatives in workshops for the micro-planning o f polio
activities at the district and below level. The current institutional arrangements for PEI have been
effective achieving results on the grounds. The project will reinforce arrangements to promote
coordination between the government departments, international agencies, NGOs and community groups
at the national, provincial and local levels.

6.       Environment
The project has no significant negative environmental impact which would need to be addressed. The
project involves the supply and use o f OPV in small plastic vials which will need to be disposed off. The
disposal o f the vials will be done inaccordance with the WHO guidelines for polio vaccination campaigns
as being already practiced. No sharps such as needles or vial cutters are involved in the oral vaccination
methods. Therefore, the program has no infected medical waste. It i s deemed not necessary that a new
environmental assessmentbe camed out.

                        Annex 1: Polio EradicationInitiativeProgramBackground


The proposed project will support PEI, which seeks to eradicate polio and ensure Pakistan remains polio
free till certification, with an IDA support o f US$46.7 million. This will make a significant contribution
to the eradication o f polio from the world. The PEI i s implemented at the national level by EPIunder the
overall guidance o f the Federal Minister o f Health. At the provincial and district level, well-established
structures in the Provincial and District Departments o f Health implement Supplemental Immunization
Activities (SIAs) as part o f the routine immunizationprogram.

PEI has three components: (a) the procurement, supply and use o f OPV; (b) supporting supplemental
operations; and (c) surveillance. IDA will support only the first component as in the original project.
SIAs, in which the OPV will be used, require supporting activities such as logistics, social mobilization,
training, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. Besides the three levels of government, WHO and
UNICEFsupport and finance these activities through bilateral donor andprivate agency contributions.

The following indicators will measure the project's success and achievement o f the first two indicators
will be a trigger for the IDA buy-down: (i) o f OPV at the EPI cold rooms inIslamabad at least
                                               Arrival
five weeks before each o f the SIAs, to be measured through the EPI's vaccine arrival reports; and (ii)  S I A
coverage o f 85% achieved in the remaining endemic provinces during 2005, to be measured through a
cluster sampling survey according to a WHO-approved methodology.

Distribution arrangements and storage o f vaccines in the EPI cold rooms at the national, provincial, and
district levels are fully functional and no new arrangements are required for the proposed project. The
system work well for routine program and have worked adequately for the original project. Duringthe
planning and implementation o f SIAs, transport o f these vaccines through vaccine carriers to the children
i s coordinated with the vaccination teams.
Social mobilization and IEC activities with parents and communities are organized at the local, district,
provincial and national levels. Media campaigns in visual, audio, and print form are carried out to make
the public aware o f the programbenefits and to motivate them to get their children immunized.

Mobilization o f community leaders, health staff, and volunteers for planning and implementation o f SIAs
i s a key activity. InPakistan, about 750,000 personnel are mobilized for each campaign o f whom 100,000
are public sector employees, including 10,000 vaccinators.        In addition, 75,000 plus Lady Health
Workers, the community based workers provide additional support during SIAs. The remaining, about
650,000 include other government staff, NGO staff and community members. Training and advocacy
with these groups inmicro-planning, supervision, administration o f OPV, record keeping, and cold chain
maintenance occurs prior to each round o f immunization.

By Component:

Component 1 procurement, supply and use of OPV: Through the proposed project IDA will only
                  -
support component one i.e. support the timely provision o f supplies o f OPV needed for SIAs to immunize
all children below five years. It will also monitor the appropriate use o f OPV. IDA will finance the
procurement o f about 75% o f the OPV needed for the SIAs to be carried out during 2006-2007. UNICEF
will supply the vaccine under an agreement between GOP and UNICEF as in the original project. The
Bank has accepted use o f UNICEFprocurementprocedures for the OPV procurement.

The component's success will be measured by the following indicators:

      0   Timeliness o f GOP's request for funds for procurement o f the OPV: GOP will send, within three
          weeks o f project effectiveness, a withdrawal application to the Bank requesting payment to
          UNICEF.


                                                     16

    0    Timeliness o f disbursement o f WE3 funds to UNICEF for OPV procurement: Bank will transfer
         funds to UNICEF within 30 business days o f the date on which the payment request i s received
        by the Bank.

    0    Timeliness o f procurement and supply by UNICEF; the OPV will arrive at the EPI cold rooms in
         Islamabadat least five weeks before eachroundo f SIAs.
Funds will not be handled by GOP and will be transferred directly to UNICEF. Accordingly only
UNICEFwill provide financial management and accounting for the funds andprovide quarterly reports to
the government with copies to IDA. IDA will use these reports to monitor the outstanding balance and the
funds received and spent byUNICEF.

SIAs coverage i s monitored by an analysis o fthe tally sheets recordingthe number o f children immunized
against the number in the target group. Output monitoring i s undertaken at the provincial level through
independent monitors, and impact monitoring at the national level through the AFP surveillance system.
The Technical Advisory Group meets periodically and assesses progress. Its reports, along with the
periodic assessments of the SIAs quality undertaken by WHO and other technical partners, are also used
for monitoring and evaluation purposes. WHO will evaluate this component within three months o f the
project closing, focusing on the timeliness o f OPV procurement and supply, and vaccination coverage.
WHO will submit its report to GOP with copies to IDA.

Component Two         - supplemental operations: The second component o f PEI i.e. supplemental
operations consists of: (a) maintenance o f cold chain; (b) social mobilization; and (c) training.    All
implementation arrangements are inplace for these operations. The National, provincial and district units
are supported by WHO and UNICEF through international and national staff to support and oversee the
activities inthe field. The system functions well, and during2004 and 2005 an average coverage o f about
97% of the targeted population has been achieved. This coomponent will be financed by WHO and
UNICEF.

Third component - surveillance: The surveillance component includes laboratory and epidemiological
surveillance. The surveillance system i s fully functional and data i s regularly reviewed by TAG in
collaboration with Government counterparts and technical partners. Each district regularly reports above
the global standard on key indicators including timely collection o f stool samples, 60 day follow up etc.
The data fi-om surveillance and assessments o f the quality o f campaign comprise the monitoring and
evaluation system for PEI. The component i s financed by WHO.

Summary of the FinancialManagement Assessment

Not applicable

Overview of ImplementationArrangement

IDA has entered into a partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationandUNFoundationto support
the proposed project. The project will support a single component, i.e., the provision o f OPV. The
proposed project as the original project i s using an innovative financing mechanism: although IDA
financial resources will be provided to GOP, thirdparty funding from the above partners will "buy down"
the service charge, the commitment fee and repayments by financing the net present value (NPV) o f the
IDA credit. This would, ineffect, mean grant fundingfor the program.

The IDA credit will finance a single agreement for the supply o f OPV between the GOP and UNICEF for
the supply o f OPV with the arrangements described below which are similar to original project:

    0   OPV will be procuredby UNICEFfor GOP following its own procurement procedures. The draft
        agreement between GOP and UNICEF will be subject to the Bank's prior review and no
        objection.

    0   GOP will send a blanket withdrawal application to the Bank, authorizing the Bank to make direct
        payments to UNICEF o f amounts requested by UNICEFunder this Agreement, through an initial,
        and subsequently semiannual, paymentrequests;

    0   UNICEF will maintain a separate ledger account, through which all o f UNICEF's receipts and
        expenditures for the purposes o f providing the services contemplated under this Agreement will
        be recorded; and

    0   UNICEF will report semiannually to GOP, with copy to the Bank, on the use o f funds received
        including: (a) balance at the beginning and end o f the reportingperiod; (b) purchase orders placed
        by UNICEF during the reporting period; (c) actual quantities of OPV delivered and number o f
        children immunized duringthe reporting period; and (d) expenditures from the OPV Procurement
        Account during the reportingperiod.

The above arrangements are based on the proposed agreement for supply o f OPV to be entered into
between UNICEF and GOP.

Financial ManagementArrangements

The proposed project as the original project does not require direct involvement o f the Borrower in the
management and accounting o f funds, which will be the responsibility o f UNICEF. The credit proceeds
will be disbursed by the Bank directly to UNICEF as stipulated in the procurement agreement to be
signed between the GOP and UNICEF. The needed quantities o f vaccines will be agreed inadvance and
the price i s relatively stable.

The Bank will accept semiannual reports from UNICEF as meeting the financial information
requirements for Financial Monitoring Reports. EPI Cell would provide to IDA a) OPV arrival reports;



                                                    23

and b) a quarterly financial management report (Sources & Uses o f Funds) including OPV received and
its utilization. The assurance that the Bank's fiduciary requirements are met, and that funds are used for
the purpose intended with due regard to economy and efficiency, will be achieved through the following
measures:

    a     UNICEF's procedures for the procurement o f OPV will be agreed upon with the Bank;

    a     All expenses will be on items agreed beforehand (vaccine cost including freight, and UNICEF
          handling charges);

    a     The semiannual financial report from UNICEF to GOP, with a copy to the Bank, will allow close
          monitoring of the outstanding balance and funds received and spent by UNICEF. The Bank will
          be ina position to verify expenditures before any subsequent disbursements; and

    a     GOP will be able to confirm receipt o f the quantities o f goods indicated in the above reports,
          GOP will also submit to IDA a quarterly evidence o f utilization (issues o f OPV to the
          implementing agencies) o fthe quantities received.

UNICEF will submit to GOP, with a copy to IDA, a semiannual summary o f Sources and Uses o f funds
Statement showing utilizationby Disbursement Category and Activity.

Audit Arrangements

As the funds will be managed by UNICEF, the borrower i s not required to submit audited annual
financial statements to the Bank. However, the Association retains the option to request for an audit.

                                  Annex 7: Procurement Arrangements

A.      General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carriedout inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004 and the provisions
stipulated inthe Legal Agreement.

Procurement of Goods

The goods will comprise OPV only, which shall be procured from UNICEF in accordance with the
provisions o f Paragraph 3.9 o f the Procurement Guidelines. UNICEFhas been agreed by the global polio
eradication partners to be the sole procurement agent for OPV, given the tight supply and demand o f OPV
duringthe final stages o fthe globalpolio eradication effort.

The Credit will finance OPV for US$46.7 million under a single agreement with UNICEF for the supply
o f OPV. The draft agreement has been drafted. IDA will review and clear the draft agreement before
UNICEFand GOP sign the agreement.

B.      Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

As per the Director OPCPR's Memorandum dated October 17, 2002, a formal assessment o f the
procurement capacity o f the Federal EPI Cell (Project Implementing Agency) i s not necessary according
to Procurement Services Policy Group guidelines dated August 11, 1998. This i s because under the
proposed project, UNICEF, and not the implementing agency, will handle procurement.

The Federal EPI Cell will be responsible for project execution at the national level. While EPI i s a strong
program, it has limited capacity for procurement, especially for large scale internationalprocurement. As
inthe original project, the borrower will enter into an agreement with UNICEF for the supply of OPV.
UNICEF will ensure timely supply o f OPV to EPI. EPI will be responsible for the in-country storage,
distribution and administrationo f the vaccines.

UNICEF will report on a semiannual basis to the Government o f Pakistan with a copy to IDA on: (a)
purchase orders placed by UNICEF; (b) actual quantities o f OPV delivered to NIH; and (c) expenditure
from the OPV Procurement Account during the reporting period. Payments to UNICEF will include its
standard handling charges for vaccine procurement, an amount not exceeding 6% o f the vaccine cost, and
other non-freight costs, ifany.

The overall project risk for procurement i s Average.

C.       Procurement Plan

The quantity o f vaccine required i s determined by the needs identified by the Technical Advisory Group
(TAG). These needs are regularly adjusted based on surveillance findings. If surveillance shows good
results, and not all project funds are needed for procurement o f OPV for during 2006-2007, through the
first quarter 2007, IDA funds will be reprogrammed for the procurement of OPV needed for 2008. If
TAG determines that are no longer needed, the available funds will be used for procurement o f polio
vaccines for the routine immunization program. A TAG recommendation to this effect will be needed.

D.      Frequencyof Procurement Supervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank office, it is recommended that
supervision mission take place every 12months.

E.      Details of the Procurement Arrangements

The credit will finance OPV for US$46.7 million under a single agreement of total US$61.4 million
between GOP and UNICEF for the supply o f OPV in accordance with Paragraph 3.9 o f the Procurement
Guidelines. This agreement will be subject to prior review by the Bank before signing

                                  Annex 10: IDA Buy-DownMechanism

Introduction

This annex describes the arrangements for the implementation o fthe IDAbuy-down mechanismfor polio
eradication projects, which aims to convert the terms o f a normal IDA development credit to grant terms
through provision o f additional external donor resources under clearly definedperformance criteria. Inthe
context o f the Pakistan second polio eradication project, resources for the buy-down will become
available as a result o f an agreement between IDA, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and
UNFoundation(UNF).The buy-down mechanism complieswithIDA'S existing financial policies.

The Partnership

The World Bank's Health, Nutrition & Population Sector Anchor established a partnership with BMGF,
UNF and several technical partners to assist polio eradication by providing countries with IDA financial
resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The BMGF and UNF agreed to provide funds to IDA-
administered trust fund (the Polio Eradication Trust Funds or PETFs) that will buy down the debt
incurred by recipient countries for successful implementation o f polio eradication projects. Inaddition to
making commitment and service charge payments to IDA on behalf o f the recipients during project
implementation, the PETFs will, upon successful project implementation, buy down the net present value
of the principal amount o f the development credit.

The Mechanism

IDA is extending a development credit to Pakistan. The Financing Agreement will include two special
provisions:

    0   The PETFs will pay the applicable service charges and commitment charges, ifany, and

    0   The PETFs will buy down the principal amount o f the credit upon successful completion o f      the
        project (as determined by a World Health Organization (WHO) performance audit).
The buy-down will be funded by contributions from the BMGF and UNF. The buy-down mechanism
operates in three stages-credit signing, project implementation, and project completion. These stages are
described below.

At Credit Signing

IDA (FRM) determines the discount rate (the prevailing SDR-basket Commercial Interest Reference
Rates (CIRR) on the date of credit signing) and the foreign exchange rate (SDR:USD) that will be usedto
calculate the estimated net present value at final buy-down. The indicated amount i s set aside in a special
earmarked child-account under the PETFs. The set-aside amount equals IDA commitment and service
charge payments over the projectedimplementation period and the estimated amount needed to buy down
the principal of the credit at the end o f the implementationperiod. IDA hedges the foreign exchange risk
under its existing currency rebalancing mechanism.

DuringProjectImplementation

Under the project, IDA, acting on a request from the recipient country, disburses funds to UNICEF, the
agency responsible for procuring the polio vaccine. UNICEF in turn supplies the vaccines to the recipient
government. Resources in the earmarked child accounts o f the PETFs pay the commitment and service
charges on the disbursed amounts duringthe implementation o f the project.



                                                     31

If implementationperiodissubstantiallylongerthaninitiallyprojected,fundsrequiredtopayservice
  the
charges could exceed the funds set aside. However, the investment income on the set-aside buy-down
amount would provide a cushion against this risk. If the implementation period exceeds five years, the
responsibility for servicing the credit will revert to the recipient country unless the BMGF and UN
Foundation grant an extension.

At ProjectCompletion

Upon completion o f the project, WHO conducts a performance audit to determine if the IDA funds
achieved their intendedresults. The performance audit measures the results for two indicators:

    0    Timely arrival o f oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the country at central level (target five weeks prior
         to each SIA), and

    0    Vaccination coverage for OPV duringthe vaccination campaigns (Target 90% coverage).
If WHOperfonnanceauditevaluatestheprojectassatisfactory,theIDAbuy-downwillbetriggered.
  the
The earmarked funds in the PETFs will be used to pay o f f the IDA credit at the net present value o f the
credit based on the defined foreign exchange and discount rates to buy down the principal of this credit
(Repayment Amount). IDA will in turn cancel this credit and release the recipient from any future
liability. Ifthe credit i s not fully disbursed, the final Repayment Amount will be calculated on a pro-rata
basis. Ifthe WHO performance audit evaluates the project as unsatisfactory, the recipient will remain
obligated to pay back IDA on the terms o f the credit.
