                         manufacturing, agribusiness and mining sectors; (ii) put in place appropriate incentive measures to achieve rapid growth; (iii) develop the instruments to ensure
                         equitable, sustainable growth; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of local authorities to formulate, prepare, implement, and manage medium- and long-term integrated of
                         future regional development projects

                         The Thirteenth Implementation Support Mission for the Madagascar Integrated Growth Poles Project (IG2P) was conducted in May 15-June 4, 2013. The main objective of the
                         mission was to take stock of implementation progress following the completed level 1 restructuring of the Project in the fall of 2012.

                         Overall Implementation Progress and Progress towards Achievement of the Development Objectives are both rated Satisfactory. The PIU has performed strongly since the last

                         mission and the Overall Safeguards rating was upgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory. All ratings are now satisfactory, including on procurement and financial
                         management.

                         In 2012, the number of formal businesses jumped by 27% (+751 enterprises) whereas the number of formal jobs only increased by 6% (adding 695 jobs) in the two poles—reflecting
                         an increase in formalization but a slowdown in overall job creation. The numbers of businesses and formal jobs continued to increase in both Fort Dauphin and Nosy Be during the
                         first five months of 2013 but on a slower pace.

                         The level 1 Project restructuring, which was approved by the Board of Directors on December 4, 2012, included the following main changes: (i) the Project Development Objective
                         (PDO) was amended; (ii) the closing date of the Project was extended from December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2014; (iii) the Antsirabe-Antananarivo growth pole was dropped; (iv)
                         some Project sub-components, associated results indicators and legal covenants were dropped or amended; and (v) funds were reallocated.

                         The original credit (Cr.4101) was closed on October 31, 2012, and the full US$124.8 million was disbursed. The disbursement rate of the additional financing credit (Cr.4399) was
                         37% in mid-June and total commitments covered 63% of the credit. The disbursement for Q1-Q2 FY13 was US$5.5 million. The projected disbursement for Q3-Q4 FY13 is US$4.77
                         million; and $9.27 million for Q3-Q4 FY14.
