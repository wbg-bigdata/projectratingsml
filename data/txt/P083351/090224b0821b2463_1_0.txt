                         Data for November 15, 2013, reveal that the Project is on track to achieve its PDO level results indicators by quite a large margin: indicators on jobs creation and enterprise creation
                         already meet or exceed the targets for the closing date (December 31, 2014) of the Project.

                         In 2012, the number of formal businesses jumped by 27% (+751 enterprises) whereas the number of formal jobs only increased by 6% (adding 695 jobs) in the two poles. During the
                         year up until November 15, 2013, the number of formal businesses had jumped by 23% (+440 enterprises) and formal jobs increased by 14% (+689 jobs) in Nosy Be. In Fort
                         Dauphin, the number of formal businesses also jumped by 14% (+231 enterprises) and the number of formal jobs increased by 11% (+739 jobs). The performance was strong given
                         the difficult economic climate.

                         The disbursement rate of the additional financing credit (Cr.4399) is now 50% and total commitments cover 77% of the credit. The PIU disbursed US$5.5 million in Q1-Q2 FY13; US
                         $4.9 million in Q3-Q4 FY13; and the projected disbursement for Q1-Q2 FY14 and Q3-Q4 FY14 are US$7.0 million and US$9.7 million respectively.
