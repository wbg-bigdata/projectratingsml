F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and
coverage of these services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening the health financing
policy framework and increasing the financial accessibility of health services for the poor and
near-poor; (ii) improving the availability and quality of curative care, including responsiveness
to changing disease patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health activities; and (iv)
building the capacity of the health workforce.

The project therefore blends support for demand for health care services among the poor and
near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities and needs while building physical
and human resource capacity.

Key outcome indicators include:

Percentage of poor and others using and expressing satisfaction with the provision of different
levels of health services, including hospital care

Percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project
provinces

Improvement of quality of hospital care in the project hospitals

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.      At project appraisal (June 2005), the economic situation in Vietnam was positive. Gross
domestic product (GDP) had been on a continuous upward trend and in 2004-05 Vietnam
recorded, on average, 7 percent GDP growth. In a decade poverty rates in Vietnam had decreased
by almost 20 percent. Health indicators had continued to improve nationally. Despite these
improvements, several problems persisted in the health sector. There were disparities in health
outcomes and new health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) and avian influenza. High out-of-pocket payments for health was a major concern, and
financial barriers were acute for poor households. The 2004 World Bank Participatory Poverty
Assessment identified that health shocks were one of the main reasons for households falling into
poverty. Moreover the 2004 Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VLSS) found that 10 percent of
households spent more than 16 percent of their consumption on health care. According to the
VLSS, an inpatient visit for a household in the lowest quintile would cost more than four times
the monthly income of that household and more than half of poor households seeking inpatient
care had to borrow the money to cover the costs. Average household expenditures on both
inpatient and outpatient care in the Mekong Delta region were the second highest in the country.

2.      Some health reforms had already been implemented from 1990-2005. In a context of
limited public sector resources, hospitals had been allowed to charge user-fees for services.
Health insurance options had been incrementally expanded and provinces had been given greater
responsibility for health care management. Nevertheless, these reforms had not adequately
addressed the disparities in health outcomes and financial protection between various income
quintiles and the Government was interesed in further reforms.

3.      In 2002, Decree 10 strengthened the hospital user-fee policy by giving facilities the
flexibility and incentives to develop new and better services. There were hospitals that took
advantage of these developments and upgraded their facilities and introduced new services
against user charges. In the same year, Decree (139) on a Health Care Fund for the poor was
announced by the Government. The objective of this Decree was to improve the access of the
poor to health care, specially in-patient (hospital) treatment. The Decree created province-level
Health Care Funds for Poor (HCFPs) with the objective of financing out-of-pocket costs of
eligible individuals using publicly provided health services. Province-level governments were
expected to play a major role by either buying health insurance cards for the poor, or paying
directly for the out-of-pocket costs of services provided to beneficiaries by public hospitals and
other public providers. Implementation of Decree 139 was expected to bring significant benefits
for the poor – in terms of increased utilization of health services and financial risk protection
thereby mitigating any potential income loss for households from health care use. The other
objective of Decree 139 was to incrementally divide responsibilities between financing and
service delivery (purchaser/provider) and through the implementation of appropriate health
provider incentives create pressures for improving service quality. The project aimed at
supporting a regional approach to the implementation of Decree 139. Moreover, recognizing that
“near poor? households also needed financial risk protection, the project proposed – on a pilot
basis – to test the enrollment of the “near poor? into health insurance.

4.    The project was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2003 – 2006
which supported the implementation of Vietnam’s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and
                                                1
Growth Strategy. A key objective of the CAS was enhancing equitable, inclusive and sustainble
development. “Providing basic social services to the poor? was identified among the key sub-
themes. The January 2004 CAS Progress Report recognized that the needs of the poor are likely
best addressed through complementary supply- and demand-side investments. It also emphasized
the importance of narrowing the gap between the rich and poor provinces and encouraging
effective decentralization.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.      The project aimed at improving health services in the Mekong region and enhance access
to and coverage of these services in the Project Provinces, especially for the poor population
through: (i) strengthening the health financing policy framework and increasing the financial
accessibility of health services for the poor and the near poor; (ii) improving the availability and
quality of curative care, including the responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii)
increasing the capacity of preventive health activities, and (iv) buillding the capacity of the
health workforce. Key outcome indicators included:

1.3 Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators:
7.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) was not revised during the life of the project.
However PDO indicators as well as component indicators were revised. The restructuring paper
revising these indicators was approved by the World Bank Management in December 2010. As a
result of the revisions, the total number of project indicators (PDO and component indicators)
were reduced from 21 to 14, and the revised indicators more precisely formulated and aligned to
the project activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.     The main beneficiaries of the project were the poor and near-poor populations of the 13
provinces of the Mekong Region included under the project (approximately 2 million
individuals). The following public sector health facilities were also main beneficiaries: Can Tho
Central General Hospital, 2 specialized hospitals, (Can Tho Pediatrics Hospital and An Giang
Cardiovacular Hospital), 3 Inter-District Hospitals, Can Tho University of Medicine and
Pharmacy, 12 Medical Colleges and 13 Provincial Preventive Care Centers.
      Original Components:
10.      The project consisted of five components:

11.     Component One Protecting the Poor and Near Poor (US$8.0 million): The objective
of this component was to support the central and provincial governments in ensuring access to
poor and near poor populations through the expansion of the health insurance program.
Specifically, the component supported: (i) capacity building for the management of provincial
Health Funds for the Poor (HCFPs); (ii) strengthening coordination and collaboration among
involved agencies; and (iii) improving the flow of information; and developing an information
technology system. It mobilized technical assistance to help MOH and Vietnam Social Security
(VSS) identify key issues and constraints for the shift from supply – to demand side financing.
To foster the expansion of heath insurance, the component supported coverage of catasthrophic
health care costs for the poor and near poor through pilot schemes in the project provinces.
Finally, the component supported innovative pilot schemes to improve the effectiveness of the
HCFPs, in establishing targeting mechanisms to better reach ethnic minority people, ensure
access to services for mobile populations such as migrant laborers, or set up public-private
partnerships in health care for the poor. Provincial health departments will prepare work


                                                3
programs with a detailed description of the pilot schemes that they wish to undertake, as well as
conduct evaluations of these innovative pilots.

12.     Component Two: Curative Care Quality and Capacity (US$38.0 million). This
component aimed to improve the quality and capacity of hospital services in the Mekong Region,
by investing in equipment for provincial hospitals and the Can Tho Central General Hospital
(CTCGH) and in a region-wide hospital information system (HIS) to assist the integration of
private providers into the health insurance system as newly manadated by Decree 63. The
provincial hospitals received investment in two stages: (i) to ensure that provincial hospitals
could provide an essential level of care; and (ii) to allow provincial hospitals to expand selected
clinical services in response to demand. The CTCGH was supported through a two-stage
investment: (i) providing equipment for core, tertiary-level services; and (ii) allowing for the
expansion of servies based on demand. The hospital information system aimed to be designed
based on end users’ needs followed by investments in software, hardware and training to
improve information about hospital performance and disease patterns across the region. Finally
the private sector regulation initiatives helped integrate the private sector in the health insurance
system by financing guidelines, tools and information dissemination to assist the government in
accrediting and monitoring private providers. Medical waste management is supproted under this
component.

13.     Component Three: Preventive Health (US$6.5 million). This component built the
capacity of the region’s preventive health system to address long-standing and emerging
infectious disease threats as well as new health challenges arising from economic growth in the
region. This was achieved through through investment in laboratory capacity and supporting the
implementation of an improved surveillance system in the Mekong’s 13 Provincial Preventive
Medicine Centers (PPMCs). These investments are complementary to the reforms in the
Preventive Health system at the national level and to investements in the remaining provinces of
Vietnam through the ADB Preventive Health System Support project, in particular, national-
level surveillance software developed under the ADB project. Satisfactory completion of
software was a condition for Project disbursement for surveillance.

14.      Component Four: Human Resources Development (US$8.0 million). This component
aimed to improve the capacity of the health workforce to deliver quality health services,
especially for the poor and near poor. The component financed training activities for health
teams at different levels of the health system, and supported the CTUMP in delivering and
organizing priority training activities, and piloting non-training human resources (HR) initiatives.
Importantly, this component provided the training inputs to complement investments in Curative
Care and Preventive Health components to ensure efficient use of new equipment. Training
activities for local health staff would be determined through a bottom-up planning exercise
looking at linkages to services for the poor and near poor, skill gaps based on demand and
projected population growth and skills needed for project-financed equipment. Support to the
CTUMP included training teaching staff to develop new or supplementary teaching capacities
crucial for the training needs of local health staff and the provision of essential teaching
equipment. Non-training HR initiatives would include an HR planning exercise to help pilot
provinces understand the existing HR situation and to make strategic choices in addressing labor
market constraints, including schemes to bring in health workers from outside to address staff
shortages in poor areas. It would also finance an HR information system for planning,
monitoring and evaluation in the region. Each initiative is initially piloted in one or two


                                                 4
provinces and findings and lessons learned shared among all 13 provinces at the mid-term
review.

15.      Component Five: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) (US$6.5
million). This component supported the establishment and operation of the Central Project
Management Unit (CPMU), Local Project Management units (LPMUs), and Regional Advisory
Committee (RAC) by funding: (i) consulting services to cover technical issues as well as
procurement, financial management, and disbursement; (ii) training of project management staff;
(iii) provision of office equipment; and (iv) incremental operating costs. This component also
financed data collection through baseline, mid-term, end-of-project surveys, and evaluations.

Revised Components
The project components were not revised or restructured during implementation.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1    Soundness of Background Analysis:
16.     The project development objectives were consistent with the prevailing conditions and
ongoing policy reforms in the Vietnamese health sector. At the time of project design, the
Vietnamese health sector had started introducing health reforms to address various identified
problems in the health sector. The Ministry of Health initiated incremental movement away from
direct service provision to more standard-setting and regulations. The country implemented fiscal
decentralization and provinces were given fiscal responsibility for sectoral allocation. Decree 10
which had granted autonomy to health facilities to raise resources for the sector by implementing
innovations and developing new services – paid for against user fees − had also been
implemented. These reforms generated some impacts but poor households were being left behind
– utilization rates among poor households were significantly lower and households faced high
out-of-pocket payments when accessing health services. In response, the Government launched
a demand-side financing program for poor households (Decree 139), but there was need for
implementing these various reforms within a coherent policy framework. At the same time, the
supply- side was not adequately developed, and there was recognition that with the expansion of
health insurance there was a need to also improve the supply side. The project design clearly
aimed at providing adequate health insurance coverage to poor housheolds while making sure the
supply side was ready for increased demand as a result of coverage expansion.

17.     The Bank, through policy dialogue and analytical work, undertook a Public Expenditure
Review (PER) (Managing Poverty Reduction for Growth and Expenditure, Report No. 30035–
VN) which included a chapter on the health sector. The PER noted that while the Vietnam health
sector had made good progress on improving indicators at the aggregate level, these indicators
were not improving among poor households. It commended the Government policy of expanding
health insurance coverage for poor households, while recognizing that implementation of the
decree could be a challenge. It noted the need for strengthened monitoring at the hospital level to
make sure that hospital funds were not diverted to provide services for the rich. It mentioned the
need for establishing accreditation mechanisms for both public and private hospitals. The project
design took into account available global evidence on improving health systems performance –
namely the need to balance demand and supply side elements.

                                                5
2.2        Assessment of Project Design:
18.    In defining project objectives, the project was well aligned to the diagnosis of health
problems in Vietnam. Moreover, it took into account the lessons learned from the
implementation of health projects in Vietnam as well as other World Bank projects that were
supporting health insurance expansion programs for poor and near poor households. The IDA-
supported National Health Support Project, which closed in 2006, found that facility-level
improvements in Vietnam needed to be underpinned by greater attention to the demand-side to
ensure quality and access. The early lessons of implementation were already available to the
team at the time of design of this project and were incorporated by the team.

19.    The implementation arrangements built upon in-country experience with World Bank
health projects. Most of the previous World Bank projects were designed as national projects
and implemented in selected districts throughout the country. This approach was found to
increase project complexity and reduce impact and therefore there was discussion of moving to a
regional approach. A regional approach was conceived as optimal for packaging key inputs
(demand- and supply-side) to obtain results. Generating accountability at the local level for
project management was also identified as a lesson and incorporated in the design of the
Regional Advisory Committee (RAC) which consisted of high level officials from each
province. The Mekong project was the first one to try the Regional approach.

20.     In a context of decentralization, the project design appropriately focused on Local Project
Management Units (LPMUs) for implementation. Moreover, it established a Regional Advisory
Committee as a regional coordination mechanism to oversee project implementation at a higher
(local) governmental level, as well as sustain the efforts after the project closed.

21.    The project did not duplicate the work of other development agencies but rather built
upon and collaborated with other initiatives, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Project
which supported the implementation of a provincial public health model for Mekong.

22.     There were some areas where design could have been stronger. At the time the project
was designed, overall utilization of health services in the country was already high. Average
length of hospital stay was around 12 days, the referral system was inefficient, and there was
excessive use of hospitals over primary care services. The project included a preventive health
care component – this was mostly on surveillance at the provincial level, not entirely linked to
increased use of primary care. Payment systems – strategic purchasing to encourage providers to
deliver cost-effective care – was, however, not a focus of the project. As is discussed later, this
approach led to some unintended outcomes – namely a large increase in the number of
hospitalizations and consultations – including among the poor. It is not clear how much of this
increase is due to supplier-induced demand and how much of it is real unmet need in the
population. It is perhaps a combination of both, but in a context where the country was moving
towards universal coverage, a large number of hospitalizations is a key indicator for future fiscal
sustainability and quality of health care in the health sector.

23.     A Quality Assurance Review (QAG) of project design assigned a rating of moderately
unsatisfactory.1 One of the main comments of QAG was on the weaknesses in the results
framework and linkages between the various levels of indicators that would allow the

                                                        6
Government and the team to adequately track and report on results under the project. The QAG
also noted that project design perhaps was not streamlined enough to make the connections
between demand side expansions through health insurance coverage, and improved access to
health services and quality of care at the hospital level.The QAG comments on M&E framework
was valid. The project team revised and strengthened the result framework after the QAG
review. On the overall design and the relevance of project to the health sector situation in
Vietnam, it is considered that the project design was relevant to the country situation and remains
relevant throughout the project implementation period (detailed evaluation of the design is
discussed in Paragraph 54). The weaknesses in M&E framework were not sufficient
justification for a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating of the Project design.


Adequacy of Government Commitment
24.     The Government of Vietnam (GOV), specifically the Ministry of Health was fully
committed to the project. The MOH exhibted full ownership from the start since the project
supported the implementation of key government policies. It was fully committed to the regional
approach as well. The necessary policy and legal frameworks were already in place, which
indicated strong commitment of the Government to the implementation of health insurance for
poor households.

2.3    Assessment of Risks:
25.     The description of project risks is detailed, including assessment of risks by component.
Identification of potential policy and program risks based on a technical assessment of design
was adequate. For example, the project recognized that better off provinces may move faster than
others and identified mitigation strategies. It identified that expansion of health insurance
coverage for the poor and near poor may lead to a moral hazard situation where beneficiaries
have less incentive to demand low-cost services and providers have less incentive to provide
these services. It correctly identified that working with Vietnam Secuity on benefits caps and
exclusions and in general strengthening payment mechanisms and purchasing would be needed.
This did emerge as a risk during project implementation. Under Component 3, the
implementation of which was linked to the implementation of the ADB model, the project
identifed that delays may impact the project. Interestingly, the project risks section did not
include a risk on project management, including project management capacity. During
implementation, this emerged as one of the major risks. Implementation during the early years of
the project was considerably slowed down. Moreover, monitoring and evaluation capacity was
limited at project conception and this capacity was only very slowly built during project
implementation. Adequate identification of risks at project entry is supposed to provide the task
team with issues that should be carefully monitored and mitigated during project
implementation. In hind sight, identification of project management risks during design could
have led to better, early mitigation and improving readiness for implementation.

2.4    Implementation:
26.     Overall, in the Vietnam context, project implementation has been impressive. The project
has closed on time, fully disbursed and has achieved the PDO and component targets. This is one
of the few projects in Vietnam that was not extended beyond the closing date. Initially,
implementation was slow as were disbursements due to several reasons. The project management
structure blends national and decentralized entities, and capacity at the decentralized level was
uneven. The Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) was responsible for supporting the

                                                7
Local Project Management Units (LPMUs), but on a day-to-day basis the LPMUs were in charge
of implementation. For start-up of the project, thirteen out of fifteen feasibility reports had to be
prepared and approved by the People’s Committee for each of the provinces; two out of the
fifteen feasibility reports, (Can Tho Central General Hospital and Can Tho University of
Medicine and Pharmacy) had to be approved by the MOH.

27.     For Component A, there were policy changes in 2008 – the premium for poor households
was increased from VND 80,000 to VND 130,000. The national government decided that the
government would finance 50 percent of the premium for near poor households. This meant that
each province had to come up with a detailed plan based on the new national policies. For
Component B, one fourth of all the medical equipment purchased under the project was for Can
Tho Medical University Hospital. Since the procurement for Can Tho was packaged with
medical equipment for the provincial hospitals, there were initial delays. In addition, there were
delays in finalizing the technical specifications for medical equipment packages. Component C
of the project (preventive health) was linked to the implementation of the ADB project and the
ADB project had a slow start as well, impacting the implementation of Component C.

28.     However, after initial delays, due to proactive involvement of the GOV and World Bank
teams, implementation picked up susbtantially as the CPMU and LPMUs built their capacity in
procurement of medical equipment and other goods using Bank procurement rules. For example
by the time of the August 2009 supervision mission, project disbursements and commitments had
increased from 12 percent to 30 percent of total grant proceeds (in approximately 12 months), the
prepartion time for bidding documents had been reduced from six months to four months and
around 80 percent of actions identified during the previous missions for the health insurance
coverage component, which were quite difficult to achieve, had been completed on time. By the
time of the September 2011 supervision mission, disbursements had reached 60 percent of total
grant proceeds and commitments 85 percent.

29.    Despite the highly decentralized nature of project management which could have been
problematic and chaotic, implementation of the project went smoothly. The CPMU maintained a
close collaboration (almost day-to-day) contact with the LPMUs, made frequent visits and were
available to answer any questions. The project management structure which consisted of MOH,
DOH staff and consultants worked well. The MOH and DOH staff ensured close connection with
policy issues. The World Bank team and CPMU worked together to resolve implementation
problems.

30.     The GOV and World Bank team conducted a strong mid-term review (MTR) in 2009.
The MTR focused on a review of the PDO, key peformance indicators and component indicators
as well as disbursement. An independent review of the project was also completed for the MTR.
The conclusion of the MTR was that the project would be able to completed by the closing date,
and only a few changes were necessary in the outcome indicators, some new activities needed to
be implemented and a reallocation of funds was needed. One weakness of the MTR was perhaps
that the M&E framework was not evaluated as closely as possible since the following year, based
on a QAG review (described below), the team would restructure the project key performance
indicators and component indicators. The project underwent a QAG Review for supervision in
2010. The QAG Review rated implementation progress moderately satisfactory. The reasons for
this rating were: (i) given that the project is procurement heavy, delays in the procurement of
goods and services could cause substantial delays. The QAG team was concerned that given that
total commitments and disbursements under the project were only 40 percent, the project would

                                                 8
not be able to fully disburse at closing; (ii) although the project included anti-fraud and
corruption measures, it was not sure that these were being followed; and (iii) weaknesses in
M&E (see following sections on M&E). The QAG panel report was taken seriously by the team
and identified issues addressed. For example, the project closed in June 2012 fully disbursed,
with all medical equipment purchased under the project installed and operational. Financial
management was rated moderately satisfactory since 2010, and there were no noted procurement
problems.

2.5 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
31.     Overall, the GOV and World Bank team get high marks for paying attention to M&E
systems and taking a proactive approach to refining M&E systems to address identified
weaknesses. Monitoring and evaluation is typically one of the most difficult areas for project
design and implementation and yet critical for measuring on-the-ground project results.
Moreover, M&E systems are critical for project tracking and undertaking necessary restructuring
to align with an evolving policy context. Good practice in project M&E highlight the following:
(i) selection of a limited number of appropriate indicators; (ii) attention to responsibilities and
capacity for data collection, reporting, and analysis; and (iii) leveraging project investments to
strengthen country Health Information Systems (HIS); and (iv) making sure that baseline data is
available before the start of the project. Surveys can be used as independent assessments to
validate HIS data, improve the quality of HIS data reporting and providing in-depth evaluation of
specific project areas. 2In this ICR these criteria are applied to the evaluation of project M&E. At
design: (i) the PDO and components indicators were broad, and there were too many indicators;
(ii) several of the indicators were vaguely defined making it difficult to measure during
implementation (e.g., coverage, quality); and (iii) there was limited use of already ongoing, well-
established health surveys in the country (e.g., Vietnam Living Standards Survey). The VLSS is
conducted every two years and has a well developed health module. Positive M&E project
design elements include clear designation of responsibilities for data collection, analysis and
reporting and the availability of baseline data for most indicators. Monitoring and evaluation
functions were assigned to the CPMU. Moreover, funds were allocated under the project for
carrying out the M&E function (Component Five: Project Management, Monitoring and
Evaluation).

32.     During implementation, the CPMU and LPMUs mainly tracked project activities (inputs).
The baseline survey was carried out in 2007 − one year after the project was approved and
despite the PHRD grant (both preparation and during implementation), CPMU and LPMU
systems were not established to track intermediate indicators. While some indicators were clearly
dependent on surveys – such as beneficiary satisfaction and out-of-pocket payments − others
such as the number of cards distributed and the hospitalization and consultation rates could have
been collected by the LPMUs, drawing upon routine data systems including hospital information
systems. Although there was a small sub-component (under Component B) on developing
hospital information systems, this mostly focused on the provision of hardware and software and
less on linking the hospital information system to a functional M&E system for the project that
could eventually be institutionalized by MOH and provincial health units. On the positive side,
during implementation, M&E received strong scrutiny during Bank supervision mission and the
GOV and Bank were proactive in addressing gaps in M&E. In 2008, the Bank team
recommended the use of routine information systems for tracking and this was eventually

2
 This section draws upon various IEG evaluations of World Bank lending for HNP projects. For details see
Johnston and Stout (1999) and Ainsworth et al.

                                                       9
integrated into the M&E system. Under these systems large amounts of data are routinely
collected and reported by public authorities, but retroactive fit did not work and the data did not
necessarily fit the Results Framework for the project and were not necessarily used by project
implementation units, and/or hospitals involved in the project to monitor project implementation,
focusing on inputs, outputs and intermediate results.

33.     The mid-term review also carried out a review of project indicators and suggested minor
changes. Finally in response to a 2010 QAG supervision review, the GOV and World Bank
restructured project indicators. The restructured results framework was approved by the World
Bank Board in 2010. Three surveys were conducted in 2007 (baseline) 2009 (mid-term) and
2012 (end of project survey). The surveys used the same methodology throughout; there was
good quality assusrance of the surveys from the CPMU and the World Bank team, and the
surveys cross-validated with other sources of data – administrative and the Vietnam Living
Standards Survey. As discussed later (assessment of outcomes), the project surveys results vary
from the VLSS. This could be due to methodological differences between the two surveys but
the results on the comparison are inconslusive. The availability of the surveys meant that there
was comparable data on project results by the end of the project.

2.6 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance:
34.     Safeguards: Approximately 12 percent of the population of the project areas belong to
ethnic minorities. The project developed an Ethnic Minorities Policy Framework (EMPF) The
project surveys tracked the impact of the project on ethnic groups. The health insurance coverage
rate was relatively equal between the Kinh majority ethnic group and the minor ethnic groups
(59.7% and 58.0% respectively) in the Mekong region. The surveys indicate that there was
substantial improvement in the uptake and use of the health insurance scheme among the
minority ethnic groups. The Kinh majority ethnic group tended to use health care services more
than the minority ethnic group, particularly the poor and the near poor. Total health care
expenditure per one treatment episode of the minority ethnic group who had health insurance
was higher than that of the Kinh majority ethnic group. There is no information to indicate why
this could be the case, but one possibility could be because of higher health needs among the
minority ethnic group.

35.     The project allocated US$1,780,000 to health care waste management which is
substantially more than it committed at project design and appraisal stages. Part of the funds was
used for technical assistance to develop provincial health care waste management plans
(HCWMP) and contributed to a stronger hospital waste management program in beneficiary
hospitals. By the end of the project, all provinces had operational health care waste management
plans. In fact, during the prepartion of the Vietnam Health Care Waste Management Project, the
fact that there existed already prepared health care waste management plans for the Mekong
Region greatly accelerated project finalization and implementation.

36.     Fiduciary: The Mekong health project management unit is considered one of the
strongest PMUs among the various World Bank projects implemented in Vietnam, across health
and other sectors. Recently, for a fiduciary forum organized for PMUs for other World Bank
project, the Mekong fiduciary team was invited to present. This is in recognition of the strong
fiduciary capacity of the Mekong PMU. As in the case of overall implementation issues, during
the early years of project implementation, financial management capacity in the PMU was weak
and the project was at various times rated moderately unsatisfactory for financial management.

                                                10
Procurement capacity as mentioned earlier, was weak during the early stages of the project but
was substantially improved during the life of the project.




                                             11
Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
37.     The main elements of the Mekong project are expected to be sustained as the
Government has put in place a national policy on health insurance for the poor and near poor,
financing the poor and providing 70 percent of government subsidies for the near poor. In
addition, provincial hospitals are fully equipped and operations and maintainence for facilities is
integerated into the hospital’s annual budget. Since hospitals in Vietnam are allowed to charge
fees, and the availability of health equipment is one factor that attracts patients to the hospital,
operations and maintainence is not a concern. However, there may be a concern vis-à-vis
hospital selection of particular patients (paying, non-paying) or giving preference to patients that
enjoy better benefits from the VSS. The GOV and the Bank could consider tracking O&M
expenditures in the hospitals ensuring that these can be financed from hospital budgets and do
not pose additional resources burden on hospitals. The VN-Hospital Waste Management Project
includes several of the project sites in the Mekong (5 Provincial Hospitals and 10 District
Hospitals). The health team supervising this project plans to continue to follow-up on the
environmental impacts of the Mekong health project and to make sure that lessons are shared at
the national level. The Government is also continuing with the model of regional health
projects.The World Bank is currently designing a new Regional Project for the North East and
Red River Delta that would support the Government in strengthening essential service delivery,
especially within the district and commune health system. These systems are quite weak,
including in the Mekong Region, and increase consumer preference for hospital services. The
application of district and commune health strengthening as national policies will contribute to
further strengthening of Mekong health services, including those elements developed through
this project.

38.     It will also provide examples of how commune services can be strengthened to address
excessive utilization of hospital services. Therefore, the proposed new Regional Project can be
considered a next phase operation for the Vietnam health system, with implications for the
Mekong region. Finally, the World Bank has a strong non-lending/analytical and advsiory
services (AAA) program in Vietnam to complement its lending program. Under the AAA
program, the Bank, along with other development partners, is undertaking a review of the 2009
Health Insurance Law with the objective of supporting the Government to undertake strategic
revisions in health insurance implementation as it works towards achieving universal health care
(UHC). This review will cover critical areas related to the equity, efficiency and sustainability of
health insurance expansion, including for the poor and near poor. Depending on the uptake of the
recommendations from the review by the GOV, the policy interventions supported through the
project will be further strengthened and sustained.3


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
39.    The project development objectives remain of high relevance for Vietnam as it strives to
achieve universal health care by 2015 through demand (health insurance) and supply (health

service expansions) side interventions. The Mekong Project, which was the first regional project
to support the operationalization of Decree 139 (health insurance for the poor), was also
innovative in that it included interventions to test the enrollment of the near poor into the health
insurance system through a partial subsidy scheme – where the premium is shared between the
government and the individual. Based on the Mekong experience, the Government has decided
to scale-up the Government cost-sharing program, by covering 70 percent of the total premium
for the near poor. Global experience on universal health coverage indicates that enrolling the
informal sector and near poor populations through contributory programs is difficult. Several
countries that are on the path towards universal health coverage have implemented cost-sharing
schemes (partial or full subsidy through the Government). Examples include Colombia, Mexico
and Thailand. The results of the pilot and its scale-up by the Government is consistent with
global experience.

40.     The objective of improving the supply of services to improve demand – mainly through
structural inputs such as medical equipment and human resources development remains equally
important for other regions of Vietnam as it scales up universal health care. The project has also
generated important lessons regarding the design of benefit packages and provider payment
systems at the hospital level. Currently, hospital payments are on a fee-for-service basis and
based on what we know globally about such payment regimes, it could be argued that the high
rates of hospitalization – as experienced under the project – was partly due to the payment
mechanism. Finally, the excessive use of hospital services under the project points to the need to
strengthen primary care. Therefore, both in terms of its original design and implementation, as
well as in the lessons it has generated, the project holds high relevance for the Vietnam health
sector. The new Country Partnership Strategy for Vietnam (2012-16) includes health under the
“opportunities? pillar and the main CPS indicator is increased health insurance coverage among
poor and near poor households.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
41.    Based on available information, project development objectives were achieved and even
surpassed in some cases (Table 2). Data for evaluating the achievement of the PDO indicators is
based on the project baseline and final survey.4

  The survey combined quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative survey was conducted in all 13
provinces, and had a sample size of 3,550 households (around 13,935 individuals), and 775 hospital patients. The
households were selected using randomized sampling method for population-based study. The hospital patients were
also randomly selected using the list of patients who would be discharged from the provincial hospital the next day.
The results presented in this section are from the survey results.

Achievements under Specific Components
42.    The component indicators (intermmediate indicators) are described in Annex Table 1. 1.
The revised component indicators are in Annex Table 1.2.

43.     Component 1: Protecting the Poor and Near Poor: According to the targets set for
intermediate indicators, this component was successful at increasing health insurance coverage
for the poor and near poor. Results under this indicator were exceeded (project target 90 percent,
final results 98 percent for poor and 97 percent for near poor). The policy impact of the
enrollment mechanism for the near poor was also substantial since the central government
recently announced that it will finance up to 70 percent of the premium for near poor families.
The other intermediate indicator was out-of-pocket payments with the target that these would not
increase from the baseline of 18 percent of non-food household expenditures; the result was an
increase to 23 percent, and the target was not achieved. Measuring out-of-pocket payments for
health needs to be carefully done, and and a detailed assessment of the baseline should
accompany any such analysis. In other countries (e.g., China), out-of-pocket payments for health
increased after health insurance was introduced. Due to financial barriers to accessing care, the
baseline for out-of-pocket payments may be low at baseline. As access to health insurance
improves, the major financial barriers are removed, and utilization improves. However,
households may pay for transportation to access health services, or there may be other costs
which are not fully covered by health insurance. The household survey also calculated other
household expenditures. This could be the reason why the target was not achieved.

44.     Component 2: Curative Care Quality and Capacity: The main objective of this
component was to support provincial and regional hospitals to improve structural quality of care
through the provision of needed medical equipment. The number of new clinical or para-clinical
tests conducted in hopsitals increased significantly from 7 at mid-term to 32 (with a target of 9).
The other indicator on reduced referrals to Ho Chi Minh city for poor was not achieved –
referrals increased from 3.4% to 3.7%, while the expected 20% decline for non-poor was
achieved. Medical equipment purchased under the project are in place, well used and maintained
by the hospitals. This component also envisaged support to the Vietnam Social Security for
private sector regulatory activies that would allow VSS to develop private facility accreditation
guidelines and procedures as well as carry out quality assurance activities. This part of the
project did not make much progress and at the end of the project such guidelines have not been
developed.

45.     Component 3: Preventive Health: The defined indicators for the component achieved
and even exceeded target values in the M&E framework (details below). The objective of this
component was to invest in laboratory capacity and support the implementation of an improved
surveillance system in the Mekong’s 13 Provincial preventive Medicine Centers (PPMCs). The
investment in laboratory capacity took place through the provision of equipment for essential
services in all provinces and for more advanced services in Can Tho PPMC. The indicator that
PPMCs would carry out standard tests as per national benchmarks was exceeded. The target
was 70 and the final number was 85. The other indicator was the number of districts
receiving training and the target was also exceeeded (60 with a final outcome of 129).

46.    Component 4: Human Resource Development: As Annex Table 1.3 shows the
majority of the component indicators were met, or even exceeded their targets. The objective of
the component was to improve the capacity of the health workforce to deliver quality health

                                                15
services, especially for the poor and near poor. This component financed training activities for
health teams at different levels of the health system, by supporting the CPMU in delivering and
organizing priority training activities.

47.      Component 5: Project Management. The objective of this component was to support
the central and provincial project management units (PMUs) to carry out project tasks in a timely
and efficient manner. There were no specific component indicators defined. As noted in the
implementation sections, the Central and provincial PMUs initially had a slow start and
difficulties with procurement of the rather complex medical equipment packages. Over time the
provincial PMUs built their capacity with strong support from the Central PMU. The PMU
organizational structure, i.e., that the head of the PMU is a senior staff from the Ministry of
Health, helped in integration of the PMU into the Ministry of Health and ensured that project
implementation was not disconnected from policy developments and the lessons from the project
integrated into policy making. This is also evidenced by the adoption of the national government
of the financing plan for the near poor which was piloted under Component 1 of the project.
Finally at the provincial level, regular meetings between the project management units –
facilitated by the central PMU – helped in creating a supportive environment where the
provincial PMUs could learn from each other. As the results of the project show, lower capacity
provinces within the Mekong region did not necessarily perform worse than the higher capacity
provinces.

48.     Triangulating Project Data with Other Surveys: To better evaluate project
achievements and triangulate with other sources of data, data from the survey was compared
with data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS, 2010). Comparison
with the VLSS 2010 shows differences. Across the board, the rates noted in the project survey
are significantly higher than the VLSS. For example for Q1, the VLSS noted a utilization rate of
31% for the Mekong, while the survey rate was 36%. Again, it is not clear why there are
differences (Figure 2). One possible reason is that the VLSS was conducted in 2009 and the
survey in 2011. The utilization rate for Q1 is the VLSS is slightly higher in Mekong as compared
with the national rates. Comparing the VLSS (2004 and 2010) shows that national rates for
health consultations (inpatient and outpatient) have increased nationally from 34 percent to 40
percent. In Mekong, the improvements in health consultations are from 42.8 to 50.3 percent (7.5
percent). Among the regions in Vietnam for which 2004 and 2010 data are available, Mekong
recorded the second highest increase in health consultation rate (North East had the highest:
10.5%). In other words, the VLSS corroboates that there was an improvement in the utilization
rate in Mekong. All the improvements were in outpatient consultants. Inpatient consultations
remained the same from 2004 to 2010 (6.7%). In 2004 (before the project), 1.3 percent of
inpatient consultations were among the insured (28 percent of total inpatient consultations). In
2010, this had incresed to 3.3 percent (49 percent).

49.     For outpatient consultations, the percentage insured using services in 2004 was 25
percent of total consultations and this increased to 36 percent by 2010. These data corroborate
the survey results on increased utilization of health services among the insured. Moreover, the
percentage of the surveyed population using government hospitals (project beneficiaries) in
Mekong increased by 9 percent. 5 For out-of-pocket payments, the rates for Mekong for quintile
1 are slightly lower than the national rates (See Figure 1). However the project survey results
indicate significantly higher out-of-pocket expenditures for Q1 as compared to the national and

Mekong rates in the VLSS. This is most likely attributable to the methdology in the survey
which calculated cash and non-cash expenditures for health, including income loss of both sick
persons and family members that took care of the patients. According the project survey results,
out-of-pocket payments are also regressive, i.e., poor households pay more than rich households.
The VLSS shows that the differences between poor and rich households is much smaller,
indicating a much lower level of regressivity.

3.3 Efficiency
50.      The project did not undertake a quantitative estimate of the project’s net present value
(NPV). It mainly focused on the equity, efficiency and fiscal impacts of the project. The fiscal
impacts are covered under the sustainability section of the ICR, and this section mainly focuses
on the impact of the project on technical and allocative efficiency in the Mekong health sector.
The project expected increased efficiency, both through resource savings (i.e., enabling
reductions in the cost of health care without compromising health outcomes) and by improving
the Mekong region’s health outcomes. According to the baseline and final survey for the project
– based on self-reported data – morbidity in the Mekong region did not improve during the life
of the project. In fact, the percentage of people of the surveyed population that had experienced
at least one sick episode increased from 25% for the poor and near poor to 36%. The cost of
health care at baseline and at project closing does not seem to have been reduced as measured by
indicators such as the frequency of hospitalization per patient increased from 1.45 for poor and
near poor to 1.90 at end of project, as well as the average number of hospitalization days which
increased from 12 to 15 days for the poor and from 12 to 13 days for the near poor.

51.     There is no available information on the price of health care services at baseline and at
project completion, but upgrades in health technology can result in cost savings or become cost-
enhancing depending on use. Based on the data collected, the number of tests per capita in
project sites appears to be on the high side. Therefore, it could be argued that the provision of
improved medical equipment without the parallel improvements in provider payment systems
which is largely fee-for-service in the hospitals, has not contributed to technical efficiency under
the project. Based on survey data, it seems that generally, as a result of health insurance, the use
of health services both inpatient and outpatient increased among the poor and near poor.
However, there is no data available to gauge the effectiveness of treatment encounters, indicating
possibly technical and allocative efficiency concerns.

52.    Overall Rating: Based on the analysis presented in the previous section, the overall
assessment of project outcomes in Satisfactory. The project was a first generation universal
coverage project that aimed at expanding coverage for the poor and near poor population and
ensuring that services were available and accessed by the newly insured. These objectives were
achieved and even exceeded. The project remains highly relevant for the country as it strives
towards universal coverage and expanding access for the poor and near poor. The project had
national level policy impact since the enrollment of the near poor became national policy.
Nevertheless, there are shortcomings in terms of efficiency – namely the large increase in use of
hospital level services and potential concerns with supplier-induced demand in a fee-for-service
environment. However, these impacts were already noted during the implementation process,
and through additional policy dialogue with the client, the current policy interventions with the
Vietnam Social Security now largely focus on provider payment reforms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
53.    The risks to development outcomes is rated moderate. The GOV is continuing the
reforms that were implemented in the project – broadly under the rubric of universal health care.
The Prime Minister has announced that the Government will pay up to 70% of the premiums for
the near poor. In the Mekong Region, as a result of the project, all provincial hospitals and the
Regional Hospital in Can Tho have been equipped to provide the level of health services that
hospitals at this level in Vietnam are expected to provide. The Project has generated important
lessons for the implementation of universal coverage in the country including enrolling the near

                                                 19
poor, implementing a catastrophic health care package, and the impacts of improved structural
quality of care (inputs) on utilization of health services at the hospital level. This has also
triggered concerns with technical quality of care and provider payment mechanisms which the
MOH is now beginning to address as part of second generation universal coverage reforms.
Ensuring that these issues are addressed as national policies will ensure that provincial level
implementation follows. From the financial perspective, Vietnam continues on a strong growth
trajectory. The Vietnamese economy is growing at a rate of 6-7% on average and public
financing for health needed to sustain enrollment of the poor and near poor is projected to grow.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
54.     Bank Performance at Design: Bank performance at design is rated moderately
satisfactory. The project design was relevant to the health sector situation in Vietnam and took
into account both demand- and supply-side dimensions which is critical for achieving better
results in the health sector. Project design built upon key Government laws and regulations,
namely Decree 139 (health insurance) and 10 and 40 (financial autonomy for health facilities)
and took into account Government’s preferences for a regional approach. There were a few
design elements which could have been stronger with the expansion of health insurance and
improvement in structural quality of care (through the provision of medical equipment and
training), it was expected that utilization would increase. However, increased hospitalization
rates, as well as excessive use of medical devices (compared with either national or international
benchmarks) are not necessarily a good development and something that needs to be closely
tracked at a policy and project level. Moreover, provider payment systems become very
important in this context to make sure that supplier-induced demand is not a problem. The
project design, while mentioning that capacity of VSS would be built, did not include any
specific mechanism to ensure that these policy developments on provider payments systems
would be calibrated with the roll out of health insurance and facility upgrades. The weaknesses
in M&E design were already elaborated earlier.

55.     Bank Performance during Supervision: Bank performance during supervision is rated
satisfactory. Projects operate in a dynamic policy and institutional context and even the best
designed project may be poorly implemented and not contribute to results on the ground. The
World Bank team took a continuous, proactive approach to supporting project implementation. It
was also responsive to various M&E reviews and took corretive action.

56.     The project indicators were revised through a formal restructuring of the project (2010).
The team began to raise with the Government quality of care issues. For example, the March-
April 2010 aide memoire notes that while health insurance coverage was on track in many of the
13 provinces, in those provinces where coverage was reaching almost 100 percent, it was
important to shift attention to quality of care issues. Based on these discussions Long An
province prepared a quality improvement proposal. It was perhaps because the team had already
raised quality of care as an emerging issue, that the findings of the ICR team were of no surprise
to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and in fact very well received in terms of next steps for reform.

57.    Continuity within the task team has been good and there were three task team leaders
(TTLs) since the beginning of the project cycle with a well planned transition from one TTL to
the next. The team has brought in technical specialized expertise as needed (e.g., medical
equipment specialist).    The Bank team worked closely with the Borrower providing
implementation support on procurement, financial management and technical issues. The task
team, along with the team leader and country sector coordinator (also health specialist) were

                                               20
based in the field and were therefore able to respond promptly to emerging problems. In the early
years, although the team leader was based in Washington DC, the TTL had good relations with
the client and was able to provide good support from a long distance. There were also frequent
missions undertaken.

58.     Implementation experience in the expansion of health insurance and quality
improvements at the provincial hospital levels indicates the need for national level policy
reforms in strategic purchasing by VSS. Therefore, in this type of project design, the Bank team
should have continuously integerated the policy dimensions into national level policy dialogue.
Based on discussions with counterparts during the ICR mission, the ICR team concluded that the
task team had indeed been integrating the lessons from the project into the national policy
dialogue. In fact, the lessons learned from the implementation of health insurance for the near
poor were integrated into national policy (70% coverage of premium for the near poor).
Moreover, there is recognition that payment systems at the hospital level – mainly fee for service
− could be encouraging increased volume of services (number of diagnostic test carried out), and
there is a need to implement different payment mechanisms and strengthen technical quality of
care.

Overall Bank performance rating is satisfactory.
59.     Borrower Performance during Design: Borrower performance at design is rated
satisfactory. The Borrower strongly owned the design of the project which focused on the
implementation of key policy and regulatory reforms. This project was originally designed as
two projects − a health insurance project and a second project supporting the supply-side. The
GOV however did not want two projects. The potential recurrent cost implications of borrowing
from the World Bank for health insurance premiums was a concern, and therefore, the Borrower
requested only one project. In hindsight, having one project instead of two reduced project
complexity and increased the success of the implementation of demand- and supply-side
elements that need to be carefully phased for project impact.

60.     Borrower Performance during Supervision: Borrower performance during supervision
is rated satisfactory. Despite, initial delays, the CPMU and LPMUs significantly improved their
performance over time, making sure that the project closed on time, fully disbursed, and results
achieved as per project targets. Over time, project management capacity was significantly
improved, and the CPMSU and LPMSUs worked in close coordination on the procurement of
medical equipment. Capacity to procure technical assistance was, however, more limited. There
was strong supervision from the Central PMSU, and continuous support to LPMSUs. This is
evidenced by the fact that prior to project closure, close to 90% of planned medical equipment
under the project has been purchased and installed, staff trained; andmedical equipment
operational in all provincial hospitals and Can Tho Regional Hospital.
Overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
61.     More than 30 low and middle income countries globally are currently pursuing universal
health care (UHC) policies. In many of these countries, an explicit focus is on expanding health
insurance programs for poor and near poor households. In that context, the VN Mekong Health
Support Project which was one of the early Bank projects to adopt the combined demand- and
supply-side approach is instructive for Vietnam as well as for other countries in the Region and

                                               21
elsewhere. In the lessons learned section, the ICR team focused on two aspects of lessons
learned: (i) the technical lessons learned of relevance for the World Bank and other countries
work on universal health care; and (ii) the particular project design and implementation issues
which have implications for the design of such projects.

Technical Lessons Learned
62.     One of the main objectives of universal health care is to improve access to quality health
services. In the Mekong project, this objective was pursued through expanding health insurance
coverage for the poor and near poor, and at the same time improving the structural quality of care
in provincial hospitals to serve the needs of the insured population. In many countries where the
Bank works, similar reforms are being undertaken. As the results from the project show for the
Mekong Region, the number of insured population increased significantly during the life of the
project. Providing medical equipment and training to hospitals helped upgrade the structural
quality of care in the hospitals and allowed the hospitals to better serve the needs of the
population. However, there are some key lessons learned.

63.     Bringing Poor and Near Poor Households into Health Insurance: One of the key
challenges facing Vietnam, and other countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region is how to
bring poor and near poor families into health insurance. Enrollment of near poor families is a
particular challenge since there is typically no coherent approach and countries adopt different
approaches based on country-specific conditions and fiscal space considerations. However,
countries in the region such as Thailand that have been able to achieve universal coverage, did so
by covering the near poor from general budget revenues. The Mekong Health project which
provided coverage for near poor households up to 80% (50% through the province, 30% through
the project and 20% through member participation) demonstrated that such a cost-sharing
arrangement could attract the near poor to enroll into health insurance. Although the project
stopped paying its share in 2011, enrollment of near poor has not dropped. The province as well
as the national government are picking up a large share of the premium. However, in 2011, the
national government subsidy was not in place and individuals were willing to pay their share (50
percent). This possibly indicates that the near poor see the benefit of enrollment in health
insurance through access to health care services, especially hospital services.

64.      Phased Implementation of Demand- and Supply-Side Interventions:                   In many
countries implementing universal health care, there are large supply-side gaps in delivering
services. The Mekong Project shows the importance of phased sequencing of demand- and
supply-side interventions. It also indicates that some level of hospital autonomy is needed so that
hospital managers and staff are able to effectively use inputs to generate results. The key gap – in
the case of Vietnam – is in benefits package definition and provider payment reforms, in the
absence of which, the goals of universal health care for the poor will not be achieved. It seems
that due to weaknesses in district level financing and management of the insured population,
utilization of provincial hospitals is quite high. Since hospitals are allowed to charge over and
above what is paid by the VSS – albeit in a regulated manner, this has implications for uneven
access to care for the poor and near poor.

65.    High utilization rate at the provincial hospital level for given burden of disease in
the population. The data on leading causes of morbidity in the Mekong Region in 2010 and the
leading causes of morbidity reported by provincial hospitals in the Mekong River (Vietnam
Living Standards Survey or VLSS and the household survey for the project) indicate acute

                                                22
tonsilitis and pharyngitis, post-viral fatigue syndrome, acute bronchitis. Only 2 percent were
catasthrophic (heart disease, heart failure). The majority of hospital admissions are for similar
reasons. For example, an estimated 20 percent of admissions were for viral fever. Many of these
conditions can be treated at the primary care centers and district hospital levels.

66.     The project dealt with provinical and tertiary level hospitals and aimed at reducing the
number of referrals to Ho Chi Hinh City. However, it did not tackle referrals between district to
provincial levels. Therefore, it is hard to understand why there is a preference for provincial
hospitals. It could be that care at the district level is inadequate and the population feels they will
get better care at the hospital level. It could also be a reflection of the provider payment systems
at different levels of the system. At the district level, capitation (fund holder model) is in place,
while provincial and tertiary level hospital payments are largely fee-for-service. Looking ahead,
as Vietnam moves towards universal coverage, the inter-relationship between the district and
provincial health systems will require more attention. Primary care systems could perhaps also
be strengthened. At the national policy level, there is discussion of introduction of diagnostic
related groups or DRGs. This payment mechanism would help control high use of medical
devices and encourage hospital to carry out more efficient care.

67.     General technical quality of care issues. The project did not collect information on use
rates for medical equipment provided through the project (Computer Tomography scans,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRIs, X rays). Nor was data available for use rate among poor,
near poor and non-poor populations, although this data is available in the Vietnam Social
Security (VSS) and could be analyzed. During the field visit to Ca Mau provincial hospital,
hospital administrators indicated that the hospital carries out 30 to 40 CT scans a day, which
means 1200 CT scans per month in a population of 1 million. Approximately 300-400 x-rays
are carried out each day. We know from OECD countries that high rates of usage of diagnostic
testing do not necessarily perform the best on health outcomes. As Vietnam gets into the next
stage of universal health care reforms, perhaps addressing technical quality of care will emerge
as a concern. There is already policy discussions at the national level on the implementation of
clinical pathways or other mechanisms to address technical quality of care.

Project Specific Lessons Learned
68.     Success of the Regional Project Design: The Mekong Health Project was the first
attempt at a regional approach. The objective of the regional approach is to make the necessary
investments at the regional level combined with pilot testing of interventions which then impact
national policies. In this case, the Mekong region was selected since it was one of the regions in
Vietnam with poor health outcomes. The project piloted interventions for enrolling the poor and
the near poor into health insurance which have subsequently been adopted as national policies. In
2009, the GOV announced the integration of the health insurance for the poor scheme into the
national health insurance system. In 2012, the GOV announced that the national government
would cover 70 percent of the premium for near poor households. This turned out to be good
approach focusing project inputs within a region and getting impacts at the regional level, as well
as lessons learned. The project at design identified the risks of a regional approach and
effectively managed these risks during project implementation. As a result of the success of the
regional approach under Mekong, this approach will now be continued under the proposed Red
River Delta project.



                                                  23
69.     Strong Project Management and Capacity: The project implementation design of a
central PMSU and local PMSU worked well, as did the Regional Advisory Committee (RAC)
which provided a mechanism for provincial leaders to share experience and hold provinces
accountable for results under the project. While at the beginning of the project, capacity in the
PMSU and LPMSU was weak which impacted the pace of project implementation, capacity was
built over time. Project management unit has built up considerable capacity and it would be good
to keep this capacity in the health sector since several other regional projects are currently under
design.

70.     Strong Project Implementation Support and Good Integration of Policy Dialogue
into Implementation Support: The World Bank team worked continuously and in a proactive,
problem-solving manner with the GOV to provide implementation support. The team carried out
a strong mid-term review (MTR) using the MTR to reiterate GOV commitment to strong project
implementation. Small adjustments were also made during the MTR to enhance chances of the
project closing on time, and fully disbursed. The implementation of regional projects, such as
Mekong Health, requires strong and continuous policy engagement at the national level. The
health team in Vietnam managed to keep a good balance between project implementation
support and national-level policy dialogue. This is evidenced by the fact that the implementation
experience from the project on enrolling the near poor has been announced as national policy by
the Prime Minister with the national government paying 70 percent of the premium for the near
poor. The lessons from the Mekong Project which integerated demand- and supply-side issues
have also contributed to the Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue on provider payment reforms in
Vietnam. The Bank has been strongly engaged as well on hospital reforms and jointly produced
policy notes on this topic with the Ministry of Health, Vietnam. The lessons from the Mekong
project are being incorporated into the the design of the Health Task Force under the Central
North Regional Health Support Project. This support was developed taking experience from the
Mekong project to bring up project issues to national level policy.

71.     Limited Focus on Building Country Systems for Monitoring and Evaluation : Every
World Bank financed project is an opportunity to strengthen country data systems in monitoring
and evaluation While the project supported software and hardware for hospital management
information system, these investments were not linked to the to the broader M&E framework
that would allow outputs from this component to be used for M&E. The project had an
interesting design wherein a technical assistance component financed through a Japan grant
(PHRD) were utilized for capacity building. However, few of the PHRD funds were used for
supporting country systems in M&E. The strong M&E element of the the project were the
baseline, mid-term and final survey, which were completed on time for the mid-term review and
project closing and provided comparable data on project impacts. This is often not the case in
most Bank projects and provides key information to gauge the impact of the project. In the future
design of HNP projects in Vietnam, the GOV and World Bank teams could perhaps focus more
on building country systems for M&E in the health sector.

Annex 4: Economic and Financing Analysis

1.     The project did not include a quantitative analysis of project benefits, for example in
terms of net present benefits. It focused on the potential economic impacts of the project in terms
of improved equity and efficiency. It also looked at financial sustainability of investments
through the project.

2.      The project expected increased efficiency, both through resource savings (i.e., enabling
reductions in the cost of health care without compromising health outcomes), and by improving
the Mekong region’s health outcomes. According to the baseline and final survey for the project
– based on self-reported data – morbidity in the Mekong region did not improve during the life
of the project. In fact, the percentage of people of the surveyed population that had experienced
at least one sick episode increased from 25% for the poor and near poor to 36%. The cost of
health care at baseline and at project closing does not seem to have been reduced as measured by
indicators such as the frequency of hospitalization per patient − increased from 1.45 for poor and
near poor to 1.90 at end of project, as well as the average number of hospitalization days which
increased from 12 to 15 days for the poor and from 12 to 13 days for the near poor.

3.      There is no available information on the price of health care services at baseline and at
project completion, but upgrades in health technology can result in cost savings or become cost-
enhancing depending on use. Based on the data collected, the number of tests per capita in
project sites appears to be on the high side. Therefore, it could be argued that the provision of
improved medical equipment without the parallel improvements in provider payment systems –
which is largely fee-for-service in the hospitals, has not contributed to technical efficiency under
the project. Based on survey data, it seems that generally, as a result of health insurance, the use
of health services – both inpatient and outpatient increased among the poor and near poor.
However, there is no data available to gauge the effectiveness of treatment encounters, indicating
possibly technical and allocative efficiency concerns.

Source: Baseline and Final Household Survey.

4.      Poverty Reduction/Welfare Impacts for Poor Households: It was expected that as a result
of project intervention, poor and near poor household welfare would be improved, i.e., these
households would have access to formal health care at times of need without having to pay out-
of-pocket or facing financial burden. The data from the VLSS and the project survey were
compared earlier and this showed that survey data on utilization is higher than for the national
and Mekong rates under the VLSS. However, this data is not disaggregated by income quintile
and urban/rural (where rural is also a proxy for the poor and near poor). In the Table below,
disaggregated utilization rates are provided. The data indicates that having health insurance
increases health service utilization. Utilization in rural areas have also increased slightly over
time (from 38 percent in 2004 to 40 percent in 2010). Moreover, while utilization rates among
quintiles 1 and 2 (poor and near poor) have improved between 2004 and 2010, for quintile 5 the
rates are the same. This is potentially a sign of progressiveness, and it appears that based on the
project results and comparing with national data across income quintiles, the situation is slightly
better for poor and near poor households. Access to health insurance seems to be a key factor.
Despite these improvements, inequalities persist. Since poor and near poor households would
likely have greater health needs, these ineuqalities in utilization across quintiles need to be
tracked.

5.      In terms of financial protection, comparing data from the surveys indicates that out-of-
pocket payments did not decrease. Moreover, poor and near poor households in the VLSS and
survey paid more out-of-pocket payments as compared to other (better-off quintiles). This
indicates that out-of-pocket payments are regressive, and despite access to health insurance, this
aspect of universal health care has not improved as yet. This could be related to the scope of the
benefits package for poor and near poor households and is an issue that needs to be closely
tracked by the GOV and the World Bank. Based on these findings, it is not clear that the
objective of reduced poverty and welfare gains for Mekong happened as predicted in the
economic analysis. It should be noted that as per international definitions, catasthrophic
payments which can drive households into poverty is defined as a threshold of 40 percent
spending on health as a percentage of total household spending. The rates in the VLSS for poor
and near poor households are much lower than this threshold. However, if the survey data is
used, a rate of 23 percent is high and could indicate potentially impoverishing effects.

6.      Health Expenditures and Implications for Sustainability of Project Investments :
Overall health expenditures are increasing in Vietnam. Therefore, most likley fiscal
sustainability of investments is not a concern. Total health expenditures accounted for 6.9 per
cent of GDP in 2010 or US$85 per capita. In 2002 when the economic analysis was completed,
health expenditures on health as a percent of GDP was only 1.6 percent. This is quite a sharp
growth in health expenditures over a period of 8 years. Public financing for health is critical for
poverty reduction and for sustaining the benefits for poor and near poor households under the
project. Total government spending on health as a percentage of total government spending in
2002 was around 6.4 percent. This increased to 8.4 percent in 2005, and currently is estimated at
24.3 per cent in 2009. While these numbers may include external financing as well, 23 percent of
total government expenditures is on the high side. The average for East Asia and Pacific
countries is much lower (9 percent of total government expenditures). This indicates strong
commitment of the government to health. However, the fiscal sustainability of such high
investments need to be considered. Moreover, whether these investments are generating value for
money need to be evaluated as well. The main sources of government financing are central
government, provincial governments and external development partners. Social Health Insurance
share of expenditures was 17.9 per cent in 2009, up from 8.8 per cent in 2005. Households
continued to account for the largest share of total health expenditures – 50.5 per cent in 2009 –
although this has declined from 67.1 per cent in 2005. Therefore, at the overall level, given the
strong commitment of the GOV to health, sustainability of investments supported through the
project is not a concern. Further attention will have to be paid, though, to efficiency of
investments in the future.

Annex 6: Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.    The ICR was sent to the Ministry of Health and the Project Management Unit. Borrower
comments on the ICR have been incorporated. The Borrower has two comments under the
Implementation Section.

        (a) The Borrower corrected the approval process for the feasibility reports; and
        (b) The Borrower mentioned that project implementation in Can Tho Hospital was not
            delayed due to construction.
Below is the summary of the Ministry of Health’s project evaluation report.

2.      Project design is relevant.
      Project Development Objective, components, activities are designed in compliance with
       the conditions of Mekong provinces and the needs of the health sector.
      Supply and demand side intervention: medical equipment - training – capacity building –
       support to the poor, near poor.
      For 6 years of implementation, there have been no major amendment.
      Some project activities are one step ahead of the government policy, then the MOH
       proposes government policy at national level: HI for the near poor; support to heart –
       surgery and catastrophic cases.
      During implementation, minor adjustment have been made in time.

3.      Good governance and leadership, coordination among stakeholders.
      Special attention and guidance from MOH leaders (Minister and Deputy Minister) and
       PPC leaders.
      13 Mekong PPC Deputy Chairman are the member of the Regional Advisory Committee,
       directly support the Project.
      The project get the timely support for project bottle-necks. The appraisal, approval,
       allocation of government counterpart fund is in time, contributing to project completion
       as committed, reaching the set target and indicators.
      Strong support from MOH departments: Planning and Finance; and Medical Equipment.

4.      Regional Advisory Committee took the effective role in management.
      For project with regional design like Mekong Regional Health Support Project, the RAC
       is crucial.
      For regular meeting of RAC, the MOH takes the key role.
      CPMU and LPMU report regularly to the leaders.
      13 PPC leaders directly support the project activities, the coordination among local
       departments is under the guidance of the PPC leaders; new proposals that is in line with
       local needs and the allocated fund from project are approved, reallocation is made under
       the authority in time.

5.      CPMU and LPMU have enough capacity to carry out project activities.
      Capacity of CPMU and LPMUs is key factor to project successful completion.
      CPMU has a good team comprising of experienced and devoted specialists: Coordinator
       responsible for Planning; Procurement Specialists knowledgeable of WB procurement

                                               47
       guidelines, especially ICB procedure for goods; Training Specialist; Financial
       Management Specialists.
      TOR for each position is clear.
      For the initial stage, the LPMU capacity is moderate as the LPMU team lack of
       experience with WB project. With hands- on training and capacity building, LPMUs are
       able to carry out project activities.
      LPMU have good teams comprising of Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, Chief
       Accountant.

6.      WB provided timely support and guidance

      Task Team Leader and WB team (especially WB Procurement Specialist and FM
       Specialist) are of great assistance and make great contribution to project success.
      Timely assistance and guidance from the WB team.
      Bottlenecks are settled with WB support through direct discussion.
      TTL and the WB team joined the WB supervision mission, attended project meetings and
       provided necessary support.

7.      Decentralization and the role of the localities

      PPC, DOH, LPMU play the key role in project implementation. The localities identify the
       needs for investment, carry out project activities, manage and utilize medical equipment,
       maintain health workers.
      Decentralization to localities to carry out activities: support the poor, near poor, training,
       procurement under IC, NS, NCB and ICB.
      CPMU take the key role in providing guidance to LPMUs to ensure the activities are in
       the right directions. CPMU developed manual, organized training workshop, provided
       hands- on training, conducted supervision mission at LPMUs.
      CPMU conducted missions every 3 months to provide necessary support and adjustment
       have been made when necessary.
      However, the decentralization is at acceptable level, depending on the capacity of LPMU.
       For tough activities like procurement of medical under ICB procedures, CPMU should
       provide hands-on training. For the delayed ICB that the capacity of the LPMU is limited,
       CPMU do the ICB on their behalf (DSA package).

8.      Good communications among stakeholders

      Smooth flow of information among: Beneficiaries – LPMU – CPMU – WB.
      Other communications: official documents, exchanges of email, telephone, fax.
      Exchange through email is an effective way and fast communication means to push up
       project progress.
