F. Results Framework Analysis



Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

     There were three Program Development Objectives (PDO) associated with these operations:
(i) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through
improved budget and public financial management (PFM) (EGRG I and II); (ii) foster private
sector development mainly through the development of a modern legal framework for private
investment and improvements in the business environment (EGRG I); and (iii) improve specific
aspects of the investment climate, including streamline procedures for business registration and
targeted reforms of the legal framework (EGRG II).

achievement)       the number of days to start a business by assigning one to two days for each
                   procedure, and more time than that for more lengthy procedures such as
                   making the company seal. It is believed that this methodology sometimes
                   overestimates the number of days to start a business since many of these steps
                   can be completed simultaneously (except obviously making the company
                   seal). The team estimates that the actual number of days to start a business
                   has already dropped to 20.

Comments           Target 100 percent achieved. Source: 2010 Doing Business Report. It is
(incl. %           important to note that the methodology of the Doing Business report estimates
achievement)       the number of days to start a business by assigning one to two days for each
                   procedure, and more time than that for more lengthy procedures such as
                   making the company seal. It is believed that this methodology sometimes
                   overestimates the number of days to start a business since many of these steps
                   can be completed simultaneously (except obviously making the company
                   seal). The team estimates that the actual number of days to start a business
                   had dropped to 20 in 2010. Actually, according to the DB 2012, the number of
                   days needed to start a business fell to 9.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Guinea-Bissau, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the world’s poorest countries. A
very difficult political context has characterized the country‘s economic and social development
since independence. The country has ranked invariably in the bottom rung on the last decade‘s
annual UNDP Human Development Indices, being the 173th out of 187 countries in the 2011 HDI.
Income per capita in 2010 was estimated at about US$550. Chronic poverty is deep and
entrenched—in the most recent estimates, in 2010, 70 percent of the population was living under
the PPP$ 2 dollar-a-day poverty line, and more than a third of the population lived under the $1-
a-day line.
Guinea-Bissau is a fragile state barely emerging from conflict. Political instability is deeply
rooted in the country‘s history of colonization and de-colonization since the 19th century. While
most neighboring countries had become independent in 1960, a long and fierce guerilla struggle
was necessary for Guinea-Bissau to achieve independence in 1974, with few structures for
effective governance in place. From then on, periods of relative stability alternated with open
internal conflict, events of political violence and underlying tension. A brief civil war, starting in
June 1998 which is estimated to have cut national income by 25 percent, ended with the ouster, in
May 1999, of President João Bernardo Vieira, who had ruled the country for 20 years. Between
2000 and early 2009, eight Prime Ministers have been appointed for eight different governments,
with an average time-in-office of about one year. Short-lived governments focused on managing
day-to-day business with limited ability to develop, let alone implement, long-term strategies.
Economic growth has barely exceeded population growth. The preparation of the first Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), initiated in 2001, was repeatedly delayed and only completed
in September 2006, while achievement of HIPC Completion Point (approved in December 2010)
took about ten years.

The context at appraisal for the first EGRG (EGRG-I) under this series was a country
challenged on the political and economic policy fronts. Hopes that the November 2008
elections would mark a significant milestone towards stability quickly gave way to
disappointment following a failed coup attempt one week after the formation of a new
government, and then the deaths of the army chief of staff and President in early March 2009.
Despite these developments, constitutional procedures were respected. As provided in the
Constitution, an interim President was sworn in soon thereafter, and presidential elections were
announced. In the meantime, the civilian government headed by Prime Minister Carlos Gomes
continued governing and submitted its program along with a draft budget to Parliament, which
approved them in its March-April 2009 session. This modicum of political stability was
supported by an acceleration of real GDP growth to 3.2 percent by end-2008, up from 2.7 percent
in 2007, driven by a good cashew crop and the gradual, albeit partial, normalization of the
country‘s fiscal situation. This improved fiscal situation allowed public sector wages to be paid
at a better pace and government spending for supplies and investment to increase. The
developments in 2009 placed the country in a more favorable position to finally begin moving
toward reaching the HIPC/MDRI completion point.

By the time of the appraisal for the second operation under this series (EGRG-II), the
country’s export sector had been buffeted by the global financial crisis, so political and
fiduciary risks remained significant (see Annex 7). Real GDP growth had slowed down only
marginally to 3 percent, compared to the 3.2 percent recorded in 2008, and inflation pressures had
eased considerably, with sharply lower food and fuel prices, leading headline inflation to close by

end-year at -1.6 percent. Moreover, growth was supported by a record cashew crop, despite
lower export prices, and a moderate expansion of food crops. It was the fiscal impact of the
global financial crisis that was the most significant, however. Slower economic activity and low
cashew nut prices (about a third of the government‘s fiscal base) negatively affected tax revenue
collection, requiring the government to accelerate tax collection efforts and to tighten spending
controls.

The bottom line is that the preparation and implementation for both operations needs to be
seen through the lens of a fragile and highly volatile political context. The late 1990s was
marked by civil conflict and the restored civilian regime in the early 2000s operated under a
situation of permanent instability given the tension between the country‘s armed forces and the

civilian government – a tension that was reflected the drug trade and the existing ethnic
divisions1. Chapter 1 of the Country Economic Memorandum describes the main events after the
civil war and following the restoration of the civilian government from the early 2000s to the
present days.

The series of Economic Governance Reform Grants I and II were key operations for the
2008 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) designed to support the country’s efforts toward the
achievement of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI).2 The EGRGs I and II were included in the 2009 Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) and the 2009 Africa Action Plan Progress Report.3 The objectives for these operations
were to strengthen economic management by supporting improvements in governance,
transparency and efficiency in public expenditure management, as well as laying the foundations
for improvements in productive sector with advancements in legal and administrative reforms to
foster private sector development. The EGRG I was a SDR 5.4 million (US$8 million
equivalent) grant, while the EGRG II was a slightly smaller operation of SDR 4 million (US$6
million equivalent) that drew funding from the Crisis Response Window (CRW).

The EGRGs were seen as part of a package of World Bank and donor resources that
included budget support, technical assistance and selected investment operations. They also
included the prospects of significant debt relief that would be provided through the HIPC and the
MDRI initiatives. The Bank‘s contribution came through several complementary analytical,
capacity building and investment operations. These interventions included the synchronization of
PFM and PSD legislation, such as the harmonization with the WAEMU legislation on
procurement that effectively leap-frogged Guinea-Bissau to the standards and institutions of their
faster reforming neighbors, as well as simplifications in the administrative steps for business
registration, including the establishment of a one-stop shop. These were important ‗low hanging‘
reforms that supported the common monetary and currency framework that helped deliver
stabilization.

Aid flows have been sizeable, but fragmented and unpredictable. The political situation
triggered Article 96 Consultations4 with the European Union (EU) in early 2011. Budget support
and other new projects were suspended. Guinea-Bissau was able to benefit from financial
support through projects from several other donors. However, the EU had been funding the
critical army downsizing, as well as a comprehensive multi-year reform action plan to reform and

  Guinea-Bissau is ringed by an archipelago of uninhabited islands and has become a key transit point for
Europe-bound cocaine. The government estimates that as much as 3,200 kilograms of the drug transits
through the country's borders each week. These drug flows amount to billions of dollars per year, dwarfing
all other economic activity in the country. A power vacuum in Guinea-Bissau could make it even more
attractive for drug cartels that were under increasing pressure in neighboring countries
2
  Consistent with the ISN for Guinea-Bissau, these operations also provided financial support to the
government whose annual debt service to the World Bank remained considerable up to the attainment of
the High Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point.

      Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement lays down the possibility of taking appropriate measures in cases
    of violation by one of the parties of the requirements of essential elements of the Agreement, namely
    respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.

and had still not resumed at end-2011. From 2008 to 2011 the UN-Peace Building Commission
provided complementary support, with a total of US$6 million in funding for electoral support,
youth employment, and rehabilitation of prisons and military barracks. These projects aimed at
serving as a catalyst for the reforms being provided by other donors as a confidence-building
effort for the national population.

During the EGRG series period, Guinea-Bissau enjoyed a period of relative macroeconomic
stability, with low inflation and resilient growth, although one should not attribute specific
outcomes to development policy operations. The maintenance of economic growth was
assisted by the rebound in the price of cashew exports, the strengthened liquidity of the banking
system, and sounder fiscal management during this period. Real GDP growth slipped slightly to
3.0 percent in 2009, down from 3.2 percent in 2008, before rebounding to 3.5 percent in 2010.
Inflation dropped from around 10 percent in 2008 to -1.6 percent in 2009 and 1.1 percent in 2010
(see Annex 8). Although rising prices for food and fuel imports began pushing headline inflation
up again in 2011, the core inflation remained subdued and the consumer price index (CPI) is now
projected to reach 4.8 percent by end- year.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

There were three Program Development Objectives (PDO) associated with these operations:
(i) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through
improved budget and public financial management (PFM); (ii) foster private sector development
mainly through the development of a modern legal framework for private investment and
improvements in the business environment; and (iii) improve specific aspects of the investment
climate, including streamline procedures for business registration and targeted reforms of the
legal framework5.

Key Indicators: There were 7 prior actions for EGRG-I and 9 prior actions in the follow up
EGRG-II. The medium to long term impact of these prior actions was measured, in turn, against
key expected outcome indicators. These key indicators totaled 17 in EGRG-I and EGRG-II.
These key indicators included indicators for public financial management (11) for EGRG-I and
10 for EGRG-II), as well as indicators for private sector development (6). The indicators on
public financial management consisted mainly of measures of improved performance in budget
execution, and compliance with new procedures and reporting, with several of these indicators
drawing from the findings of the 2008 PEFA assessment.6

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Reasons/Justification

The Project Development Objectives (PDO) for the public financial management block
remained unchanged during the two operations of this series. The PDO for private sector
development under the EGRG II was slightly different from the one defined in the EGRG I.

  PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability), is an integrated monitoring framework that allows
measurement of country Public Financial Management performance over time. It comprises six core dimensions of
PFM performance containing 31 indicators measuring the operational performance of the key elements of the PFM
systems. A rating that varies from ―A‖ (the highest score) to ―D‖ (the lowest score), is set for each one of the 31
indicators.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

There were some limited adjustments in the selection of prior actions for EGRG-II relative
to the triggers envisaged for this second operation at the time of the first operation,
EGRG-I. These adjustments were made to take into account exogenous factors not under control
of the Government, and where capacity constraints had affected the speed of program
implementation. Specifically, technical issues that had arisen in setting up the new payroll system
resulting in the postponement of the planned acquisition and installation of the system, and delays
in reaching a consensus between the executive and judiciary branches of government led to a
postponement of the reform of the Court of Accounts (Tribunal de Contas). Portugal offered to
finance the acquisition and installation of the new payroll system, and there was ultimately an
agreement on a medium-term program for strengthening the Court of Accounts in the context of
the dissemination of the PEMFAR, which detailed the required legal and operational reforms, as


                                                           7
well as of the supporting capacity building activities. The alternative reform chosen as a prior
action for the EGRG-II significantly strengthened oversight and control over public procurement
transactions.

The two triggers were originally designed as follows:
       Completion of the planned biometric survey of the civil service and substantial progress
        made in the implementation of the new payroll system as evidenced by the installation of
        the system and the inclusion in its database of personnel data for at least 75 percent of
        civil servants, and
       Submission to Parliament of the draft Law for the ―Tribunal de Contas‖ (Supreme Audit
        Institution) consistent with WAEMU directives.

These two prior actions were redrafted in the following way:
       Joint decision by the Recipient‘s Ministers of Finance and Public Administration Reform
        on the selection of an appropriate payroll IT system to be acquired, installed and
        integrated with SIGFIP and formal submission of their recommendation to the Recipient
        Council of Ministers; and
       The adoption by the Council of Ministers of: (i) a draft bill approving the new
        procurement code defining the regulatory and control functions thereof in line with
        WAEMU‘s procurement directives; and (ii) a decree establishing the Recipient‘s central
        procurement unit.

1.6 Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

There were two other significant changes that were captured in the actions supported by
the follow up operation to this series of grants. While the Investment Code was promulgated
at the end of 2009, the implementation process and the set of reforms to transform and modernize
the Investment Promotion Directorate of the Ministry of Economy were never initiated, leaving
investors without a clear set of rules to follow. The lack of capacity to manage a tax credit
system, specifically the lack of secondary regulation and the non-exemption of customs rates and
of the General Sales Tax (IGV) on imported capital goods, continued to impede new private
capital investment in the country. The government took advantage then of the redefinition of the
implementing regulations for the investment code to make the needed revisions. The Council of
Ministers created a special commission to review the investment code and propose adjustments to
it, and, with the support of the Bank, the special commission drafted a revised investment code
law that was adopted by the Council in May 2011.

The revised Investment Code maintained the principles of transparency, simplicity and
non-discrimination enshrined in the 2009 Investment Code and addressed three limitations
that prevented its successful implementation. First, it explicitly listed all possible fiscal
incentives and duty concessions available for potential investors. It eliminated the possibility of
granting new incentives by other laws, which Art. 9.7 of the 2009 investment code left open,
which enhanced transparency and eliminated the possibility of granting discriminatory fiscal
benefits. Second, in line with other countries in the region, it reintroduced duty concessions and
general sales tax exemptions for capital goods. Third, given Guinea-Bissau‘s weak tax
administration capacities the revised code introduced a set of incentives that are easier to manage
than the tax credit mechanism in the 2009 Investment Code. Specifically, the new code
introduced a gradually declining scale of deductions in the corporate income tax (Industrial


                                                8
Contribution) for the first five years of the investment, which were aligned with the draft of the
WAEMU investment code that is was expected to be adopted by 2012.

The revised code re-introduced an incentive for firms with a view to encourage training and
skill formation -- incentives particularly important for improving firm productivity.7 On
the negative side, the new code restored the role of the Investment Promotion Directorate of the
Ministry of Economy in the process of approval of projects, granting with it the power to allocate
tax incentives. On the positive side, the new Code limits the discretion of the Investment
Promotion Directorate and preserves the non discrimination rules for investments by size, sector
and region. Also, the Investment Promotion Directorate must decide in favor or against granting
the incentives within 30 days from the date the request is received. This decision must depend
exclusively on verification whether the requirements of the Code are satisfied. Finally, the
revised investment code defines more clearly the role of the Ministries of Economy and Finance
in the administration of tax incentives.

The second significant change was the preparation of a third EGRG grant: EGRG III.
Although this series of EGRGs was originally designed as a programmatic series of 2 operations,
a stand-alone grant followed the EGRGs series to support the reform drive that had gained further
momentum with sustained real GDP growth and the newly-found stability (both economic and
political). (This is newly-found stability is discussed further below in Section 2.1 Program
Performance). This additional EGRG grant (EGRG III), was not anticipated at the time of the
beginning of the series due to the 18-month coverage and funding limits under the ISN; as a result
a separate ICRR will be prepared.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

Overview: Overall the program performance was satisfactory, with a moderately
satisfactory performance in the quality at entrance stage more than compensated by a
satisfactory performance during the supervision stage. The ISR dated in December 2009,
rated the implementation performance as moderately unsatisfactory as progress in the
implementation of the policy actions was slow in the first six months after their adoption and the
impact on the performance indicators had not appeared. Nonetheless, the implementation of
these actions was accelerated in 2010 as part of the government efforts to achieve the HIPC
Completion Point at the end of 2010. Impacts on performance indicators became apparent in 2010
and were reflected in a smoother budget preparation and execution in 2010. As a result, the
implementation rating was upgraded to satisfactory.            Overall, there were significant
improvements in the frameworks for public financial management and for private sector
development. Also, the implementation of this series of grants coincided with the achievement
leading to the HIPC/MDRI completion point at end-2010, as well as a period of recovery in real
GDP growth, measurable progress in maintaining fiscal discipline, improvements in public
financial management, modernizing the public administration, improving the business
environment, and managing public debt. These achievements were possible above all because of
the peaceful democratic stability achieved during this period.

 This point is particularly important as the recent investment climate report found that Guinea-Bissau
companies are the ones that invest the least and less often in training – which obviously have important
implications for productivity.


                                                   9
EGRG-I:

The first component of the EGRG-I reflected the PRSP objectives of strengthening
governance, modernizing the public administration and improving public financial
management. Progress in this component was satisfactory, with good progress in laying the
groundwork for a stronger public financial management framework. Specific action completed
include the following: (i) a new Organic Framework of the State Budget was approved by the
Council of Ministers, (ii) the budget elaboration and execution modules of the SIGFIP system in
the budget units of the central administration to improve efficiency and transparency in budget
execution was installed; (iii) the new WAEMU-based budget classification was used to prepare
the 2009 budget proposal, improving and making more transparent the presentation of budget
allocations; and (iv) a General Finance Inspectorate control missions was carried out for the
payment of civil service wages inspecting personnel data at least half of all Ministries.8

Outcomes from the implementation of the prior actions became apparent only in 2010 and 2011.
Firstly, as the alignment of the Guinea-Bissau budget framework to the WAEMU directives was a
pending agenda for several years (from the late nineties when the country entered in the
WAEMU), the approval of the Organic Framework of the State Budget represented a significant
step towards the leap-frogging to the regional standards for budget management and the starting
point for the building up of a system of budget institutions needed for a transparent and efficient
expenditure management. The installation and operation of the SIGFIP preparation and execution
modules supported the institutional reforms included in the new organic framework of the state
budget and facilitated improvements in the timeliness of budget preparation and enabled the
country to adopt a more effective control on expenditure execution that favored the fiscal
adjustment policy adopted in the last years. The control missions carried out by the General
Finance Inspectorate made evident the need of centralizing the payroll and making compatible
different data bases on personnel paving the route of the unification of the payroll in 2011.

The second component of the EGRG-I aimed at improving the business environment to
provide the basis for economic growth, as outlined in several successive diagnostic studies and
consultations with stakeholders. Specific policy action completed included the adoption and
implementation of: (i) nine OHADA Acts of Business Laws (adopted in February 2008); (ii) an
Investment Code consistent with good international practices; (iii) a draft Public-Private
Partnership Law; (iv) the preparation of recommendations of the Commission on the
Simplification of Administrative Procedures; (v) a decree liberalizing the notary profession; and
(vi) the launching of a study on options for public-private partnership for the Port of Bissau.

As in the case of the reforms on PFM, the adoption of the OHADA acts and the approval of the
investment code were actions that enabled Guinea-Bissau to make compatible the national
legislation with WAEMU standards and turn more predictable the domestic investment climate.
The new investment code provided a level play field for investors, with benefits to be granted
with transparency and automaticity due to the elimination of discretionary treatment and the
multiplicity of regimes. The preparation of recommendations on the simplification of procedures
opened the agenda for the consistent improvement in the business climate that were reflected in
the latest Doing Business Report of 2012.

  This is a stop-gap measure to strengthen controls of the wage bill, by helping prune the payroll database from obvious
inconsistencies between entered data and actual physical presence of employees, ahead of a PARAP-supported
biometric census of the civil service, and the implementation of a unified payroll system/personnel management system.



                                                          10
EGRG-II:

The first component of the EGRG-II focused on the implementation of the public financial
management framework laid out during the first grant. The new Organic Framework of the
State Budget and complementary legislation were enacted regulating the role of the different
government entities responsible for budget formulation and execution. Also, the Integrated
System for Public Financial Management (SIGFIP) for the register and control of government
budget preparation and execution transactions was extended to the treasury, and customs
upgraded its computerized customs management system which covers most foreign trade
procedures (ASYCUDA++). Finally, the authorities adopted far reaching procurement reforms,
effectively leap-frogging to the standards and institutions of their faster reforming neighbors. In
this context, the government approved a new Public Procurement Law in June 2010 to harmonize
procedures with the standards of the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and
it passed additional measures to strengthen enforcement of the code and facilitate monitoring of
procurement transactions. The new system created the Procurement Regulatory Authority
(ARCP) with external oversight responsibilities, as well as a Central Procurement Unit (UCP)
that aimed at replacing individual procurement units for line ministries.

The prior actions supported by the EGRG-II enabled the operation new Organic Framework of
the State Budget. The definition of roles and the reorganization of the agencies responsible for the
budget cycle management were instrumental for the actual adoption of the new budget
framework. In this regard, important progress was obtained in the separation of control and
budget execution functions. These actions needed to be complemented by the preparation of
manuals for budget execution at the line ministries levels. Reforms on public procurement also
enabled the separation of roles between the execution agencies and the regulatory authority.

In the second component of the EGRG-II, the government took important steps to simplify
business opening and closing procedures. Specifically, it adopted measures simplifying
procedures for business registration, significantly reducing the number of administrative steps
needed in these processes. Also, it established a one-stop-shop for business registration,
supporting more rapid private-sector-led growth and boosting job creation, and it enacted a legal
framework for the telecom sector that fosters competition and transparency.

The simplification of business registration procedures had enjoyed a quick implementation as the
government selected this area as one of its main priorities in 2010. Results were immediate as
reflected in the impressive reduction of days and procedures needed to register a firm. Facing
severe resource constraints, the one-stop-shop was inaugurated in May 2011. An increasing
number of registers has been observed since the beginning of its operation.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Five sets of factors – mostly positive -- affected the implementation of these operations.
They were:

   The EGRG development policy grants were supported by the complementary efforts of
    the World Bank and the IMF (see more in the paragraph on donor coordination below).
    The collaboration between the two institutions happened at the design and, most importantly,
    at the implementation stages of these operations. Also, the prospect of attainment of the
    HIPC completion point provided an additional motivation for the government, which was
    used appropriately to accelerate the reform process.




                                                11
      This EGRG development policy grant series was informed by the conclusions and
       recommendations of an extensive body of analytical work conducted over several years.
       This body of analytical work included core diagnostic assessments by the World Bank in
       collaboration with the government and other donors as well as various studies conducted by
       the government with donor support. The studies comprised: (i) the 2005 and 2006 Public
       Expenditure Reviews, as well as the 2006 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
       (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), which documented fiscal
       policy issues as well as the numerous weaknesses in PFM and provided a range of
       recommendations on the legal framework and operational approaches for reforms, including
       the adoption of WAEMU directives on PFM in national law and the installation of an
       integrated PFM system; and (ii) various FIAS studies and project documents and aide-
       memoire of the IDA-financed private sector PSRD Project, which have provided analytical
       background and specific recommendations on business environment reforms, the investment
       code and other PSD reforms. Project-related studies, as well as early input from a planned
       Investment Climate Assessment, have all confirmed the crucial roles of political and
       macroeconomic instability, business environment and infrastructure deficits as impediments
       to private investment. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study also highlighted red tape and
       related petty corruption as a barrier to private activity and investment. In addition, the 2009
       PEMFAR drew on an early 2009 EU-supported Public Expenditure Financial Accountability
       (PEFA) providing: (a) an updated diagnostic analysis of the current strengths and weaknesses
       in the country‘s public financial management system and practices, including public
       procurement; (b) a considerable range of inputs for the design and preparation of PFM and
       public procurement reforms; and (c) a rating of all key components of the PFM and
       procurement system against international benchmarks which, in principle, was designed to be
       used to judge future progress of PFM reforms.

      Donor coordination. The window of opportunity opened by the end-2009 elections and the
       popular support for peace and stability following the April 2010 temporary imprisonment of
       the Prime Minister created the momentum for Guinea Bissau‘s development partners to
       coalesce in support of the civilian government.9 This support was provided by the African
       Development Bank, the UNDP, the Bank (IDA), the IMF, the regional economic
       organizations (WAEMU, ECOWAS, the BCEAO), the West African Development Bank, and
       bilateral donors, including Angola, Portugal, Spain and France, 10 the Community of
       Lusophone Countries,11 and, at times, by the European Commission. These donors aligned
       their support on the policy platform and performance assessments of the IMF-supported
       program, ensuring better coordination and information sharing.

      Resilience to external shocks. Economic growth performance was solid and the country was
       been able to weather relatively well the effects of the global crisis. Implementation of the
       EGRGs was impacted both positively and negatively by external factors, notably by the
       improvement in the terms of trade. Favorable commodity prices for Guinea-Bissau‘s chief
       exports, cashew nuts, contribute positively to economic growth and macroeconomic
       performance in 2008 and 2010. The country was negatively affected, however, by several

 This popular support is believed to have reflected the desire of the population to preserve the gains
achieved by orderly and regular salary payments to the civil service, which were funded in part by the
EGRGs.

     There was also occasional participation from Japan, Libya, and Turkey, amongst others.

                                                      12
    exogenous factors, including the fall of cashew prices and the drought in late-2009 that
    affected the cashew nut harvest, the sharp increases in food and oil prices, and the slower
    than expected rich-world recovery from the global financial crisis.

   Relatively political stability. Despite the setbacks mentioned above, the relatively political
    stability observed since 2009 allowed a consistent reform effort on the areas of PFM and
    PSD. Despite the incidents of April 2010, the technical teams at the Ministry of Finance and
    the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Integration enjoyed an stable environment
    and support from the higher decision levels, that enabled them to design and implement the
    reforms supported by the EGRG series without interruptions.

   The sustainability of the EGRG-I and II outcomes are however challenged in case
    support from development partners do not continue compensating for the country’s
    limited financial and implementation capacity. Donor support is needed to provide
    required funding for new and ongoing activities, as well as hands-on technical assistance
    aimed at raising the skills in public administration.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design: Beginning with the preparation of the EGRG-I the IDA team had worked in close
collaboration with the government and its development partners to ensure adequate monitoring
and evaluation of the program. The existing institutional structure for the PRSP process was
expected to implement and monitor the policy reforms supported by this EGRG development
policy grant. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, jointly with the Project
Implementation Unit for the PSRDP, were to assume overall responsibility for coordinating the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the policy matrix, and were ultimately responsible
for reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned Ministries and agencies.
The government‘s policy matrix identified ministerial departments for each policy reform and
benchmark outcome indicators. The Council of Ministers provided overall guidance for the
budget support program. Finally, periodic stakeholder consultations served to provide additional
feedback on the impact of the proposed operation and the limited number of active development
partners providing budget support should have allowed for easy coordination and monitoring of
actions and progress reviews of the implementation of the policy matrix.

M&E Implementation: The implementation of this M&E as designed did not work very well in
practice. The M&E framework designed for the PRSP was weak and did not provide useful
indicators in the areas covered in the EGRGs series. IDA remained nevertheless engaged
throughout the process, continuing to work alongside Government and other participating
development partners in the monitoring of implementation and helping determine adjustments to
the policy matrix. The time that elapsed between the two grants within the series was too short
however to develop the needed statistical capacity for this M&E function. By the completion of
this EGRG series, therefore, the M&E system continued to be challenged by severe capacity
constraints, and by the postponement of donor-funded and executed reports designed to provide
progress benchmarks for the achievements under these grants, such as the preparation of a more
recent installment of the PEFA report.

M&E Utilization: The EGRGs were designed to encourage the utilization of M&E results. For
instance, by drawing on the findings of the Doing Business Report to monitor progress in private
sector development, it was anticipated that IDA and the Government‘s allocation of resources
would increasingly begin to reflect the feedback provided through the M&E results. This appears
to be the case with the design of the next Private Sector Development (PSD) project and the use


                                               13
of these indicators in design of the PRSP II. The immediate impact of the M&E framework
appears to have been limited, notwithstanding the measurable progress in some of the indicators
being monitored and the usefulness of these results for guiding ongoing and future policy
reforms.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Despite encouraging progress achieved on the economic and institutional fronts in the
EGRG I and II, Guinea-Bissau continues to face extraordinary short- and medium-term
development challenges typical of a fragile state. The ISN highlighted how, recent progress
towards macroeconomic stabilization notwithstanding, Guinea-Bissau remains locked in a low-
equilibrium trap of continued political instability, weak governance and disappointing economic
performance. The 2009 ISN also argued that donors, including the Bank, would need to continue
to remain engaged and move further on a strategy capable of effectively continuing to support
systemic change. When additional IDA funds became available in late 2010, the Bank prepared a
third EGRG designed to continue supporting the reforms begun in this series EGRG.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives, design, and implementation of these operations were highly relevant to
current country and global priorities, and to the Bank‘s assistance strategy, in the following way:

EGRG Objectives: As discussed in Section 1.2, Original Program Development Objectives
above, the EGRGs‘ development objectives were highly relevant as they focused on two key
pillars of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (NPRSP) covering the period 2007-
2010. In particular, the EGRGs were instrumental in paving the way to the country‘s
achievement of the HIPC Completion Point and in enabling the country to perform satisfactorily
in the IMF EPCA and ECF programs as a number of triggers for the HIPC Completion Point
were related to improvements in PFM and to the improvement of the country macroeconomic
situation. In addition, the EGRGs‘ objectives of fostering private sector development are viewed
as a pre-requisite to reignite economic growth, create employment opportunities and reduce
poverty.

EGRG Design: The design of these operations was highly relevant to Guinea-Bissau and the
implementation of NPRSP. This series of operations was central to the strategy outlined in the
May 2009 Interim Strategy Note for Guinea-Bissau and designed to support the reforms initiated
by the State and Peace Building Fund (SPF), the Technical Assistance (TA) for Economic
Governance and Public Financial Management (PFM), and the Private Sector Rehabilitation and
Development Project (PSRDP), and then followed up by the 2009 IMF-supported EPCA
(Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance) program. These initiatives had generated significant and
encouraging results in public financial management (PFM) and investment climate reforms, so it
was followed by the launching of this series as well as by an IMF-supported ECF (Extended
Credit Facility) program for the period 2010-2012. In the meantime, the government had also
committed to a rapid attainment of the HIPC completion point and to adjust the macroeconomic
program to address exogenous shocks.

As noted previously, the reform program associated with this operation was also highly
relevant to Guinea-Bissau’s own development priorities and circumstances. It was built


                                                14
directly on the Government‘s NPRSP, thus ensuring ownership by drawing on the Government‘s
own priorities, and guided by the more specific findings of several analytical studies that outlined
in greater detail the agenda for reform. Also, by channeling resources through the budget, instead
of through projects where Government decision-making is limited, the EGRs fostered decision-
making by the Council of Ministers and, in particular, Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Economy and the Ministry of Public Administration Reform. This decision-making authority
gave, as a result, these entities some stake in the institutional reform agenda that aimed at
enshrining the principles of sound financial management and a business-friendly environment,
while in the process enhancing democratic accountability.

The number of prior actions was appropriately limited to less than 10 (7 for EGRG-I and 9
for EGRG-II). As seen in Tables 2 and 3 above, these prior actions show a consistent unfolding
of a reform package designed to support more disciplined public financial management and to
foster more responsive business environment, thus ensuring a high level of continuity from
operation to operation. Program design also incorporated the ―Good Practice Principles on
Conditionality‖ (see Annex 9), which were informed by both the general lessons learned from the
Bank‘s involvement with fragile states, as well as by sound principles of good governance and
democratic participation.

While modest in their objectives, the EGRG I and II, as well as the follow up operation
(EGRG-III), focused on promoting incremental institutional development, they were also
highly selective with focus on a small number of reforms feasible to be implemented in a
complex political situation, with weak institutional and technical capacity. In this context,
the delivery of budget support through these operations allowed greater predictability of inflows
of financial support and enhanced the Government fiscal management. Following the
recommendations of the new Africa Strategy, these two operations aimed at capturing the
synergies and benefiting from technical cooperation with other agencies, such as the European
Union, the IMF and the AfDB, by taking advantage of the comparative advantages of these
agencies in specific policy areas.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

PDO Achievements: In the case of 4 PDO indicators in EGRG-I and 3 PDO indicators in
EGRG-II, there was no data available to measure their performance. These were indicators
relating to public financial management, and included: (i) orderliness of and participation in the
annual budget process; (ii) effectiveness of internal control for non-salary expenditures; (iii)
classification of the budget; and (iv) effectiveness of payroll controls. Their performance against
the 2008 baseline targets was to be measured by another PEFA survey but the last PEFA survey
conducted for Guinea-Bissau was in 2008. Nonetheless, progress on these areas has been strong
and was reflected in: budget proposals have been timely submitted to the Parliament since 2010;
improvements in budget execution controls led to a drastic reduction of arrears; regular issuance
of quarterly budget execution reports since mid 2010; elimination of ghost and double dippers
workers from the payroll; unification of the government payroll; and strong reduction of the
government payroll as reflected by the fall in the payroll to domestic revenue ratio from 100
percent in 2008 to 70 percent in 2011.In the case of 10 PDO indicators for EGRG-I and 3 PDO
indicators for EGRG-II, targets were 100 percent achieved. These were PDO indicators relating
to: (i) the legal framework for procurement; (ii) the percentage of civil servants registered in the
unified payroll system; and (iii) the legal framework for the telecommunications sector. And in



                                                15
the case of the one PDO indicator for EGRG-I and one PDO indicator for the EGRG-II, the
outcome measured exceeded their target. These were indicators relating, respectively, to the
number of quarterly budget execution reports prepared during one year and the number of days to
register a business.

The causal links between policy actions supported by these operations and outcomes were
as follows:
With the support of the EGRG-I:
      The adoption of the Organic Law for the Budget improved orderliness and
       participation in the annual budget process;

      The installation of the budget elaboration and execution modules of the SIGFIP
       allowed the reduction in the time in the preparation of the budget so that Parliament
       approval of the budget could be secured before the beginning of the fiscal year as
       envisioned in applicable laws and regulations;

      The adoption of the draft 2009 budget under the new WAEMU-based budget
       classification aligned Guinea-Bissau with the other WAEMU countries and ensured the
       synchronization of budget expenditure categories with multilateral surveillance
       procedures;

      The authorization for the General Finance Inspectorate to control the payment of
       salaries of civil servants provided the basis for eventually establishing the government‘s
       unified payroll system;

      The adoption of the nine OHADA (Organization for the Harmonization of Business
       Law in Africa) acts of business law consolidated the prevailing tax incentive schemes,
       making the payment of taxes more automatic and transparent;

      The adoption of a new investment code replaced the obsolete 1991 investment code
       and ensured that investment incentives would be considered automatically, thus
       removing the discretion that could be exercised by government officials under the
       old law. With the new investment code there was no discrimination among projects on
       the basis of size, reducing the multiplicity of investment regimes and mitigating the
       potential for tax fraud and evasion; and

      The adoption by the Council of Ministers of the draft Public-Private Partnerships
       (PPP) Law aimed at establishing clear statutes on public-private partnerships, fostering
       transparency and competition in awarding PPP contracts.

With the support of the EGRG-II:
      The enactment of the Organic Law for the Budget enshrined in the law the
       commitment to orderliness and participation in the annual budget process that had already
       been initiated during the EGRG-I period;

      The definition of the organization, attributions and functioning of the Financial
       Controller, as well as the roles and responsibilities of credit managers, enhanced the
       quality and efficiency in the management of public funds by ensuring greater credibility,
       completeness, transparency and control in carrying out budgetary operations;




                                              16
         The issuance of a manual of procedures for budget execution to be used by the
          spending ministries ensured that the budget was executed in line with what had been
          envisioned in the budget law;

         The completion of the planned biometric survey of civil servants was an important
          step toward the implementation of the new unified payroll system;

         The submission to Parliament of the draft Law for the “Tribunal de Contas?
          (Supreme Audit Institution) consistent with WAEMU directive strengthen oversight and
          control over public procurement transactions;

         The adoption by the Council of Ministers of a decree simplifying procedures for
          business registration and the establishment of the one-stop shop for business
          registration streamlined the process of business registration, resulting in a remarkable
          increase in the number of companies created; and

         The liberalization of the telecommunications sector ushered the entry of three mobile
          phone operators in the Guinea-Bissau market that were instrumental in creating many
          jobs and expanding the access to telecom services to more than 300,000 users.

There was satisfactory performance in the implementation of the two components of the
EGRG series laying the groundwork for an agenda of additional reforms supported in the
follow up operations (e.g., EGRG-III). While four outcome indicators were meet, one fell short
of its objective, and in the other three cases progress could not be properly measured because the
necessary reports were not available, qualitative evidence indicates that progress was made on
these measures as well. Examples include the fact that: (i) all public revenues are now accounted
in the general budget; (ii) treasury management has been strengthened through the establishment
of an independent treasury committee; (iii) the Ministry of Finance is now able to produce a
monthly account ledger and monthly synthetic government financial accounts; (iv) an action plan
was drawn to reform the public procurement system in six large spending ministries (education,
health, agriculture, infrastructure, finance and defense); and (v) establishing the principle of the
clear separation of responsibility between budget executors and payment officers that is at the
core of the WAEMU public financial management model. When these results are super imposed
on the PEFA PFM performance measurement framework, Guinea-Bissau would have improved
its scores in 6 of the 28 PEFA performance indicators. Improvements would be recorded in: (i)
the budget classification; (ii) public access to budget information; (iii) orderliness and
participation in the annual budget process; (iv) effectiveness of payroll controls; (v) timeliness
and regularity of accounts reconciliation; and (vi) quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating:
EGRG I - Satisfactory
EGRG II - Satisfactory

The EGRGs’ objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes were highly relevant to the
country’s difficult circumstances and its development priorities, as well as being consistent
with the Bank strategies and goals in fragile states. Despite the worsened global scenario, at
the macroeconomic level, real GDP growth was at or above 3.0 percent in 2009 and 2010,
allowing for a modest increase in GDP per capita. Fiscal and external deficits were substantially


                                                 17
reduced and inflation has been kept under control, prudent macroeconomic management allowed
the country to perform satisfactorily under the IMF‘s EPCA and ECF programs. PFM reforms
contributed to build confidence on budget institutions through enhanced efficiency, transparency
and accountability. Guinea Bissau was able to achieve the HIPC/MDRI completion point after 11
years of stop and go reforms. Given the continued political instability endured by the country,
this was a remarkable achievement.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

The main achievement beyond the completion of the policy actions supported by this EGRG
series was reaching the HIPC/MDRI completion point. This achievement crowned the efforts
made before and during the EGRG period, assisting the country achieve a modicum of stability
and debt sustainability. Most importantly, the reward permitted Guinea-Bissau and its partners
shift their focus toward meeting the enormous challenges of regaining what was lost over the past
conflict-afflicted decades.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICRR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating:
Substantial

The risk to development outcomes is judged as significant, primarily because of the difficult
and unstable political situation. Elections due in 2012 could lead to further instability, while
the drug trade represents a continued threat to the rule of law and good governance. Reforms may
be undermined by vested interests, including the private commercial interests of members of the
government.

In addition, the lack of computer equipment undermined some PFM reforms. These
constraints lead to the duplication of certain tasks, and made it difficult to prepare management
accounts and the general accounts of the state. To mitigate this problem, the follow up operation
to this series (EGRG-III) supported the implementation of SIGFIP -- a computerizing the
accounting management process designed to ensure an adequate communication between the
budget preparation and execution modules with a view to guaranteeing the accuracy of
expenditure reports.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating:


                                                18
EGRG-I: Satisfactory
EGRG-II: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry is rated as Satisfactory for EGRG I and II.
As discussed in Section 3.1, (Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation) above, these
operations were highly relevant to Guinea-Bissau and Bank priorities and demonstrate what can
be achieved when development agencies engage in a concerted fashion with fragile states. The
program of reforms agreed with the Government was selected amongst the country‘s own
priorities, with a view to identify measures that were technically ready, and benefitting from
extensive analytical work and timely technical assistance. An example of this timely technical
assistance was the one provided by the team established by the State and Peace-Building Fund
(SPBF), who was assisted in activities ranging from the computerization master plan of the
ministry, budget and treasury operations, customs, debt management, the establishment of the
civil service data base, and the preparation of legislation to support the reform process. The
reforms supported were also politically achievable, benefitting from numerous consultations with
stakeholders and internal governmental discussions.           Finally, most measures built on
governments‘ longstanding commitments towards regional integration in the context of WAEMU
(West Africa Economic and Monetary Union) and OHADA (Organization for the Harmonization
of Business Law in Africa), which mitigates risks of reversibility. Extensive analytical work was
completed prior to, and during, this series of grants, contributing to building consensus with
government and amongst development agencies.

The funding mechanism used was central to the Bank’s strategy for Guinea Bissau, as it
provided predictable and tangible support tailored to the country’s circumstances and
capabilities. As noted below, the EGRG I and II (see Annex 9) explicitly incorporated the good
practice principles on conditionality into program design and implementation, as well as the
lessons learned from the Bank‘s involvement with fragile states. The Bank took a very strong
role in working with the Government while also working closely and cooperatively with other
DPs on private sector development and capacity building in public financial management. The
Bank's non-lending services were coordinated with those of the other DPs to ensure
complementarity and avoid duplication. The Bank and the Fund closely coordinated their policy
advice to the Guinea-Bissauan authorities and collaborated closely in terms of joint support for
the implementation of the NPRSP (e.g., the 2010 Joint Staff Advisory Note on the NPRSP).
Consistent with standard practice on such operations, the IMF led the policy dialogue on
macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and monetary policy, while the Bank led the policy
dialogue on economic reforms in sectors such as: (i) public financial management and (ii) private
sector development. Finally, there was strong staff continuity, including at the team leader level,
with the Lead Economist in charge of the two operations working in co-TTLship with more
junior staff. In doing so, the Bank was able to preserve the ―institutional memory‖ associated
with these operations, as well as strengthen the working relationships with the Government and
other development agencies.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Rating:
EGR-I: Satisfactory
EGR-II: Satisfactory




                                                19
Bank supervision was Satisfactory for the EGRG-I and the EGRG II. Supervision took place
in a difficult environment, with the team endeavoring and succeeding in resolving
implementation difficulties in a timely manner. There were 3 supervision missions, which in the
case of the EGRG-I overlapped with the preparation of the EGRG-II. The missions for the
EGRG-II occurred at the time of the preparation of the concept note, just before the ROC
meetings and at appraisal. These missions were aligned with both the activities of other donors
and the Government‘s own calendar, providing a common basis for discussion and evaluation,
facilitating and strengthening coordination. Supervision suffered however from the grants‘
inadequate monitoring and evaluation framework, although the lack of PEFA reports was
somewhat offset by further analytical work on public financial management in the context of the
PEMFAR and the DTIS.

The creation of a group of experts at the Ministry of Finance funded by the World Bank
under the State and Peace-Building Fund (SPBF) played a leading role in the reform
process. They were responsible for the computerization master plan of the ministry, covering
budget and treasury operations, customs, debt management and the civil service data base, and
also all of the preparation of legislation to support the reform process.

The difficulties of working in Guinea Bissau should not be underestimated, however. The
first DPO mission was cancelled because of a rocket launched in Bissau that prompted the
evacuation of the IMF team. Three months later, the second World Bank mission was evacuated
because of the president‘s assassination.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating:
EGRG-I and II: Satisfactory

The Bank’s overall performance is rated as Satisfactory for EGRG-I and EGRG-II. The
performance for quality at entry was rated as moderately satisfactory, while the performance for
supervision was rated as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Note: According to the ICRR Guidelines, if Government and the implementing agency are
indistinguishable, particularly for DPG operations, a rating and justification is provided
only for Overall Borrower Performance.

Rating:
EGRG-I – Moderately Satisfactory
EGRG-II – Moderately Satisfactory

The Government’s overall performance is rated as moderately satisfactory for EGRG-I and
EGRG-II. The performance for quality at entry and for supervision was rated as moderately
satisfactory. ICRR Guidelines (Appendix A) identify seven criteria for rating Government
performance, and the overall Government performance is rated as acceptable on five of these
criteria:




                                              20
      Government ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives
       was moderately satisfactory, despite being constrained by the country’s internal
       conflicts. Most importantly, the country was motivated by the prospect of reaching the
       HIPC/MDRI completion point. In this context, the EGR I and II can be seen as a catalyst
       for implementing some of the reforms that had been defined earlier in jointly prepared
       analytical studies.
      Stakeholders and civil society organizations were consulted at the time of the
       launching of the PRSP, with consultations held in Bissau and in regional outposts. Also,
       the Government dissemination of the 2010 APR findings on PRSP allowed stakeholders
       to provide feedback aimed at informing decision-making of the program through
       workshops organized in all the 8 regions of the country. Where the PRSP lacked the
       specificity necessary to be translated into an action plan for reforms, the Government,
       stakeholders, and development agencies relied on more technical documents, such as the
       2009 PEMFAR and early drafts of the 2010 CEM.
      The Government was able to draw on the team established by the SPF grant to assist
       in the implementation of the reforms, including the harmonizing the domestic legislation
       with WAEMU legislation, the setting up the necessary IT infrastructure, and the
       preparation of quarterly budget execution reports and quarterly financial statements.
      The Government was able to resolve most implementation issues on a timely basis;
       thanks to the good relations between the Government and the Bank and between the Bank
       and the other development agencies.
      The Government’s relationships and coordination with the Bank and other
       development agencies were satisfactory, with the agenda for reforms articulated in the
       2009 Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR)
       prepared jointly with the AfDB, the EU and the World Bank. This early agenda outlined
       in the PEMFAR and then further elaborated in the preparation of the 2011 Country
       Economic Memorandum (CEM) provided the basis for a common understanding of the
       reforms that needed to be implemented, helping to forge a consensus for action by
       Government and support from the development agencies.

There were concerns during the supervision process, nevertheless, because:
      Fiduciary arrangements remained weak. While some important progress was
       achieved in public financial management during the period of the EGR I and II, with
       some key reforms almost implemented, the internal control environment in Guinea-
       Bissau remains weak.
      The Government’s Monitoring and Evaluation framework never became fully
       operational. The indicators identified in Table 2 were to rely on reports prepared jointly
       by the Government and development agencies (such as the PEFA report), which meant
       that the reports were not produced with the regularity required to guide the actions
       supported by the EGRG series.




                                              21
6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

       Outcome indicators should not depend on future reports for which funding is not
        assured. The heavy reliance on PEFA indicators was unfortunate since it turned out that
        the PEFA assessment could not be updated.
       EGRGs were useful in maintaining an agenda for reforms that had benefited from
        analytical and operational work done ahead of time and for which technical
        assistance and project support were available. Reforms that had been identified and
        understood well ahead of time helped secure support among development agencies. This
        consensus building exercise remains important, as is the analytical work that supported it,
        because Guinea-Bissau will continue to require outside support and to have in place a
        strong multi-year reform program.
       The EGRGs experience highlighted the importance of complementary technical
        assistance in a fragile state environment. Many of the reforms aimed at supporting
        PFM and private sector development were possible because, in parallel with the budget
        support, the World Bank Group (including IFC), provided technical assistance crucially
        given the country‘s weak institutional capacity to achieve results. These included the
        State and Peace Building Fund (SPF), the Technical Assistance for Economic
        Governance and Public Financial Management, the Private Sector Rehabilitation and
        Development Project (PSRDP), and the EU‘s Public Sector Reform Support Project. A
        substantial share of what was achieved under the EGRGs was due to the ability to draw
        on the team established by the SPF grant to assist in the implementation of the reforms.
       The EGRGs were useful in compensating for the unpredictability of annual aid
        flows from more politically motivated sources of support. This was particularly true in
        light of the decision by the European Commission to withhold its budget support to
        Guinea-Bissau in 2010.
       By channeling resources through the budget, instead of through projects, where
        Government decision-making and implementation of the government structural
        reform agenda are limited, the EGRGs instrument helped foster decision-making
        within Government. In the case of Guinea-Bissau, the EGRGs encouraged a sense of
        normalcy that allowed instances within government (e.g., the Council of Ministers, the
        Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Public Administration
        Reform) to exercise their decision-making authority because these entities had a stake in
        the institutional reform agenda aimed at enshrining the principles of sound financial
        management and a business-friendly environment.
       The EGRG series benefited from a mutually reinforcing partnership between the
        World Bank and the IMF that combined efforts to attain macroeconomic stability
        with needed structural reforms in areas ranging from education and health to
        public financial management and private sector development. The collaboration
        between the two institutions helped craft an implementable reform agenda that combined
        extensive technical assistance and funding, supported by a continuity of involvement
        during the most challenging times during this period. This partnership was important to
        seize a window of opportunity when Guinea-Bissau was able to reach the HIPC/MDRI
        completion point, with the IMF overseeing the implementation of actions aimed at
        ensuring macroeconomic stability, while the Bank provided needed budget support, and
        the technical assistance needed for producing and monitoring fiscal outcomes.

After having read the Implementation Completion and Results Report for the EGRG I and II, I
would to express the following opinion:

I agree with the content of the report for the following reasons:
   i.   These two operations were crucial in supporting the country' efforts toward the
        achievement of the Completion HIPIC point as well as for the achievement of good fiscal
        performance in the last three years.
  ii.   Specifically, these two budget support operations helped the country in the
        implementation of a set of cross-cutting reforms in the following areas: Governance,
        public administration and macroeconomic stability; public finance management and
        investment climate.

                 Annex 7: Key Risks Identified in the EGRG I and II

There were five main risks to the implementation of the reform program supported by this
EGRG series:
      Political risks and policy slippage. Political instability could flare up again and
       commitment to fiscal stabilization and to reforms, which has been demonstrated in the
       recent past, could come under pressure either from within or from outside the winning
       political party. This risk is especially true if tangible benefits of reforms do not become
       apparent to the population, or if costs of reform to narrow constituencies become too high.
       To mitigate these risks, the UN and several donors supported the country in its political
       transition (see the ISN for a more in depth discussion of this risk). Also, reforms
       supported by these operations were chosen carefully in the government‘s own PRSP,
       among measures that were technically ready (having benefitted from extensive analytical
       work and proven technical assistance) and politically achievable (having benefitted from
       numerous consultations with stakeholders and internal governmental discussions). Most
       measures build on government‘s longstanding commitments towards regional integration
       in the context of WAEMU and OHADA, which mitigates risks of reversibility.
      Macroeconomic risk. A slower than expected recovery from the global slowdown could
       have undermined the country‘s already challenging stabilization efforts which relied
       heavily on high and sustained donor support. The government‘s sustained commitment
       to fiscal stabilization was a potential risk, as the cash position of the government
       remained extraordinarily tight. The EGRGs financial support was itself a crucial element
       in enabling the government to meet its financial obligations and execute its budget.
       Given the vulnerability to exogenous shocks and the volatile global environment, the
       IMF and IDA staffs monitored the economic environment and macroeconomic
       performance closely with a view to providing assistance to the country in case needed.
       An additional risk was the failure of the IMF-supported program to materialize (itself the
       result of possible reform backsliding) or a lack of supply response from the private sector.
       The track record of the successive governments in Guinea-Bissau was taken into account,
       as the Bissauan performance under the IMF program had been mixed, owing primarily to
       exogenous and political shocks. The positive news was that the government was
       committed to accelerate efforts toward the attainment of the HIPC completion point.
      Capacity constraints. Public sector capacity constraints constituted another major
       challenge to successful implementation of the reform program. The proposed operation
       sought to mitigate this risk in several ways: first, the operation focused coverage on
       selected policy reform areas and narrow number of reform measures; second, it
       emphasized building on ongoing initiatives as opposed to introducing new ones; and third,
       it relied extensively on Bank and other donors‘ instruments for alleviating capacity
       constraints, including a State and Peace building Fund (SPF) grant. The track record with
       both PFM and PSD reforms indicated that progress on capacity building was possible but
       required a long term donor engagement and sustained government‘s political
       commitment.
      Fiduciary risk. The financial management assessment had concluded that fiduciary risks
       were substantial mainly because of political instability and governance issues. This risk
       was mitigated, however, by focusing the proposed grant on the improvement in fiduciary
       standards and continued IDA and other donors‘ assistance in public financial
       management and public administration reforms designed to help improve the budget
       execution processes.

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The reform agenda underpinning the proposed operation is rooted in both the fundamental
commitments of successive governments towards regional integration (under the West African
Economic and Monetary Union and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Laws in
Africa) and on the country‘s own PRSP which was prepared through a highly participatory and
consultative process. For the latter, stakeholder consultative workshops and focus group
discussions were held with representatives of the public and private sectors and civil society,
down to the level of local communities. There has also been extensive analytical work which has
informed policy formulation, and further consultation exercises, such as a 2007 Public-Private
Forum.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
There are only a limited number of financial partners involved in providing budget support,
facilitating joint understanding of areas of common and special interest. A framework agreement
among donors providing budget support has been set up to ensure better coordination and
information sharing. The 2009 PEMFAR also provided an important opportunity for enhancing
collaboration with other donors aligning donor technical assistance on the country‘s key PFM
reform priorities.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
country circumstances
The policy matrix was developed in close coordination with the government, thus ensuring that it
reflects the government‘s expressed policy intentions and the country circumstances – including
weak capacity for policy formulation and implementation. The design of policy reforms has been
backed by analytical work and technical assistance in place. Most of the reforms are longstanding
and ongoing government initiatives which were prioritized in the PRSP. Donor coordination on
the budget support has reduced transaction costs and the expected timing of the IDA
disbursement is aligned with the government‘s domestic budgeting process.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
Prior actions for the proposed grant focus on a selected number of measures that are critical to
achieving the objectives of the government‘s reform program.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support
The existing institutional structures for the PRSP processes were used to implement and monitor
the policy reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation. The limited number
of active development agencies providing budget support allowed coordination and monitoring of
actions and progress reviews of the implementation of the policy matrix. After the disbursement
of the grant tranches, IDA continued working with the government and other participating
development agencies to monitor implementation and help determine whether adjustments to the
policy matrix needed to be made to take into account the country developments, stakeholder
support and alternative options for realizing the intended development goals.
