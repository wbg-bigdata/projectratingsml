MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL. BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOPRS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF POLAND
WITH A GUARANTEE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR AN AGROINI)USTRIES EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) with a guarantee from the Republic of Poland
for US$100 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposcd loan
would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturiLy including five years
grace to help finance an agroindustries export development project.
2.           Background.  As noted in the latest Country Brief, the environment
for effecting real reform has recently greatly improved and the new Government
has initiated measures aimed at moving towards a market-oriented economy with
a view to improving the efficiency and productivity of the economy, promoting
growth, and improving socioeconomic conditions. In this context, deposit and
lending interest rates have been liberalized. On January 1, 1990, the zloty
was devalued and exchange rates unified, and administrative price controls
were removed on most goods and services. Major progress on tax reform is
expected in the first quarter of 1990. These measures are part of a
comprehensive macroeconomic/stabilization program that has recently been
agreed with the IMF. In the short term, high priority is being accorded to
sharply reducing the rate of inflation, mitigating the country's severe
external debt problem and beginning the process of restoring the country's
creditworthiness. In the longer term, priorities in the economy will focus on
restructuring, including the development of a strong private sector both
through fostering new private sector initiatives and through privatization of
existing public-sector enterprises.
3.          Agriculture is important for the Polish economy and plays a major
role in trade and employment. Its share in CNP has remained stable at about
13% over the last ten years, and the sector accounts for 15% of convertible
currency (CC) exports (as compared with only 3% of "transferable ruble"
exports) and for 28% of total employment. In terms of gross value of
agricultural production in 1988, the crop subsector contributed about 54% and
the livestock subsector about 46%. About 77% of the agricultural land,
totalling about 14.5 million hectares, is controlled by the private sector,
compared to about 23% which is under the control of the socialized sector.
The distribution of land between the two sectors is roughly in about the same
proportion as their share in total output. Within the socialized sector, the
state farms generate about 80% of the output compared to the cooperatives'
share of about 20%.  The food processing industry subsector is handicapped by
outmoded technology and inadequate capacity, which are constraints on
increasing its share in existing export markets and penetrating new markets.
Furthermore, the present extreme scarcity of foreign exchange is causing a
critical shortage of agricultural inputs, particularly protein feed for
livestock, which is threatening a decrease in supplies of raw materials to
processors and a disruption in the transition to a market economy.



- 2 -
4.           The Government's main long-term objectives for the sector are to
improve productivity of land and labor and increase the sector's contribuLion
to the trade balance. Improvement in productivity, which was constrained in
the past by a policy of controlled agricultural prices, and an inadequate
system of support services, has received a significant incentive recently with
the liberalization of most agricultural prices, and the significant role being
given to market mechanisms. Further improvement in the sector's performance,
however, would require fundamental changes in the agrarian structure (e.g.,
consolidation of land holdings and mechanization and adoption of other
labor-saving technologies); adoption of advanced technology; demonopolizati.on,
privatization, and more efficient provision of specialized production inputs
(pesticides, fertilizer, machinery and equipment). The Government intends to
carry out these policy adjustments as part of its reform program and has
already taken several major steps such as liberalization of commodity prices
mentioned earlier. The aims of the proposed project are to support the
Government's long-term objectives and respond to the short-term goals of
improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the agroindustry subsector and
its contribution to the trade balance. In addition, the project would assist
in overcoming the shortage of oilseed meal, a critical input for the livestock
industry.
Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The overall Bank strategy for Poland
is aimed at (i) supporting the long-term objectives of the government, viz.,
to increase the efficiency and productivity of the economy, promote growth,
improve socioeconomic conditions, and (ii) in the short run, helping to
improve the balance of payments, alleviate the critical shortage of essential
production inputs (livestock feeu) which negatively affects output for both
the export and the domestic markets, and begin the process of restoring the
country's creditworthiness. To fulfil these objectives, the Polish
authorities are adopting macroeconomic policies for promoting stabilization
and undertaking major reforms so as to make the economy more market oriented
in its working. These measures include plans to: introduce positive interest
rates, unify the exchange rates which would eliminate the need for the present
system of export subsidies, and support the development of the private sector,
increased autonomy of management and progressive privatization of state-owned
enterprises, and demonopolization. The proposed project fits into the
strategy of seeking policy reform and complementing it with support for
investments that would improve the country's trade balance and competitiveness
vis-a-vis CC countries.
6.          Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
would be: to remedy existing constraints to rapidly increasing Poland's
exports of processed agricultural products to CC countries; to assist the
lending institutions and enterprises involved in the project to operate
efficiently; to promote further involvement of the private sector in food
processing activities which are export oriented; and to help maintain supplies
of livestock to processors and thus sustain meat exports.
7.          Project Description.  In order to generate incremental convertible
currency export earnings, the project would aim at the rehabilitation,



- 3 -
modernization and expansion of existing agro-processing industries.
Investments in the needed equipment would allow Polish products to be upgraded
to levels of quality prevailing in western markets and would result in
obtaining higher prices for them because of improved quality and packaging and
in increased volume of exports. This would be particularly the case for ham
in cans and in vacuum packing, frozen fruits and vegetables and forest
products including game meat and berries, which are exported mainly to EC
countries. The project would also include support for export marketing
activities of agro-processors and would meet part of the shortage in livestock
feed and thus help maintain adequate supplies of livestock to processors. To
achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would support, over a four-
year period, the following activities:
(a)   Credit Program.  The project would provide financing for
investments by agro-processing enterprises, comprising
freezing and processing lines for fruits and vegetables,
cold storage facilities, equipment for processing of ham and
meat products (including the production of metal cans for
export of ham), machinery and equipment for the production
of a coffee substitute and chicory, a processing and packing
plant for herbs and creams, bottling lines for beer,
refrigerated trucks, and machinery and equipment for the
modernization and expansion of production of various other
agroindustrial products. (This component includes a
significant proportion of pre-appraised subprojects and a
provision for a credit line for additional subprojects.)
The project would also provide financing for export
marketing support, market studies for export commodities,
training of management and export marketing staff, leasing
and testing of new equiDment and export promotion
activities. Special efforts would be made to promote and
support investments by joint-venture enterprises and by
small and medium-scale private processing plants.
(b)   Livestock Feed. The project would also provide financing for
the import of about 100,000 tons of protein feed for
livestock, which would help meet part of the current deficit
in imports estimated at approximately 200,000 tons.
8.          Markets. Poland has well established export markets for the main
commodities to be produced under the project, and is also expected to
penetrate new markets. Marketing studies/surveys which were prepar.. for the
main products to be produced under the proiect, such as meat and frozen fruits
and vegetables indicated that increases in exports are well wti_hin the scope
of projected potential growth of the relevant markets.  In fact all the
preappraised investments are related to enterprises which have already some
share in export markets, and the possibility of expanding their share was
examined on a case by case basis.



9,.P_aLla,   All the p .sappraioed subprojects were reviowed
and found to be in Rati0factcry compliance with the pollution control
guidelinee not by the authoritioe of the Government of Poland, to dvoid any
increase in pollution either in the water or the air.  Further, PB would
require that an environmiental impact aUseasment and certificaton be
undertaken for ench subproject to be financed, for ensuring that no
environmental deterioration would reault from its implementation.
10.         Aarwd-i4Wu.  During negotiations, NBP agreed to the following
main points: (a) US$75 million of the Bank loan would be onlent by NBP to the
Bank for Food Economy (BFE), which is expected to be the main implementing
bank, and other participating banks (PB). Subloans to final boneficiarios
would be denominated iti US dollars and interest would be at prevailing market
rates. NB? would bear the foreign oxchange risk between the US dollar and tho
Bank's currency pool. The interest rate charged by NBP to the PB would be
established as a floating rate linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) for dollar deposits and would include a margin for NBP. NBP would
establish this interest rate for a six-month period. NBP would establish its
margin, in consultation with the Bank, taking into account its spread
requiroments and the cost of similar funds in the market. This margin would
be set at 1.75X for the January 1 - June 30, 1990 period.  Subloans would be
for a maximum of 12 years, including a maximum grace period of 3 years; (b) PB
would conform to agreed operational and financial criteria, including the
introduction of a sound financial structure, minimizing of exposure risks,
introduction of adequate provisions for loan losses, and auditing of accounts
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (c) subloan repayments would
be deposited with NBP and, to the extent that they are not required to service
the Bank loan, such funds would be made available to PB for financing
additional investments to expand exports; (d) PB would ensure that
subborrowers adhere to sound operational and financial standards; and (e) PB
would require that subprojects conform to agreed criteria, including economic
and financial rates of return of at least 18%, and would generate in the first
four years after completion cumulative net revenue ia foreign exchange
exceeding the foreign exchange cost of the investment. In support of its
request for the financing of livestock feed, the Government confirmed at
negotiations that its policy is that all users (private, cooperative and State
farms) should have access to feed without preference for any sector. During
project implementation, Bank supervision missions would verify that this
policy is observed in practice.
11.         Begeflt.   Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (a) increased production of frozen fruits and vegetables, meat
products and miscellaneous food items and increased exports of these
commodities, mainly to CC markets; (b) increases in value added of fruits and
vegetables and potato products; (c) decreases in operating costs due to
technological innovation and more efficient use of labor; (d) increase in
overall profitability due to improved organizational and managerial skills
resulting from training and technical assistance to be provided under the
project;  (e) generation of an estimated 1,500 new jobs, mostly seasonal; .ad
(f) establishmentt of appropriate management information and cost accounting

systems by the enterprises. The economic rate of return of all preappraised
subprojects, which varied between 21% and 70% was calculated to average about
35%. Although the exchange rate of the zloty vis-a-vis CC has depreciated
since the time of appraisal, the preappraised subprojects are still judged to
be amply viable under present and evolving conditions since   the primary
benefits would be in foreign exchange from exports, and the market prospects
remain favorable. Relative prices of imported inputs have not changed
significantly, and because the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate has
been greater than the rate of inflation in Poland, the prices of domestic
inputs have somewhat decreased in terms of foreign exchange. Therefore, the
rates of return on investment are estimated to have improved since appraisal.
Benefits from the livestock feed component derive from helping prevent a
decline in livestock production which would result in a decrease in raw
material supplies to processors, meat supplies to domestic consumers, and meat
exports.
12.         Risks.  At the macro level, the project faces the risk that the
policy and institutional reforms may not progress sufficiently to alleviate
the constraints on efficient performance of the food processing industry. The
risk is being reduced by actions to be taken by Governmenc on the basis of
its firmly-declared policy objectives and of an intense policy dialogue with
the IMF and the Bank. Another risk is that international prices for project
commodities may be lower than estimated. To offset this factor, the project
seeks to improve the quality of output and of marketing services. As for the
possibility that the project could be delayed with negative effects on its
economic benefits, Bank staff have helped to reduce this risk by assisting
with the procurement arrangements during preparation and appraisal. In any
case, even with a delay of benefits by one year, the project would still yield
a rate of return of about 20% on the pre-appraised portion; a two-year delay
would reduce it to about 13%. Finally, the institutional capability of BFE
and other PB may prove to be inadequate. Therefore the Industrial Export
Development Project, which is being processed in parallel with this project,
contains a component to provide technical assistance to the banks.
13.    Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articlrs of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
