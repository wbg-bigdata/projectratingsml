A. Project DeveMopment Obiectlve
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The development objective of the Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project - Copan Valley -
is to achieve sustainable tourism development based on the cultural and natural patrimony of the Copan
Valley and surrounding areas which will, as a result, create investment opportunities for the private
sector, foster employment, and reduce poverty in one of the poorest regions of Honduras. This project
will achieve its objective by supporting: (a) the creation of an archeological tourism circuit integrating
three archeological parks (Copan, El Puente, and Los Naranjos) and two archeological sites (Cerro
Palenque and Plan Grande); (b) ecologically sustainable management in the three parks and two sites
and surrounding areas to address negative impacts provoked by poverty, deforestation, erosion, and
natural disasters; (c) environmental education that is appropriate to the biodiversity and the historical
characteristics of the region; (d) capacity building for employment associated with park/site
development, eco/cultural guiding, and the tourism service sector; (e) strategic planning for tourism
development among key community, private, and public stakeholders; (f) access to training and
technical assistance for high-quality alternative products and services provided to indigenous and
locally-owned enterprises, tourism operators, and municipal staff to provide better services, generate
income and foster longer stays, encouraging a local investment climate; and (g) institutional
strengthening for cultural management and planning capacity.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Key performance indicators are measurable and will include, at end of project (EOP): (a) average
number of visitors increased by at least 20 percent above the natural historic rate; (b) average length of
stay increased at least 100 percent with respect to baseline (2.6 days); (c) level of average expenditures
by tourist increased at least 100 percent with respect to the baseline ($117); (d) 15 percent increase in
municipal revenues in the areas benefiting from the project (expected through growth in local
economies, employment, and increase in tax collection); (e) 5 percentage points increase in employment
in the region benefiting from project (at least 4 percentage points for women, at least 6 percentage
points for men); (f) 100 percent increase in the number of small, local enterprises in the region (with an
increase of 35 percent in indigenous enterprises) created and functioning sustainability; (g) 100 percent
increase in the number of hectares under ecologically sustainable management; and (h) at least 70
percent of the visitors express satisfaction with the service received.
B. Strategic Content
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 20072-HO Date of latest CAS discussion: 12/14/1999
The project is consistent with the Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the
Executive Directors on December 14, 1999 and is incorporated in the new CAS expected to be presented
to the Board in June 2003. The 2000 CAS prioritizes a comprehensive poverty reduction and social
development strategy through building human capital, supporting indigenous peoples development,
mainstreaming gender, supporting environmental management, and stimulating sustainable rural
development. Sustainable tourism is identified as a significant growth sector for the country. This
operation will contribute to the CAS goal by focusing on the poverty reduction and private sector
development potential of sustainable tourism based on diversification of attractions, ecological
sustainability, and training and technical assistance for community-based initiatives linked to tourism,
and particularly for the very poor, indigenous communities, and women.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
National Level: Issues and Government Strategy
Honduras possesses rich natural and cultural resources, yet ranks as the third poorest country in Latin
America and has a high incidence of extreme poverty in rural areas. Its natural endowments have been
threatened by deforestation, inappropriate land use, degradation of water and coastal resources, and
poor management. According to the 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for Honduras,
although the country has substantially recovered from Hurricane Mitch, the Government of Honduras
(GoH) still faces many challenges to sustainable economic growth. To increase economic growth,
Honduras is pursuing a robust tourism development strategy that capitalizes on its many exceptional
natural and cultural resources. Tourism is the world's fastest growing economic activity and it has the
potential to generate employment, foreign exchange, and tax revenue and contribute to poverty
reduction. In 2002, tourism in Honduras grew by 20 percent with more than 800,000 visitors. The GoH
seeks to increase this number to one million visitors by 2005 and be a regional leader in tourism by
2021.
The main issues affecting growth in the tourism sector include: (a) lack of a strategic framework for
tourism development that makes the country competitive due to prevailing legal and institutional
obstacles to private sector investment; (b) insufficient infrastructure to support physical demands and
investment in tourism; (c) poor or nonexistent public services in priority areas (such as water,
sanitation, solid waste management); (d) difficult access to potential tourism clusters; (e) fragmented
management of sectors that impact tourism (such as transport and communications); (f) limited
application of land use planning and mapping; (g) weak municipal capacity; and (h) low human
resource capacity.
The Secretarfa de Turismo (ST - Ministry of Tourism) and the Instituto Hondureiio de Turismo (IHT -
Honduras Institute of Tourism) are pursuing a comprehensive Plan of Action for 2002-2006 to increase
growth in the sector, in partnership with the private sector, donors, and civil society. The objective is to
provide incentives for tourism development based on a national strategy to support equitable,
sustainable, and responsible growth to generate employment, capture foreign currency, and support
local/regional development. The Plan consists of: enhancing infrastructure, access portals, and
transportation; developing new destinations; building consensus at regional/local levels; creating
opportunities for private sector investment; developing marketing campaigns; and implementing tourism
police units in key areas. The World Bank is helping the GoH to address some of these issues through
the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project. Also, the Competitiveness Program, currently under
preparation, will help Government address the main legal and institutional challenges to promoting an
investment climate in tourism, such as private sector innovation, labor force skills, local development,
and communications. In addition, the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), which will finance
priorities identified in the PRSP, will contribute to resolving many of these obstacles.
CoRan Valley: Issues
(a) Persistent Poverty and Low Human Resource Capacity. Although an increase in tourism has
brought progress to the western region of Honduras, the Department of Copan continues to rank among
the poorest of the country. The municipality of Copan Ruinas has benefited from the increase in
tourism, but poverty remains: the illiteracy rate is 49 percent, malnutrition rate is 55 percent and 75
percent of the households have Unmet Basic Needs. Vertical linkages between tour operators, hotels,
and airlines have limited opportunities for new, small enterprises to enter the sector and these
operations often produce employment that is limited to unskilled and poorly paid jobs. However, due to
- 3 -



labor laws, even when low paid, the cost of formal labor that is generated is high, particularly for the
small employer, leading to significant turnover. The other five municipalities with archeological sites
included in the project also show very low human development indicators and a high number of
households with Unmet Basic Needs: In Guanaja (Plan Grande), the illiteracy rate is 92 percent and 30
percent of the households have Unmet Basic Needs; in La Jigua (El Puente), the illiteracy rate is 80
percent and 67 percent of households have Unmet Basic Needs; in Yojoa (Los Naranjos), the illiteracy
rate is 62 percent, the malnutrition rate is 40 percent and half of the households have Unmet Basic
Needs; and in both Pimienta and Porterillos (Cerro Palenque), the illiteracy rate is 70 percent, the
malnutrition rate is about 28 percent, and the percentage of households with Unmet Basic Needs is 54
and 73 percent respectively. The main challenge for the GoH in a pro-poor tourism approach is to
ensure that the poor have the capacity to benefit from the potential of tourism development (see Social
Analysis in Annex 12).
(b) Pressurefrom Increasing Number of Tourists. The Copan Archeological Park, located near the
western border with Guatemala, contains some of the most impressive Maya ruins in Central America
and it is the most popular tourist attraction in Honduras. Copan has experienced substantial growth in
the number of tourists (from 12,500 in 1975 to 135,000 in 2002) and in the 1990s, this increase resulted
in a boom in tourism-related hotels and restaurants in the nearby town of Copan Ruinas. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), through the Mundo Maya initiative, will be supporting a
regional aerodrome for larger planes in the nearby Rio Amarillo Valley. Although this airport will
respond to one of the main needs for regional development, by facilitating the arrival of an increasing
number of tourists, it will place additional pressure on the existing infrastructure and require more
diversified attractions. The Copan Park has nearly reached its maximum carrying capacity (in terms of
numbers of people visiting the ruins without damaging them), and although occupancy rates for hotels
in the project areas are low (as shown in the Economic Analysis), the municipalities, specifically Copan
Ruinas, have limited capacity to absorb additional inflows of visitors given constraints in public
services such as sewage, water, garbage collection, electricity, and police coverage (see Annexes 11 and
12).
(c) Lack of a Strategic Framework to Attract Investors. Private sector investment has generally
followed the development of the Copan archeological site with hotels and restaurants constructed in
Copan Ruinas and neighboring areas, in part stimulated by regressive tax incentives the Government
provided in the aftermath of Mitch. Ultimately, this development has benefited only a few investors
with very little trickle down effect. Government is just beginning to recognize that private investors
should include local residents, who if appropriately skilled and trained, can take advantage of market
niches created by the inflow of tourists seeking local attractions, products, and gifts. Finally,
institutional and legal obstacles to the creation of enterprises, even small businesses, continue to exist,
with substantial bureaucratic requirements often taking place in Tegucigalpa.
(d) Environmental Degradation. The Environmental Assessment (EA) confirmed the limitations of a
model that relies only on quantity of tourists without addressing the environmental impacts that these
numbers provoke. In terms of non-economic impacts, it is important to raise awareness about
environmental degradation that may be caused by overuse of areas. Increasingly, the GoH is aware that
the environment is the capital of the poor and any poverty reduction strategy must be environmentally
sustainable. This is particularly true in areas where natural and cultural resource attractions are the main
sources of income.
(e) Weak Municipal Capacity. Tourism growth can strain local public services delivery and hence,
municipalities must have the capacity, in terms of human resources, planning tools, and finances, to
- 4 -



respond to these new demands. Municipalities in the area, including Copan Ruinas, face significant
problems in generating their own revenue, in part due to the lack of a cadastre for tax collection. In
Copan, there is also an issue of the collection of entrance fees from the Archeological Park, which are
appropriated by the central government and only in part, spent on maintenance of the Park. This issue
has been raised in the past and is currently being negotiated between the municipality and the central
government. Also, the Tourism Incentive Law (April 1999), designed to promote the touris-m sector
after Hurricane Mitch, provides tax exemptions for new tourism developments, but it has resulted in the
unintended consequence of limiting municipal tax collection. The Tourism Law provides incentives, but
administrative and legal requirements to create a new business are cumbersome, costly, and slow, and in
general constitute a disincentive to enterprise development, particularly in a poor area such as the
Copan Valley.
(f) Protection of Cultural Patrimony. The Instituto Hondurefio de Antropologia y Historia (iHAH -
Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History) in the Secretaria de Cultura, Artes, y Deportes
(SCAD - Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Sports) is responsible for the use and preservation of all
cultural patrimony associated with archeological ruins. For centuries, Maya artifacts have been
transferred out of the country, reappearing in private collections and foreign museums. The GoH has
prioritized.security in the archeological parks and sites since illegal artifact smuggling, which is highly
profitable, continues to be a significant problem.
C6pan Valley: Government Strategy
Government has developed strategies to address these sector issues, some of which will addressed by
the C6pan Valley Project and others by complementary World Bank Projects, bilateral and multilateral
donors, or by Government itself. The GoH tourism development strategy in the Western region is to
contribute to social and economic development by valuing attractions and diversifying existing
offerings through implementation of short- and medium-term plans for tourism development. This
strategy is based on several fundamental principles: (a) consultation and participatory planning with
local authorities, communities, and the private sector; (b) restoration and security of archeological sites;
(c) promotion of tourism and social infrastructure; (d) partnership with the private sector and small
enterprises with incentives for local productive initiatives; (e) environmental conservation; (f)
institutional strengthening of rural municipalities in the area; and (f) promotion and marketing.
As part of this strategy, the GoH plans to create a new "Archeological Tourist Circuit." This strategy
uses Copan as a prnmary attraction, diversifies destinations, and facilitates visitor access to
under-utilized and/or undeveloped sites, including the El Puente Archeological Park, the Cerro.Palenque
Archeological Site, the Los Naranjos Eco-Archeological Park, and the Plan Grande ruins on the island
of Guanaja. All five sites are accessible through the San Pedro Sula International Airport (four sites can
be reached in less than 3 hours by road and for Guanaja in less than one hour by air). Copan and El
Puente (in the Department of Copan near Cop.n Ruins) are also accessible from Guatemnala by road for
tourist groups visiting other Maya sites. The road conditions are good and have been recently
rehabilitated in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including through the World Bank-financed Road
Reconstruction and Improvement Project. Cerro Palenque is located near San Pedro Sula (a nine mile
access road is in poor condition and rehabilitation is planned for in the Copan Valley Project) and Los
Naranjos is located along the main road from San Pedro Sula to Tegucigalpa near Lake Yojoa (the two
mile access road is in fairly good condition). Access to Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands, is by air or boat
and then to the "Plan Grande" site, by boat and then walking (additional information on these project
areas is included in Annex 11). These archeological sites also coincide with six national parks with
varying levels of development that are included in the Protected Areas System of Honduras. With this
- 5 -



strategic choice, the GoH intends to promote a more decentralized and inclusive model of development
that will be complemented with intensive capacity building, training, and incentives for local enterprise
development.
Local and central governments recognize the main constraints that affect the successful expansion of
tourism and are seeking financing mechanisms to plan and address priority needs. For example, the
Municipality of Copdn Ruinas is currently carrying out a participatory strategic planning process and
will develop a strategic plan for investments in infrastructure, particularly water treatment and solid
waste management. In Copan, the Ministry of Tourism and IHT are supporting municipal-level
activities including: urban development plan, historical center regulations planning, restoration of
public buildings, tourism police, training, municipal strengthening, and establishment of municipal
tourism units. Spanish Cooperation will be supporting infrastructure improvements in Copan related to
solid waste management. The World Bank-financed Competitiveness Program will enhance
competitiveness by supporting the development of local competitiveness strategies in four locations, to
be selected, based on their high economic development potential. It will also pilot, in one or two of
these priority areas, small-scale initiatives to increase productivity by upgrading local infrastructure,
promoting business innovations and use of technology, and increasing micro, small, and medium sized
enterprises' access to training and advisory services. Government has prioritized Copan as the first pilot
area and during preparation of the Competitiveness Program, the Bank team will support the
organization of a public/private partnership to identify needs and formulate a Comprehensive
Development Plan for Copan.
The GoH has been also pursuing a Decentralization Program to build the capacity of local governments
to support equitable economic development, focus on poverty reduction, and ensure greater coverage of
public services. Copan Ruinas has been prioritized with the other 87 poorest municipalities. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), currently under preparation as part of the PRSC,
has identified several problems with the revenue and collections office and the issue of financial
transfers to municipalities has been identified as a key issue on the decentralization topic in the PRSC.
Several studies are currently under preparation to identify legislation gaps, financial systems, capacity
issues, and specific sector issues. The decentralization program has been supported by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), which is providing technical assistance on financial
management, budgeting, and planning to priority municipalities, including Copan Ruinas and La Jigua
(municipality of El Puente). The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is preparing a new
initiative in the Copan Department to build municipal capacity to raise revenues to invest in services
and address economic development in the poorest areas. A second phase of the IDA-financed Land
Administration Project, currently under preparation, will include priority areas in its cadastre work.
Finally, in the Bay Islands, the IDB is supporting environmental management and municipal capacity
building with particular emphasis on general sanitation and protection of natural resources.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The GoH has recognized that multi-sectoral efforts are needed to address poverty and promote
sustainable development in ecologically fragile and culturally diverse areas. In addition to the creation of
incentives for local private sector involvement, the challenge is to create conditions for tourism to
contribute to poverty reduction. The Copan Valley Project will target the Copan Valley and surrounding
areas, one of the poorest regions of Honduras, and seek to promote a holistic vision of pro-poor,
community-based tourism development. The project will take a broad approach in a limited geographic
area as a model of sustainable regional development that benefits local residents. The following strategic
choices were made, based on the sector issues described in the previous section:
- 6 -



(a) Creation of a Tourism Circuitfor Regional Development. The first strategic choice was to
decentralize the tourism flow from Copan by developing other sites and parks by creating a new
archeological-ecological tourism circuit. This choice is strategic for the following reasons: (i) it protects
the delicate ruins in Copan, which cannot absorb additional increases in the number of visitors without
additional archeological works that will take time to complete; (ii) it protects the environment in the Park
and the municipality, already at capacity limits; (iii) it allows time for the Copan Management Plan to be
implemented so that attractions can be enhanced and created; and (iv) it allows for the protection and
development of other cultural resources as significant as Copan.
(b) Pro-poor Modelfor Tourism Development The second strategic choice was the adoption of a
Pro-poor tourism approach. First, this approach recognizes that cultural heritage and the environment are
the patrimony of the poor. The poor are the most vulnerable and may lose the most from environmental
degradation and misuse of cultural patrimony. The project pursues this strategy by creating conditions for
the preservation of archeological parks and sites and their natural environments while at the same time,
promoting employment and income opportunities linked to this preservation. Second, this approach,
based on worldwide research, will promote: (i) market access (how to break into the location of poor
people); (ii) commercial sustainability (quality of products, marketing, and positive cost benefit); (iii)
policy framework (favorable government involvement); and (iv) capacity building for the poor with a
strong social communication strategy. These issues are corroborated by the lessons learned from the pilot
GENFUND (Norwegian Trust Fund for Gender Mainstreaming Program implemented in Copan during
2002-2003 under the IDA-financed PROFUTURO Project). Third, a pro-poor strategy also requires
incentives for the creation of a local climate for investments to prevent economic leakages to wealthier
locations.
(c) Frameworkfor Private Sector Investment. By developing a new tourism circuit in areas that
previously have not benefited from the tourism inflow, but are easily accessible through the Intemational
Airport in San Pedro Sula, the C6pan Valley Project is providing the private sector with important
investment incentives and market opportunities derived from tourism. The framework for private sector
development is based on the following elements: (i) The best investments for regional and local
development are those that do not produce resource leakages to external areas. To promote these
investments, intensive capacity building and planning exercises among key public, private, and civil
society stakeholders, including tourism operators (following the model of the Sustainable Coastal
Tourism Project) will be financed by the Copan Valley Project (in coordination with the Competitiveness
Project) in C6pan Ruinas, the Valley, and the other project municipalities; (ii) Institutional and legal
barriers to business creation exist, are generally regressive, and they should be challenged. The Copan
Valley Project will collaborate with the Competitiveness Project, which will be working to improve the
investment climate in Honduras, and particularly in C6pan; and (iii) Private sector development includes
small businesses than can be effectively run by indigenous organizations. The GoH has recognized the
value of cultural resources for tourism, the potential of micro and small enterprises linked to the sector,
handicraft development, and cultural heritage promotion (PRSP, 2001). The development of artisan
products can produce substantial economic benefits if groups are linked to technical assistance to provide
high-quality products, reliability, stringent quality control, marketing, and commercialization. The
rediscovery, development, and successful commercialization of the Lenca ceramics is a model experience
to be followed. An intermediary organization can play an important role in maximizing the business
opportunities. Fondo Prosperidad (Prosperity Fund) will identify market niches, and finance subprojects
which may include technical assistance, quality control, and commercialization.
(d) Enhance Quality of Destinations. The challenge is not only to attract tourists to the other sites, but
also to encourage longer stays by enhancing existing destinations and creating new high quality
- 7 -



attractions. In addition to infrastructure and interpretation improvements in the parks and sites, the
project will expand and diversify sights, such as the integration of the parks and sites in an
archeological-ecological tourist circuit; the creation of a Maya village from the 8th century A.D. in El
Puente; appreciation of environmental richness and biodiversity (such as the lake near Los Naranjos);
and reorientation of local production towards a market responsive to visitor demand. The Copan Valley
Project will also promote attractive tourism opportunities for private investment, with a priority on
indigenous communities.
(e) Conservation of Natural and Cultural Resources. The future sustainability and attraction of the
archeological parks and sites is contained in their natural environment and cultural resources. Tourism
can produce unintended negative effects such as: overuse of the resource, an increase in nearby
populations, and generation of garbage. Lax security can provide opportunities for artifact smuggling.
The Cop6n Valley Project will place a priority on the management and security of the sites by balancing
conservation and archeological research needs with increased access and interpretation. If there is no
consideration given to planning and implementation of sound environmental and cultural management
plans with an assessment of carrying capacity and security, the interest and potential of the sites will be
lost.
(f) Capacity Building and Skills Development. To help integrate local residents, the project will provide
specialized training and capacity building and support the creation of employment related to alternative
tourism enterprise development, guiding, and management of archeological parks and sites (related to
preservation and conservation). Women, and specifically indigenous women, will be targeted in the
technical assistance and training program to improve income generation skills among vulnerable
populations. Through the Fondo Prosperidad, the project will support income generation activities in
rural and urban areas that are identified by a pre-feasibility study to be sustainable, cost-effective, and
responsive to market demand.
(g) EnvironmentaiEducation. The project will design and implement interactive education for children
and families that takes into account biodiversity and the historical characteristics of the northwest region
of Honduras. This project will build on the work started by the PROFUTURO Project, which supported
the development of Casa K'inich (House of the Sun), an interactive learning center for children in Copan
Ruinas. This center presents the complexities of Maya life, their scientific knowledge and their close
relationship to the environment through interactive exhibits, text, and sound. There is a need to support
expansion of Casa K'inich, creation of new exhibits, and the production of curriculum materials based on
new findings. Similar educational activities targeting youth will also be designed and developed in the
other parks and sites in the project. Environmental awareness will also be promoted by the training and
capacity building linked to the Fondo Prosperidad.
(h) Communications/Institutional Development. The project will strengthen the institutional capacity
for tourism and cultural patrimony management among public, private, and civil society actors at both the
national and local levels. A participatory planning process will accompany the development of the new
archeological-ecological circuit with a strong social communications strategy. The long-term
sustainability of the tourism investments will depend on the ability of local level actors to invest in and
maintain the areas that serve the parks and sites. A national and international marketing campaign to
promote the new destinations will be designed and implemented.
The following chart summarizes the main sector issues in tourism in the C6pan Valley area, outlines the
Project's strategic choices, and presents complementary World Bank and donor projects that have
contributed to the choices of the C6pan Valley Project.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
Component 1 - Integrated DeveloRment of Archeological Parks and Sites will create an Archeological
Tourism Circuit by financing tourism infrastructure and participatory management in three
archeological parks and two archeological sites. This component will fund: (a) the implementation of
the Management Plan priorities in the Copan Archeological Park (financed under the PROFUTURO
Project), including security equipment in the Park, environmental management and education, cultural
education activities and community outreach; and (b) Management Plans and implementation of
priorities in El Puente Archeological Park, Los Naranjos Eco-Archeological Park, Cerro Palenque
Archeological Site, and Plan Grande Archeological Site.
Component 2 - Income Generation Opportunities will implement a program of formation and incentives
to foster income generation opportunities for populations in the project areas, particularly the very poor.
This component will fund: (a) local capacity building, skills development, and training for workers and
guides in Archeological Parks and Sites; (b) capacity building in tourism services delivery for local
residents, including tourism operators and municipal staff; and (c) income generation opportunities with
a pre-feasibility study to identify profitable market niches and training and technical assistance for
vulnerable groups on production and commercialization through the creation of Fondo Prosperidad.
Component 3 - Institutional Development will design and implement institutional strengthening for
IHT, IHAH, and SCAD; a plan for tourism development by fostering consensus among public, private,
and civil society actors at the local, regional and national levels, including technical assistance and
training for municipalities; a marketing and promotion strategy; and a social communications strategy.
This component will fund: (a) institutional strengthening and communications; and (b) enhancements to
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and monitoring and evaluation.

2. Key poRicy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The existing policy and institutional framework is not expected to inhibit project viability nor
sustainability, although there are several important issues as presented in Section B.3.-This project will
complement ongoing initiatives by the GoH to address policy and institutional reforms, including the
World Bank-financed Competitiveness Program, which will support actions to strengthen the business
climate in the tourism sector, forge a partnership between private and public actors and reduce barriers
that create disincentives to private sector investment. The project is consistent with priorities identified
in the CAS and in the PRSP by addressing poverty, particularly of vulnerable groups such as indigenous
peoples and women, and creating investment opportunities for the private sector. It will also promote
consensus-building mechanisms regarding revenues produced in the CopAn Park and the other parks and
sites, which will also support objectives of the PRSC.
3. Benefits and target population:
The western region of Honduras, including the Copan Department, is inhabited by a larger proportion of
the country's poor and the project will specifically target this group. The project will generate benefits
for direct and indirect beneficiaries. The large majority of direct beneficiaries are indigenous peoples.
The approximately 141,400 residents of the six municipalities where archeological sites in the project
are located will also benefit from the project. The departments where the archeological sites are located
and that will benefit from the archeological tourism circuit are inhabited by a population of
approximately 1.5 mnillion people, who will indirectly benefit from the project. A Baseline Survey will
be conducted in the area to refine the numbers below and will, when replicated, produce the expected
outcomes of the project described in Annex 1. Based on available information from the PRSP, it is
possible to estimate the following number of beneficiaries:

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The estimated period of implementation of the project is four years. Overall project oversight and
coordination will be the responsibility of the Instituto Hondurenio de Turismo (HiT - Honduras Institute
of Tourism).
Project Coordination Unit. The existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in IHT for the Sustainable
Coastal Tourism Project will serve as the PCU. The PCU will be responsible to the Bank for all project
implementation activities including procurement, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and
monitoring and evaluation, and it will be enhanced with the addition of a Budget Specialist, and
accounting and procurement assistants. A small branch of the PCU will be established in Copan with a
coordinator, procurement assistant and a cultural specialist from IHAH to facilitate local-level actions.
The procurement, financial management, audit, and disbursement arrangements are presented in Section
E.4 and Annex 6.
Technical Support Agreement. The Instituto Hondureino de Antropologia y Historia (IHAH - Honduran
Institute of Anthropology and History) has the legal mandate to preserve and protect the archeological
sites. The project design includes a Technical Support Agreement to be signed between IHT and IHAH
through which 1IAH will participate in technical support, development of terms of reference, review of
procurement, etc. in all the activities related to the archeological sites. The Institutional Development
component also includes specific capacity building activities for IHAH.
Asociaci6n Copan/Component 1. Government has requested the involvement of Asociaci6n Copan, a
local non-governmental entity specialized in archeological work, for technical support to IHAH for part
of Component 1 -- Integrated Development of Archeological Parks and Sites. This will be pursued as a
sole source contract (see Annexes 6 and 13 for additional information).
Fondo Prosperidad. It is expected that a NGO (Management Agency), will be selected, according to
Bank procurement procedures, to administer the subprojects. The Agency will have experience in the
management of subprojects, a history of trust dealing with communities, and a presence in the area. At
least one local organization representative will participate in the decisions of the Agency regarding the
Fund. The Management Agency will report financially and in terms of development results each six
months to the PCU. The Agency will identify subprojects and request IHT to disburse funds for the
subprojects to the Management Agency, which will then disburse to beneficiary groups. Disbursements
to the Management Agency will be based on the commitments of the Agency with beneficiaries and on
- 13-



the results achieved each six months (see Annexes 2 and 6 for additional information).
Advisory Committee. A high-level advisory committee will be convened by 1HFT with the participation
of the Ministry of Finance, Minister of Tourism, Minister of Culture, Arts, and Sports, IHAH Director,
and local mayors in project areas. This committee will meet regularly to review project plans and
implementation progress and will include representatives from other central and local-level government
agencies and non-governmental organizations involved in the sector.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Focus only on Implementation of Management Plans for Archeological Parks. Consideration was given
to only providing the inputs necessary to improve visitor access and preserve the archeological parks and
sites. However, experience shows that there is a need to be pro-active regarding poverty reduction and
that markets can be created given the availability of good products. The Bank's experience in technical
assistance and training shows that opportunities can be created through a strategic approach in a region,
in this case, the entire Copan Valley and surrounding areas. This project is designed not only to address
cultural assets, but also to support ecologically sustainable management and income generation
strategies.
Focus only on Copan Park. The Copan Park is the main attraction in the Valley and consideration was
given to only implementing the Management Plan recommendations for this park. However, the fragility
of the ruins, absorptive capacity, and the fact that a greater number of tourists staying for longer periods
of time is needed to provide sustainable employment and development for the poorest residents, led to
the decision to create a more diversified supply of tourism attractions and services. Therefore, the project
will create a new archeological-ecological circuit that encompasses the other significant sites in the
region. It will develop a model Maya village from circa 8th century A.D., promote eco-tourism in Los
Naranjos, Cerro Palenque, and Guanaja and provide new, educational attractions for visiting children and
youth. This strategy complements the Mundo Maya Program, supported by IDB which is identifying key
infrastructure constraints and tourism development opportunities to be financed, including the regional
aerodrome in Rio Amarillo.
Include as part of the Competitiveness Program. This altemative was considered, but not pursued due to
several reasons: (a) conceptually the project is focused on promotion of pro-poor tourism development,
indigenous development, and financing Management Plans with a strong emphasis on environmental
protection; (b) there are no savings on IDA funds as the project would require the same financing; and (c)
there would be no savings on supervision/administration budgets given the social and environmental
focus which requires specialized expertise.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The program in Copan financed by the PROFUTURO Project and the GENFUND program have
generated many lessons and ideas, which have been used to inform the design and preparation of this
project. These programs have allowed for a clear identification of the economic needs in the Copan
Valley, the natural and cultural assets, and the definition of areas to be involved in the proposed project.
The following lessons also reflect concepts from other eco/cultural tourism programs, Bank research,
Implementation Completion Reports (ICR) Reports, and Operations Evaluations Department (OED)
findings.
Barriers to Participation of Poor in Tourism. The main lessons learned from pro-poor tourism research
shows that the following issues must be addressed if a project is to benefit the poor: (a) provision of
formal/informal skills training and capacity building to meet tourist expectations on issues such as
business management, language, guide training, and/or craft development; (b) access to financial
resources; (c) participation of communities and community-based organizations in decision-making; (d)
training in gender sensitive approaches; (e) creation of tourism that is compatible with existing livelihood
strategies-avoid mass market tourism to reduce pressure on resources and issues of waste management;
(f) destination building and marketing by private sector and government is necessary; (g) development of
tourism plans and lobbying for infrastructure development is important; and (h) there is a need to develop
and establish new "products" for tourists, such as destinations, visitor's centers, tours, etc.
Management Plans. Ample evidence from natural and cultural parks around the world shows that the
development of participatory Management Plans with integrated conservation management can establish
a framework for improvements and allow managers and community members to develop a consensus on
the future management of the resource. An increase in the number of visitors is welcome, but the
implications must be managed so that natural and cultural sites are not degraded. Management Plans
identify priority areas in need of immediate preservation and address long-term issues related to
conservation and education. Once a Plan is developed, the implementation allows for the sustainable
development of the site and expansion of attractions for visitors.
Development of High Quality Alternative Attractions. Copan, as a primary site, is currently benefiting
from a high influx of visitors, but as is the case in other Maya sites in Mesoamerica, most visitors only
stay for a short time as part of national or international tour packages. Sustainable tourism projects
should promote alternative attractions so visitors stay longer, visit additional parks, and spend additional
resources. The Copan Valley possesses many cultural and natural attractions, but they will not become
tourist products until identified, made accessible, staffed with well-trained guides, advertised, and linked
via distribution and sales mechanisms to the market.
Community Participation and Benefit can Lead to Sustainability. Incorporation of those living near a
natural or cultural asset is the best way to preserve physical and living culture and ensure sustainable use
by the local residents. Local residents and indigenous communities will be encouraged to participate in
the project through the training and educational opportunities and access to the Fondo Prosperidad.
Institutional Development. The strengthening of national institutions responsible for sustainable tourism
development and cultural heritage preservation is essential to the long-term sustainability of projects
involving archeological sites. An important part of this institutional development is the establishment of
enhanced communication and coordination with all involved agencies.
Preservation of the Environment and Cultural Heritage. One way of achieving the preservation of the
environment and cultural heritage is by building a stake in their conservation. The project will implement
- 17 -



a strategy that will make conservation measures productive for both the private sector and the poor.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Copan Valley Project has enjoyed strong Government commitment and ownership. The GoH
expressed interest in this project as a result of the successful implementation of the PROFUTURO
component in Copan, the increasing number of visitors to this site, and the desire to transform this inflow
into benefits for the local residents of one of the poorest regions in the country. The GoH initially
requested this project in a letter dated May 27, 2002. During a preparation mission in September 2002,
the Government presented the mission with a preliminary project preparation plan, detailed designs and
implementation arrangements.
During the Pre-Appraisal Mission in February 2003, over 30 participants, including Government and
other partners (the Minister of Tourism; the Minister of Culture, Arts, and Sports; the Vice-Minister of
Tourism; the Director of IHAH; the Director of International Cooperation of IHT; representatives from
the Direccion General de Credito Publico de la Secretaria de Finanzas (DGCP - General Directorate of
Public Credit in the Ministry of Finance); representatives from the Ministerio de Recursos Naturales y el
Ambiente (SERNA - Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment) and the Department of
Protected Areas, and Asociaci6n Copan) participated in a two-day logical framework meeting to review
and discuss project objectives, components, activities, and risks. This meeting served to develop a
consensus on the project and establish implementing arrangements. This project is a top priority for
Government and inter-agency coordination has been exemplary.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
There are five strong reasons illustrating the value-added of Bank involvement in this project: First,
through the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project, the Bank is already active in reducing poverty and
promoting prosperity through equitable eco- and heritage-based tourism. Second, this project is a
follow-up of the IDA-financed PROFUTURO Project, providing an opportunity to scale-up the
successful experience of financing several activities in the Copan Park, specifically small civil works and
capacity building. Third, several of the design characteristics of the proposed project draw from
successful lessons of two grants implemented by the Bank in the area. Fourth, the Bank is the only
multilateral organization with experience in creating the conditions for pro-poor sustainable tourism
development in the Copan Valley. Finally, an important comparative advantage of Bank involvement is
the focus on reducing poverty and increasing prosperity of poor households. The Bank brings decades of
experience in rural development and cultural resources management to the proposed project. The Bank
will support the actions of IHT in the integration and development of the parks and sites for tourism and
promotion of employment opportunities as a means to achieve the goal of improving the lives of poor
residents living in the Valley and surrounding areas. The Bank will also seek to protect the environment
and provide opportunities and resources for the poorest households.
The World Bank support for this project has catalyzed a number of agreements between the Government
(IHAH) and top research institutions (Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Tulane
University, and others) and donors (Japanese expert volunteers and others) to continue and expand their
archeological investigation, research, and publishing about these sites in Honduras. These agreements
represent a significant input into the project, which although not considered official co-financing,
represents an important contribution to the project and to preserving the cultural patrimony of Honduras.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
* Cost benefit     NPV=US$9.4 million; ERR = 20.5 % (see Annex 4)
0 Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
This project makes a public investment in public goods (archeological parks and sites, roads, etc.) and
private goods (training and financing for small tourism businesses), to promote growth in the tourism
industry. The benefits expected from the project's implementation are additional jobs, production, and
incomes in the project's areas of influence and the increased flow of tourist demand takes up the slack in
the hotel industry. At present, occupation rates in the hotel industry are very low, estimated at under 20
percent. The project will invest in the development of additional visitor attractions, will support the
marketing of the industry and will strengthen the capacity of private actors to provide good quality
services demanded by visitors. This should lead to a rapid increase in the flow of visitors.
The project's economic rate of return was analyzed by comparing the public investment cost of the
project with the project's stream of expected net benefits in terms of additional net incomes to Honduran
factors of production. In this variant of the analysis the costs and benefits are all accounted for at their
economic opportunity costs. The NPV in the medium scenario is US$ 9.4 million with a 20.5 percent
ERR. Under Scenario 3, of high growth in demand, the NPV is US$ 32.4 million with a 78.5 percent
ERR. The project is likely to be socially profitable under reasonable scenarios for demand growth and
costs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the project's profitability will be sensitive to the flow of visitors and
to the number of days they stay in Honduras. This implies that the project's success requires the effective
promotion of these archeological sites as tourist destinations, and on the supply of tourism products and
services that will make it more attractive for tourists to stay longer and spend more money. Both aspects
are backed by specific components in the project's design. The implementation of the project must also
be complemented with continuing Government actions in exploration and research at the selected sites
including the acquisition of property rights of lands where the archeological sites are located.
Additional information on the conversion factors, conceptualization of costs and benefits, economic net
present value and Internal Rate of Return, the sensitivity analysis, and detailed data tables are included in
Annex 4.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ 6.1 million; FRR = 20.7 % (see Annex 4)
The project's rate of return is analyzed in terms of the relationship between the stream of costs incurred
both publicly (the project costs) and privately (the costs of the industry) due to the project's intervention,
compared with the incremental revenues to be derived by tourism mdustries in the zone of influence as a
result of the project. In the first variant of the analysis, all the costs and benefits are analyzed at their
market prices. The analysis shows that the overall financial rate of return of the project is positive, with a
Net Present Value (NPV) of $6.1 million and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 20.7 percent in the
medium scenario; and NPV of $25.6 million and IRR of 46.7 percent in the high scenario.
The distributive and fiscal impact of the project was analyzed to determine the distribution of the costs
and benefits between the public sector (public investment and tax revenues) and the private sector
(additional factor incomes, net of taxes). Annex 4 contains detailed information on the benefits stream,
cost stream, and the Financial Rate of Return.
- 19 -



Fiscal Impact:
The counterpart contribution to this project is ten percent of the project costs, including taxes for a total
of US$1.2 million.
The analysis of fiscal impact separates the public and private components of the economic costs and
benefits of the project. This exercise was done for Scenario 2 - Moderate Impact, allowing an analysis of
the components of the NPV of $6.8 million projected in this scenario. The analysis shows that the project
has a negative fiscal impact of US$1.421 million, indicating a recovery rate of 82 percent on the public
investment. The government invests $7.79 million and gets back in taxes $6.37 million.
The projected net benefit derived from payments to national factors is US$ 10,837 million. Since the net
private benefits after taxes are positive, and greater than the project cost, it might be argued based on
these numbers that if the private sector undertook the investment it would have a positive net return.
However, given the public-good nature of the investments in the development of the archeological parks
and sites, coupled to the fact that the economic return is derived entirely from a net benefit to labor not to
capital, it is most unlikely that private companies would undertake the investment if the government did
not do so. This same fact indicates that the distributive impact of the project in terms of benefits to labor
and capital is very positive.
Additionally, it's worth pointing out that the loan terms (IDA) for the project, much below the discount
rate of 11.5 percent used here - imply that the Central Government's cash flow will be positive in this
project. As a result, the fiscal balance as measured by the IMF will be improved, not worsened, by the
project.
3. Technical:
The technical design of the project is appropriate to the needs and capacity of Honduras. The
infrastructure needs in CopAn, as prioritized in the PROFUTUIRO-financed Management Plan, include
estimated costs for small civil works based on market rates, with a consideration of contingencies and
inflation. Management Plans will be carried out for the other archeological sites to inform the priority
needs for each site. The design of Management Plans for archeological sites is based on a model which
has been used and tested worldwide. A model for participatory Management Plans is included in the
Environmental Assessment Document (Annex 4 of EA). The Management Plans generally include:
analysis of regional context (biological, social, economic aspects); legislation; evaluation of current
management; cultural resource management (archeological research, conservation, collection
management, ethnography); natural resource management; public use program (interpretation,
community involvement, carrying capacity, monitoring of use, planning of site); operational program
(administration, public relations, security, maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation); timetable and
operational plan. For Component 1, Government has requested involvement of a local non-governmental
organization (Asociaci6n Copan) for specialized technical assistance of part of the component and a
contract with an engineering firm for supervision of the works.
The project design is based on best practices in a pro-poor tourism approach, which is appropriate to the
situation in Copan and the other project areas. The Income Generation Opportunity Component is
designed to provide training, capacity-building, and technical assistance. The inclusion of a
pre-feasibility study prior to the technical assistance and the implementation of Fondo Prosperidad is
based on best practices and the need to identify profitable market niches in advance of targeting
resources. Project design has also considered sustainable tourism models and "green" certification
programs that will help support ecologically sustainable management and also provide marketing benefits
for local enterprises.

4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The Executing Agency for this project will be the Honduras Institute of Tourism (IHT).
4.2 Project management:
Project management will be carried out by the same Project Coordination Unit for the Sustainable
Coastal Tourism Project in IHT, which has demonstrated experience with project management, financial
reporting, and procurement procedures. This PCU consists of a Director, Financial Officer, Procurement
Officer, Accountant, Administrative Assistant, and recently hired Communications and Monitoring and
Evaluation Specialists. Terms of Reference with clear definition of roles and responsibilities of the staff
were approved by IDA before effectiveness of the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project and all staff has
been selected competitively. For the new project, the PCU will be enhanced with additional staff to
handle budgeting, accounting, and procurement and a small branch will be established in Copan with a
Coordinator, Procurement Assistant, and IHAH representation.
IHT is a deconcentrated, autonomous agency reporting to the Ministry of Tourism, established in 1993
(Decree No. 103-93). IHT has the responsibility for tourism policy, planning, implementation, acquisition
of technical assistance, and tourism promotion. The Director of IHT also functions as the Minister of
Tourism. IHT has a National Tourism Council, a body that consists of public and private sector
representatives which meets regularly to approve the budget and policy direction. IHT is currently
managing the Sustainable Coastal Tourism LIL and the IDB Bay Islands Environmental Management
Project. The Institute has developed strong capacity over the last year and has spearheaded many
initiatives related to tourism development, including participatory strategic planning and the development
of targeted marketing and promotional materials.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Taking into consideration a Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) prepared in 1999 by the IDB
using the World Bank model, the main problems in Honduras are: (a) outdated and incomplete legal
framework and procedures that, in some cases, conflict with Bank procurement policy; (b) lack of
oversight and coordination; (c) lack of standardization; and (d) poor procurement capacity. Despite these
findings, previous operations have not presented any serious conflicts between Bank's policy and
domestic legislation. A new CPAR, as part of a joint IDB-World Bank effort, is under preparation as part
of Bank support to the Government through PRSC operation. The PRSC requires a new CPAR and an
agreement with the GoH on an action plan to tackle the identified procurement issues.
A Procurement Capacity Assessment was carried out of the current PCU in IHT and the Capacity
Assessment was approved by the Regional Procurement Advisor Office on March 24, 2003. It was agreed
that this PCU will serve as the coordinating unit for the Copan Project and will be responsible for all the
procurement financed by the project. The assessment shows that this unit has adequate capacity to carry
out the proposed procurement activities, with additional staff to assist in procurement and accounting.
The following Procurement Action Plan has been agreed with GoH:
Procurement Action Plan
Planning:
a) A detailed procurement plan for first year of the project.  Complied by negotiations.
Code of EtCocs:                                To be included in Operational Manual.
b) A draft Code of Ethics will be developed for the project
staff.

Staffing:                                        Before effectiveness.
c) Appointment of procurement assistant for the PCU.
Training:                                     At project launch workshop and during the life
d) Specific procurement training to procurement staff of  of the project and on-the-job training by PCU
the different implementing agencies.          procurement specialist.
Procedures:                                      As a condition of effectiveness.
e) Operational Manual (OM) should describe clearly the
procedures, methodologies, coordinating arrangements, filing
and records, and internal control mechanisms for all
procurement and related disbursement activities to be carried
out by the different agencies and the PCU.
The GoH has requested the involvement of Asociaci6n Copan, a local non-governmental entity
specialized in archeological work, in part of Component 1. This option will be pursued as a sole source
contract (See Annex 6 for additional information).
4.4 Financial management issues:
The Bank (led by this project's Financial Management Specialist) is currently carrying out a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). The final results are expected in May 2003. Initial results
show that the GoH faces various obstacles that prevent operational efficiency, sound personnel
management, and effective external oversight. The Financial Management Assessment for this project
considered some of the weaknesses identified by the technical analysis of the CFAA, which have been
reflected in the proposed implementation arrangements for the project.
The Financial Management Assessment shows that the PCU in IHT has a well-established finance and
accounting division, with clear policies, rules and procedures in place. The PCU has the capacity to
handle the financial management and reporting requirements for the new project. Several actions were
identified as part of the Financial Management Action Plan (see Annex 6).
The project financial statements, along with the physical progress and procurement sections of the
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), will be submitted to the Bank on a semi-annual basis, and will be
submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of 6-month period. The contents of the FMRs
have been discussed and an initial design has been agreed.
Audit. There are no outstanding audit issues for EHT as the first audit for the Sustainable Coastal
Tourism Project will be due by June 30, 2003. Annual project financial statements will be audited in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing, by independent private auditors (X) acceptable to
the Bank and in accordance with the terms of reference (TORs) already reviewed and cleared by the
Bank. Audits will be financed by the Bank. Standard project special purpose financial statements and
audit opinions on project financial statements, Special Accounts and Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
will be required. The reports will be required to be submitted to the Bank no later than 4 months
following the end of the fiscal year (January - December).
Special Account. Credit funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for Bank
funds to be held at the Central Bank of Honduras), which will be utilized for the purposes of the
implementation arrangements agreed and will be managed by IHT. The special account will be
replenished via the use of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) due to the experience that IHT already has
utilizing the traditional method of disbursements under the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project.

Fondo Prosperidad. It is expected that an NGO will be selected, as per Bank procurement procedures, for
the administration of the Fondo Prosperidad. The advances to subprojects will be considered as eligible
expenditures with respect to disbursement of funds from the Special Account. The subprojects will be
approved based on the policies, procedures, and criteria detailed in Annex 2, Annex 6 and in the
Operational Manual.
S. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
An Environmental Assessment was carried out with visits to the five project areas, consultations with
involved officials, review of existing information and maps, and consultation with the Protected Areas
Department in SERNA. The EA category of B is confirmed.
No major environmental impacts are envisioned in this project; however the EA does highlight potential
synergistic impacts that may be caused by tourist development such as: unplanned park development;
increase in neighboring populations; the impact of a larger number of visitors on natural and cultural
resources; an increase in demand for public services such as water and electricity; and the generation of
waste and garbage. The project will seek to reduce the impacts caused by tourism development by
including a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) within the Management Plans for each park and
site. The EA document provides a conceptual model for the development of participatory Management
Plans (Annex 4 of EA), which can be adapted to the needs of each particular area. The Management
Plans will include a detailed monitoring plan to identify and mitigate any potential problems.
Infrastructure sub-components will entail mainly the rehabilitation and/or expansion of existing
infrastructure. Impacts from new infrastructure such as expansion of existing electric transmission lines
and archeological research laboratories will be direct and localized in specific areas. The EA
recommends three methodological tools to be applied for infrastructure activities: (a) guide for
categorization of projects based on type of project and level of sensitivity, taking into account the
Safeguard Policies of the Bank; (b) fieldwork checklist to determine potential social and environmental
impacts of infrastructure subprojects; and (c) an environmental manual for all infrastructure subprojects
which addresses among other items: site selection, construction activities and environmental
specifications for contractors, preventative measures, security, communication with community,
chance-finding procedures, and environmental supervision during the construction. Models and formats
for these tools are included in the full EA document. The PCU will be responsible for ensuring execution
of the SEAs, screening of the works, and application of the construction manuals.
There are not expected to be any significant environmental impacts from the subprojects implemented by
the Fondo Prosperidad. This Fund can actually serve to support the environmental education programs.
Criteria will be specified in the Operational Manual with an emphasis on ecological and environmental
awareness.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
The main recommendations of the EA are reflected in the project design with a specific provision for a
SEA as part of each Management Plan. The SEA will include the tools needed to appropriately evaluate
social and environmental impacts and subproject screening criteria and procedures for all infrastructure
activities. Site-specific EMPs for each infrastructure component based on the methodological tools
presented in the EA will be prepared during implementation.

5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: March 4, 2003
The EA was received on March 4, 2003 and submitted to the InfoShop on March 7, 2003. It was
approved by LCSES/QAT on March 24, 2003 and made available in Honduras in the Resident Mission,
the PCU for the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and the
Environment (SERNA). The findings of the assessment have been made available to key stakeholder
groups.
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe
mechanisms of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
The main stakeholders (representing the Ministries of Tourism and Culture, IHT, IHAH, Finance, and
SERNA; representatives from a local nonprofit organization, consultants, and PCU staff) participated in
a two-day logical framework planning session in February 2003 with participation of the Environmental
Specialist. The main environmental issues were discussed and the Environmental Assessment process
was explained. The Environmental Specialist also visited all project sites and discussed proposed project
activities with IHAH and IHT staff, and other associated specialists.
The Management Plan for Copan Archeological Park, financed by the PROFUTURO Project, included
consultation with local residents, nonprofit organizations, and experts. During project implementation,
the Management Plans with SEAs for El Puente, Los Naranjos, Cerro Palenque, and Plan Grande will be
informed by a wide consultation process with stakeholders in each respective locale. This process will be
guided by the recommendations from the EA and the model used for the development of the Management
Plan for Copan.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
The project is designed to establish a framework for environmental protection and natural resource
management through the development and implementation of comprehensive Management Plans,
including a SEA. The EA recognized the complementary value of nearby National Parks and resulted in
the incorporation of an impact indicator as follows: increase by 100 percent the number of hectares
managed in an ecologically sustainable manner at end of project. In addition, Management Plans will
include definition of monitoring indicators related to public use and carrying capacity.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The key social issues related to the project objectives are: (a) high levels of unemployment due to the
recent coffee crisis; (b) local residents are unfamiliar with how the private sector operates and have
limited capacity in terms of marketing and commercialization for tourism development; (c) increasing
price of land forcing poorer residents to move to outlying areas; (d) extremely low education levels,
particularly in rural areas; (e) indigenous communities having successfully recuperated their traditional
lands but, for several reasons, are still not using them productively; (f) strong and growing Chorti
movement which is leading to a resurgence of indigenous culture and pride; (g) growing disparity in
degrees of organization in rural communities; and (h) serious gender disparities and segregation of roles,
where women work more than men but have much less access to decision making resources, particularly
in the guiding profession, an area that concems the project and where men dominate (see Annexes 11 and
12).
- 24 -



The social development outcomes are related to full participation of the excluded populations in the
regional development of zone and equitable access to the resources and opportunities provided by
tourism. The main outcomes include: (a) building social capital through capacity-building programs; (b)
strengthening community organizations; (c) building skills in marketing and commercialization; (d)
increasing the employment rate in the project areas; (e) increasing the number of small enterprises run by
local residents; (f) expanding employment and income-generating opportunities; and (g) promoting
gender equality in employment, income-generation, and leadership opportunities.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
During the analysis of the social and indigenous issues, the local populations were consulted through
focus groups in rural and urban areas and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in the project
areas, including patronatos (created by municipalities in each community or barrio to serve as liaison
between municipal authorities and civil society--most rural communities have gender mixed patronatos
and women only), municipal and community authorities (in Copan, El Puente, and Pimienta), leaders of
the Consejo Nacional de Indigenas Maya Chort( de Honduras (CONIMCHH - National Council of
Indigenous Chorti Maya of Honduras); and the private sector (owners of hotels and restaurants).
Local residents and communities will continue to be involved in the project through the following
mechanisms: (a) involvement of a local nonprofit organization in technical assistance of part of
Component 1; (b) CONIMCHH will be consulted during the preparation of the pre-feasibility study and
implementation of Income Generation Opportunity component; (c) participation in project activities
including training events and capacity building programs; and (d) ongoing participatory monitoring and
evaluation.
Finally, key stakeholders participated in project design through meetings during the Bank mission travel
and an intensive two-day Logical Framework planning session held in February 2003. This session
included over 30 participants and the participation of high-level government representatives from all
involved agencies, nonprofit representatives, consultants, and PCU staff. The workshop served to
develop a consensus on the project objectives, activities, indicators, risks, and implementation
arrangements.
During its preparation, the project design benefited from the Norwegian Trust Fund for Gender
Mainstreaming (GENFUND) implemented in Copan under the PROFUTURO Project (See Annex 12).
The Genfund used a highly participatory approach to integrate Maya Chortf women in the increasing
tourism flow in the area. The activities included training and capacity-building and identification of
potential income-generating opportunities.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
A local nonprofit organization experienced in archeological work has advised on project design issues.
Government has requested that this local non-governmental entity provide technical assistance for part of
Component 1. The Chorti organization CONIMCHH and the organized women's groups in the rural areas
were consulted during the analysis of social and indigenous issues. It is expected that they will continue
to be involved during implementation in the Income Generation Opportunities Component to advise on
issues specific to the rural areas and income generation potential. They may also benefit from the
capacity building and training activities.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
- 25 -



A local non-profit organization (Asociaci6n Copan) is expected to be contracted to provide technical
assistance for part of Component 1. The proposed institutional arrangements will take advantage of the
strong project management capacity of the existing PCU of the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project. This
project will involve IHT and IHAH. IlT already has experience with an Implementation Agreement with
IHAH in the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project. For the Copan Valley Project, a Technical Support
Agreement will be established with IHT to facilitate the participation of IHAH in technical support and
development of terms of reference related to the archeological sites. Also, a high-level Advisory
Committee, to be convened by IHT, will plan, monitor, and evaluate all steps of the project's
implementation. The Committee will consist of the Ministries of Finance, Tourism and Culture, the
Director of IHAH, local mayors, and local-level government agencies and nongovernmental
organizations involved in the sector. Also, local Indigenous Maya Chorti and women's organizations will
collaborate with the government and participate in the preparation and implementation of Components 1
and 2, particularly Fondo Prosperidad.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The performance monitoring indicators include attention to social impacts and social development
outcomes. A comprehensive baseline study will be carried out during the first six months of
implementation to help inform the ongoing monitoring and evaluation during implementation.
Participatory monitoring, with the involvement of community groups and organizations, is anticipated to
reorient training and technical assistance as needed and identify the level of satisfaction with project
activities. The project will incorporate a framework for learning about the employment impacts of
archeological site restoration, with information gathering on jobs created (both seasonal and permanent).
The progress will be evaluated at the mid-termn and conclusion of the project.
At the level of impacts, initial indicators include: at least 15 percentage points increase in the
employment rate in the project areas at EOP; and an increase of 100 percent in the number of small, local
enterprises in the region (with an increase of 35 percent of indigenous enterprises) created and
functioning sustainably at EOP. Specific to the Income Generation Opportunity component, the main
indicator is the number of tourism initiatives created, including specifically for women or the indigenous
and employment disaggregated by type of work, gender, and ethnicity. These indicators will be further
refined based on the findings of the baseline study. It is expected that implementation arrangements will
be flexible and respond to ongoing M&E findings.

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
Environmental Assessment. An Environmental Assessment with visits to all project areas was carried
out, taking into account the requirements of the Natural Habitats and Cultural Property safeguards. The
EA has resulted in specific recommendations for the development and implementation of Management
Plans and for infrastructure improvements and construction, which are reflected in the EA Section (E. 5
above).
Cultural Property. A reconnaissance field visit of project areas was carried out by an archeologist, an
environmental specialist, and a social scientist. An updated reconnaissance survey of the cultural
property of each site is maintained by IHAH. Through the preparation and implementation of
comprehensive, participatory Management Plans prior to investments, the project will help prevent any
damage, destruction, or theft of cultural property. The cultural property aspects of the project were
consulted with a local, well-respected nonprofit organization with extensive experience in archeological
research and education. Indeed, the objective of the project is to create conditions for the preservation the
cultural patrimony of the country, currently endangered given lack of security in the Archeological Parks
and Sites.
Indigenous Peoples. As the largest proportion of beneficiaries are indigenous peoples (specifically the
Maya Chortis), the project itself is designed to follow the principles of the Bank's Indigenous Peoples
Policy and should thus be understood as an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).
The Involuntary Resettlement Policy is not triggered, as the EA and social analysis indicate that there
are not expected to be any restrictions or prohibitions on populations living near the archeological sites.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability of the project depends to a large extent on a strong and growing tourism industry in
Honduras, particularly in the Copan Valley and surrounding areas. Tourism grew by 20 percent in 2002
and it is expected to continue to increase. Honduras has many attractions and the Government is currently
placing a priority on the development of new destinations to draw a greater number of tourists and
encourage longer stays. The Economic Evaluation indicates that the project is likely to be financially and
econornically profitable. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project's profitability will be sensitive to
the flow of visitors and to the number of days they stay in Honduras. This implies that the project's
success requires the effective promotion of these archeological sites as tourist destinations, and on the
supply of tourism products and services that will make it more attractive for tourists to stay longer and
spend more money. Both aspects are backed by specific components in the project's design.
The implementation of Management Plans with an integrated conservation approach will preserve these
attractions for future visitors, increasing the sustainability of the cultural and natural resources. The fiscal
impact of visitors' entrance fees is significant, for they will provide for future operation and maintenance
needs in these parks/sites.-

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The main controversial aspect is the optimal use of revenue generated by the Copan Archeological Park.
This issue is currently under discussion between the central government and the municipality. The
project has included two dated covenants in the Development Credit Agreement related to this issue: (a)
carry out a study on the optimal use of the revenue for the Copan Archeological Park to identify its
impact on the financing of IHAH (no later than 12 months after Effectiveness); and (b) Advisory
Committee shall develop a proposal on the mechanism for the optimal use of revenue generated in the
upgraded archeological parks and sites (no later than 24 months after Effectiveness).
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment, currently under preparation as part of the PRSC, has
identified several problems with the revenue and collections office and the issue of financial transfers to
municipalities has been identified as a key issue on the decentralization topic in the PRSC. Several
studies are currently under preparation to identify legislation gaps, financial systems, capacity issues, and
specific sector issues.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
HONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
The project is expected to take four years to implement. The project has the following components:
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$6.90 million
Integrated Development of Archeological Parks and Sites
The objective of this component is to assist the GoH to implement an integrated program of tourism
infrastructure and participatory management that links the main parks and sites of the region - Copan, El
Puente, Los Naranjos, Cerro Palenque and Plan Grande - in an archeological-ecological tourist circuit.
This concept is based on the: (a) preservation and management of environmental resources; (b) respect
for the social and cultural diversity of the resident population; (c) partnership between local and
international research communities; and (d) promotion of attractive tourism opportunities for private
investors. There are five subcomponents:
A. Sub-component Implementation of the Copdn Archeological Park Management Plan. Copan has
been managed as a protected area since the 1950s and the first Management Plan was developed in 1982.
The entire Copan Valley including all the archeological ruins (even those on private land) was declared a
National Monument in 1984. An updated Management Plan covering the entire Valley was financed by
the PROFUTURO Project and carried out during 2000-2002. This Plan addresses the measures needed to
prevent further deterioration of the archeological ruins and establishes priorities for investments in
preservation, restoration, security, and interpretation. This subcomponent will finance the priorities
resulting from this Management Plan and environmental and cultural education activities. Two activities
will be financed under this subcomponent:
(a)    Implementation of priorities identified in the PROFUTURO-financed Management Plan
including: (i) a Natural Resource Management Plan to restore and protect the park and its surrounding
areas (activities including: investigation, monitoring, and scientific cooperation; protection of native
species; natural resource management and conservation strategies); (ii) a Public Use Plan to disseminate
knowledge about ruins to visitors; improve linkages among all parts of the park; integrate all museums in
the same archeological-ecological tourism circuit; (iii) Interpretation and Security Plan with signs and
security infrastructure for park and museums (activities including: making and improving trails,
interpretative signs, safety for visitors, maps, fences, video cameras, alarms, identification and repair of
vandalism); (iv) Community Outreach Plan to promote knowledge and visits from local residents
(activities including: social communications, public relations, recreation, community learning
opportunities); (v) an Infrastructure Plan to execute small civil works to increase the flow of tourists,
including: enhancement of the Visitor's Center, ticketing center, and parking (design financed by IDB);
Sculpture Museum repair; protection of monuments and sculptures; strengthening of underground tunnels
(there are three kilometers of tunnels and only about 40 percent have been consolidated-the rest are in
urgent need of consolidation with stone and concrete so they do not cave in); improvements in the
Regional Archeology Museum; and improvements in the Regional Center for Archeological Research
(contains administrative offices, research laboratories, inventories of items removed from the site); and
(vi) a Monitoring Plan to collect information about visitors in order to plan future expansion (activities
including: monitoring limits of acceptable change, numbers of visitors, ticket sales, time waiting for
tickets, popular sites, use of trails and paths, number and use of guides, visitor satisfaction).
- 35 -



(b)    Environmental and cultural education for children andfamilies on biodiversity and the
historical characteristics of the Copdn Valley. The Casa K'inich, a small interactive learning center in
Copan for children and families was financed by the PROFUTURO Project and is now visited by over
1,000 students a month. This activity will finance: (i) expansion of Casa K'inich and enhancement of its
surroundings; (ii) development and/or acquisition of cultural and environmental education materials for
students and families to be used by Casa K'inich; (iii) development of community outreach programs by
Casa K'inich; and (iv) new interactive educational materials to be developed in other parks and sites
involved in the project.
B. Sub-component Development of El Puente Archeological Park in the Copdn Cultural Tourism
Circuit. The El Puente Park, located close to Copan along the road to San Pedro Sula, is smaller, but it is
currently the second most important archeological site available to tourists. The objective of this
subcomponent is to include El Puente in the same Copdn Park tourism circuit by improving its facilities,
promoting research, and enhancing visitor attractions. Three activities will be financed under this
subcomponent:
(a)    Development of a Management Plan that will include inter alia: (i) a Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) of the park with recommendations for its preservation, for the archeological
investigation to be conducted, and for planning future use given its unique characteristics; (ii) community
outreach planning; (iii) plan for interpretation with recommendations on how to improve accessibility for
local residents and visitors; and (iv) public use plan with recommendations for future expansion of the
park.
(b)    Implementation of the Management Plan priorities.
(c)    Promotion of tourism in the park through: (i) enhancement and expansion of the Visitor's
Center; (ii) rehabilitation of the parking space; (iii) expansion of transmission line or generator to bring
electricity to the park; (iv) security infrastructure; (v) construction and equipping of a visible laboratory
for archeological research, cleaning, and restoration; and (vi) reconstruction of a Maya village and Maya
household from circa 8th century A.D.
C. Sub-component Development of Cerro Palenque Archeological Site. Cerro Palenque is located on
the sides and top of a hill near the confluence of the luhia and Comayagua river valleys near San Pedro
Sula and it is the only archeological site remaining in the Sula Valley. The site has significant potential in
terms of archeological interest and natural resources, but it is not developed for visitors. Three activities
will be financed under this sub-component:
(a)    Development of a Management Plan that will include inter alia: (i) a SEA of the site with
recommendations for its preservation, for the archeological works to be conducted, and for planning
future use given its unique characteristics; (ii) community outreach planning; (iii) plan for interpretation
with recommendations on how to improve accessibility to local residents and visitors; and (iv) public use
plan with recommendations for future expansion of the site.
(b)    Implementation of the Management Plan priorities.
(c)    Promotion of tourism in the site through: (i) rehabilitation of access road; (ii) construction and
equipping of a Visitor's Center with parking and a laboratory for archeological research; (iii) expansion
of electricity and water; and (iv) installation of security infrastructure.

D. Subcomponent Development of Los Naranjos Eco-Archeological Park. To the east of Copan, the
Los Naranjos Eco-Archeological Park, is located in a forest along Lake Yojoa and contains an extensive.
set of non-Maya ruins of a civilization one thousand years older than the Maya. The park is located in a
natural habitat in an extremely fragile area. Los Naranjos is a relatively underdeveloped park with rich
biodiversity characteristics. This subcomponent will finance some infrastructure improvements, but the
park will largely remain an environmental attraction with archeological research planned in order to not
cause any negative impacts. Three activities will be financed under this sub-component:
(a)    Development of a Management Plan that will include inter alia: (i) a SEA of the park with
recommendations for its preservation, for the archeological works to be conducted, natural resource
management, and for planning future use given its unique characteristics; (ii) community outreach
planning; (iii) plan for interpretation with recommendations on how to improve accessibility to local
residents and visitors; and (iv) public use plan with recommendations for future expansion of the park.
(b)    Implementation of the Management Plan priorities.
(c)    Promotion of tourism in the park through: (i) enhancement of the existing Visitor's Center; (ii)
rehabilitation of the parking space; (iii) rehabilitation of the access road; (iv) security infrastructure; (v)
construction and equipping of a laboratory for archeological research; (vi) construction of a small
Interactive Environmental Learning Center for children based on the biodiversity of the park.
E. Subcomponent Development of Plan Grande in Guanaja. The Plan Grande archeological site,
located on the island of Guanaja in the Bay Islands is the only Maya site in the Caribbean. This site
complements the tourism complex accessible through San Pedro Sula and provides a diversification of
attractions in the Bay Islands. Two activities will be financed under this subcomponent:
(a)    Development of a Management Plan that will include inter alia: (i) a SEA of the site with
recomrnendations for its preservation, for the archeological works to be conducted, and for planning
future use given its unique characteristics; (ii) community outreach planning; (iii) plan for interpretation
with recommendations on how to improve accessibility to local residents and visitors; and (iv) public use
plan with recommendations for future expansion of the site.
(b)    Implementation of the Management Plan priorities.

Project Component 2 - US$2.90 million
Income Generation Opportunities
The objective of this component is to assist the GoH to take advantage of the expected tourism inflow to
foster income generation opportunities for the populations in the project areas, particularly the very poor.
It draws on lessons learned from the Nicaragua Rural Municipalities Project - Protierra; Mexico Gender
Equity Project - Generosidad and two grants associated with the PROFUTURO Project in Cop6n: a
PHRD for implementation and the GENFUND (which piloted income generation activities for poor
residents, particularly women). This subcomponent will support incentives for the poorest women and
households in the Copan Valley and surrounding areas as a means to obtain employment or a source of
sustainable income. There are two subcomponents:
A. Sub-component Local Capacity Building. Three capacity building windows will be financed:
(a)    Specialized technical training to build capacity of local residents in skills needed for the
development and enhancement of the archeological sites financed under Component 1. This training will
target current and potential technicians, archeology assistants, conservation and restoration assistants,
laboratory assistants, paraprofessionals, and local workers required for archeological research and
investigation.
(b)    Capacity building for local residents as eco/archeological guides for the archeological parks and
sites, surrounding museums, and other tourism-related activities. Training topics may include: the Maya,
history and descriptions of the parks and sites, museums and villages in area, natural resources
management, main tourist attractions, basic English, and communication skills. The training will also be
periodically updated with new information.
(c)    Capacity building in tourism services delivery for local residents including tourism operators and
municipal staff in the tourism service sector and/or in technical and administrative positions related to
tourism development.
B. Subcomponent Income Generation. Three activities will be financed:
(a)    Pre-feasibility study (contracted by the PCU) to identify profitable market niches for the
development of tourism-related income generation opportunities;
(b)    Development of capacity building, training and technical assistance programs (by a firm
contracted by the PCU according to Bank procurement procedures) to respond to tourism increase for
small local tourism operators and local services providers, including indigenous communities, in addition
to funding other studies and activities related to sustainable development, including the preparation of
future investment projects;
(c)    Through Fondo Prosperidad, make resources available to subprojects that respond to market
niches identified by the pre-feasibility study menu, including capacity building, training and
commercialization. The menu of the Fund will be defined through a pre-feasibility study contracted by
the PCU within the first six months of the project. The menu will be appropriate to the characteristics of
the visitors of archeological parks/sites, potential channels of commercialization, and local traditions.
The fund will be financed by Credit proceeds and it is expected that a NGO (Management Agency), will
be selected according to Bank procedures to administer the subprojects. The Agency will have
experience in the management of subprojects and a history of trust dealing with communities. It will also
have a presence and a staff in the area. At least one representative of a local organization will participate
in the decisions of the Agency regarding the Fund. The Agency will report financially and in terms of
- 38 -



development results each six months to the PCU. The Agency will identify subprojects and request IHT
to disburse funds for the subprojects to the Agency, which will then disburse to beneficiary groups.
Disbursements to the Management Agency will be based on the commitments of the Agency with
beneficiaries and on the results achieved each six months.
Proponents for proposals should be communities recognized by customary law according to the
principles accepted by indigenous community organizations in the area. Proposals will be selected based
on the linkages with the menu and an analysis by the Agency of their economic return potential. The
Agency will be able to assist proponents to make proposals with potential, to fit those criteria. If more
proposals are presented than funds allow, a committee of specialists will be selected to make the
allocation. All participants in a proposal should sign off their contractual obligation and reporting,
according to procedures proposed by the Management Agency. Proposals are estimated at a maximum of
$25,000. The amount of resources to be disbursed will depend on the type of activity to be financed, and
also based on the results of the financial reporting of the activities carried out. Communities will sign an
agreement with the Management Agency prior to receiving funds, detailing a 10 percent cash or in-kind
contribution, and will present reports, to the Management Agency every three months. Communities will
choose from a list of qualified technical assistance/training providers.
This Fondo is based on the successful experience of Porto Sol in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil which has
been studied by the Bank and presented in several best practice workshops sponsored by the Bank. The
Operational Manual of the Project will detail all the procedures and be presented to the Bank as a
condition of effectiveness.
Project Component 3 - US$ 3.50 million
Institutional Development
The objective of this component is to assist the GoH to design and operate a program of institutional
strengthening in tourism/cultural management for public, private, and civil society actors at national and
local levels. This component will also support coordination of the project and capacity building in project
management, including finance and administration, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation. There
are two subcomponents:
A. Subcomponent Institutional Strengthening and Communications. This subcomponent will fmnance
institutional strengthening for IHT, 1HAH, and SCAD; a strategic participatory plan for development of
archeological-ecological tourism circuit including technical assistance and training for municipalities; a
marketing and promotion strategy; and a social communications strategy.
B. Subcomponent Enhance Project Coordination Unit/Monitoring and Evaluation. This subcomponent
will finance enhancement of the existing Project Coordination Unit and the Monitoring and Evaluation
system. The existing PCU will add personnel to handle the increased responsibility. It will also finance
the creation of a branch of the PCU in Copan. This component will finance the recruitment of
international and national specialists for short periods of time to provide training and carry out studies
related to project implementation. A Baseline Study will be financed and regular monitoring and
evaluation of project activities will be carried out.

Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
HONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
Summary of Benefits and Costs:
This project makes a public investment in public goods (archeological parks and sites, roads and
the like) and private goods (training and financing for small tourism businesses), to promote growth in
the tourism industry. The benefits expected from the project's implementation are additional jobs,
production and incomes in the project's areas of influence and the increased flow of tourist demand takes
up the slack in the hotel industry.
At present, occupation rates in the hotel industry in Copan Ruins and the Yojoa lake area are
very low, estimated at under 20 percent. The project will invest in the development of additional visitor
attractions, will support the marketing of the industry and will strengthen the capacity of private actors to
provide good quality services of the sort demanded by visitors. This should lead to a rapid increase in the
flow of visitors.
The project's rate of return is analyzed in terms of the relationship between the stream of costs
incurred both publicly (the project costs) and privately (the costs of the industry) due to the project's
intervention, compared with the incremental revenues to be derived by tourism industries in the zone of
influence as a result of the project. In the first variant of the analysis, all the costs and benefits are
analyzed at their market prices. The financial IRR is estimated at 20.7 percent.
The project's economic rate of return was analyzed by comparing the public investment cost of
the project with the project's stream of expected net benefits in terms of additional net incomes to
Honduran factors of production. In this variant of the analysis the costs and benefits are all accounted for
at their economic opportunity costs. The economic IRR is estimated at 20.5 percent.
The distributive and fiscal impact of the project was analyzed to determine the distribution of the
costs and benefits between the public sector (public investment and tax revenues) and the private sector
(additional factor incomes, net of taxes).
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to identify the impact of changes in key assumptions. The
critical assumptions are those related to the growth of the number of tourists and the number of days they
stay overnight. The rates of return are found to be reasonably robust in the face of changes in the key
parameters of the model.
The project's macroeconomic impact via the strengthening of the Balance of Payments is likely
to be very positive. This component of the benefits is not incorporated into the rate of return analysis. As
a result, the estimated rate of return should be considered a lower bound estimate.
1. Sector Context and Project Strategy
In recent years, according to data from IHT, between 20 percent and 25 percent of tourists in
Honduras visit the archeological sites located in the Copan Valley, especially Copan Ruins. However,
only 3.5 percent of the visitors to Copan Ruins spend the night in the city, reporting an average 2.6 days
stay. According to our analysis of Instituto Hondurenio del Turismo (IHT) data, the average occupation
rate for hotels in Copan Ruins the Yojoa area (which is the zone of influence for Los Naranjos
Archeological Park and Cerro Palenque archeological site) is under 20 percent. Hotel industry sources in
Copan Ruins (interviews with hotel owners) estimate occupancy in Copan ruins at 54 percent, but this is
not consistent with the data supplied by IHT. This point is discussed in more detail in section 2.
In this context, the Copan Valley Project intends to boost tourism development and to increase
the income of Copan Valley residents, through an increase in the flow of visitors to the different
archeological sites that make up the circuit, and an increase in the amount of time that tourists stay to
visit the area, and in their daily expenditures on tourism products, helping to realize the potential of the
installed capacity of the tourist industry in the areas.

It will also develop new sites near to Copan and in other areas of Honduras (the Yojoa lake area
and Plan Grande on the island of Guanaja) in order to increase the attraction of Honduras for tourists
interested in this sort of product. Based on the experience acquired with the Copan Ruins Archeological
Park over the last two decades, the Project will develop and implement archeological restoration and
management plans in four other sites at El Puente, Los Naranjos, Cerro Palenque and Plan Grande. All of
these have potential to replicate in future years the recent increases in the flow of visitors to Copan.
The project's timing is good, since the Government has prioritized tourism as one of the key
sectors for the country's economic development. There is much expectation and interest from the private
sector in providing complementary tourism products (bird observatories, tour operators, tourist guides,
souvenirs and quality local products). Private investors have shown strong interest in the sector and its
potential. In 2003, private investment established a landing strip at Copan Ruins, and the government is
promoting the construction of an airport at Rfo Amarillo, near Copan.
This is a classic situation where public-private cooperation can help unleash the economic
potential of an industry in which Honduras is known to have high competitive potential in the
international market. Conditions are ripe for investments to improve the quality of the principal tourist
attractions that will provide the main underlying motive for future visitor flows, and for working to help
the industry develop its products to promote these attractions and then meet the increased flow of
demand.
2. Methodology
2.1.   Data sources
The projections are based on data from IHT, which carries out an annual Establishment Inventory
and Tourism Spending Survey, which is available for the last three years. The data give numbers of
visits, length of stay and spending per visit-day, separating the reported totals according to the visitor's
national origin. These data were validated and adjusted based on the information directly acquired in site
visits and in key informant interviews, carried out by the study team.
The study also draws on labor market data from the Honduran Govemment's national bi-annual
multi-purpose household survey and on data for the cost structure of the industry that were gathered
specially for this study. Table A8, at the end of this report, presents a more detailed description of the
type of data utilized, specifying the corresponding source in case of secondary data, and the assumptions
made in case of data constructed within the model.
2.2. Scenarios
For analysis purposes, three scenarios are set: one scenario without a project, one scenario with a
project and medium expectations, and one scenario with a project and high expectations. Projections are
made for 15 years (2003-2017). At the new sites to be developed, visits are expected to start to grow
quickly only after the 4th year, when the project's investment is completed.
The modeling parameters for these scenarios were established according to interviews with key
informants and with experts on Honduras' tourism industry. The characteristics of the scenarios are as
follows:
Scenario 1: Without project scenario. The projection is made considering parameters and growth
rates based on recent performance and the present level of tourist spending and visits.
Scenario 2: With project scenario - medium expectations. The project's investment costs were
distributed among the years for its execution and among the different sites to be supported. The
parameters for the variables in the model were adjusted to reflect a moderate increase in the number of
visits, in the average length of stay and in spending per day, due to the program' s implementation.
Scenario 3: With project scenario - high expectations. The parameters for each variable are
adjusted assuming a very favorable performance.
The parameters used and their expected performance in each of the scenarios are summarized in Table 1.

* Expected growth rates dunng first years/ and expected growth rates for final years.
The projected growth rates in the "with project" scenarios are quite high: 15 percent a year in the
most important sites in the medium scenario and as much as 20 percent in the high scenario. At first glace
they might seem unrealistic. However, the projections were constructed after careful conversations with
industry specialists.
The key to the reasonableness of these projections is to be found in the low starting point, which
is due in part to the impact of the September 11th attacks and continuing unease about airline travel. This
explains why projected growth even without the project is quite high, due to an expected "bounce-back"
when the international security climate improves.
Table 2 details the numbers of visitors and ovemight stays implicit in the medium scenario. At
present, a very smallproportion of visitors stay overnight (3.5 percent). This leads in tum to a very low
base level of overnight visits, which makes it reasonable to project a pretty fast rate of growth in the
number of overnight visitors.
At present, according to Tourism Ministry data, on an average night, only 90 people are staying
ovemight while visiting any of these sites. Even with the high growth rates of visitor numbers and
modest increase in the percentage who stay overnight assumed in the medium scenario (up from 3.5
percent to 6 percent), the average total number of people projected to be staying overnight while visiting
one of these attractions per night only reaches 508 in 2017.
Given the size of the market for Central American / Mexican tourism and the quality of these
attractions, this target is well within the reach of the Honduran tourist sector.

Table 2 also underlines another important point about the rationality of the project: the existing
number of hotel rooms is sufficient to allow a large increase in demand before the industry reaches its
capacity constraints. This point is further discussed in Section 3.2.
3. Financial Analysis
3.1.     Benefits stream
The project's benefits derive mainly from increased spending by national and foreign tourists
who will visit the supported archeological sites and will increase their average stay in the areas. This
spending is classified into entrance fees to the sites, hotel expenses, food, use of tourist guides, and
consumption of other available goods and services, based on the Tourism Spending Survey of 2002. The
survey shows that spending varies according to the tourists' origin (nationality).
If recent trends were to continue (Without Project Scenario), at the end of the 15th year, visits to
Copan Ruins would be 1.8 times the level observed in 2002 (244,000); while at El Puente, it would rise
from 6,700 to 24,100 visitors; at Los Naranjos there would be 91,000 people (from 16,900 in 2002); and
at Cerro Palenque it would increase to nearly 12,000 visitors.
Table Al presents the projection for tourist flow expected under the parameters of the With
Project - Moderate impact scenario. Under this scenario the total number of visitors would increase from
159,183 in 2002 to 242,549 in 2005, to 500,000 in 2010 and to 1,150,000 in the year 2017. As argued in
Section 2, although these growth rates seem high, they are not unreasonable, given the very low starting
point.
The growth rates are different, based on each site's initial situation. By the end of 15 years
Copan Ruins would have 4.3 times the number of visitors received in 2002. El Puente would receive one
third of Copan Ruins' total. Los Naranjos would receive an equivalent to 46 percent of Copan Ruins'
visitors; while Cerro Palenque would receive an equivalent to 43 percent of Los Naranjos' visitors. In
each case these volumes of tourists would be within the archeological parks and sites' estimated
load-bearing capacity. Copan Ruins currently has the greatest load, with 135,000 visitors between 8 and
11 in the morning. The total number of visits could be increased considerably by making a better
distribution of visits throughout norrnal business hours (interviews with archeologists).
The income stream is made up by spending from visitors to the sites and from tourists that stay
overnight in the project's zone of influence. These estimates are based on survey data for tourist
expenditures at market prices in lempiras, converted to dollars at the present official nominal exchange
rate.
- 44 -



Annex table A2 sumrnarizes the projections for income from entrance fees to archeological sites,
hotel, food, local transportation, various purchases (including souvenirs and other tourism products and
services) and payment for use of archeological guides. The projections were generated in site-specific
analysis also taking account of the nationality structure of the visitor flow and are available in project
files.
The Present Value for this income flow during the 15 years of the projection is US$107.8
million, discounted at 11.5 percent (medium scenario). In scenario 3 this rises to $188.4 million. The
increase in the Present Value of the income flow in the medium scenario, compared with the baseline
scenario, is $61.6 million (Table A4). In the high impact scenario, this rises to $142.2 million (Table A5).
All these data are summarized in Table 3.

Source: Annex Tables A2 , A3 and A4. In each case the
data shown measure the incremental Impact on the revenue
and cost streams of the "with project" scenarios compared
with the baseline scenario.
3.2.    Cost stream
The project's costs include the public investment in the project itself and the privately incurred
costs in the production of the goods and services that tourists consume. These costs were classified into
operation and maintenance costs. The present value of the incremental cost stream - all at market prices
in lempiras converted to dollars at the official exchange rate - is $55.5 rnillion in the medium scenario
and $116.6 in the high scenario (Table 3).
Note that there is no provision in the cost stream for additional private investment in hotel
capacity, since the data supplied to the project team suggest that existing capacity will be sufficient for
the duration of the projection.
As illustrated in Table 2, in the previous section, LIHT statistics show that there are at present 399
hotel rooms available in Copan Ruinas and another 132 in the Yojoa area, making a total of 531 in the
proximity of these two major attractions. This so, even without taking account of the 2,355 hotel rooms
in San Pedro Sula that are within an easy one hour drive of the Yojoa sites and just over two hours from
CopAn Ruinas.
Based on the IHT data for the number of visitors and overnights, the occupancy rate in Copan
Ruinas and Yojoa is at present very low indeed. Only one hotel (the Marina) has a high occupancy rate
(over 70 percent); the average is under 20 percent. That means that the industry can handle enormous
expansion in demand without needing significant additional private investment in hotels. In this setting,
the central rationality of the public investment in the project is that it releases the potential of existing
private investments.
There might arguably be a need for further private investment around 2012, when the occupancy
rate would reach 61 percent, unless one were to suppose increased placement of visitors in the San Pedro
Sula hotels. Even so, with a discount rate of 11.5 percent, the present value of such investments would
make little material difference to the findings of the evaluation.
The details of this analysis are presented in Annex Tables A2 to A5 and the supporting
spreadsheets are available in project files.
- 45 -



3.3.   Financial rate of return
The rate of return results from the financial analysis are summarized in Table 3. The analysis
shows that the overall financial rate of return of the project is positive, with a Net Present Value (NPV)
of $6.1 million and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 20.7 percent in the medium scenario; and NPV of
$25.6 million and IRR of 46.7 percent in the high scenario.
The results for financial projections are detailed in Annex Tables A4 and AS and the Excel
spreadsheets used to make the calculations are available in project files.
Note that some of the archeological sites themselves are "loss leaders" whose entrance charges
cannot recover the cost of their development. An analysis of the financial situation of the archeological
sites can be found in Tables A9, at the end of this document. This, combined with the overall positive
rate of return of the combined public and private costs and revenues, is the justification for providing
public funding for investment in these developments, which can be considered public goods.
4. Economic Analysis
This section presents the results of the economic analysis. This analysis takes as its starting point
the financial data presented in the previous section. However, the analysis is adjusted to take account of
divergences between financial costs and revenues and the economic opportunity costs of the resources
that are mobilized.
In addition, the presentation of the benefit stream is re-conceptualized to emphasize and highlight
the development goal of the project, which is: to increase the net factor incomes of Honduran productive
resources. This differs from the normal approach of traditional project economic analysis, where the
benefit stream is often based on the benefits derived by the consumers from the outputs of the project,
focusing on the analysis of consumers surplus derived from demand elasticity estimates.
4.1.   Conversion Factors
The financial as well as the economic analyses are done in local currency at domestic prices, and
then converted to US Dollars at border prices. That is, the estimates are in real prices, in 2003 US dollars.
In the economic analysis, the factor of minus 4 percent was used as a general conversion factor to adjust
national prices to international opportunity costs (border prices in dollars). This reflects the difference
between the nominal exchange rate and the account (shadow) exchange rate, estimated at 4 percent.
This small divergence reflects the fact that the nominal exchange rate of the Lempira in relation
to the US dollar is the product of a relatively competitive exchange market in which the Central Bank
auctions available currency to the market. The Bank uses its exchange reserves to support the
management of the exchange rate. However, the Bank uses a floating peg system which leads to a slight
lag in price adjustments. The country has experienced significant real exchange rate appreciation in
recent years, but this reflects underlying currency flows rather than administrative actions. The exchange
rate cannot be considered to be seriously misaligned based on market criteria.
The most important adjustment factor considered in the analysis is the opportunity cost estimate
for labor. This was determined by analysis of the Honduran Government's National bi-annual household
survey (May 2001), which collects detailed labor market data. The survey does not provide valid regional
data for Copan, so the national average was used. Since a significant part of the employment generated
by the project is indirect employment (in the production of inputs to the tourist industry that might take
place anywhere in the national economy), the use of a national conversion factor is not regarded as
inappropriate. If it leads to a bias in the estimated returns, the bias will be downwards.
The analysis used standard techniques to establish the opportunity cost of labor, based on the
ratio between average wages for unskilled labor commerce, hotels and restaurants, compared with the
economy-wide average for agriculture, trade and services. On this basis, the average opportunity cost of
the labor that works in the tourism industry is estimated at 70 percent of the wage paid. This reflects the
very high under-employment rate registered in the Honduran labor statistics. Although in May 2001 open
unemployment was only 4.2 percent and open under-employment (people working under 30 hours a
week) was 3.3 percent, hidden under-employment (people earning less than the minimum wages) stood at
23.1 percent).

4.2.   Conceptualization of Costs and Benefits
For the purpose of the economic analysis, costs are the project's publicly-financed investment
costs. The benefit stream is the net supplementary income to Honduran factors of production arising as a
consequence of the project's existence. To this end, the private costs of the industries that are stimulated
by the project are "carried over" onto the other side of the equation and netted out from the incomes
generated by those providing services to the sector.
The critical consideration justifying the project's existence is the fact that without the project, the
labor that will be employed in the tourist sector due to the project, would eam a lot less elsewhere. This
is quantified on the basis of the estimated opportunity cost of labor explained in the previous section.
The analysis of incremental (pre-tax) income was based on the relevant components of the
financial analysis. Based on the income estimates for the sector, an estimate is made for incremental
income to national factors of production.
In order to equate the estimate to the industry's gross product at factor cost, since our base data
are market price data, the transfer payment represented by indirect taxes was reassigned to the factors of
production for the economic analysis. Although indirect taxes are acquired by the state, they capture part
of the value added by the productive factors working in the taxed sector. Taxes (including sales taxes,
and specific tourism taxes) will capture an estimated 15 percent of the value stream generated by the
industry. It should be noted that if the productive resources were used in other sectors, most of this tax
revenue would not arise, due to the high level of exemptions - especially for food products - under the
Honduran sales tax system. In contrast, when food is sold in restaurants and hotels it pays full sales tax.
The input output matrix for the tourist industry was then modeled, based on the detailed data
gathered for the financial analysis, allowing all the industry's expenditures to be assigned eventually to
factor payments to labor, capital or imports. These payments were then analyzed in the following way:
*   Payments to imports were excluded as they are not for the benefit of national factors of
production. The import component for the services to be provided is relatively small.
*   Payments to capital were excluded. This reflects the assumption that the after tax rate of return
on capital will reflect the (risk adjusted) opportunity cost of capital, and no more than that. This
is a conservative assumption. If the marginal and average returns to capital were to increase in
Honduras as a result of the greater profitability of the tourism investments in Copan, there would
be an additional benefit from the project, not quantified in the present analysis. However, we
have no good empirical basis for estimating the likely impact of the project on the national
capital market.
*   The total expenditure on labor (including direct and indirect labor expenditure) was adjusted to
remove the estimated opportunity cost of the labor (70 percent of the total). This is tantamount to
supposing that without the project, 70 percent of this labor income would have been generated in
other activities. The project team considers that this is a conservative assumption since the
likelihood is that for labor in the Copan region, opportunity cost is significantly lower than the
national average.
This leaves an estimated net benefit stream equivalent of 30 percent of incremental direct and
indirect payments to labor in the tourist industry and its supply industries due to the project.
4.3.   Economic Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return
The Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return for the project were then estimated by
comparing the cost of the project with the net benefit stream under the two "with project" scenarios. In
this case, the "without project" scenario is simply zero investment and zero net gains.
Table 4 summarizes the results of the economic analysis. The detailed calculation is reported in
tables A6 and A7.

Source: Annex Tables A6 and A7. In each case, the data
shown measure the incremental impact on the revenue and
cost streams of the "with project" scenarios compared with
the baseline scenario.
Under Scenario 2, of medium growth in demand, the Present Value of the benefit stream is $17.2
million. This is just 28 percent of the increase in the present value of the total spending attributable to the
project, calculated at $61.7 million, so can be regarded as a very conservative appraisal. The other
benefits (payments to capital and imports, plus 70 percent of the payment to labor) are regarded as being
equivalent to the opportunity cost of those resources, and so do not constitute a net social gain. Under
scenario 3, the net benefit increases to $40.1 million.
In each case, the economic cost is the same: it is the present value of the investment in the
project, corrected to take account of the opportunity cost of labor (this results in a 30 percent reduction in
the estimated cost of the labor component, compared with the financial version) and the adjustment
factor of 4 percent for the cost of foreign exchange.
The NPV in the medium scenario is US$ 9.4 million with a 20.5 percent ERR. Under Scenario 3,
of high growth in demand, the NPV is US$ 32.4 million with a 78.5 percent ERR. We may conclude that
the project is likely to be socially profitable under reasonable scenarios for demand growth and costs.
5. Fiscal Impact Analysis
The analysis of fiscal impact allows us to separate the public and private components of the
economic costs and benefits of the project. This exercise was done for Scenario 2 - Moderate Impact,
allowing us to analyze the components of the NPV of $6.8 million projected in this scenario. The results
are shown in Table 5.
The analysis shows that the project has a negative fiscal impact of US$1.421 million, indicating a
recovery rate of 82 percent on the public investment. The government invests $7.79 million and gets back
in taxes $6.37 million. The taxes that the government collects within the framework of this project are:
from hotel activities (12% sales tax + 4% for tourism services), and 12% sales tax from restaurants, local
transportation and general sales (souvenirs and tourism services provided by private citizens). Under the
Tourism Incentives Law, this type of business is exempt from income tax.

2 Total incremental economic benefits, before taxes
The projected net benefit derived from payments to national factors is US$ 10,837 million. Since
the net private benefits after taxes are positive, and greater than the project cost, it might be argued based
on these numbers that if the private sector undertook the investment it would have a positive net return.
However, given the public-good nature of the investments in the development of the
- 48 -



archeological parks and sites, coupled to the fact that the economic return is derived entirely from a net
benefit to labor not to capital, it is most unlikely that private companies would undertake the investment
if the government did not do so. This same fact indicates that the distributive impact of the project in
terms of benefits to labor and capital is very positive.  Additionally, it's worth pointing out
that the loan terms (IDA) for the project - with an interest rate of 1 percent for the first 10 years and 2
percent from the 10th year on, much below the discount rate of 11.5 percent used here - imply that the
Central Government's cash flow will be positive in this project. As a result, the fiscal balance as
measured by the IMF will be improved, not worsened, by the project.
6. Sensitivity Analysis
Table 6 presents the results of a sensitivity analysis showing the impact on the estimated project
rates of return and fiscal impact of changing the estimated values of key parameters (such as the flow of
tourists and the number of average days of stay). The variations were simulated in percentage terms, in
relation to the parameters specified in Table 1, above, for each scenario.
For the financial return rate, the most sensitive variable is the flow of tourists to archeological
sites. If the real outcome for this variable were 10 percent below what was specified in the middle and
high scenarios, the financial IRR descends to 16.5 percent in the middle scenario (compared to 20.7
percent with the initial parameters of Table 1) and to 40.5 percent in the high scenario (compared to 46.7
percent). Similarly, the economic rate of return would fall to from 20.5 percent to 15.9 percent in the
medium scenario and from 78.5 percent to 67.8 percent in the high scenario.
The table reports a critical value for each parameter defined as the limit value that would lower
the project's financial IRR to 11.5 percent, which is the discount rate used in the analysis. At this point,
NPV would reach zero. For this to happen, the tourist flow would have to turn out to be 21.3 percent
below the projected value in the moderate scenario and 57 percent below the value projected in the high
scenario.

Critical Value of Variation*     -41.3%   -85.5%
* % of change in variable, that leaves the rate of return equal to the discount rate.
The number of days that visitors stay also has a significant impact. In this case, an increase of 10
percent above the established initial parameters will bring increase the financial IRR to 23 percent in the
middle scenario and to 52.5 percent in the high scenario. On the other hand, a decrease of 10 percent will
lower the financial IRR to 18.5 percent and to 41.6 percent, respectively. The critical values for this
variable are decreases of 41.3 percent in the middle scenario and of 85.5 percent in the high scenario.
The economic return rate is equally sensitive to variations in tourist flow and in the number of
days they stay, with a 10 percent fall in the value of the parameter leading to decreases to 15.7 percent
and 61.3 percent in the ERR, in the medium and high scenarios, respectively.
These results indicate that the project's implementation strategy should give a high priority to the
promotion strategy geared to increase the flow of tourists to these archeological sites.
7. Balance of payment impact
Honduras has a chronic balance of payments deficit which is a strategic constraint on the
macroeconomic balance. Any intervention tending to strengthen the balance of payments allows the
- 49 -



equilibrium level of output and income to rise. This is the underlying strategic reason why Honduras -
like many other countries with small open economies - has opted in recent years for an export-led growth
strategy.
The tourism sector is part of this strategy, and has contributed an important part of the growth of
foreign exchange revenues in recent years. At a macroeconomic level, the Project will also contribute to
Honduras' export-led growth strategy, giving a boost to archeological tourism as a new source of
dynamism in the generation of foreign earnings, to complement the large gains registered in the maquila
sector over the last decade, and helping further to diversify the economy's trade dependence.
In this light, a very positive macroeconomic impact is expected. In the execution of the
investment component, an estimated 94 percent of the original investment is for national goods and
services, generating a net contribution to the balance of payments in the investment phase of US$ 3.9
million. Furthermore, during the next 13 years of the projection, an average US$ 5.4 million in currency
is expected to be generated annually, which will strengthen the balance of payments and contribute to
development in other sectors of the economy.
The economic analysis presented above does not take account of this effect, which would be
additional to the benefits from increased employment incomes in the tourism sector as such.
8. Conclusions
The project is likely to be financially and economically profitable. The estimated financial rate of
return is 20.7 percent in the middle scenario and 46.7 percent in the high scenario. The economic rate of
return is projected at 20.5 percent in the middle scenario and at 78.5 percent in the high scenario.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the project's profitability will be sensitive to the flow of
visitors and to the number of days they stay in Honduras. This implies that the project's success requires
the effective promotion of these archeological sites as tourist destinations, and on the supply of tourism
products and services that will make it more attractive for tourists to stay longer and spend more money.
Both aspects are backed by specific components in the project's design. The implementation of the
project must also be complemented with continuing Government actions in exploration and research at
the selected sites, including acquisition of property rights of lands where archeological sites are located.

Tables A9: Projected Financial Situation of the Archeological Parks and Sites
Summary: The consolidated projected financial situation of the parks and sites is positive, with an NPV
of US$8.6 million, as a result of favorable balances in the Copan Park and Cerro Palenque site, that
compensate for the negative balances of the El Puente and Los Naranjos Parks. The result is derived from
an initial situation of low tourist flows in these more deficient parks given their underdevelopment in
terms of infrastructure, and low          prices entry tickets. Revenue by entry ticket for each park. The
reported revenues derive form the number of projected visitors under a medium scenario, multiplied by
the price of the ticket paid by each visitor, which vary by park and origin of visitor. These prices were
maintained constant in the projection and are shown in Table A9- 1:

Operating and Maintenance Costs. These costs are derived from costs reported by IHAH in 2002. In
the projection, these costs were given annual increases of 5 percent in personnel costs and 10 percent in
maintenance and other costs, reflecting an increase in tourist flows which will require more Operating
and Maintenance spending. Individual results per Park. Under the parameters specified, the projections

show that CopAn would accumulate a positive balance of NPV US$9.9 million and Cerro Palenque with a
slight positive balance of US$0.2 million (Table A9-2). On the other hand, El Puente would have a
negative balance of US$1.2 million and Los Naranjos of US$0.3 million.

Universal results. The data consolidated for all parks and sites is presented in Table A9-3 and reflect a
positive NPV of US$ 8.6 million throughout the entire projection in favor of IHAH. This is a net result,
after absorbing the negative balances of El Puente y Los Naranjos Parks. The results for each park are
presented in the full Economic Analysis in the project files.
Recommendations. The following recommendations are made given the data generated:
* Contemplate in the project implementation the necessary support and technical assistance to IHAH
so that they can establish a universal model of equilibrium price determination for the parks and sites
that reflect administration costs and the value of the park's attractions.
* In the first years of implementation, subsidies should be allowed from the parks and sites with
positive to the ones with negative balances until the equilibrium price is established.
* Given that the net flow of all the parks and sites is positive in all the years, the necessary
regulations for the revenue's allocation, which will reach US$2.0 million in the 10th year of
projections.

Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
HONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
Procurement
All procurement will be done in accordance with IDA's guidelines on procurement of goods,
works, and using standard contract documents acceptable to IDA (Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997
and January 1999 and Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
dated January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999, and May 2002) and the provisions
stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement.
Procurement Responsibilities and Capacity
The Government has proposed that the existing PCU in IHT for the Sustainable Coastal Tourism
Project will serve as the PCU for the proposed project. The PCU will be responsible for all procurement
activities in the project. A Procurement Capacity Assessment of this unit was carried out and approved
by the RPA Office on March 24, 2003.
The assessment shows that the current PCU capacity and internal controls are adequate for the
level and type of procurement required for the project. The PCU includes an experienced Procurement
Officer, a good filing system, and an integrated financial system with a procurement monitoring module.
The PCU is subject to the internal auditing of the Ministry of Tourism. While there are procedures to
prevent fraud and corruption under national laws, there is no regulation that enforces ethical performance
of staff or consultants involved in project execution. The PCU has expressed an interest in adopting a
Code of Ethics for the project. The project will also finance two additional procurement and
administrative assistants for the PCU that will allow a better distribution of workload between the two
projects.
The PCU has presented the procurement packages for the four-year project and the draft
procurement plan for the first year of implementation. An action plan was discussed and agreed at
Negotiations and includes the following:
Procurement Action Plan
Planning:
a) A detailed procurement plan for first year of the project.  Complied by Negotiations.
Code of Ethics:                                          To be included in Operational Manual.
b) A draft Code of Ethics will be developed for the project staff.
Staffing:                                                As a condition of effectiveness.
c) Appointment of procurement assistant for the PCU.
Training:                                                At project launch workshop and during the
d) Specific procurement training to procurement staff of the different  life of the project and on-the-job training by
implementing agencies.                                   PCU procurement specialist.
Procedures:                                              As a condition of effectiveness.
e) Operational Manual (OM) should describe clearly the procedures,
methodologies, coordinating arrangements, filing and records, and
internal control mechanisms for all procurement and related
disbursement activities to be carried out by the different agencies and the
PCU.
Procurement Arrangements
Procurement of Works. The project will finance works identified by the Management Plan of
Copan Ruins that was financed under the PROFUTURO Project (Credit 3250-HO), and basic
- 57 -



infrastructure for the archeological parks and sites that are part of a proposed archeological-ecological
tourist circuit. These works consist of construction, rehabilitation or expansion of visitor centers,
archeological research centers, security infrastructure and museums in the parks and sites and in Copan
Ruinas. Due to the nature and estimated amount of the works, no International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) is expected. To the extent possible works will be grouped to be procured by National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$2.3 million. Standard bidding documents
agreed with IDA will be used. Works estimated to cost less than US$150,000 equivalent per contract will
be procured, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.7 million, on the basis of at least three quotations
received in response to a written invitation, which will include a detailed description of the works
required, including basic specifications, the necessary completion date, a basic form of request for
quotations and lump-sum fixed-contract, acceptable to the IDA.
Procurement of Archeological Services. The project will also finance archeological protection
and conservation of monuments, sculptures and tunnels that have been identified by the Management
Plans in Component 1. All archeological work will be carried out by IHAH with the technical assistance
of Asociaci6n Copdn. These works will be financed under force account up to an aggregate amount of
US$1.02 million that covers mostly the specialized labor.
Procurement of Goods. Goods to be procured under this project will include vehicles, computer
equipment, security equipment, museum exhibits, office equipment, and furniture. Due to the estimated
amounts and schedule for the procurement of these goods, no ICB is expected. To the extent possible,
goods would be grouped in bidding packages of more than US$25,000 to be procured following NCB
procedures, using Standard Bidding Documents agreed with IDA, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.36
million. Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped into larger bidding packages and estimated to cost
less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.45 million, may be
procured using shopping (national or international) procedures based on a standard request for
quotations agreed with IDA to at least three suppliers.
Selection of Consultants. Consulting services will be contracted for technical assistance in
implementation of the components, design of management plans for the archeological parks and sites,
design of expansion or construction of visitors centers, museums in the parks/sites, training, social
communication strategy, marketing strategy, studies, monitoring and evaluation system, etc. All contracts
with consultants would be financed net of income taxes, using the standard disbursement percentage for
Honduras.
Consultingfirms will be selected following Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
procedures using the IDA Standard Request for Proposals (RFP). Short lists for consulting assignments
estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 may consist of national firms. Auditing services will be
contracted using Least-Cost Selection (LCS) procedures (paragraph 3.6 of Guidelines).
Individual consultants will be selected for advisory services and other technical assistance,
including long-term consultants for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). These consultants will selected
by comparison of qualifications of at least three candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions
of paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 of the Consultant Guidelines, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million.
Training. Training activities in the project will finance non-consultant expenditures related to
the delivery of training events and workshops to archeological assistants, tourism guides, tourism service
workers, vulnerable groups and government and project staff, reasonable costs of travel and per diem of
trainees, rental of training facilities and equipment, training materials, promotion and publicity costs, and
national and international study tours.
Subprojects. The project will finance Fondo Prosperidad to make resources available to
subprojects that respond to market niches identified by the pre-feasibility study menu, including capacity
building, technical assistance, training, and commercialization. A nonprofit organization (Management
Agency) will be contracted to administer the Fondo. This Agency will be selected following QCBS
procedures for consultant services. Subprojects will be approved for only those proposals that meet the
- 58 -



eligibility criteria established in the Operational Manual. The eligible beneficiaries should be
communities recognized by customary law according to the principles accepted by indigenous
community organizations in the area. Proposals will be a maximum of US$25,000 each and should
include a minimum in-kind or cash community contribution of ten percent. Subprojects may consist of
goods, works, technical assistance, training or any combination of these four. Procurement under
subprojects may be done directly by the beneficiaries and to the extent possible following shopping
procedures. Communities will choose technical assistance or training from a list of qualified providers.
At the request of the beneficiaries, the Agency could provide assistance on procurement following Bank's
guidelines for shopping or selection of consultants. The Operational Manual of the Project will detail all
the procedures and be presented to the Bank as a condition of effectiveness. The aggregate amount for
subprojects totals US$1,700,000.
Operating Costs. The project will finance incremental recurrent costs for the implementation of
the project, i.e. incremental support staff for the PCU, office supplies, operation and maintenance of
vehicles and equipment, communication expenses, travel and per diem for supervision activities of PCU
staff and implementing agencies. Public entities in Honduras are required by law to procure these goods
and services through comparison of at least three quotations, which was found satisfactory to IDA during
the capacity assessment. No government salaries would be financed under the IDA credit.

Sole source contract with CopAn Association. Copan Association will provide technical support for part
of the Integrated Development of Archeological Parks and Sites component, in terms of providing
specialized expertise and short term inputs to the proposed activities in the three archeological parks and
two sites and the implementation of the Copan Management Plan. Copan Association is the only NGO in
the Copan Valley with specialized experience in the delicate archeological ruins. The direct contract is
justified due to Copan Association's successful experience developing the Copan Archeological Park; the
uniqueness of its experience with the development objectives of the project in the Copan Valley; and its
excellent performance as an implementing entity in carrying out the activities in Copan financed by the
World-Bank through the PROFUTURO Project (Credit 3250-HO).
Copan Association is managed by a Board of Directors (representing the private sector, different
political parties, the current Vice Present of Honduras, and scientific researchers) and the Executive
Director is Dr. Ricardo Agurcia. Over the last ten years, Dr Agurcia has directed extensive fieldwork at
the Copan site, published and lectured widely, and consulted internationally on the management and
preservation of archeological resources and is particularly known for his views on site conservation and
the rational use of sites for tourism (see Annex 13 for additional information).
The contract with Copan Association will include involvement of a core team of researchers
representing different disciplines to provide technical support for the simultaneous development and
implementation of Management Plans in the proposed three archeological parks and two archeological
sites, with most work occurring in the first three years. The full time core team of experts over four years
consist of a Director, Conservator, Archeologist, Architect, Biologist, and Expert in Park Services and
Site Interpretation. The organization will have a specific focus on the requirements of archeological
research, biological impacts, surveying, preservation, public use, and inventory/record keeping. The team
will provide specialized expertise in many cross-cutting areas and travel to all project sites. Specifically,
the team will provide technical assistance in conservation (to ensure archeological pieces are not
damaged during construction or improvements); preparation of terms of reference and technical
specifications when needed on specific topics; architectural guidance in terms of designing simple
Visitors Centers with an archeological laboratory; biological expertise in terms of placement of the
infrastructure and precautions to comply with all environmental guidance; and specialized expertise in
park services and interpretation to advise on security, paths, signs, access, and presentation of written
materials for tourists. The PCU will determine the timetable for activities and advise on the technical
specifications and requirements needed for each specific activity.
In sum, CopAn Association has a comparative advantage in its ability to convene a highly
qualified team to be involved in this project due to the history of this organization in the Copan area,
international and national contacts in the fields of cultural and natural patrimony, and also a strong level
of integration with the local institutions, municipality, and community members. The estimated amount
of the contract is US$850,000.

Annex 6(B): Financial Mianagement and Disbursement Arsangements
HIONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
Financial Management
1. Summary of the Financial Management Assessment
An accredited Financial Management Specialist carried out the Financial Management
Assessment. The PCU within IHT has a well-established finance and accounting division, with clear
policies, rules and procedures in place. There is a strong segregation of duties, with a junior staff to
handle routine processing and a Director to oversee operations (internal and donor funded operations)
and to present key documents (including disbursement applications and audit papers) to other senior
officials within IHT.
During the first year of the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project, the PCU has successfully
implemented an integrated and comprehensive financial management system. The Unit is able to generate
financial management reports and has submitted withdrawal applications. The Unit has initiated project
activities, including civil works in Trujillo, an international bidding process for the tourism strategy, and
has contracted consultancies.
Accounting Policies and Procedures
Administrative procedures are in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with
consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring
systems. The PCU has a well developed Operational Manual, which outlines the roles and
responsibilities for staff, clearly details the segregation of duties and defines the standard operating
procedures for the unit. The Operational Manual was developed during the preparation of the Sustainable
Costal Tourism project, and has subsequently been reviewed and found acceptable by IDA.
The PCU utilizes a cash basis of accounting with accruals used primarily at year-end. The
project accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial transactions of the
project, and produce financial statements useful to project management and meeting Bank fiduciary
requirements. The accounting system was designed to be able to capture all financial information and
allocate between both categories (the Bank's legal/disbursement categories), GoH Expenditure Objects
and project component/activity. This is due to the flexibility of the accounting system, and the system is
truly an integrated management system, with varying degrees of controls and safeguards. Procurement
information is linked to the accounting and budget information to enable the finance division to
effectively carry out contract management.
Internal Audit. The internal audit unit for IHT operates under the auspices of the Tribunal
Superior de Cuentas (formerly the Contraloria General de la Republica). The internal audit team
customarily reviewed expenditures on an ex-post basis, however under the recently passed law of the
Tribunal Superior de Cuentas, there is a requirement for ex-ante review of expenditures. The law is
somewhat unclear as to how this ex-ante review is to be applied (e.g., does the requirement call for 100
percent or is there a criteria or application of expenditure thresholds to determine the ex-ante expenditure
review).
Under the new law, the internal audit team will carry out an annual internal control review of
IHT, with the report being submitted to the central office of the Tribunal Superior de Cuentas. The
review of IHT will also include a review of the PCU, as this will fall under the scope of work of the
internal audit program.
Safeguard over assets. Assets acquired by the PCU will be in the custody of IHT. The amounts
in this register will be reconciled monthly against the respective accounting balances. At least one annual
physical inspection will be undertaken by PCU/IHT staff (in addition to verification by external
- 62 -



auditors), and there is adequate insurance policy coverage to ensure against the loss of physical assets.
Reporting and Monitoring
Financial statements and reports will be prepared in formats satisfying PCU/IHT and the Bank's
monitoring and fiduciary requirements. On a monthly basis, the finance division will prepare the
project's Statement of Expenditure, a matrix classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by
financing source and disbursement category, as required by PCU/IHT's operational guidelines for
donor-funded projects. The expenditures would be compared to the projected figures per the budgets
prepared for the project.
In addition to Statement of Expenditure, the monthly financial reports will include the Special
Account Reconciliation Statements. Any difference in the amount of expenditures reported under the two
financial statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the physical
progress and procurement sections of the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), will be submitted to the
Bank on a semi-annual basis, and will be submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of
6-month period. The contents of the FMRs have been discussed and the initial design of the reports has
been agreed by the finance division and the Bank.
For Bank purposes, the annual financial statements will include, as well, the schedule of
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) presented during the year in support of Withdrawal Applications.

Risk Analysis
Given the moderate to high risk associated with various aspects of implementation (Fondo
Prosperidad for community income generating activities), it is recommended that at least for the first year
of implementation, financial management supervision should take place approximately every 6 months.

2. Audit Arrangements
Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing, by independent auditors (X) acceptable to the Bank and in accordance with the terms of
reference (TORs) already reviewed and cleared by the Bank. Standard project special purpose financial
statements and audit opinions on project financial statements, Special Accounts and Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs) will be required. The reports will be required to be submitted to the Bank no later
than 4 months following the end of the fiscal year (January - December). The table below summarizes
audit requirements:

establishment of a legal non-profit entity (foundation), with by-laws acceptable to IDA for the appropriate
management of Plan Grande; and (ii) the Foundation has title to the Plan Grande land.
c/ Fondo Prosperidad Subprojects. Engage the services of a Management Agent to manage the implementation of
Fondo Prosperidad subprojects.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
The special account will be replenished via the use of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) due to the
experience that IHT already has utilizing the traditional method of disbursements under the Sustainable
Tourism Project. Disbursements will be made on the basis of full documentation for all expenditures
made under contracts requiring prior review by IDA and contracts whose value will be raised above the
prior review limnits as a result of amendments. For all other expenditures disbursements will be made
against SOEs: (a) contracts for works costing less than 1,500,000 equivalent; (b) goods costing less than
250,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for consulting firms costing less than 100,000; (d) contracts for
individual consultants costing less than 50,000; (e) training expenses; (f) archeological services; (g)
subprojects; and (h) incremental operating costs.

Special account:
Flow of Funds. In order to facilitate project implementation, credit funds will be disbursed to a
Special Account (US dollar account for Bank funds to be held at the Central Bank of Honduras),
managed by IHT with an authorized allocation of US$1,000,000 equivalent and an initial advance of
US$500,000 equivalent, corresponding to the average of four months of expenditures that are expected to
be made from the account. The PCU will submit request for replenishments on a monthly basis. The
replenishment application will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the
Special Account and a reconciliation of the Special Account against bank records.
PCU/IHT will carry out the procurement for services and/or goods in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines, and payment orders for eligible expenditures will be executed to the PCU/IHT
finance division for financing and execution. This arrangement will not require additional accounts for
Bank funds, as all financial transactions will flow directly from the Special Account. This arrangement
will also fall under the normal scope of work for the annual external audit.
Payments and operation of bank accounts. Before payments for acquisition of goods and services
can be processed, a purchase order or contract must exist. On the basis of these documents, electronic
checks/transfers are issued, provided that there's available budget. Bank account reconciliation will be
prepared on a monthly basis and will be available within 15 days after the'end of the month.
Retroactive Financing. IDA will finance expenditures incurred after February 18, 2003. The amount
of the retroactive financing will not exceed 10 percent of the total Credit amount.
Flow of Funds/Fondo Prosperidad. It is expected that a NGO (Management Agency), with
experience in the management of subprojects and a history of trust dealing with communities, will be
selected, according to Bank procurement procedures, for the administration of the Fondo Prosperidad.
The Management Agency will report financially and in terms of development results each six months to
the PCU. The Management Agency will identify subprojects and request IHT to disburse funds for the
subprojects to the Management Agency, which will then disburse to beneficiary groups. Disbursements
to the Management Agency will be based on the commitments of the Management Agency with
beneficiaries and on the results achieved each six months. The advances to the subprojects will be
considered as eligible expenditures with respect to disbursement of funds from the Special Account.
The menu of the Fondo will be defined through the pre-feasibility study contracted by the PCU
within the first six months of the project. The menu will be appropriate to the characteristics of the
visitors of archeological parks/sites, potential channels of commercialization, and local traditions.
Proponents for proposals should be communities recognized by customary law according to the
principles accepted by indigenous community organizations in the area. Proposals will be selected based
on the linkages with the menu and an analysis by the Agency of their economic return potential. The
agency will be able to assist proponents to make proposals with potential, to fit those criteria. If more
proposals are presented than funds allow, a committee of specialists will be selected to make the
allocation. All participants in a proposal should sign off their contractual obligation and reporting,
according to procedures proposed by the Management Agency. Proposals are estimated at a maximum of
$25,000. The amount of resources to be disbursed will depend on the type of activity to be financed, and
also based on the results of the financial reporting of the activities carried out. Communities will sign an
agreement with the Management Agency prior to receiving funds, detailing a minimum of 10 percent
cash or in-kind contribution, and will present reports, to the Management Agency each three months. The
Operational Manual of the Project will detail all the procedures and be presented to the Bank as a
condition of effectiveness.

Additional Annex 11 Assessment of Project Areas and the Impact of Tourism
HONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
Project Areas
1. The three archeological parks and two archeological sites benefiting from the project involve six
different municipalities and three departments, as shown in Table 1. All five parks/sites are accessible
through the San Pedro Sula International Airport, and can be reached in less than 3 hours by road and for
Guanaja in less than one hour by air).
Table 1: Location of the Archeological Parks and Sites
Archeological Park/Site  Municipality    Department
Cerro Palenque        Pimienta and Potrerillos Cortes
Copan                 Copan Ruinas       Copan
El Puente             La Jigua           CopAn
Plan Grande           Guanaja           Islas de la Bahia
Los Naranjos          S.C. de Yojoa      Cortes
2. The Cerro Palenque Archeological Site is located in the Sula Valley, near San Pedro Sula, in the
Department of Cortes, which has a population of 1,202,510. Cerro Palenque extends over an area
belonging by two municipalities: La Pimienta and Potrerillos, with populations of 13,127 and 18,945
respectively. The nine kilometer access road to the site is in poor condition and needs to be rehabilitated
(this has been planned in project) and there is little infrastructure and no services (such as electricity and
water). A small, poor community with about twelve houses is located near the site.
3. The Copdn and El Puente Archeological Parks are located in the Copan Valley in the Department of
Copan, which has a population of 288,766. The capital of the Copan Department is Santa Rosa de Copan
with a population of 25,000. This city is also a tourist attraction and it has a colonial atmosphere and
offers many outdoor activities, including thermal pools, guided tours, and hiking. The Copan Park is
located within the Municipality of Copan Ruinas, which has a population of 30,703; El Puente is located
in the Municipality of La Jigua, with a population of 7,807. The access to El Puente is a four kilometer
paved road in good condition from the small town of La Entrada.
4. The Los Naranjos Eco-Archeological Park is located in the Department of Cortes, along the
northeast side of the Yojoa Lake, which also borders the Departments of Comayagua and Santa Barbara.
The park is located in the Municipality of Santa Cruz de Yojoa, which has a population of 65,901.
Access to the park is from the main paved road from San Pedro Sula to Tegucigalpa, turning at the paved
road to the town of Penla Blanca, then taking a two kilometer access road. This road is in need of
rehabilitation (which is planned for in the project). This area has basic infrastructure and hotels in the
nearby town of Pefia Blanca. Lake Yojoa is the largest natural lake in Honduras, with good fishing, and
the area has other diversions such as caverns, waterfalls, access to two national parks (Santa Barbara and
Azul Meambar) and excellent bird watching (379 bird species identified in archeological area).
5. There are two Municipal partnerships- or "mancomunidades" in this area. These partnerships have
been created between local governments to protect the environment, develop tourism and control
unrestricted private profiting from the national parks. These efforts show that there is a strong interest at
local level to protect the environment and to develop tourism. The Municipalities of Santa Cruz of Yojoa
(Los Naranjos), La Paz, Taulab6, Sigatepeque, Villa de San Antonio y Comoyagua joined forces to create
the "mancomunidad del Lago de Yojoa," with the aim of protecting the environment and promoting
- 74 -



tourism. There is another organization, constituted by the mancomunidad del Lago de Yojoa, and the
municipalities of La Paz, Amapala, and Valle de los Angeles and their main concern is urban planning
and tourism. This group has already prepared a strategic plan to work in the entire region, including the
following sites: Los Naranjos, Lake Yojoa, the Cafiaveral reservoir, and the ecological corridor
Solo-Pefia Blanca Caniaveral.
6. The Plan Grande Archeological Site is located in the island of Guanaja in the Bay Islands (accessible
by air or by boat). The Department of the Islas de la Bahia has a population of 38,073, and the
Municipality of Guanaja has a population of 4,856, concentrated in two small cays (Bonacca) to the east
of the main island. There are no roads or cars on the island and access to the hotels is by water taxi.
Access to the "Plan Grande" site is by boat, then foot.
The Spatial Impact of Tourism Development on the Urban Setting: The Copan Ruinas Case
7. General Overview of Copdn Ruinas. Copan Ruinas is the most important Municipal site, but it is also
the most complicated. Urban and rural areas are generally poor, with rural villages making up the poorest
areas. Copan Ruinas contains 4.5 percent of the Honduras population, most of which is rural since it
contains 6.2 percent of total rural population and only 2.5 percent of the urban (Instituto Nacional de
Estadistica - INE, National Statistics Institute, 2001 Census). The small town of Copan Ruinas is located
in the western end of the country, in the Department of Copan, near the border with Guatemala. Its
population is approximately 33,000 people, of which one-third lives in the urban core and two-thirds in
the 102 rural villages. The CopAn Archeological Site, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in
1980, is located in the Copan Valley. Although the main economic activity in the region is still
agriculture, specifically coffee and tobacco, the tourism industry has grown. In 2002, Copan Ruinas
attracted about 135,000 visitors, and, if more and appropriately explored, tourism can be used as a tool to
bring a new dynamism to the local economy.
8 Natural and Cultural Attractions. Twenty-two per cent of tourists to Honduras visit Copan Ruinas.
The main attraction in the area is certainly the Copan Archeological Heritage, containing the legacy of
the great Mayan civilization, which includes: the main Site, Las Sepulturas and Los Sapos sites, the
stelae surrounding the valley, the Museum of Maya Sculpture and the Museum of Archeology. In recent
years, the increasing flow of tourists has led to a diversification of attractions in the region. They include:
Casa K'inich - an interactive learning center dedicated specifically to children (financed by
PROFUTURO); El Puente Archeological Site, one hour drive from Copan Ruinas, in the municipality of
Nueva Arcadia; The Bird Park; The Butterfly House; The Hot Springs - 23 kilometers from Copan
Ruinas; Eco-Hacienda San Lucas/Los Sapos - a typical Honduran farm; Macaw Mountain Bird Park; and
El Jahal Aqua Park.
9. Tourism Facilities. In order to receive its tourists, Copan Ruinas has 31 hotels and B&Bs, of which
five offer a set of standard facilities and services for guests with a higher purchasing power, and two new
hotels are being built. In the year 2002, the average "stay over" of these tourists was nearly two days.

10. Access to Copdn Ruinas. Visitors can reach Copan through two ways: (a) by land via the Western
Highway (a paved road in good condition) that connects San Pedro Sula and the municipalities of Santa
Rita de Copan (the main municipality of the Department) and Copan Ruinas or via the border with
Guatemala (road in good condition); or (b) by air, through a private airstrip located in the outskirts of
town, in the community of La Estanzuela. The airstrip, owned by local residents, is 1000 meters long and
30 meters wide, and receives small airplanes with carrying capacity of 20 to 30 passengers. A larger
airport in Rio Amarillo, about 20 kilometers from Copan Ruinas, has been designed with financing from
IDB and it is currently in planning stage. Access to rural areas is only possible through unpaved, dirt
roads, making access difficult in the rainy seasons.
11. Infrastructure Services in the Urban Settlement. One of the most important problems in urban
Copan is pollution and waste management (solid and sewage). This issue imposes clear limitations on an
increase in the number of tourists. It also increases social and health risks and vulnerabilities contributing
to greater poverty. Urban infrastructure in Copan Ruinas is highly precarious: (a) only 20 percent of the
urban area has clean, drinkable water; (b) only 30 percent has sewage-others let the sewage waters run
across the streets; (c) the lack of a sewage system pollutes the Copan River, since waste runs directly into
it; (d) electricity coverage is limited; (e) garbage collection needs to be strengthened with clearly defined
schedules and local residents need learn about basic environmental education on how to manage their
garbage; (f) garbage treatment is carried out inappropriately; (g) the municipality has only one hospital
and four health posts in the rural area, of which only two are functioning albeit in precarious conditions
due to lack of material and human resources, and (h) in terms of public security, there is no fire brigade
and the police service is ineffective, consisting of no more than six men.
12. Rural Infrastructure. The situation in the rural areas is even more unfavorable: 48 percent of the
population has no potable water and 80 percent of households do not meet minimum standards of living,
reflecting the low quality and overall lack of social services and infrastructure. Deforestation continues to
spread because people use wood for cooking. Some rural communities, such as La Candelaria, use
polluted water to satisfy their basic needs.
-76 -



13. Social Structure of the Urban Space. Copan Ruinas still maintains the urban design of a Spanish
colonial town, with the main square encompassing the church, the town hall, and a few stylish buildings,
presenting a harmonious urban landscape. The 10,000 inhabitants of the urban core live in two main
areas: 'Parte Baja' (Lower Town), inhabited by upper middle and higher classes, and 'Parte Alta' (Upper
Town), occupied by the lower income sectors. The former presents a mixed occupation, consisting of
residences, shops, hotels, public buildings, restaurants, banks, museums, among others. In this area, land
is most valued, averaging US$30 per square meter, and one of the real estate market's indicators is the
purchasing of property by foreigners. Another tendency of the land market is for people outside CopAn to
purchase older houses in the historical center and restore them for housing or commercial purposes. Even
though this contributes to the embellishment of the area, it also leads to an increase in land prices. In the
last few years, the increasing price of land, the coffee crisis and the development of tourism activities
have contributed to a change in the use of houses, where a number are either sold or rented for varied
commercial activities.
Box 2: Copan Ruinas Indicators 2002
HDI - 0.458 (ranking it 16th among the 23
municipalities of the Department of Copan)
Malnourishment rate - 55 percent
Illiteracy rate - 45 percent
Infant Mortality Rate - 41 per 1000
Average family income - US$96.41
14. Socioeconomic Profile. This kind of process directly affects the socioeconomic profile of residents
in the 'Parte Alta,' who sell their property to the more affluent sectors of expanding 'Parte Baja.' In turn,
the lower class residents of 'Parte Alta' are forced to leave and settle in the city's peripheries, specially
in Ostuman, located in the direction of Guatemala, and Sesesmil, north of town. To the east, however,
these settlements are limited by the boundaries of Copan Archeological Park and tobacco and coffee
plantations. Given the lack of public infrastructure services and of a Urban Plan for Land Use and
Occupation, the possibility of creating slum neighborhoods exists. Although the majority of Copan
Ruinas' residents own their homes, the land surrounding the urban core is concentrated in the hands of a
few traditional families, including in the areas neighboring the archeological sites. This situation could
cause problems and limitations in terms of improvements, expansion and protection of the entire valley
given its archeological richness. It could, as well, restrict the expansion of the land market, leading larger
tourism investments to locate in neighboring municipalities. For instance, a large scale hotel investment,
Hacienda el Jahal, has been made in the municipality of Santa Rita, 11 kilometers from Copan Ruinas.
This hotel complex includes a shopping mall, movie theater and Honduras' first water park. Furthermore,
a large plot of land has recently been purchased in Santa Rita by one of Honduras' most powerful real
estate investors dealers.

15. Local Government Capacity. The situation of Copan Ruinas is critical given the municipality's
small budget. In 2002, its revenue amounted to 4 million Lempiras (US$236,000) that carne from two
sources: 2,400,000 Lempiras in taxes and 1,800,000 Lempiras in government transfers. Of this amount,
the administration allocated 60 percent to personnel and operational costs and 40 percent to investments
in public services. In order to increase revenues, the municipality should improve its legal and fiscal
tools, such as an efficient land ownership, a commercial establishment cadastre and the ability for tax
collection. During an interview, the mayor affirmed that the expansion of the tourism industry has only
benefited bar, restaurant and hotel owners. The municipality has not felt a positive impact for two main
reasons: (a) only twenty percent of the economically active population in Copan Ruinas benefits from
tourism, and (b) the five largest hotels have benefited from the Ley de Zonas Libres Turisticas (Law of
Free Tourism Zones) that afforded hotels with tax exemptions for a period of 10 years. This situation is
being gradually resolved and in 2008 the last hotel will 'retire' from this benefit. Related to this issue, the
mayor, like previous mayors, has called attention to a past claim that the revenue produced by Copan
Archeological Park is not equitably allocated, for it is entirely appropriated by the central government.
For instance, in 2002, the site collected around 15 million Lempiras in tickets, which is more than three
times the municipality's budget. Thus, the municipality suffers the pressure for improved public services
and infrastructure resulting from the tourism flow, but does not receive the benefits. To deal with this
situation, the mayor is preparing a Strategic Plan to establish investment priorities, and needs a cadastre
and database to improve its administrative and fiscal efficiency.
Key Recommendations
a Implement a Plan for Regulation of the Use and Occupation of Land to maintain urban development
that is compatible with the concept of sustainable development.
a Decentralize the tourism flow from Copan Ruins, by building hotels/bed and breakfast with attractions
such as horseback riding or bird watching in other areas of the Valley.
a Apply a Historical Protection and Conservation Law that can guarantee the maintenance of the
original urban landscape of Copan Ruinas.
a Elaborate a Visual Communication Code to control the use of outdoor signs and advertisements to
avoid a visual pollution incompatible with the town's atmosphere.
o Define conflict resolution mechanisms for land tenure in and around archeological sites.
o Implement urban and environmental education activities that involve and empower the local
population, especially children and youth, to reduce the gap between the municipality and the federal
government's tourism and cultural agencies.
o Take measures to prevent a repeat of the current situation in Copan Ruinas in other municipalities
affected by the expansion of tourism. A careful consideration of the impact of tourism in urban spaces
should also help promote sustainable tourism development in the other archeological sites that compose
Honduras' cultural and natural heritage, such as El Puente, Los Naranjos, Cerro Palenque and Plan
Grande.

Additional Annex 12 Social and Indigenous Issues
(Should be read in conjunction with Annex 11)
HONDURAS: Regional Development in the Copan Valley Project
Introduction
1. Background. Honduras ranks among the lowest-income countries in the Western Hemisphere. Policy
reforms beginning in 1990 sparked a turnaround in Honduras' economy and prior to Hurricane Mitch,
GDP growth was 5 percent. The economy is once again recovering, with a GDP growth rate of 6.4
percent in 2001. However, the economic growth has not reached the poorest and most vulnerable groups
such as the rural poor, especially indigenous peoples and more particularly, indigenous women. With an
average of 5.3 years of schooling for adult workers, Honduras is well behind the average for most of
Latin America. The PRSP finds a low-quality labor force as one of the main causes of the fluctuating and
weak economic growth, and despite seemingly high investment and savings rates in the country, a more
dynamic poverty reduction has not takeri place. This suggests that it is imperative to identify alternative
ways to increase households' revenues mainly in the most deprived and ethnic regions such as the Copan
Valley.
2. Copdn Valley. Honduras has a rich environmental diversity and cultural heritage. These resources are
the patrimony of the poor and the challenge for the Copan Valley Project is to make them productive
through a pro-poor tourism approach. Over 3,000 years, the Maya created a remarkable heritage of
immense structures, intricate carvings and a highly accurate language based on detailed representative
symbols. Tourist attention to Honduras' archeological heritage has traditionally focused on the Maya site
of Copan. The excellent condition of Copan makes it the most detailed source of information on the
Maya that exists today. Southernmost of the great Maya cities, Copan was geographically isolated from
the Maya realm, yet became a center of art and culture. Copan is known for its sculptures and long
hieroglyphic texts. More than 100,000 tourists from over 60 countries visited Copan Archeological Park
in 2002.
3. Tourism Transformation. Over the past decade, tourism in Honduras has evolved dramatically and
most visitors go to Copan. Archeological research and the declaration of the Copan National Monument
have contributed to this increase, but also international media coverage of new findings at the site and
more recently, international events such as the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, have fostered an
increase in the number of tourists since Central America is perceived as a safe destination. Economically,
the region faces a major recession due to agricultural crises primarily in the tobacco plantations and
secondly, in coffee. As a result, the majority of the population is currently unemployed, works in tourism
/services or are self-sufficient peasants and artisans. Most people have few assets and production
inputs--a situation that leads them to perceive low revenues. A quantitative survey being carried out.
separately will provide additional statistics.
4. Objectives of the Analysis. The main objectives of this annex are to: (a) determine who are the main
beneficiaries and stakeholders of the project and their respective stakes; (b) what are the constraints to
the participation of the poor in tourism development and how to overcome them: (c) what are the risks of
the project and how to overcome them; (d) what are the social development outcomes of the project and
include these in the monitoring and evaluation system of the project; (e) what institutional arrangements
are needed to guarantee that the social development outcomes are reached; and (f) how to make the
project as participatory as possible in order to achieve ownership, sustainability, and projected outcomes.
5. Data Sources. This analysis draws on qualitative and quantitative data sources and methodological
- 79 -



techniques. It used the 2001 Population Census and statistics collected by IHT. As the census data is
highly aggregated - geographically, socially and ethnically - the analysis relies mainly on qualitative
data. Focus groups were conducted with five urban and seven rural communities. Semi-structured
interviews were conducted with key actors such as patronato leaders (municipalities create patronatos in
each community or barrio--the social function is to serve as liaison between municipal authorities and
civil society and most rural communities have a gender mixed patronatos and those working only for
women), municipal and community authorities, and leaders of the Consejo Nacional Indigena Maya
Chorti de Honduras (CONIMCHH - National Council of Indigenous Maya Chorti of Honduras); and the
private sector (owners of hotels and restaurants). It also draws from lessons learned from the GENFUND
which piloted different ways of reaching the poorest population close to Copan, integrating them in the
flourishing tourism flow.
Main Results
6. Socioeconomic Characteristics. According to the 2001 National Census, the Department of Copan is
predominantly rural (74 percent) and about 85 percent of the rural population is illiterate. Vial access to
rural communities is very difficult and often insecure. For example, Otuta (Santa Rita Municipality) is a
poor, insulated community with no piped water or electricity. However, it seems to hold a strong internal
cohesion; it has strong social capital development with a well coordinated patronato and outspoken
leaders. This community has clear ideas how to use their ecological beauty to develop tourism.
7. Stakeholders and Beneficiaries. Key stakeholders include the rural and urban local population of the
Copan Valley and surrounding areas, especially those living near the archeological parks and sites or
involved directly in the project's activities, the Government of Honduras (and within it, IHT and 1HAH),
the municipalities, the private sector, community-based organizations and NGOs. All municipalities
visited - Copan, El Puente, and Pimienta - are interested in developing a new integral approach to
tourism. Private sector and municipal authorities agree on a vision of the entrepreneurship opportunities
in the tourism facilities; development of strategies for creation of various tourism facilities; and market
tourism using trained professionals.

8. Overall, the Copan Valley Project will benefit the national and regional economy by increasing
investment opportunities derived from the increase of the tourism flow and improving and expanding
sectors related to it through production of goods and provision of services, while benefiting either
directly or indirectly the most vulnerable groups in the region, where the majority of the country's poor is
located. Above all, the benefits of tourism development in the region should be targeted at the
communities themselves, to whom the region's natural and cultural patrimony belong. The indirect
beneficiaries are expected to be the approximately 1.5 million people living in the departments in which
- 80 -



the parks and sites are located, both rural and urban, poor and non-poor, men and women, and indigenous
and non-indigenous. In particular, the project is expected to directly benefit the Maya Chortfs who live in
the Copan Valley in caserias (villages of less than 200 residents each) or aldeas, where the project
activities and subprojects are designed to take place. Also, specific income and employment generating
activities, such as training of archeological and eco-tourism guides and those involved in the Fondo
Prosperidad, are expected to directly and indirectly benefit at least 3,000 families by end of project.
9. The expected benefits for these groups include poverty reduction and increased household incomes as
a result of employment generation, diversification of economic activities, and expansion of market
opportunities, given the increased flow of tourism. The development and conservation work of
archeological sites and the activities that increase tourist access to the attractions will benefit directly,
aside from local urban and rural residents, the municipalities involved, the private sector, the national and
international visitors, researchers, scholars and students. Lastly, the Government of Honduras will benefit
from the institutional enhancement of the IHT and IHAH and the consolidation of its cultural and
environmental resource management.
Box 1: The Chortis
The Chortis are direct descendants of the Maya. Due to a history of disparity, the Chortis were
forced to move away from their traditions, and today most wear western clothing and take western
names. Immigration of criollos and mestizos to the Copan Valley in previous centuries displaced
Chortis from their native land. There are approximately 4,000 Maya Chorti in the Western area of
Honduras In 1997, the Chortd movement strengthened and demanded the Government to return the
land as it was promised in the agreement signed with the Spanish Colonial Government in the 18th
Century. As a result, there has been a resurgence of indigenous culture and pride along with a land
recovery process. In rural Copan, most communities have or are in process of recuperating their
land. Otuta in the Santa Rita Municipality, has recovered some land and more are in process. With
the exception of Otuta, however, most of the recovered land in other communities is not
productive. This is explained by the lack of assets and production inputs, but also because these
communities have been land-workers and not land owners. There is a differentiated degree of
development of social capital and community-based organizations, despite organizing by
CONIMCHH. Also, there is a correlation between the historical structures of social internal
relations within communities' current organizational capabilities and there is a correlation between
communities' social capital and their entrepreneurial capabilities.
10. Social Factors Affecting Poverty, Participation and Project Success. All sites and parks forming
the tourist circuit and their surroundings have different limitations, social scenarios, and tourist
advantages.
* Micro-credit, grants, funds, individual and collective incentives: Although there is a demand for
access to resources, the demand needs to be tailored. In focus groups held with various barrios
(neighborhoods), those consulted stated that unemployment has been increasing due to the coffee crisis.
The urban citizens rely on hotels, restaurants, and souvenir stores for job opportunities. A few work or
have worked for the Copan Park as guards or janitors. However, this source of work is seen as unstable
because it relies on donors' financial support. As self-employed artisans, some produce handicrafts, but
there is little variety. As artisans' supply increases, the market competition and prices drop. In general,
these communities have no clear idea regarding the tourist potential available in urban areas besides the
park and handcrafts. Urban communities have no experience or knowledge regarding Cajas Rurales, a
type of revolving fund used in Honduras. These cajas have used different funding modalities and control
- 81 -



measures to ensure accountability. The general idea that prevails is that what is needed are incentives to
production, without any clarity about market niches or requirements.
Box 2: Cajas Rurales of Savings and Credit
Cajas Rurales have been created across Honduras. They are formed by men and women as a
private enterprise with no political affiliation. The goal is to provide credit to poorer
socioeconomic groups who have not had access to traditional or formal lines of credit due to
lack of collateral. The Organizaci6n Cristiana para el Desarrollo Integral de Honduras
(OCDIH) provides training on accounting, management and enterprise development. One of
the most successful ones is Dalias del Campo localed in Sesesmil 1 in Copan. This Caja
provided credit to produce organic coffee and elaboratejams.
D In principle, communities are interested in the development of small enterprises. None of the people
consulted had previous experience in the private sector or how to organize a firm. Most are willing to
benefit from well-targeted technical assistance to learn how to manage an enterprise. It would be useful
to use the Brazilian experience with the Rural Poverty Projects and process of certifying and selling to
the European Community.
o The Carrizalito village has some level of community-based organization, but vague ideas on how to
generate potential for tourism. Other communities such as La Pintada show low levels of organization,
social capital, and vision to enter into the tourist development. Residents of La Laguna are very
enthusiastic and perceive that they have great potential, but they need to receive appropriate market
training. They have discussed a Tilapia fish enterprise to supply hotels and restaurants with a limited
supply of fresh fish, but their lagoon is too small. The nearby mountain area has some eco-tourism
potential, but lodging and eating facilities need to be developed nearby.
Lessons from GENFUND
11. A pilot initiative funded by the GENFUND sought to explore and identify possible types of
income-generating activities for poor men and women in rural communities in the Copan Valley, in the
vicinity of the Copan Archeological Park. Although this Fund was targeted towards women, lessons
learned have moved beyond this, and in great part, allowed for the design of specific activities to
generate and/or increase income among the Chortfs in the Copan Valley Project. This pilot provided
training and capacity building to women in the rural communities and identified possible
income-generating opportunities. As such, as it became clear that a new project was being prepared, it
also created expectations about what this project would provide to the communities. The pilot provides
useful lessons that were taken into account in designing the Copan Valley Project, including addressing
sustainability, expectations, and coverage. In practical tenrs: the women who participated in the pilot
activities learned how to produce or improve ceramics, how to make bread and pastries, how to set up
and maintain plant nurseries, and how to make candles. Although these activities did not necessarily lead
to an immediate improvement in their lives, the following benefits resulted from the experience:
. Participation in the program increased the women's awareness of their unexploited potential, that they
could contribute ideas for their own improvement, and that their efforts are valuable, as demonstrated by
the sale of their products. It also made them aware of the importance of producing quality goods, it
expanded their perspective and allowed them to see things in a larger framework.
a Women's employment does not negatively affect or disrupt family life in the villages. In fact, women
who work together, for example in producing pottery, share the benefits of their work by providing
- 82 -



employment for other women, such as in childcare.
* One area where significant progress was made was in the support from the men in the villages who
came to see the initiative not as a threat to the gender relations, but as a form of assistance. The men in
the rural communities became aware of women's potential and were ready to work together with women
and support their work. Even the male CONIMCHH leaders in the villages expressed strong support. The
process of consulting the women participants and letting them decide about which activities to carry out
had an impact on the men's attitude and increased their respect towards them. The men in the village of
Carrizal6n, for example, supported the women's work on ceramics and participated in building the fence
around the women artisans' workroom. Men in different villages accepted leadership and instruction
provided by the project promoter who was a woman.
12. Issues that needfurther attention for their impact on sustainability. Marketing is a key issue that
needs further development to ensure that the pilot activities will last after the pilot ends including issues
such as: how to find and keep a market for selling the products such as ceramics and candles; lack of
knowledge of how the market works; and the perception that it was enough to produce a product for
people to buy it. There was no understanding of the concept of competitiveness, quality, or marketing.
The women who participated in the pilot activities now have a better understanding of these issues. There
was misunderstanding among certain women village leaders and members about what the pilot would
provide -- they expected to receive funds or to be paid for their participation in the training events.
Box 3: Women in the Village of La Pintada
In the village of La Pintada, a group of women who had been successfully working together to
produce their dolls decided to work on their own and compete with each other. Their competition
and misguided decisions about marketing resulted in the collapse of the sale of their products. This
led them to decide to get back together to work as a group. The benefit was that they learned about
the importance of working and marketing together as a group. The women who produce soap in the
community of Cabainas have also realized that it is better for them to work together as a group.
In the meetings with representatives from different urban barrios and rural communities on February
14-16, 2003 it became clear that the participants had expectations about the benefits of both the
GENFUND pilot and the new project. The different possibilities for income-generating activities
identified by the exploratory process under the GENFUtND pilot led the participants (urban or rural
residents) to believe that these activities (or other similar ones) would be part of the new project. They
also believed that the new project would be led by the same coordinator who was in charge of the
GENFUND pilot and would benefit the same population. There is a need to communicate clearly and
often the project objectives, and to repeat in different settings the message about what the pilot project
would and would not do. It is also important not to create additional expectations about future projects.
13. Gender Analysis. The following are gender-relevant issues that need to be taken into account in
designing the new project:
* The GENFUND Pilot worked primarily with women in response to gender specific needs identified by
the PROFUTURO Project. It followed a "women in development" approach of targeting and integrating
women into the project activities.
* Participation in the pilot activities has increased the women's awareness of their potential and
improved their self-esteem. It opened a new perspective to them of their value and possibilities for
improving their economic well-being and contributing to their household's welfare.
- 83 -



a Women in Chorti communities are already mobilized and organized in women's groups although these
do not threaten men's dominance in the movement. The groups' purpose is to address women's needs or
to find additional income-generating activities for women, for example, in handicrafts (as artisans).
a The gender division of labor and gender roles in the communities is still quite traditional: men work
in agriculture and/or paid employment while women work at home. Even women's income-generating
activities are performed as part of their domestic activities and usually at home. Girls perform household
tasks such as taking care of younger siblings, doing laundry and carrying water, while boys may help
fathers in farming.
a GENFUND did change somewhat men's opinion about women's work and value but did not greatly
affect the gender division of labor or gender roles. Even when men were or became positive towards
women's income-generating activities, they did not change their gender roles to support women's
increased workload.
o There are almost no women among the village leaders and authorities-either in the patronatos or the
Maya-Chorti councils-although a few women are leaders or representatives among the leadership of the
CONIMCHH.
14. Advantages for Copdn Valley Project. The GENFUND pilot faced constraints and also took
advantage of certain resources already available in the project area including:
a An organized and mobilized population, functioning as communal groups as part of CONIMCHH;
a Most villages have women's groups;
o Local residents are very interested in participating and benefiting from the new project;
- Local residents are very open to receiving training to produce goods and services and to learning about
marketing.including, farming and skills in
producing handicrafts such as ceramics, working with com husks, candle-making or wood carving;
 Most men have a positive attitude towards women's income-generating activities; and
a Some villages that initially decided not to participate in the activities now want to join.
15. Missing Services. All hotels and restaurants in Copan Ruinas buy eggs, vegetables, fish and meat in
San Pedro Sula. Most of these goods are produced in Guatemala. The transaction cost could be reduced if
local enterprises produce these goods, but they need quality control, and supply and tax control to trust
local producers. Services that are lacking include: local place to sample local fruits, juices, salads, and
Mayan food; books in English and/or Spanish compiling all Maya medicinal herbs or recipes; a place to
find Mayan herbs; a handicraft market on weekends in the Central Plaza to allow indigenous peoples and
local residents to sell their goods-from handicrafts to sugarcane juice, fresh fruit juices, pineapple
and/or banana pies, coffee tasting, Copan typical fruit non-alcoholic liqueur, Mayan recipes, hand made
ice cream, fresh made tortillas and marimba and guitar music. This type of event could be negotiated with
the Municipality of Copan Ruinas.
16. Monitoring and Evaluation. The following indicators should be used and monitored:
a Households' revenues at the beginning and end of the project;
a Number of small enterprises created near sites (number of partners by gender, type of trained received,
amount of money provided):
o Investments and transaction costs
a Main clients
a Amount of sales
a Periodic Revenues statements (3 months)
Small enterprises' niche and main activity
o Number of enterprises legally established (taxes) - monitored every six months;
o Number of international and national tourists at the beginning of project - monitored every 3 months;
- 84 -



and
* Average days of stay at the beginning of project - monitored every 3 months.
17. Project Risks. The main risks include:
* Create false expectations in communities by not clearly explaining the rules, their rights and
responsibilities;
* Not to create well-established small enterprises oriented to create a cultural change and increase
household's revenues;
* Not to develop a private mentality and promote and enhance "clientelistic" attitudes among
community people;
* Not to provide a "private or marketing" meaning to the concept of "sustainability;"
* Increase poverty instead of developing well-being and increasing people's revenues - if small
enterprises are not well designed;
 Not to follow a balanced gender approach;
* Not designing and executing a clear stakeholder participatory strategy;
* Not designing an appropriate marketing strategy and not involving communities and local authorities
in understanding it; and
* Not designing a monitoring and evaluation system to keep IHT well-informed to make strategic
backstopping decisions.
Recommendations
18. The main recommendations of the social analysis are:
* Facilitate entrepreneurial opportunities such as: (a) lodging and eating facilities near the tourist places;
(b) rescue Maya Cuisine -- small funding could be provided to rescue basic Maya culinary tradition (this
could be created through the organization of focus groups with Mayan women); (c) restaurants--there are
no eating places near the tourist sites with gourmet Maya cuisine. Small, good ethnic restaurants could be
promoted using the small enterprise funding and arrangement with administrators of cafeterias located in
the parks could be reached.
* Tourist guides. Expectations were raised regarding the training of guides to work for the Copan Park
since IHAH did not approve certifying or licensing the trained guides. To continue with this training, it is
highly recommended to negotiate in advance with IHAH to obtain their training support to ensure
required standards are met.
* Museum Specialists. Appropriate specialists are needed for technical advice regarding strategic
display of ceramics, lighting and use of the space in museums located in parks and sites. This support is
also needed to improve signs located along trails.
* Simple and clear institutional arrangements to keep all key actors and stakeholders - such as
Municipalities, NGO's, community-based organizations, and private sector - on board. IHT must be the
leader of this strategy.
 Marketing strategies based on a sound market research.
* In Copan, initiate an environmental campaign involving the municipality and private sector.
 Involve students in re-forestation activities.
* Prepare a pre-feasibility study to clearly identify areas and activities that could help households' to
increase revenues through small enterprise development.
* Carry out short, but well-targeted customer satisfaction surveys. The target population is private sector
owners of hotels and restaurants and tourists. The main question could be: What would you recommend
to improve tourist leisure and enjoyment in the area?
