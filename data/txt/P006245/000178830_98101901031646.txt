PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Santos
Port Project for which Loan 756-BR for US$45 million equivalent was approved
on May 25, 1971. The project was financed, in addition to the Bank loan by
PORTOBRAS a   by the Federal and Sao Paulo State Railways and by Federal
Government contributions. Loan 756-BR was fully disbursed on March 31, 1981.
This Report was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR has been read in the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The report
was reviewed by Brazilian Authorities whose comments are attached as an
Annex to the Report.

HIGHLIGHTS
The project was the first Bank loan for the port subsector in
Brazil. It was intended to support the port of Santos five year, 1971-
1975, Development Plan and consisted of the following main items:
a)   construction of and equipment for a two berth container terminal;
b)   construction of rail access to the container terminal on the
left bank;
c)   FEPASA's right bank rail link to the port;
d)   dredging equipment;
e)   miscellaneous port related studies.
The construction of the grain terminal which was included in the project
was later deleted (para 3.01).
The project experienced severe delays. The appraisal report
foresaw completion of the project towards the end of 1975. Actually, less
than 50% of the project works had been completed by September 1978. This
delay was caused by a number of factors, among which the more important
ones are changes in decisions during project implementation, financial
difficulties, technical problems. (paras 3.04 to 3.16).
The project also experienced important cost overruns. The items
actually carried out showed a 170% overrun in relation to the estimates at
the time of appraisal (para 3.30). The main explanation for the cost over-
run is that cost estimates at the time of appraisal were based on preliminary
engineering of the project. The detail engineering design was carried out
only after approval of the loan, resulting in substantial cost increases.
Also, the long implementation period contributed to these cost overruns.
(Para 3.31).
Overall traffic figures have exceeded those forecast at the time
of appraisal by about 10%. However, traffic composition was markedly
different than forecast, with general cargo traffic substantially below
the forecast figures, but with dry bulk cargo, mainly fertilizer, being
substantially higher. The annual rate of increase was about 10% as compared
to the appraisal forecast of only 5%. (Paras 4.01 to 4.05).
From 1976 onwards the port's finances deteriorated drastically.
The main reason for this was inadequate tariff increases, considerable cost
increases, change of the allocation rules of port taxes. (Paras 5.01, 5.08).
Thus, the operation surpluses foreseen did not materialize and the






- vi -
part of the investment program that was to be financed by these surpluses
had to come from PORTOBRAS and direct Federal Government contributions.
(Paras 3.13, 3.14).
On the institutional side, the creation of PORTOBRAS and the
transfer of the responsibility for the port of Santos from a private con-
cessionary company to a subsidiary of PORTOBRAS have been achieved. The
adoption of cost-based tariffs which was also foreseen in the project,
has not been achieved.    (Paras 6.01, 6.09).
Despite the cost overruns, the project is still economically
sound, showing an average economic rate of return for the actually carried-
out items of close to 30%. One reason for this is the fact that the pro-
gram as actually carried out did not include some of the items with rela-
tively low rates of return. Also, as mentioned, some traffic items were
substantially above the appraisal values. (Paras 7.01, 7.07).






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965, the Brazilian Government undertook a general transport sur-
vey with the Bank's assistance.   The Government retained consultants to carry
out studies of the ports of Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife, and of coastal
shipping. In 1968, the Government prepared a strategic Development Plan for
1969-1975 which incorporated recommendations of the 1965 transport survey,
including an investment plan and recommendations for institutional reform in
the port sector. The Government subsequently requested Bank financing for
expansion and improvement of the three ports studied by the consultants, and,
in October 1968, an identification mission visited Brazil. Preparation of
the Santos port project was well under way; however, very little preparation
work had been done for the Rio de Janeiro and Recife projects. The mission
recommended that feasibility studies be undertaken for these ports, for possi-
ble consideration for a followup project which never materialized, and, in
the meanwhile, the Bank would proceed with evaluating the Santos port project.
1.02      The Santos port project was finally appraised in August/September
1970, and the Bank approved, on May 25, 1971, a loan for US$45.0 million
equivalent. This was the first port project to be financed by the Bank in
Brazil, and no other port project has been financed since. 1/ The basis of
the project was a Five-Year Development Program (1969-1974) for the port of
Santos - the most important general cargo port in Brazil - which included
activities and investments to (a) modernize and expand the capacity of the
existing congested port on the right bank of the Santos estuary; and
(b) develop the largely unused left bank of the estuary. Dredging equipment
and complementary studies were also included.
1.03      This PCR is based on the following sources of information: (a) the
Appraisal Report (Report No PTR-79a), (b) Supervision Reports, (c) LAC Infor-
mation Center, (d) Draft PCR prepared by PORTOBRAS, and (e) information
collected during a mission to Brazil in May 1981.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A.   Project Preparation
2.01      An identification mission to Brazil (October/November 1968) found
that the preparation of a US$50 million expansion project for the port of
Santos was well advanced and estimated that it could be appraised by March/
April 1969 provided that the Government would perform the following additional
preparation work satisfactorily: (a) complete preliminary engineering;
(b) appoint consultants for detailed engineering and supervision; (c) update
traffic and financial data; (d) prepare a financing plan; and (e) reach agree-
ment with the Concessionaire of the Port of Santos, the Companhia Docas de

Santos (CDS), on the valuation of capital employed and the eventual reversion
of properties to the Government when the concession expired.
2.02      Project preparation proceeded much slower than originally anticipated.l/
In July 1969, Boucinhas and Campos (Brazil)/Coopers and Lybrand (USA), account-
ing consultants, were retained by the Departamento Nacional de Portos e Vias
Navegaveis (DNPVN) to prepare financial forecasts for the Santos port and
accounting systems for the Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife ports. An earlier
preliminary engineering and feasibility study for the project had been completed
in February 1969 by CDS, with the help of Engevix and Planave, Brazilian
consultants. A consortium of consultants OESA (Brazil)/King & Gavaris (USA)
(OESA/KG), was selected by DNPVN in November 1969 to carry out an updated
feasibility study, including an economic analysis for the project, and to
prepare final engineering. A draft preliminary report was submitted by
OESA/KG in April 1970 which proposed extensive development on the right bank
of the Santos estuary (the existing port area) involving an investment of about
US$90 million in 1970-1975. This feasibility study was considered by the Bank
to be deficient in the following respects: (a) inadequate analysis of port
capacity and of improvements in facilities and operations needed to meet
future traffic; (b) little consideration given to use of containerization and
other handling techniques; and (c) all facilities to be located on the right
bank of the Santos estuary, which the Bank believed would exacerbate already
intolerable port/city congestion. The previous Brazilian consultants had
taken into account the possibility of using the left bank and had indicated
this in their studies. However, it appears that this plan was rejected
since OESA/KG indicated that soils were very difficult and that at least ten
years of capital works at prohibitive costs would be necessary. 2/
B.   Project Appraisal
2.03      Despite these problems, an appraisal mission (originally scheduled
for March/April 1969, then rescheduled for March 1970) visited Brazil in
August/September 1970. The mission was assisted by staff from the Agricul-
tural Projects Department which appraised the proposed grain silo subproject.
The appraisal also included the identification of the need for, and scope of,
a national maritime sector master plan. The main issue to emerge from the
appraisal was that of the right versus the left bank development. DNPVN had
never fully studied the Engevix/Planave study. 3/ The mission proposed that
1/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that the delays were caused by the
Bank's request for additional studies.
2/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that this was the Bank's conclusion
which was offered to DNPVN as a hypothesis on which to decide between the
two alternative options that were available, namely the Engevix/Planave
left bank option or the OESA/KG option for the development of the right
bank. The two options were studied thoroughly and a final decision was
held back until the Bank's appraisal mission had an opportunity to review
the matter.
3/ PORTOBRAS has indicated that this statement is incorrect as the report
was thoroughly assessed before arrival of the Bank's appraisal mission
(see note 2 above).

certain facilities, including grain loading and storage facilities, and the
container berths be located on the left bank. Since such development would
involve attendant investments in rail and road links and preparation of a
new physical plan, as well as necessary soil investigations to ensure suita-
bility of the sites, the Government deferred its decision on the matter
pending further study, which included full soil investigations. In the
following months, the National Transport Planning Agency (GEIPOT) analyzed
the 1969 consultants' study, and DNPVN arranged for soil investigations
which were successfully carried out by Planave and OESA. In addition, a
Bank railway mission visited the site to evaluate preliminary cost estimates
for the rail links, and a Bank-financed hydraulics expert from the U.K.
visited the Santos port and recommended that hydraulic studies be included
as part of the project's technical assistance component. When the Government
eventually agreed to develop the left bank, a post-appraisal mission in
December 1970 confirmed the Government's decision to locate the proposed
new grain and container facilities on the left bank. In February 1971, a
second railway mission appraised the railway component of the project.
2.04      In November 1969, when the Brazilian Government had selected the
consortium of King and Gavaris/OESA, consultants for the Santos port project,
the wider implications resulting from shifting development to the left bank
of the Santos estuary had not been foreseen by DNPVN. 1/ Following the
appraisal mission, DNPVN had discussed with the consultants the added work
requirements and related costs of services needed for the preparation of a
revised project arising from shifting major project elements to the left
bank. The negative indications that the consultants had then given for
the development of the left bank and the very extensive and costly studies
that they recommended be done by themselves before any development could
proceed, coupled with the high cost of their then existing contract, led to
DNPVN's decision to terminate that contract. By mutual agreement, and with
satisfactory settlement, the contract was terminated on December 16, 1970.
C.   Project Content
2.05      The project, as appraised, supported the port of Santos' Five-Year
Development Program 1971-1975 and consisted of the items listed in paragraph
3.01. Because the soil conditions on the left bank were considered difficult,
and further soil investigations were warranted, a 25% physical contingency
allowance was added to the cost estimates for the corn silo and railway
component of the project, while a 10% physical contingency was allowed for
the other items. In addition, a 12% price contingency was provided on the
basis of an expected 5% average annual increase in world prices for equipment
and materials involved. In accordance with Bank policy for projects in countries
with rapid inflation and indexing, the price contingency for local costs was
based on anticipated dollar price increases. The cost estimates were based
also on the assumption that the construction would commence in early 1972 and
be completed by the end of 1975.
1/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that the implications were clearly
foreseen and that this was the reason for studying also the right bank
development option.

D.   Loan Negotiations and Particulars
2.06      Loan negotiations took place in Washington D.C. from April 22 through
29, 1971. The loan was approved by the Board of Executive-Directors on May 25,
1971 and became effective on October 29, 1971.
2.07      The loan, amounting to US$45.0 million, covered the foreign exchange
cost of the project (total cost estimated at US$78.5 million in December 1970
US$). The project formed part of the larger Five-Year (1971-1975) Investment
Program for the port of Santos, involving an estimated investment of US$143
million for the port and US$16 million for the rail access. The loan was made
to the Government, with DNPVN as executing agency for the port works. RFFSA
and Sorocabana (now FEPASA) were to carry out related railway works, and
GEIPOT the maritime Sector Master Plan.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.01      The Bank-financed project consisted of eight largely independent
subprojects listed as follows:
(i) Development of the Left Bank
(a)  construction of, and equipment for, a two-berth container
terminal;
(b)  construction of, and equipment for, a grain terminal, including
training for the manager and assistant managers (later deleted
from the project);
(c)  construction of a three-rail track (to serve two different
gauges over 24 km) from COSIPA, a steel mill at the head of the
Santos Estuary with the nearest federal railway connection, to
the two terminals (Rail Access); and,
(d)  construction of a meter gauge track (21 km) and installation of
a third rail on an existing federal track (6 km) to link the
state railways to COSIPA and thus to the two terminals (FEPASA
Rail Link).
(ii) Complementary Activities
(a)  provision of dredging equipment;
(b)  study on the reorganization of the main executing agency, to be
carried out by a management consultant;
(c)  hydraulic study of the Santos bay and estuary, including the
provision of equipment and instruments; and.
(d)  overall port planning study.
The project also provided engineering consultant services for engineering
design and supervision of construction for the terminals and the rail access.
3.02     Although Bank financing was restricted to the project, both the Bank
and the Government committed themselves to the full Program. Therefore, the
Loan Agreement included a covenant requiring the Government to "consult with
the Bank before undertaking in any one year any project or development at the
port of Santos (other than the borrower's 1971-1975 Five-Year Development
Program for the port of Santos) involving a capital investment in excess of
US$2,000,000 equivalent."
3.03     Responsibility for project implementation was entrusted to the National
Ports and Waterways Department (DNPVN), reorganized in January 1976 as the Bra-
zilian Ports Authority (PORTOBRAS). The Federal Railway Authority (RFFSA)



- 6 -
undertook the construction of the rail access; a railway of the State of Sao
Paulo (SOROCABANA, which was later merged with other State railways into the
State of Sao Paulo Railway-FEPASA), the construction of the linking railway;
and the Ministry of Transport's Planning Authority (GEIPOT), the overall port
study. The Hydraulic Research Institute (INPH), a subsidiary of DNPVN/PORTOBRAS,
carried out the hydraulic studies. The signing of contracts between DNPVN
and the management and engineering consultants and the signing of subsidiary
loan agreements by the Government with RFFSA and SOROCABANA for relending from
the loan proceeds were made conditions of effectiveness.
A.   Project Implementation
(i) General
3.04     Neither the appraisal report nor the loan agreement contained any
schedule for project implementation, except for mentioning the work of the
engineering consultants (see Annex 7 of the Appraisal Report). However, the
Appraisal Report does state that construction was expected to start early
in 1972, and that the project was expected to be completed toward the end of
1975. Actually, project implementation started very slowly. When compared to
appraisal expectations, less than 50% of the project works had been completed
by September 1978.
(ii)  The Left Bank Subprojects:  (a) The Container Terminal and
(b) the Rail Access - Factors Affecting Both Subprojects
3.05      The Appraisal Report indicated that engineering consultants would be
appointed in May 1971 and that final engineering would be ready in December
1971.  In actual fact, the contract was not signed until November 1971, and
final designs were delivered in December 1972 (overall, a 12-month delay).
The engineering consultants re-estimated the cost for the subprojects (still
inclusive of the Grain Terminal) at US$93 million, almost double the appraisal
estimate of US$50 million because the final designs presented were much larger
in scope and magnitude than those originally envisaged when the project was
appraised.
3.06      Meanwhile, the Brazilian Government was preparing and launching the
Export Corridors Program, which envisaged Japanese-financed investments in
several ports, including Santos, to handle the anticipated increase in the
volume of exports. Under the Program, the Government not only requested that
a larger grain terminal be built under the project, which the Bank had earlier
agreed to, but also planned investments for temporary grain storage and handling
facilities located on the right bank. Although the Bank followed the develop-
ments under the Export Corridors Program closely, and had asked the Government
to be kept informed, details were furnished to the Bank only in November 1972,
after contracts with Japanese firms had already been signed and construction
on the right bank had started.
3.07      Although bidding documents for the rail access and both container and
grain terminals were substantially ready in early 1973, the Bank concluded, and
DNPVN agreed, that the grain facilities duplicated on both banks, plus the



large increase in project cost estimates, cast doubts on the economic justifi-
cation of the grain and container terminals and the rail access on the left
bank. At the Bank's request, the Government undertook to reanalyze the
project's scope, timing and economic feasibility, and, in January 1973, the
calling of bids for the three subprojects was suspended pending the outcome of
this review.          1
3.08      The review was conducted by consultants (Planave-Brazil) already
retained as part of an ongoing GEIPOT study of the Export Corridors investments,
under additional terms of reference agreed with the Bank. Work started in
April 1973 and was to be completed in June. The consultants' draft report,
produced in September 1973, concluded that: (a) the construction of the grain
terminal should be postponed until 1980; (b) modified and scaled-down rail
connections were justified; and (c) the container terminal should be built
in three phases (later reduced to two). After discussions with DNPVN, GEIPOT,
and the consultants in October 1973, the Bank agreed to the deletion of the
grain terminal from the project and to the immediate start on the first phase
of the container terminal. It also agreed to the modified rail access, subject
to confirmation of some of the assumptions on which traffic forecasts were
based. In February 1974, the Bank withdrew its objections to proceeding with
the rail access, and amendments to the loan documents were made accordingly in
June 1974.
3.09      Immediately following Bank action in June 1974, RFFSA reactivated
the rail access subproject, now on a modified scheme, and alignment and
bidding procedures started 2.5 years after effectiveness. 1/
3.10      Three problems seriously delayed the railway earthworks:
(a)  Because the hydraulic fill from dredging for the earthworks
originally scheduled was unexpectedly found to be of fine
silts and alluvials (and useless as a fill material), coupled
with the fact that the type of dredger used could not perform
adequately to required specifications, the more expensive alter-
native of stone dykes for the earthwork sections, backfilled with
suitable sand-fill hauled in and dumped by trucks, had to be
resorted to. Delay in resolving the problem amounted to nine
months.
(b)  Because of financial cash flow problems in late 1976, RFFSA
ordered a work stoppage throughout 1977 (one-year delay);
PORTOBRAS had to rescue RFFSA in early 1978 by providing much
needed funds.
(c) The subsequent clearances of the railway alignment due to
existing obstructions (houses, small industries in a coastal
town near the alignment) took up most of 1978 until August.
1i PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that the delay was entirely caused by the
Bank's request to reanalyze and redesign the rail access. PORTOBRAS also indi-
cated that work on the rail access did not follow the Bank's action but
resumed only once the Bank withdrew its objection to the construction of the
access as planned.



- 8 -
The rail access was substantially completed, except for the laying of the third
rail to complete the COSIPA-FEPASA link, by October 1979. Subsequently the line
was completed in 1980.
3.11      In contrast with the rail access, activities on the container terminal
did not start immediately after Bank agreement to the phased construction con-
veyed to DNPVN in October 1973.  The consultants, SONDOTECNICA/INTECSA, had
demobilized, and the redesign and detailed engineering for the modified scheme
represented additional work which resulted in protracted negotiations between
DNPVN and the consultants. This delayed the completion of detailed engineering
until April 1975. Although the Bank approved the bidding documents in July
1975, bidding did not take place until several months later. Three out of the
ten bidders submitting bids in December 1975 were rejected at the first
envelope stage; they filed objections that resulted in a three-month delay.
Eventually, construction of the container terminal was awarded in August 1976,
2.8 years after the Bank had approved the phased construction plan. 1/ The
contract time for construction of the container terminal was 33 months, ending
June 1979.
3.12      Mobilization of the contractor was slow.  Initially, he had to spend
two to three months to obtain authorization from the Forestry Development
Institute (IBDF) - the agency in charge of ecological protection in Brazil -
to get into the project area. The contractor then suggested several changes
in project design, including adding gabions after detailed soil tests had con-
vinced him that the construction method proposed by the consultants was not
viable. He assured a Bank supervision mission that there would be no increase
in the cost of construction. The proposals were accepted by the mission on
that basis. Several months later, however, DNPVN (now PORTOBRAS) informed the
Bank that the changes would mean a cost increase of 25%. 21 Bank staff suggested
an alternative design to avoid this cost increase, but PORTOBRAS responded
nine months later, reiterating its preference for the gabion solution in spite
of the cost increase. 31 At a meetinR held in Washington. the Bank acceded to
PORTOBRAS on this issue in order to avoid further delays which would probably
1/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that the delay was mostly caused by the
Bank's request to review the project and stage it, a process that had the
sole purpose of assisting the Bank define what it would finance out of the
total works. To PORTOBRAS the project continued to be one entity; in fact
PORTOBRAS did complete the third stage of the project without Bank assistance.
2/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that the 25% cost increase was not due to
the use of gabions; that in fact the gabions cost no more than the works they
substituted for and the cost difference, as explained at the time was caused
by other works which had to be modified because of site conditions.
3/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that while it is true that there were
unexpected delays most of the delay was caused by the need to convince the
Bank that every change required in the project was needed as a result of
changed circumstances in the field. For instance, it savs, this comparatively
unimportant change was not easily approved by the Bank. PORTOBRAS indicates
that on similar works of significant complexity not assisted by the Bank
delays are substantially smaller.



have cost more than the expected savings. The new construction technique
required waiting a minimum of five months to permit the settling of the
gabions before driving the piles. In 1980, PORTOBRAS suffered from a serious
shortage of funds, which slowed the progress on the project. The work was
still continuing when the loan was closed. Substantial completion was achieved
by May 31, 1981, but Rro^urement of container h4ndling equipment (except for
two container cranes) was still pending at the time. I/
(iii) Rail Works Outside the Left Bank Port Area (FEPASA Rail Link)
3.13      The FEPASA (formerly SOROCABANA) rail subproject consisted of (a) the
construction of a meter-gauge railway line, 21 km long, between Paratinga
and Pereque; and (b) the installation of a third rail to the existing meter-
gauge line, 6 km long, between Pereque and Piacagura (COSIPA). The original
purpose of this subproject, begun in 1963, was to connect the State railway
network to COSIPA, a steel mill about 10 km from the city of Santos. Lack of
funds had caused work to cease in 1965. When the left bank project was con-
ceived, this rail link acquired enhanced importance, and its completion was
included in the project. FEPASA was entrusted with the task of executing the
works.
3.14      Several problems slowed implementation, but the most significant delay,
affecting the completion of the entire link, was in the start of the construc-
tion of the Via Anchieta Viaduct, which would carry the main Sao Paulo-Santos
highway over the rail line. A contract, signed in April 1973, for works to
start in July had to be canceled because the State Highway Department objected
to the viaduct design. New bids were opened in September 1974, and works
started in April 1975, 21 months after the date previously envisaged. Work
proceeded without problems, and the viaduct was completed in June 1976. The
cost of the viaduct was not financed by the Bank, although it formed part of
the project executed by FEPASA. The rest of the works were completed by
mid-1977, and the line was opened to railway traffic in October 1977.
3.15      Other major parts of the project, although not involved in the
re-evaluation of the left bank works, were also subject to delays. Specifica-
tions and bid documents for the trailing suction hopper dredger included in
the project were approved by the Bank in March 1972, but another year was
taken to complete the documents and call for bids.   It was found that none of
the eight bids received in February 1974 complied with the bidding conditions.
The second bid opening resulted in award of the contract in February 1975; the
dredger was delivered ahead of schedule.
3.16      The project also included hydraulic studies of the Santos bay and
estuary to investigate siltation, sediment, salinity, littoral drift and other
phenomena that could affect the expansion of the port of Santos. A physical
model of the Bay was built by the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Hidroviarias
(INPH, a department of DNPVN), some field studies were carried out, and some
hydraulic instruments and measuring equipment were purchased with loan funds.
1/ PORTOBRAS has indicated (see Annex) that much of the delay was caused by
the Bank's slow approval of a reallocation of loan proceeds from civil
works to the equipment category of the loan.



- 10 -
(iv) The Overall Port Planning Study
3.17      The loan included a sum of US$500,000 for consulting assistance to
coordinate studies for the development of an overall port plan for Brazil.
Responsibility for the port plan studies was delegated to the National Trans-
port Planning Agency (GEIPOT). GEIPOT had been established by the Government
in the mid-1960s and had been quite effective for several years, but, after
1968, GEIPOT lost staff to the private sector and also lost status because a
change in Government had brought a different approach to planning. Nothing
happened during the first nine months after effectiveness, and, in July 1972,
the Minister of Transport transferred responsibility for the Study from GEIPOT
to DNPVN, which would administer the consultants under the general guidance of
GEIPOT; a contract was awarded in May 1973.   The contract allowed 12 months
for preparing the study, but the study was not completed until August 1975,
a 15-month delay.
3.18      The 12-month period envisaged for the study was too short.    Although
the consulting firm worked continuously, and without delays, it took twice as
long as originally envisaged to complete the study. Three factors contributed
to this unrealistic scheduling: (a) the study aimed at putting together all
information and studies available on each of the 16 main Brazilian ports, and
it was difficult to forecast the amount of material and the time needed to
retrieve, organize and analyze it; (b) the time required for DNPVN and GEIPOT
to review, comment on, and approve each of the elements that made up the study
was grossly underestimated; and (c) there was some pressure to shorten the
time allowed for the study because all the parties involved were rather
anxious to make up for the two years which had already elapsed.
(v) The Overall Investment Program of the Port of Santos Outside
the Bank-Financed Project
3.19      Excluding the Bank-financed project, the DNPVN investment program
for capital expenditure for the port of Santos, executed during the same time,
consisted of:
(a) other projects in the Five-Year Development Program, 1971-1975,
agreed by the Bank during appraisal (see DNPVN's funding schedule
in Table 1); and
(b) investments under the Export Corridors Program for Santos (see
DNPVN's funding schedule in Table 2).
3.20      The works under (a) preceding were meant to be improvements to the
right bank facilities, viz., extending and widening some quays, converting
others into roadways for port traffic, constructing transit sheds, improving
rail and road access and other facilities inside the port area, replacing old
equipment and acquiring additional equipment, and improving and extending
wheat handling. Most of the program was executed during the Bank-financed
project 1971-1981. The Export Corridors Program was executed in two phases,
the first being completed by the end of 1973, and the second largely completed
at present.

3.21      Delays in implementing the Bank-financed project, in particular
those affecting the civil works on the left bank estuary of the port, including
the rail accesses, and the procurement of the dredger have been extensively
covered in the Operation Evaluation Department's (OED) Report No. 2946 dated
April 11, 1980, entitled "Operational Policy Review - Delays in Project
Implementation." We fully agree with OED's comments.
(vi) Services of Consultants and Contractors
(a) Consultants
3.22      The consortium of Boucinhas and Campos (Brazil)/Coopers Lybrand (USA),
Management Consultants (BCCL) was retained by DNPVN between September 1971 and
April 1974. Its assignment consisted of establishing financial and cost
accounting, budgetary and financial planning, electronic data processing
(EDP) and internal auditing systems at the port of Santos and for DNPVN. The
consortium also reviewed port tariffs at Santos, installed a tariff review
section in DNPVN, established an operational planning unit at Santos and made
recommendations to re-organize DNPVN. According to DNPVN, the consultants'
work was very satisfactory, and they were on schedule.
3.23      Engineering consultants SONDOTECNICA (Brazil) and INTECSA (Spain)
were retained for the final engineering and design of the left bank civil
works between September 1971 and August 1975. INTECSA ceased activity there-
after, and only SONDOTECNICA was retained for the supervision phase which
ended May 1981 with the completion of the container terminal. Both consultants
were reported by DNPVN and PORTOBRAS to have performed their assignments
satisfactorily.
3.24      The consortium of PLANAVE (Brazil)/Rendel Palmer and Tritton (UK)
was retained by GEIPOT/DNPVN for the overall port studies. Its performance
was reported by GEIPOT/DNPVN to be satisfactory.
3.25      Professor D.M. MacDowell (UK) was retained by DNPVN (PORTOBRAS)
as a consultant advisor for the hydraulic studies, training of Brazilian
engineers abroad, and establishment of model studies and related equipment and
instruments for the hydraulic studies. His performance was reported by DNPVN
to be very satisfactory.
3.26      FEPASA had retained the services of a local Brazilian consulting
firm, SERETE, for the design engineering involved in its work. FEPASA reported
that the performance of this consultant was satisfactory.
(b) Contractors
3.27      The list of contractors employed on the various subprojects is as
given in Table 3. All civil works subprojects were undertaken by Brazilian
contractors, whose performance and quality of workmanship were reported to be
very satisfactory by PORTOBRAS, RFFSA and FEPASA.

current Cruzeiroe and U.S. dollars, as of May 1981, is as summarized in the
following tabulation. As of that time, some outstanding claims were pending
and payment for some container handling equipment not yet delivered, was still
due.

3.29      The "Actual and Appraisal Estimates of Project Costs" given in
Table 4, differs from the PORTOBRAS' estimate (para 3.28). The "Actual Costs"
column in Table 4 provides costs actually incurred on the project up to May
1981; whereas the PORTOBRAS' estimate includes costs actually incurred up to
May 1981, as well as estimated pending payments still outstanding after that
date.
3.30      In order to compare the cost of the project, as now completed,
against the Appraisal Cost Estimate, the summarized table below has been pre-
pared. The figures are in Constant December 1970 Cruzeiro values, excluding
items not carried out:

3.31      This cost overrun occurred despite the fact that many of the items
included in the project at appraisal were not carried out. The main explana-
tion for the cost overrun is that cost estimates at the time of the appraisal
were based on preliminary engineering of the project. The detailed engineering
design was carried out after approval of the loan, and a substantial cost
increase compared with appraisal estimates resulted. Furthermore, the long
implementation period and higher prices due to local inflation had a considera-
ble impact on the cost overruns for many project items, specifically in the
case of civil works.
C.   Disbursements
3.32      At appraisal, the loan contribution was estimated to cover 57% of
the total project costs. Primarily due to the worldwide price increases in



- 15 -
port-related construction, and, to a lesser extent, to cost underestimates at
appraisal, total project costs increased almost twofold (in 1970 US dollars)
over appraisal estimates, the loan contributed about 30% of total project
costs; by the time of the closing of the loan, the rate of disbursement for
the civil works had been reduced to 10%. 1/

the proportion of the dredger financed by loan proceeds will be below 60%.
PORTOBRAS has also indicated that the disbursement procedures used by the
Bank (which were not explained to them at the time) turned this operation
into a means of being reimbursed for expenses incurred rather than a loan
to finance the project. This, according to PORTOBRAS, had not only the
effect of generating additional costs but was the source of many delays
on which the Bank should share responsibility.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A.   Traffic
4.01      Traffic projections at appraisal showed potential for average growth
in port traffic of about 5% per year, from about 12 million tons in 1970 to
about 17.3 million tons in 1980. Table 5 details the appraisal forecasts
and relates these figures to actual data. A summary is given below:

4.02      It can be seen that the total traffic (tons) predicted in the
appraisal has materialized, and was even 8% higher than originally estimated.
However, traffic composition was different than forecast, which had an adverse
effect in the finances of the port (paras 5.02 and 5.05). Actual traffic,
excluding private terminals, reached about 18.8 million tons in 1980, which,
through extrapolation, represents an 8% annual average increase since 1970.
General cargo traffic (tons) was about 20% lower in 1980 compared to appraisal
estimates. This was due almost entirely to general cargo imports which were
estimated to increase, from 1970, on an annual average rate of 10%, but
actually increased by only 3%, largely because of Government restrictions on
imports as a part of a program to conserve foreign exchange. Dry bulk traffic
(tons), however, was about 12% higher in 1980, compared to the appraisal
forecast, mainly because of fertilizer imports, which increased on an annual
average rate of 10% vis-a-vis the appraisal forecast of only 5%.
4.03      The largest increase in traffic was attributed to liquid bulk; in
1980, it represented about 30% of the Santos port traffic and reached 5.6
million metric tons. Liquid bulk traffic was about 60% higher in 1980 than
appraisal estimates, mainly as a result of coastal shipping (exports) of diesel
oil and other petroleum products. During the appraisal, it was estimated that
a large portion of crude petroleum imports (about 2,000 million tons) would be
discharged at Santos; however, Government policies diverted these imports to
the port of Sao Sebastian, which belongs to PETROBRAS. However, after the
crude oil was refined at REPLAN (PETROBRAS' refinery near Sao Paulo), it was
shipped back to Santos for domestic consumption and coastal distribution.
The appraisal forecast could not reflect this policy change and, therefore,
under-estimated liquid bulk coastal shipping and over estimated liquid bulk
imports. The net result was an increase in liquid bulk traffic.
4.04      The appraisal traffic forecast considered only the traffic directly
handled by the Santos port concession and did not take into account traffic
going through private terminals inside the port boundaries. The following
chart illustrates the volume of this traffic:

4.05      In 1980, traffic through private terminals represented about 20% of
total traffic throughput in Santos. This traffic provided some badly needed
revenues (port dues) to the Santos port which were not forecast in the appraisal.
B.   Operations
4.06      Port operations at Santos have been handled competently and did not
cause any major problem to the project. The appraisal report did not address
this matter in depth, and, therefore, no forecast of port operating statistics
was made. Some of the more significant port operating statistics are given
below, representing averages for the period 1974-1980:
(1) Ship waiting time

- 19 -
The number of containers handled by the Santos port during the last seven
years has almost quadrupled. The cargo handled in containers reached about
one million tons in 1980, which represents about 5% of the total cargo through-
put during that year. This is a considerable achievement since the containers
were still being handled in the general cargo berths 1/ where the working area
is inadequate, particularly at ship side. With the recently inaugurated
container terminal not yet fully operational, container operations will become
much more efficient. At present, containers handled through the right bank of
the Santos port have to be trucked through the congested city area of Santos
to get to their final destination. Inland transport to and from the new
container facilities on the left bank should suffer from much less congestion
since that side of the estuary is only sparsely developed.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Revenues and Expenses
5.01      Tables 6 and 7 summarize the financial performance of the Santos
port for the period 1974-1980 and compare it with appraisal projections.
Results for the period 1970-1973 are not shown since the figures have little
value because of the cumbersome accounting procedures used to gather them and
the rather unusual form of published financial accounts. This deficiency
had already been pointed out during the appraisal, and management consultants
were hired to set up a meaningful accounting system which was fully implemented
only in 1974.
5.02      The Santos port had been a profitable institution for many years
and was in a strong financial position at the time of appraisal. The overall
financial performance was satisfactory until 1975. From 1976 onward, port
finances deteriorated to such a point that the port was taking heavy losses
and the reserves it had accumulated in prior years were rapidly depleting.
The main reasons for the deteriorating financial trend are: (a) tariff increases
were smaller than the increases in costs; (b) the inflexible and inadequate
tariff structure did not permit response to changes in the composition of
traffic; and (c) allocation of the proceeds of 40% of the port improvement
taxes as part of the ports' revenues was discontinued. Furthermore, but to a
lesser extent, the concessionaire (CDS) did not go out of his way to make a
strong effort to obtain tariff increases, largely because CDS knew that the
concession was coming to an end in 1980 and, under the concession agreement,
it was assured of its fees as well as the repayment of the actual value of its
assets. The preceding matters are discussed more fully in paragraphs 5.04 to
5.08.

in August 1981.

5.04      As can be seen from the preceding chart, the average operating
revenue per ton (in December 1970 Cr$) was Cr$ 16.3 in 1970, Cr$ 22.8 in 1975
and Cr$ 14.1 in 1980. Tariffs did not increase in relation to much larger
increases in port costs during the period 1976-1980; tariff increases authorized
by the Government during that period were insufficient to maintain them at the
same level of 1975 and, in fact, they decreased by about 38% in real terms.
Furthermore, as of 1977, the Port Improvement Tax, 1/ which is collected by
1/   2% over ad-valorem on imports until 1976, 3% from 1977 onward.



- 21 -
each port and of which 40% 1/ remained in the port as part of its revenues for
port investment purposes, was entirely passed on to PORTOBRAS. Although the
entire transfer of the proceeds of this tax to PORTOBRAS has a logical rationale,
because PORTOBRAS should be and is in charge of port investments and investment
priorities, it left the ports, specifically Santos, with fewer resources. For
instance, it had to pay, out of its operating revenues, for dredging expenses
and the replacement of small equipment from 1977 onward. Since the operating
revenues barely covered the direct labor operating costs, the remaining
resources were not sufficient to cover other port costs.
5.05      Another reason for the reduced operating revenues can be found in
the inflexible and inadequate tariff structure. In 1975, storage operating
revenues represented about 57% of total operating revenues, and the average
collected was Cr$ 12.9 (in December 1970 Cr$) per ton. In 1980, these revenues
represented only 18% of Santos' total operating revenues, and the average
revenue collected was only Cr$ 2.5 per ton. The main reason for this decrease
in revenues is the fact that general cargo imports were considerably less than
in prior years because of the restrictions and high deposits imposed on all
imports by the Government. These deposits had a dual impact:
(a)  they discouraged the importation of all except only urgently needed
items; and
(b)  they encouraged the importers to clear their goods through the
ports rapidly in order to recover the import deposits.
5.06      Unfortunately, PORTOBRAS and Santos port have not yet been able to
change the tariff structure to take into account the changes in traffic compo-
sition, and across-the-board tariff increases alone have not allowed the port
to generate the required revenues to cover its costs. In 1976, PORTOBRAS
prepared a draft decree introducing changes in the port tariff structure.
This draft decree was presented to the Ministries of Planning, Finance and
Transport, but has not yet been enacted. The main reason for the long delay
is the fact that the decree contains many other issues which are politically
very sensitive, such as a complete redefinition of responsibilities of the
Merchant Marine, Customs Department, and shipping companies, as well as
changes in the structure and power of the stevedores' unions.
5.07      From 1970 to 1975, operating costs increased dramatically (about
100%, in constant 1970 Cr$) but, after 1975, they leveled off and, in fact,
decreased slightly. This fluctuation can be explained largely by the fact
that, by the end of 1973, Santos port absorbed and inherited about 4000
employees from the now defunct "Coordenacao de Servicios Portuarios" (COSEP).
This organization provided many port services generally given by the Merchant
Marine and by the "Capitania Portuaria," but it was dissolved in 1973 and its
functions were transferred to the individual ports. Some other reasons for
the sharp increase in operating costs during the 1970-1975 period are: (a) that
traffic (excluding private facilities) increased drastically from 10.5 to
1/   60% of the tax was passed on to PORTOBRAS until 1976.



- 22 -
15.4 million tons per year, at a yearly average rate of about 8% instead of
the 3% estimated during appraisal; and (b) that port labor salaries increased
by about 5% yearly in real terms (about 3% during 1975-1980) compared to
appraisal estimates of only 2%. From 1975 onward, Santos port slowly divested
itself of excess staff: from a one-time peak of 16,300 workers employed at the
end of 1974, it reduced its labor force to about 13,000 at the end of 1980.
This represents a considerable achievement because, with fewer staff, it was
still able to handle continuous increases in traffic which, in 1980, reached
about 18.8 million tons compared to the 15.4 million tons handled in 1975.
5.08      In general, operating costs increased at the same rate as prices
in the economy as a whole, with the exception that salaries increased a little
more. Tariff increases since 1975, however, did not keep pace with these
increases in costs; hence, the deterioration of Santos' financial position.
B.   Balance Sheet
5.09      Tables 8 and 9 show the consolidated Balance Sheet for the port
of Santos. The concession of the port (CDS) terminated on November 7, 1980.
The December 31, 1980 balance sheet reflects the financial position of the
newly created (November 8, 1980) "Companhia Docas do Estado do Sao Paulo"
(CODESP) at the end of 1980. The fixed assets belonging to CDS, reserve and
investment accounts which had been established and the amount owed to it by
the Federal Government are being negotiated by the Ministry of Transport. The
incorporation of those assets into CODESP, as well as the capital contribution
from the Federal Government, will take place once negotiations with CDS are
completed. The fixed asset value shown in CODESP's balance sheet represents
the net value of PORTOBRAS' assets after revaluation and depreciation. CDS'
assets are not reflected in the December 31, 1980 balance sheet since their
value is still being determinated. Although the fixed asset value increased
in current terms, it decreased in real terms since the revaluation was smaller
than the overall increase of prices in the economy.
5.10      The appraisal figures for long term debt represent the amount of the
outstanding portion of the Bank loan. However, the consolidated Balance Sheet
of CDS shows only a long term credit given by PETROBRAS to CDS in return for
some portion of land for the oil-handling facilities. The World Bank loan was
not accounted for in CDS' or CODESP's Financial Statements since the Borrower
was the Federal Government, not the port. In fact, the Federal Government,
through the Ministry of Transport, has been repaying the Bank loan and charges,
and no entry has been made in CDS' Financial Statements, so that a comparison
of debt/equity ratios becomes meaningless.
C.   Review of Financial Covenants
5.11      The principal financial covenants included in the loan agreement are
discussed below:
(a) Sections 4.02(a) and 4.02(b) required that the Borrower main-
tain adequate records and have its financial statements audited
by the Ministry of Finance. Recording and auditing were satisfac-
tory.



- 23 -
(b) Section 4.03 required that the Borrower: (1) review the rates
charged for port services and the taxes levied against port users
with a view toward coordination and simplification of such rates
and taxes; (ii) cause such rates and taxes to be reasonably related
to costs and to yield such rate of return on capital employed as
shall be agreed between the Borrower and the Bank; (iii) introduce
such rates and taxes no later than December 31, 1973; (iv) cause
such rates and taxes to be applied to any and all port users; and,
(v) amend such rates and taxes, if and when required, in order
to assure that they continue to yield such a return on capital
employed as is specified under (ii) preceding. Since, until 1975,
the Santos port financial position was very good, yielding a rate
of return on capital employed of about 13% (28% in 1974), it was
not deemed necessary to agree on a specific rate of return although
the Bank expressed some concern because tariffs were not related to
costs. In 1976, however, when the traffic composition changed and the
port no longer received a share of the port improvement tax, a change
in the tariff structure became necessary in order to produce sufficient
revenue and relate tariffs to changes in costs. In November 1976,
PORTOBRAS prepared a draft decree changing the tariff structure,
but the decree has not yet been enacted (para 5.06). PORTOBRAS did
not want to commit itself on a rate of return for 1977 onward until
a new tariff structure was introduced.

concessionaire was entitled. These surpluses would represent the excess earnings
of DNPVN (PORTOBRAS) and its return on capital invested, and would be sufficient



- 25 -
to finance the development program up to 1975, with the help of the Bank loan and
a grant, envisaged at that time, from the Government of Canada. The ample funds
which Santos port was envisaged to generate would also finance further develop-
ment beyond 1975 without recourse to other government resources. In addition,
it was said that excess profits earned by the concessionaire could be made
available to help finance capital investments at the port.
5.14      What, in fact, happened was that Santos port did not generate the fore-
cast surpluses of funds, especially after 1975, when the container facilities
(the main project item left in the project) were being built. In addition,
actual costs of the port investments made were about 70% higher than forecast;
the grant for the wheat handling and storage facilities did not come about,
and all the revenues generated by the Pori. Improvement Tax passed on entirely
to PORTOBRAS. In practice, the project was financed, in addition to the Bank
loan, entirely by PORTOBRAS and by the railways (Federal and State) from
Federal Government contributions. The railway investment cost, which was more
than three times the forecast, represented a heavy burden on the railway
finances.
5.15      Other items outside the Bank-financed project, but included in
the Santos port Five-Year Development Program (1971-1975, para 3.19) were
also fully funded by PORTOBRAS (DNPVN).
5.16      PORTOBRAS (DNPVN) collected about Cr$ 2.0 billion (in December
1970 Cr$) in port improvement taxes at Santos port during the period 1970-1980.
These funds were more than sufficient to cover port investments in Santos
during that period. In fact, no borrowings, other than the Bank loan, were
required to finance the investments in Santos.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
A.   General
6.01      The Appraisal Report listed three institutional reforms in the port
subsector as being of vital interest. They were:
(a) measures to decentralize port administration by reorganizing
DNPVN into a planning and policy-making body and gradually trans-
ferring ports to mixed economy companies;
(b) improvement of Santos port management, operations and accounting;
and
(c) adoption of cost-based tariffs, initially at Santos, but later in
the other ports as well.
6.02      The reorganization of DNPVN and Santos port have been carried through
and have been partially successful. The third item, i.e., the adoption of cost-
based tariffs, has not been implemented. Tariffs have been raised frequently but
inadequately on a case-by-case basis, which has caused financial difficulties
for the port of Santos.



- 26 -
B.   Port Administration Decentralization
6.03      The organization and administration of the Brazilian ports by the
time of the appraisal was characterized by a high degree of centralization and
administrative inflexibility with respect to salaries, tariffs, and regulations
in general. The hiring of management consultants to study this problem and to
propose improvements was therefore made a condition of loan effectiveness.
6.04      The management consultants (Boucinhas, Campos, Coopers and Lybrand,
BCCL) started their assignment in September 1971 and submitted recommendations
in late 1972. It was proposed by BCCL that DNPVN be transformed into a public
corporation, which would help to achieve the required flexibility. The
Government rejected that idea, and the question was left open. A prolonged
period of discussions regarding the future of DNPVN followed, and finally, in
mid-1975, the Brazilian Congress passed a law phasing out DNPVN and creating a
new public corporation, PORTOBRAS. PORTOBRAS would supervise, coordinate and
control port construction, administration and finances. The law allowed
PORTOBRAS to set up subsidiaries in the form of mixed economy companies or
public enterprises to run the ports. PORTOBRAS opened for business in January
1976. About 25% of DNPVN's personnel were transferred to PORTOBRAS, and the
remaining vacancies were filled by outside recruiting.
6.05      The creation of PORTOBRAS also foresaw the organization of the
individual ports as subsidiary companies to PORTOBRAS. This process is now
completed and it has enabled PORTOBRAS to get away from the day-to-day manage-
ment of port operations and become a holding company which should mainly
determine overall policy and investment needs in the port sector.
6.06      PORTOBRAS has accomplished most of its objectives; the main organiza-
tion is fully staffed, the training program is working and the overall effi-
ciency can be considered good. The one important area where difficulties have
been encountered is that of financial and investment planning. However, most
of the difficulty can be ascribed to the general economic situation of Brazil
and the tariff issue (para. 6.09).
C.   Improvement of Santos Port
6.07      The Santos port was, when the loan was made, run as a private com-
pany whose concession would expire in 1980. Therefore, to ensure the orderly
transfer of responsibility, DNPVN agreed to have ready the organization and
personnel for a new entity to take over the assets and operations at the port.
Additionally, studies were to be carried out with respect to operations, finan-
cial and cost accounting systems, budgetary control and management information
systems, maintenance, inventory control and data processing.
6.08      BCCL Management Consultants were retained for assistance and were
engaged in the implementation phase of the proposed systems when a fire,
in November 1973, destroyed many of the programs and files. It was possible,
however, to complete the assignment, and, during the first half of 1974, BCCL
completed its contract. The overall impression is that the consultants made
good progress and that their recommendations were generally implemented.



- 27 -
Their work was concentrated on developing systems for accounting, budgeting
and costing as well as on the training of port staff in these areas.
D.   Tariffs
6.09      One of BCCL's tasks was to review tariffs at the port of Santos and
to install a tariff review section in DNPVN. The new tariffs were to be reason-
bly cost-related and were to be introduced at the port of Santos by the end of
1973. The proposals of the consultants to achieve this goal were accepted in
principle, but could not be implemented without some general changes in port
regulations. A new tariff structure has not yet been enacted; thus, the objec-
tive of introducing reasonably cost-related port tariffs was not achieved. The
authority to decide on tariffs remained at the Ministry level and was later even
further centralized, with SEPLAN (the Federal Ministry of Planning) introducing
tighter controls over the economy and state-controlled enterprises in general.
PORTOBRAS thus was never given the power to modify tariffs in accordance with
changes to port operating costs.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      The economic evaluation in the Santos Port Appraisal Report was divi-
ded into four  main groups:
(a) development of the left bank compared to continued expansion
on the right bank;
(b) various items of the proposed works that could be undertaken
and evaluated separately from the others; and
(c) all the works, including the common works.
(d) the Bank-financed project.
The reevaluation attempts to follow the format as well as the methodology
of the Appraisal Report. This has not been possible throughout because some
of the items foreseen were either not carried out or were carried out in a
radically different way, which makes a comparison irrelevant. Furthermore,
it has nQt been possible to infer in detail the assumptions that were used in
the Appraisal Report.
7.02      The economic rates of return calculated at the time of appraisal,
as well as their recalculated values, are given in the following table and
paragraphs 7.05-06 (See Tables 10-13 for the cost and benefit streams).

. Wheat Facilities                14                 not carried out
. General Cargo Berths            45                      26
. Dredging Equipment              11                 information
not available
- Average for the above items          23                       29
7.03      The average for the evaluated items is thus presently expected to give a
slightly higher return than at appraisal, 29 vs. 23%. One reason for this improve-
ment is the fact that the program as actually carried out did not include some of
the items with a relativelv low rate of return such as the corn silo and
the wheat facilities. Also, the fertilizer traffic, which forms the basis for
the evaluation of both the fertilizer facilities and the left Bank location,
has been between 50 and 100% above the appraisal value, increasing the rates
of return for both the left Bank location and the fertilizer facilities
significantly.
7.04      Working in the opposite direction have been the lower than expected
general cargo volumes, which have reduced the economic rate of return for
the general cargo berths. The considerable delays and cost overruns for
the container berths have, of course, influenced the return for this item
negatively, although greater-than-forecast container traffic,increases the
return. Therefore, while the reevaluated rates of return for the various
items are markedly different from the appraisal estimates, all the items
executed are still considered to be feasible, as is the program as a whole.
7.05      The Bank-financed items, essentially the left bank access and the
container facilities, can be considered to form an entity and evaluated
separately. An evaluation of the project thus defined yields an economic
rate of return of 15%. This excludes, however, the benefits which accrue to
the fertilizer facilities on the left bank due to the accesses to the left
bank (B.HAND, Table 10). Including this benefit, which is a reasonable thing
to do since the accesses serve not only the container but also the fertilizer
facilities, raises the rate of return to 21%.
7.06      An alternative way of evaluating the left bank investments would be
to consider the left bank as a project per se. This would thus include the
costs and benefits of the container facilities and accesses (Table 11) as well
as those for the fertilizer facilities. Since the fertilizer facility, as
shown in paragraph 7.02, is a most viable undertaking the rate of return for
the total left bank investments increases to 29%.



- 29 -
7.07      The main reason for locating some of the facilities on the left
bank was that the right bank was getting congested. This congestion was
evident not only in the port area but also for the access links leading to
the port through the city. The avoidance of further congestion with the
accompanying urban problems represent a major benefit attributable to the
left bank location. Data is not available to quantify this, however, and the
rates of return above can therefore be construed as lower bounds.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      The Bank was involved at an early stage with the identification and
preparation of this project, and there is no doubt that it played an important
role in those early stages as well as in the actual execution of the project.
Relations between the Bank and the Borrower remained good throughout; during
both preparation and implementation, a series of valuable suggestions were
made by Bank staff which helped DNPVN (later PORTOBRAS) and its consultants
to overcome a number of technical problems and to achieve significant cost
savings.
8.02      Noteworthy of mentioning are the following areas in which the role
of the Bank was important:
(a) reorganization of the port system and the creation of PORTOBRAS;
(b) improvement of Santos port management, operations and accounting;
(c) technical assistance given by Bank staff to determine the loca-
tion of the container facilities, resulting in the development
of a new area of expansion for the port;
(d) technical assistance provided to prepare proper economic feasi-
bility studies; and,
(e) technical assistance provided by Bank staff to achieve cost
savings in the project.
8.03      Points (a) and (b) preceding have been dealt with extensively in
Chapter VI of this report. Although the Brazilians were already convinced at
the identification and project preparation stages that they needed a specialized
container terminal in the port of Santos, the original location was envisaged
on the right bank of the estuary of the channel. However, Bank staff argued
that this location would involve high expropriation costs. Furthermore, all
container traffic would have had to be moved through the city area of Santos,
which already suffered heavy traffic congestion. The Bank suggested developing
the left bank of the estuary, which was largely virgin land, and which also
provided a major area of expansion in the future. Based on this suggestion,
Five-Year Development Plan was drawn up which, in addition to the container
terminal, included a corn silo and berthing facilities, a sugar terminal, oil
handling facilities, a fertilizer terminal and rail and road accesses. When
the final investment program and preliminary engineering studies (which took
a long time to prepare) were available, the Bank proceeded to appraise the
project.



- 30 -
8.04       In 1972, however, the Federal Government initiated a program of
export corridors with specific investment and operating objectives and poli-
cies. In lieu of these new developments, and with the final engineering of
the project in hand (which showed that costs were much higher than envisaged),
the Bank convinced DNPVN to hire consultants to reassess the economic feasibi-
lity of the five-year port development-plan. The economic analysis indicated
that the corn silo and sugar handling facilities on the left bank should be
dropped, that the oil terminal should be located at the right bank access
(where it was later built) and that the container facilities should be reduced
from a 600-meter quay to no more than 400 meters. Furthermore, the Bank
included some urban development features in the container terminal project,
i.e., sewerage and water supply facilities which were not considered initially.
Bank staff was also involved in further reducing the cost of the project by
-eliminating some road and rail connections.
8.05       In retrospect, it does appear that the Bank's participation was va-
luable to the Brazilians, notwithstanding the long delays in project imple-
mentation. Although the Bank spent about 128 man-weeks in preparation and
supervision, the number and frequency of the supervision missions are consi-
dered barely adequate because of the complexity of the project and the insti-
tutional development required to implement it.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01       The construction of the new.container facility was very timely since
its availability enables the Santos port to meet the growing demand for con-
tainerization.
9.02       Notwithstanding the large increases in costs and long delays in the
implementation of the project, the investments are yielding a good economic
return.
9.03       The institutional performance of the Borrower during the implemen-
tation of this project was good, except for the implementation of a cost-rela-
ted tariff structure. Largely because of the prevailing inadequate tariff
structure, the Santos port finances deteriorated badly in the last five years.
9.04       The cost estimates at the time of the appraisal were based on
preliminary engineering of the project. The detailed engineering design was
carried out after approval of the loan, and a substantial cost overrun com-
pared with appraisal estimates resulted. This experience provides further
justification for the current policy of the Bank which requires detailed
engineering studies to be carried out before Board presentation. 1/
1/ PORTOBRAS (see Annex) disagrees with this conclusion and indicates that the
events of this project are a good example of the difficulties created by
the use of final detailed engineering. According to PORTOBRAS detailed
engineering is not only expensive but locks up schemes that may be
difficult to change later when circumstances require modifications. In
particular, interference by the Bank with required modifications create,
in PORTOBRAS' opinion, unnecessary delays.



- 31 -
9.05       On balance, the results suggest that the size of the project which
was finally implemented was appropriate. However, the time schedule for
implementation was optimistic since five years were required (1975-1980) ins-
tead of three years as envisaged in the appraisal (1972-1975). The main
reasons for the delay in implementing the project were (a) cost increases
which became apparent after final engineering, which were much higher than
forecast; (b) reassessment of the economic feasibility of the project, taking
into account new policies issued by the Federal Government regarding export
corridors; and (c) a change in the scope of the project due to unforeseen
economic developments.

Re.: Project Completion Report on
Brazil Santos Project Loan (756-
BR).
Dear Mr. Kapur,
We received your letter of January 19, 1983 and its
pertinent annex (draft of the above mentioned report, dated
September 25, 1981) and we indebted with the oportunity offered for
our comments about a document that, although dealing with PORTOBRAS
action in the Project as agent of the Borrower, is an internal
paper of the Bank.
With the exception of the commentaries included in
the annex of this letter, we consider the draft satisfactory.
We expect the BANK consider our commentaries in the
revision of the draft or fully reproduce them in the final text
of the report.
Sincerily,
Arno Oscar Markuos'
Presidente

EMPRESA DE PORTOS DO BRASIL S/A - PORTOBRAS
ANNEX TO PRE-203/83.
OUR COMMENTARIES ABOUT THE DRAFT OF COMPLETION REPORT
ON BRAZIL SANTOS PROJECT
1st - Regarding the following phrase "the project preparation
proceeded much slower than originally anticipated", with
which your draft begins the item 2.02, we do not
agree with your conclusion. In fact, your Identification
Mission of Oct-Nov/78 considered the project well advanced
and estimated that it could be appraised by Mar-Apr/69.
However, in that opportunity your mission demanded
additional preparation works and these works, by the guide
lines of DNPVN,only could be made after different bids
(one for each different matter) what represented forced
delays. Concluding: the project preparation phase delay's
was consequence of the additional works demanded by the
BANK.
2nd   Regarding the following phrase "DNPVN had never fully
studied the ENGEVIX/PLANAVE study", included in item 2.03,
we consider it does not proceedand PORTOBRAS does not
agree with its inclusion in the definitive text of the
completion report. In fact, in the text of your draft
submitted to our appreciation (final phrase of item 2.02),
the BANK writes that" it appears that this plan (ENGEVIX/
PLANAVE of course) was rejected since OESA/KG indicated
that the soils were very difficult and at least ten years
of capital works at prohibitive costs would be necessary".
This conclusion is exclusively of the BANK and was presented
as hypothesis. What really ocurred was the fact that DNPVN,
having an option between two possibilities of localization,
needed a study of the feasibility of the development of
the project in the right bank, but this does not means that
the study of ENGEVIX/PLANAVE had not been fully studied.
We do not agree, also, with the conclusion inserted in the
same item of the draft where is stated that "the mission

proposed that certain facilities be located on the left
bank". What really ocurred was a delay in the decision
because, having received the OESA/KG report in APR/70, when
an Appraisal mission was Scheduled since Mar/70, DNPVN
postponed its decision till the moment of mission's arrival
(what ocurred, finally, in AUG-SEPT/70) because the decision
needed the approval of the BANK and the Mission could do
this. So, during the visit of the Appraisal Mission,
the option of the left bank was formalized by DNPVN.
3rd   Still regarding item 2.04, PORTOBRAS does not agree with
the inclusion of the following passage of its first phrase,
where BANK states that "the wider implications resulting
from shifting development to the left bank of the Santos
estuary had not been foreseen by DNPVN". The reason of this
discordance is explained in the 2nd critical commentary
and renewed here: "DNPVN aimed to obtain a study of the
right bank in order to make a good choice between two
possible solutions, what does not entitles BANK to make the
criticized commentary".
4th   Reparding itens 3.07through 3.10, PORTOBRAS does not agree
with the inherent conclusion that the delay of 2,5 years in
the beginning of the bedding procedures of the rail access
subproject is due exclusively to RFFSA. It must be remembered
that the tempestive bedding of the end of 1972 was suspended
in JAN/73 at the BANK'S request in order to be reanalysed
and the most part of the delay pointed by the BANK was
consumed in the preparation of the new bids (review of the
economic justification) and, subsequently, in the
negociations, with the consulting engineers in charge of
the project for their modifications; in the preparation
of the mentioned economic reanalysis and modification of
the civil engineering projects; and finally, in the new
bidding procedures.

PORTOBRAS also does not agree with the conclusionsthat
only "following BANK action" the rail access subproject
was reactivated. Really, the reactivation of the subproject
followed the withdrawal of the BANK'S restriction, what is
very different.
5th   Even agreeing that has been an interval of 2.8 years
between the decision of the execution of the container
terminal in three phases and the award of the contract,
the simple reference of this figure without mentioning
expressly that most part of the time elapsed was necessary
to the procedures of the revision of the project decided
by the BANK (represented by 1.7 years in which are
included three months of delay in BANK'S approval of the
new project).
Thus PORTOBRAS does not agree with the reference of a
delay of 2.8 years without express mention that this delay
is.related with the revision of project determined by the
BANK.
In this opportunity we must express our opinion that the
revision made at BANK'S instance was considered an
unnecessary precaution of the BANK in order to define the
works to be financed. In fact, the development of the
services conducted PORTOBRAS to make no distinctions
between the 1st and the 2nd phases and, regarding the 3rd
phase, considering the fact that the BANK excluded this
phase of theworks financed, its execution followed the
exclusive criterion of PORTOBRAS.
6th   Although agreeing that problems related with the revision
mentioned in item 3.12 of draft resulted in delays not
expected, PORTOBRAS does not accept the implicit
conclusions of the text, unfavourable to this COMPANY. In
fact, in similar works in volume and complexity, not
financed by the BANK, with similar problems related to
design revision, the delays are substancially smaller
due to the fact that PORTOBRAS is not obliged to a

labourious work of convince d lender in each opportunity a
modification is imposed by new conditions ocurred during
the execution of the works. You can sep inyour draft that an
unimportant modification (the use of gabions)wasnoteasily
approved by the BANK: we had to spend substancial time that
cannot be charged to PORTOBRAS and even the approval was
subject to the condition that the prices would not been
majoratedd.
Your mention that only"'everal months later" PORTOBRAS
informed BANK that the modifications would represent an
increase of 25% in the costs,may give the idea of an
omission in our answer and PORTOBRAS does not agree with
the way the text was written in this point. In fact, the
time elapsed between your approval of gabion's utilization
and the presentation of the table of quantities and price
(without any influence in the development of the works)
is totally justified by the care with which PORTOBRAS
prepares the additaments to its contracts. Regarding the
increase mentioned, it covered other services than
the gabions. You must consider, also,that the several
modifications introduced, responsible for the increase,
were, in due time, communicated to the BANK through the
letters PRE-770/77, of December 27, 77 and DIR-063/78, of
April 10, 78.
Regarding the alternative design suggested by BANK'S
staff, it has been studied carefully by the engineers of
PORTOBRAS, of consulting Engineers and Contractor and
considered technically inferior to our solution (use of
gabion's) and, for this reason, not accepted by PORTOBRAS.
Regarding the assertion that BANK waited 9 months for the
answer, the text does not define dates and PORTOBRAS
disagree with the inclusion of such not precise information
in the final text. We must add that whatever may be the time
elapsed (and the text does not mention the dates as referred
above) this does not mean paralization of the works, the
only thing really important.

Regarding the alleged increase of 25% (US$ 92,7 x 106        Cr$
375,3 x 106), it was not due to use of gabion's so
criticized by BANK, beeing not admissible a text that gives
this idea. You must consider that letters DIR-063/78
(delivered in Washington, during the meetings with our
Director Mario Rohr) and PRE-770/77 (sent by mail),
explaining all the modifications, show clearly that the
gabion's are nearly of the same value of the services
substituted by them.
7th   PORTOBRAS does not agree    with the way the final paragraph
of item 3.12 is written. There, when is mentioned the
container handling equipment, it is said that, except for
two container cranes, they are "still pending". Certainly
you are associating the assertion with the date of May 31,
81. You must consider, however, that it is possible that the
association be done with the date of the final edition
of the report, what may give the idea the procurement
process'of these equipments has not been initiated in that
date, what will be not true. So, the text must be written
"was pending at this moment" instead of "is still pending"
It must be cleared in the text that delay in the
procurement process'of the handling equipments has had,
as main reason, the delay in the decision of BANK in the
change of the allocation of US$ 3.4 x 106 from equipments
to civil works. In fact, having PORTOBRAS communicated, in
due time, the impossibility, because of Government's
determination, of an international bid (exigency of your
guide lines) and having proposed the mentioned allocation
change (assuming the compromise of using its own resources
to pay, in the national market, the equipments), the
agreement of BANK delayed very much.

8th   On item 3.32 the draft does not mention (and PORTOBRAS
consider this information necessary) that the real percentage
financed reached only 18%, (about 30% of the initial
estimation). It mustbe understand, also, that this final
figure will be a little less if we consider that the value
financed for the dredge represented only nearly 60% of its
value.
9th _ PORTOBRAS does not agree with         the note in the foot of
the table included in item 3.33, in which is pointed that the
percentages of civil works decreased in steps from 40% to
10%. Really, the maximum amount of reimbursements of civil
works was 25% (in the beginning of the services) and you
must correct the note.
10th - PORTOBRAS wishes BANK include in the final text of the
completion Report an item regarding the way payments of
parcels of the loan were made because this matter was not
focused in the draft and we considered of great importance.
In our opinion BANK did not grant really a loan (which is
characterized by payments in advance), because we had only
reimbursements in the major of part of the PROJECT (civil
works). In fact, only the payments for foreign contractors
were made by the BANK and this can be considered a
discrimination against the borrower.
Regarding the transfer of money to PORTOBRAS, we can mention
also that even the reimbursement was made normally with a
delay of 15 days7and in several occasion with a more
remarkable delay, in detriment of the development of the
works. This makes the BANK partially responsible for many
delays ocurred in the completion of the PROJECT.
11th   Although PORTOBRAS recognizes the delays in the completion
of many subprojects, we do     not understand the BANK did not
mention its system       of payments (mainly in civil works),
that transformed the loan in a reimbursement of expenditures
of the borrower,created an additional charge and many
difficulties, contributing for the delays above mentioned.

12th - PORTOBRAS does not agree with the conclusion inserted in
the item 9.04 of the draft regarding detailed engineering
projects. In fact, in the Santos Port Project, a detailed
engineering project (contracted in this level in order
to fulfill BANK'S recommendations), it can be observed the
different problems pointed in your draft. The delays in
the corrections of the subpr6Jects were very expressive, not
only by itself, but mainly by the interference of the BANK.
PORTOBRAS believes that in any project, even beeing well
elaborated, modifications, mainly when related to the
methodology of execution (influenced in the majority of
the cases by the equipments to be employed by the con-
tractors), are normally introduced and the possibility
of these modifications does not indicate the detailed
engineering project as the better solution due to the
greater cost of this type of project if compared with
a basic project.
The Santos Port Project is a good example of the
inconvenience of a detailed engineering project and leads
to a conclusion different of that of draft.
