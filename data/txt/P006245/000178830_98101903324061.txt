APPRAISAL OF SANTOS PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The port of Santos serves central south Brazil which includes heavily
populated Sao Paulo state and city, which are spoearheading Brazil's industrial
and economic development. The continuing rapid economic growth of the region
requires the expansion of the port, together with the improvement of its exist-
ing facilities and their better utilization. To achieve these ends the Covern-
ment, through the Departamento Nacional de Portos e Vias Navegaveis (UVPVN),
has formulated a Five-Year Development Program, 1971-75, for the port of Santos
involving an estimated expenditure of US$143 million equivalent.
ii.       There has been a continuing exchange of views between the Government
and the Bank on the improvement and expansion of the country's transport faci-
lities. A transport survey in two phases was begun in 1965 and Phase 1 (for
which the Bank made a grant of US$1.5 million) covered highways in four states,
rail transport, coastal shipping and the country's three main ports of Santos,
Rio de Janeiro and Recife. Phase 2 was initiated in 1967 and covers highways
in 14 more states.
iii.      In 1968, the Government submitted a Plan of Action (PA-1) summarizing
its objectives in the transport sector and outlining schedules for action on
highways, railways and ports and a Second Plan of Action (PA-2) in 1970 out-
lined measures to effect further improvements in transport. Progress in imple-
menting the Plans of Action has been satisfactory for highways and railways,
but slo,w in ports.
iv.       The Phase 1 report recommended certain works for the improvement and
expansion of the three main ports, and in 1969, the Government commissioned a
more detailed study of the type, extent and cost of improvement works needed
at Santos. It had already become evident that increasing congestion of the
right bank of the estuary, on which the port and city are crowded together,
poses a major problem and a separate study was ordered to assess the technical
and economic feasibility of developing the largely unused left bank of the
estuary including provision of rail access. The results of this study were
favorable and the Government has now decided that all major new facilities for
bulk and containerized cargo should be located on the left bank. The Five-Year
Development Program for Santos takes this decision into account and is based on1
these various studies.
v.        The port of Santos is operated under concession by Companhia Docas
de Santos (CDS), a private company, under the overall direction of DNPVN which
is an autonomous entity under the Ministry of Transport responsible for ports
in Brazil. The concession expires in November 1980 when the assets will pass
to the Government and a mixed economy company, in which the Government, through
D1NPVN, will have a controlling interest, may be set up to take over the port.
In recent years most of the funds for investment at Santos have been provided
by DNPVN,, which will also be responsible for financing the Five-Year Program.
Already, the present value of DNTPNl s investments in the port exceeds th,.t of
ODS.



- ii -
vi.       The proposed loan for US$45 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange cost of the project consisting of selected items in the
development program which were suitable for international competitive bidding
and the construction or procurement of which is still to get under way. The
project conprises the construction on the left bank of a container terminal, a
corn silo and berth and all related works and equipment; some 40 km of rail
construction outside the new port area; the purchase of a dredger for mainten-
ance dredging; hydraulic studies of the estuaryj consulting services for
detailed engineering and supervision of construction; and management consultantst
services to improve the organization, administration and operations of Santos
port and of DWMVN. Additionally, the project would finance the services of
foreign experts to help the Government to prepare an overall plan for the
development of ports in Brazil on the basis of detailed studies either already
completed, underway or expected to be undertaken shortly.
vii.      A most important and integral part of the project is its institution-
building aspects for the port sub-sector in Brazil, as an essential part of the
Bank's efforts to promote improvements in institutional and policy-making areas
of the transport sector as a whole.
viii.     The loan will be to the Government.  Project execution will be the
respolnsibility of DNPVN except for certain railway works and the national port
study. A committee will be set up to coordinate port and rail construction
and other port related matters. Procurement of equipment and materials and
the award of civil works contracts will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding. For procurement itemas Brazilian manufacturers will have
a preference of 15% or the relevant rate of customs duty, whichever is lower.
ix.       The Santos port development program as a whole will earn an economic
return of over 20% (which includes the rail access to the left bank) and the
port as a whole will earn a financial rate of return of more than l0,,. The
program provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$45 million equivalent
for a term of 25 years, including a five-year grace period.



BRAZTL
APPRAISAL CF SANTOS PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Brazil has requested a Bank loan of US$45 million
equivalent to help finance: (a) selected items of works and equipment (suit-
able for international competitive bidding and the construction or procurement
of which is still to get under way) in a five-year program for the improvement
and expansion of Santos port;  (b)  rail access to a new area of the port on
the left bank; and (c) an overall review of the port needs of Brazil. The
five-year program for Santos port is estimated to cost NCr$ 694 million and
the program for rail access external to the port and the ports study NCr$ 82
million, making a total of NCr$ 776 million or US$160 million equivalent.  Out
of this total the loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of items whose
total estimated cost is NiCr$ 381 million (US$78.5 million). The loan would be
made to the Government with the Departamento Nacional de Portos e Vias
Navegaveis (DNPVN), the Government agency responsible for the overall develop-
ment of ports in Brazil, as the principal executing agency.
1.02      In 1965, the Government undertook, with Bank assistance, a general
transport survey of Brazil, with the Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECC.
being retained to carry out a study of the ports of Santos, Rio de Janeiro and
Recife.  In 1969, DNPVN appointed a consortium of two firms of engineering
consultants, King and Gavaris (US) and the Organizacao e Engenharia S/A (Brazil)
(OESA), to review the works proposed by NEDECO for Santos port and their cost
estimates and to undertake detailed engineering of the recommended works. The
project is based on studies by this consortium, the earlier NEDECO report
and a technical-economic feasibility study of the rail access to the left
bank cormissioned by Companhia Docas de Santos (CDS), the port concessionaire,
at DiNPVN's request and carried out by Engevix-Planave, S.A., a Brazilian
engineering consulting consortium. Additionally, the financial evaluation of
the project was carried out by a consortium of professional accounting and
management consultant firms, Boucinhas & Campos (Brazil) and Coopers & Lybrand
(International) (BCCL).
1.03      This is the first Bank port project in Brazil.  Other Bank projects
in the transport sector include:  (i) two railway projects financed by loans
65-BR and 92-BR (US$12.5 million each) in 1952 and 1953 for the rehabilitation
of the Central do Brazil facilities and purchase of rolling stock; (ii) a
highway maintenance project financed by loan 75-BR (US$3 million) in 1953 for
the purchase of maintenance equipment for the State of Rio de Janeiro; and
(iii) tvwo highway construction projects, 567-BR (US$26 million) in 1968 and
676-BR (US$100 million) in 1970, for the construction, paving and improvement
of highways and for detailed engineering and supervision of the works. The
two railway loans and highwxay maintenance loan 75-BR have been fully repaid,
and progress on the two highway construction loans is satisfactory.

1.04      This report has been prepared by Messrs. Clark (Financial Analyst),
Malkani (Engineer) and Parthasarathi (Economist) who appraised the project in
August-September and December 1970. They were assisted by Messrs. Zarandin
(of the Agriculture Projects Department), Pelon and Macgregor (Consultaits)
on matters pertaining to a corn silo which forms part of the project, and by
staff members of the Railways and Highways III Divisions.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2
2.01      With an area of 8.5 million km , Brazil is the fifth largest country
in the world (Map 1). Estimated end-1970 population was 92 million and popula-
tion growth averages 2.7% p.a. Average overall population density of the
country is only about 11 per km2, but in the coastal region of Rio de Janeiro,
Santos and Sao Paulo, the density exceeds 3,000 per km2. Brazilts broad range
of ecological conditions permits the cultivation of all tropical, subtropical
and temperate climate crops. Potential for expansion, particularly of agricul-
tural production, is large, and there are extensive undeveloped land and water
resources. In the last two decades the growth and diversification of industry
has been remarlkable, and the country now produces a large range of manufactures.
2.02      GDP at market prices was estimated at about NCr$ 128 billion in 1969
(Us$31.6 billion equivalent); per capita GDP in the same year was about US$348
equivalent. The early sixties were characterized by sluggish growth and infla-
tion of up to 90Q  p.a., but sustained growth has been registered in recent
years and the rate of inflation reduced.  GDP grew 8% in real terms in 1968,
by 9% in 1969 and by an estimated 9.5% in 1970. Maintaining a high economic
growth rate is one of the Government's main social and political objectives.
For the 1971-76 period, an annual growth rate of 6-7% appears feasible. To
sustain this, a major effort will be required in the transport sector, includ-
ing investments in the improvement and expansion of port facilities.
B. The Transport Sector
2.03      Because of the size of Brazil, transport has played an important part
in its economic development, since the economy is heavily dependent on both
export crops and the development of new areas for productive use. Continued
improvement and addition to transport facilities and their better utilization
are necessary to support the rapidly growing economy and to link the various
regions. The transport survey (para. 1.02) was in two phases: the first
covered highway and railway transport, coastal shipping and the ports of
Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife and was completed in 1967.  The second,
dealing with more highways, was then started with financial assistance from
UNDP and USAID and the Bank acting as executing agency; completion is expected
by the middle of 1971.



-3-
Transprt Coordination
2.04      To coordinate and supervise the transport s rvey, as well as to
provide counterpart personnel and facilities required by foreign personnel,
a Government body - Grupo Executivo de Integracao da Politica de Transportes
(CEIPOT) - was set up in 1965. GEIPOT has now been changed into a permanent
organization called Grupo de Eatudes para Integracao da Politica de Transportes
with responsibility for investment planning and improving coordination between
various modes of transport.
2.05      In connection with the highway loans, two transport plans of action
(PA-1 and PA-2) were formulated by the Government, one in 1968 and the second
in February 1970, giving a summary of Government's objectives in the transport
sector and outlining measures required to achieve them. In ports, these visual-
ized: (a) measures for the decentralization of port administration by reorgan-
izing DNPVN into a planning and policy-making body and gradually transferring
ports to mixed economy companies (in which the Government will own at least
51% of the shares and voting rights); (b) reorganization of Santos port manage-
ment, operations, accounting, etc., aid (c) following from (b), adoption of
cost-based tariffs, initially at Santos port, followed by other ports. Paras.
3.04 and 3.05 give the details.  There have been delays in implementing the
measures because of: (a) personnel changes in the management of DPTVTT includirg
the Director-General; and (b) the detailed studies required by many of the
measures have yet to be organized and carried out. Th, financing of consultantsa
services to carry out such studies as -,ell as to help implement the resulting
recommendations is includo0 in the project.
Ports and Coastal Shipping
2.06      There are 33 ports of some importance along the coast of Brazil, one
inland port on the Amazon River and one on the Paraguay River (Map 1). In 1969,
total port traffic was about 73.0 million tons of dry and liquid cargo, includ-
ing bulk (Table 1).  Santos handled about 13 million tons and is the biggest
port for general cargo. Rio de Janeiro handled about 21 million tons of which,
however, less than 10% was general cargo. Some 16.0 million tons of iron ore
pass through the specialized port of Vitoria.
2.07      Coastal shipping carries about 13% of the country's total port cargo
traffic (excluding traffic of specialized terminals). The present fleet is
too large for the cargo offering but consists of old and obsolete vessels op-
erated by a large number of companies with no fixed sailing schedules.  The
transport survey recommended the establishment of fixed sailing schedules,
replacement of old, outmoded ships and the merger of shipping companies, so
that they could become financially vi able and more efficient. Little progress
has been made in implementing these suggestions because of organizational and
legal problems. However, a proposed port planning study (para. 5.07 (xiii))
should provide data which will assist the Government to plan improvermnts in
this mode.



- 4-
Rail, Road ald Air Tra
2.08      Rail and road connections are very important for the port of Santos
and are discussed in Sections h and 5 of the report. Details of these sectors
and of air transport in Brazil as a whole are given in Annex 1.
3.  PORT ORGANIZATION AND ADIENISTRATION
A. General
3.01      The 35 principal Brazilian ports (para. 2.06) operate under various
kinds of administration (Table 1):
(a)  under concession to private companies. including Santos (3);
(b) under concession to State Governments (13);
(c) by mixed economy companies (2)1/;
(d) by an autonomous Pederal Government body (1);
(e)  directly administered by IIFVN (6); and
(f) small ports with varying local administrations (10).
3.02      INPVN1, under the Ministry of Transport, exercises overall control of
all ports in Brazil, including those under private eompany concessions. The
Director-General of INPVN is a political appointee of the Minister of Transport.
The Director-General appoints, usually from among the staff of IIIPVN, his prin-
cipal assistants - a Special Assistant (who acts as his deputy) and four direc-
tors in charge respectively of Ports, Inland Waterways, Planning and Adminis-
tration. The present Director-General appears to be a man of drive and ini-
tiative, and his principal assistants are competent.
3.03      INPVN exercises centralized ccntrol over all port administrations not
only as regards investment programs and tariffs, but also over all disbursemernts
against approved budgets and in respect of operations, salary and wage scales,
and other local administrative matters.  DNPVN's functions and powers are so
wide that they seriously interfere with the efficiency of the day-to-day manage-
ment of port administration.
3.04      The C-overnment is awyare of the need to improve ENPVN and port adminis-
tration generally. It has embarked on a program to decentralize and reorganize
the administration of the major ports in accordance with PA-2 (para. 2.05).
l/ A mixed economy ccmpany is a limited liability company, subject to Brazilian
company law, but with its own bylaws and regulations defined by decree. In
the case of mixed economy port companies, the Government, through ]NPVN,
owns at least 51% of the share capital and controls at least 51% of the
voting rights.



- 5 -
The program involves: (a) the creation of mixed economy companies to take
over the major ports, with reasonable representation of port users and regional
interests; and (b) a review and restatement of DiNPVN's functions and powers,
and reorganization of its administration to transform it into a Government
agency, responsible mainly for policy formulation, planning, approval of rates,
and the holding of Governmentts share in port mixed economy companies.
3.05      The program requires a study for which proposals have already been
received from BCCL. The proposals expect that the phased reorganization of
DNPVN can be completed in 18-30 months from the appointment of consultants.
Management consultants have been selected to carry out the above study, under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; the signing of a contract, accept-
able to the Bank, with the consultants is a condition of loan effectiveness.
During loan negotiations DNPVN undertook to implement such recommendations as
may be agreed with the Bank according to a timetable to be agreed with the
Bank. The cost of the consultants' services forms part of the proposed
project; some retroactive financing is involved (para. 5.12 ).
3.06      A serious hindrance to the development of efficient port organization
and administration in Brazil is the very low salary scales and restrictions on
promotions imposed by Government regulations, practices and procedures. This
affects DNPVN, concessionaire companies, mixed economy companies..   and in fact,
the whole of the public sector. An adequate salary structure, terms of
service and promotional opportunities, competitive with those offered by
private industry, must be introduced in any program to reorganize the ports on
efficient lines.  The Goverrment has recently revised, on this basis, the
salary structure of technical personnel employed in the Fisheries Departmmet,
the Forestry Research Program and the Wheat Research Program as a condition of
UNDP financing and has expressed its intention to take similar action in the
port sector. The management consultants (para. 3.05) will study present salary
levels in DNPVN and the port of Santos and recommend a suitable salary
structure, and an undertaking was obtained from the Government that their
recommendations, as may be agreed with the Bank, will be implemented before
December 31, 1972.
B. Port of Santos
3.07      CDS, a private limited company, manages Santos port under a concession
agreement which wxill expire in November 1980. (Details of CDS's concession are
given in Annex 2). Under the terms of the agreement, the Government may ter-
minate the concession at any time before the expiry date by buying up CDS's
interest in the port. The Government has started preliminary talks with CDS
about this and the possibility of setting up a mixed economy colpany to take
over the port with CDS continuing as a minority shareholder. To ensure the
orderly transfer of responsibility, DNPVN has agreed to have ready the organi-
zation and personnel for a new entity at least three months before the termina-
tion of the concession, with a constitution and with powers satisfactory to
the Bank, to take over the assets and operations at Santos port.

3.08      Neither Brazilian company law nor legislation relating to the con-
cession provides CDS with authority over other public and private agencies
whose cooperation is essential to efficient functioning of the port.  The
resulting lack of coordination gave rise to inefficient port operations in the
past and the problem became serious in 1968. In April 1969, the Government
created by decree a special committee for the coordination of port services in
Santos (COSEPS) under DNPVN. The Committee members were drawn from DNPVN,
various ministries and Federal Government agencies dealing with the port, CDS
and the Sao Paulo State Government. The Committee was given wide authority
over CDS, all port users, cargo, ships, and Customs, and has been effective
in improving operations. It is expected the mixed economy company which will
eventually take over the port will have powers similar to those of COSEPS.
CDS's management of operations is generally efficient and its maintenance of
facilities, cargo-handling equipment and floating craft is good.
3.09      In July 1969, DNPVN contracted with BCCL, with Bank approval, to
undertake a study of the administrative organization and systems at Santos.
BCCL's February 1970 report indicated areas which were unsatisfactory and made
general recommendations for improvements. More work is now required to formu-
late detailed programs and plans for all unsatisfactory areas, including train-
ing programs, and to assist in implementation. The areas concerned include
operations, financial and cost accounting systems, budgetary control and
management information systems, maintenance, inventory control and data
processing.
3.10      BCCL has prepared proposals to this end with which the Bank and DNPVN
agree.  The work will be important not only for the efficient future management
and operations of the port of Santos, but also to serve as a model for other
Brazilian ports. Nanagement consultants satisfactory to the Bank have been
selected to provide professional assistance at Santos substantially as proposed
by BCCL. The signing of a contract with them, satisfactory to the Bank., is a
condition of loan effectiveness. The Government has agreed to implement by
June 1974 the new systems and training programs, according to a timetable to
be agreed wfith the Bank. The cost of the consultants' services forms part of
the proposed project. Some retroactive financing will be involved (para. 5.12).
4. THE PORT OF SANTOS
A. Port Facilities
4.01      The port of Santos is on an estuary leading from a bay.  The entrance
channel is 11.5 m deep at low water and 120 m wide. There are no restrictions
on the length of ships using the port. Depths at the berths vary from 5.0 ni
to 11.0 m at low water. The mean tidal range is 1.6 m.
4.o2      Most of the port facilities are located along some 12 km on the right
bank of the estuary in close proximity to the growing city; in many places one
side of the public streets along the port's length belongs to the port and the



- 7 -
other to the town. The left bank of the estuary is virtually undeveloped
except for two existing oil berths on Barnabe Island and two berths for loading
fertilizers now being ccmpleted; this side of the estuary has no rail access
but a road is nearing completion.
4.03      The general cargo berths are provided with transit sheds, electric
portal cranes and other cargo-handling equipment. The dry bulk cargo, grain
and special-cargo berths are provided with suitable handling and pumping
plants. Further details of the port facilities, ancillary services, floating
craft and plant are given in Annex 3.
4.0       CDS provides ship berthage, shore-handling services, storage facili-
ties, maintenance dredging, and special services for ships and cargo.  Steve-
doring services are provided by independent private operators. The independ-
ent Santos Pilots Association, under the ccntrol of a Port Captain appointed
by the Brazilian Navy, provides pilotage, which is compulsory.
B. Dredging
4.o0      I1PVN carries out capital dredging through the Government-owned
Brazilian Dredging Company. CDS usually carries out maintenance dredging
of the navigation channel and alongside wharves with its own three dredgers;
the quantities have gradually increased over the past few years and in 1969
over 1.9 million m3 was dredged.
C. Operations
h.o6      Since COSEPS started functioning in 1969 it has been effective in
improving port operations, and reducing ship time in port and cargo conges-
tion: gang productivity for general cargo increased from 12 tons to 15 tons
per hour; average ship time at berth fell from 72 hours to 60 hours; and
cargo storage in transit sheds declined from an average of seven days to six
days. The port is now functioning at close to optimum capacity and further
operational improvements would be difficult. To avoid congestion and delays in
cargo movements, aidto handle growing traffic, improvements and extensions of
the port facilities- are essential.
D. Transport Connections to the Port (Map 2)
4.07      Santos is the main port for Sao Paulo State.  Because of rapid
industrial expansion in and around Sao Paulo city and vast increases in
agricultural products in the Santos service area, transport connections to
the town and the port are continually being extended and improved. Never-
theless, the approach road and rail systems to the port through the town are
extremely congested and cause considerable delays to port and urban traffic
movements. In addition, both the town and the port are expanding and encroach-
ing on each other, with resulting conflicts between urban traffic and port
operations. DNPVN, COSEPS and CDS have proposals for acquiring certain por-
tions of city land and for abandoning certain lengths of old quays with limited
alongside depth (after new berths forming part of the development program are
provided) so as to provide better rail and road services in the existing port
area. These proposals are compatible with the development plans for urban
streets and roads in Santos.



- 8 -
4.08      Sao Paulo lies about 60 km from Santos at the top of an escarpment
of 850 m elevation.  Two two-lane highwy-s, which are already inadequate for
the rapidly increasing traffic, connect the two cities and two additional two-
lane highways are under construction.  Highway connections between Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, and other parts of the Santos hin.terland are
satisfactory.
4.09      The right bank of the port is linked to Sao Paulo and the rest of
the hinterland by the 1.0 m gauge Sorocabana railway (owned by the Sao Paulo
State) and the 1.6 m gauge Santos-Jundiai railway (owned by RFFSA, the Federal
Government agency). Sorocabana serves southern Sao Paulo State and northem:
Parana State, and, through its link with the Parana-Santa Catarina railway
network, the States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. The Santos-
Jundiai railway serves extensive agricultural and industrial areas in southern
Brazil.
E. Problems
4.10      The main causes of the frequent congestion at Santos port are:
(a)  insufficient berths, inadequate alongside depths and the
narrow width of the port landward area. Some of the older
berths are inadequate to serve modern ships and cargo;
(b)  lack of adequate berths for special dry-bulk cargoes, re-
sulting in slower loading and unloading of these cargoes at
general cargo berths;
(c) lack of sufficient silo capacity for wheat and corn storage;
(d) narrow and congested port area surrounded by the growing
town of Santos. The rail tracks and highway connections to the
port cut through the center of town, interrupting urban traffic
flow, and delaying cargo movements in and out of the port; and
(e)  equipment which, although well maintained, has low capacity
and requires excessive upkeep.
4.11      In addition to the operational improvements effected by COSEPS, the
Government, through IRPVN, has already undertaken a number of works to improve
and extend the existing facilities. Annex 4 gives a list of important works
undertaken and equipment purchased between 1968 and 1970, together with opera-
tional justification.  DNPVN has also formulated a five-year investment pro-
gram for 1971-75; this is discussed in Section 5. A tentative program of
works for 1976-80 has also been prepared.



5. THE PROJECT
A. Developnent Program of Santos Port, 1971-75
5.01      On the basis of studies done by its consultants) and in cooperation
with COSEPS and CDS0, DNPVN has formulated a five-year development program for
1971-75 for Santos port costing about NCr$ 694 million. The works included
in this program are shown on Map 3, detailed in Table 2 and summarized below:

Total               694.08        143.11
5.02      Because of the problems discussed in para. 4l0, the Government has
now decided to locate all major new facilities for bullk and containerized
cargo on the largely unused left bank and to construct the necessary rail
access* A study by a Brazilian consulting consortium, Engevix/Planave, has
established the technical-economic feasibility of providing such access.
A highway to Guaruja on the left bank is now almost complete and a 2 km
connecting road to the new port site will be constructed. The highway will
be adequ.ate for port traffic requiring road transport for 10-15 years.



- 10 _
5.03      In addition to works on the left bank, the program includes improve-
ments to the right bank facilities by extending and widening some quays, con#
verting otbsrs into roadways for port traffic, constructing transit sheds, im-
proving rail and road access and other facilities inside the port area,
replacing old equipment and acquiring additional equipment, and improving and
extending wheat handling facilities. (A Canadian Government grant of C$ 10
mill-ion to Brazil will finance the improved whe-at facilities.)
5.04      The program will not adversely affect the ecological and environ-
mental surroundings of the Santos area. Oil sludge processing units will be
incorporated in the final design for berths included in the Bank project.
B. The Project
5.05      Civil works and procurement items in the above program considered
suitable for international competitive bidding, and on which construction or
procurement is still to get under way or for which no other suitable source
of foreign financing is available, are included in the project proposed for
Bank financing. The project consists of:
(a) construction of and equipment for a two-berth, 400 m
container quay, with 13 m depth alongside;
(b)  construction of and equipment for a 62,000-ton silo for
storage of corn and a 200 m quay, with 13 m depth alongside;
(c) construction of about 21 km of 1 m rail track for the
Sorocabana and about 24 km of three rail track for the
joint use of the Sorocabana and Santos-Jundiai Railways;
(d) dredging equipment;
(e) engineering and management studies and training programs;
(f) hydraulic studies of the estuary; and
(g) services of experts to assist in overall port planning.
5.o6      Items (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) are wholly within the Santos port
development program, which also includes a part of item (c) pertaining to 8
km of rail line inside the new port area. The part of item (c) referring to
rail lines outside the port area represents investments by RFFSA and Soroca-
bana. Item (g) is an investment by DIJPVN. Details of the cost estimates are
given in Table 3 and sumnarized below:

The total costs of engineering works and cargo-handling and dredging equipment
are based on known costs of labor, materials, plant and equipment and on the
Brazilian price index for Nowember 1970. The costs of corn silo and loading
equipment are based on manufacturer's current prices. The foreign exchange
costs of civil works and equipment have been calculated from the estimated
foreign exchange costs for different categories of work and items to be
procured; details are given in Annex 5. The foreign exchange requirements
of management and engineering consult:. s- fees have been taken at 80% and
60% respectively of the total fees oI. .,se basis of foreign personnel to be
employed by them and the extent of woi,. to be done abroad. For overall port
planning and hydraulic studies, US$500,000 and US$200,000 respectively in
foreign exchange have been provided to cover salaries, foreign travel, etc.,
representing 95% of total costs* The cost estimates are realistic.
U  25% on cost of corn silo (ii) and rail works (iii and x) and related
consultants, services (vi and xi), none on vii, ix and xiii, and 10%
on remaining items.

5.07 (i)  Container Qui.  The contai ner quay will include container storage
areas, a stuffing sled, rail sidings, roads, water and power supply and would
be adequate to handle the forecast traffic through 1980.
(ii) Corn Silo and Berth (see Annex 6). The silo will have 32 bins for
storing corn and will include rail sidings, roads and services.  In order us
operate the silo efficiently, (i) an assurance has been obtained that the
Santos silo management would be given sufficient autonomy to determine day-to-day
operating policies and to manage its own financial affairs, and (ii) the silo
manager and three of his staff members should undergo practical observation
and training abroad at similar facilities; the cost of such training (US,15,000)
is included in the project.
(iii and x) Rail and Road Access (see Annex 7). The provision of rail
access is an integral part of the port development on the left bank, involving
the construction of about 21 km of 1 m gauge track of the Sorocabana Railfayv
about 16 km of three-rail track for both the Santos-Jundiai (1.6 m gauge) and
the Sorocabana (1.0 m gauge) Railways outside the port limits; and about 8 km
of three-rail track inside the port area. The project also includes addition
of a third rail to about 6 km of existing track and a two km road connection
to Barnabe Island.
(iv)  Eguipment for Container and Corn Berths.  Equipment for the container
quay will include three 30-ton container cranes and six straddle carriers, and,
for the corn silo, receiving equipment (two boxcar dumpers, one power shovel,
one truck dumper), headhouse and tower equipment (belt conveyor, grain dryer
and cleaners, scales) and ship loaders with self-trimming and conveyor equip-
ment.
(v) Dredging Equipment. The proposed dredging equipment will have a
minimum capacity of 2 million m3 per year to handle the maintenance dredging
needs of the expanded port. The exact capacity and type of equipment needed
will be determined on the basis of the hydraulics expert's recommendation arid,
if necessary, the hydraulic studies that may be undertaken pursuant to the
expert's report (see item (ix) below).
(vi, vii and xi) Consultants' Services. DNPVN has selected consultants
for detailed engineering and supervision.  The signing of a contract between
DNPVN and the consultants, on terms and conditions agreed to by the Bank, is a
condition of loan effectiveness. The consultants will provide specialists
in corn storage and handling facilities. The Government's program to improve
the operational, administrative and financial efficiency of DNPVN and the major
ports (paras. 3.04 and 3.09) requires the services of a firm of management
consultants, and the proposed loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of
such services for DNPVU and Santos.
(ix) Hydraulic Studies. The hydraulic conditions of the estuary have not
been systematically studied in the past. The Bank sent an experienced
hydraulic engineer to Santos to make a preliminary study and recommend the
scope of the hydraulic studies to be made. The proposed loan will help finance
the recommended studies (see also item (v) above).
(xiii)  Overall Port Planning Study.  There has been no systematic study
for the continuous development of ports serving different regions of Brazil.



- 13 -
NEDECO, in its report of 1$67, recommended rehabilitation, improvement and
extension of the three mkain ports it studied - Santos, Rio de Janeiro and
Recife. A UK firm of consulting engineers recently completed feasibility
studies for Rio de Janeiro and Recife.  A number of other studies are either
under way or about to get under way. It is essential to ensure coordination
of the various studies and to determine the order of priority of future port
investments.  The Government has requested Bank financing of the services of
some five/six foreign experts for a total 10/12 man-years to assist GEIPOT
(as agent of DNPVN) to undertake this work and help prepare an overall port
plan.
(viii and xii)                . A quantity contingency of 10% has been
provided for all items except (ii), (iii) and (x) (corn silo and rail works),
for which 25% has been provided. A 1 Ian tunnel is involved in the rail access,
and, for both the rail works and the silo, soil conditions are known to be
difficult and further soil investigations and engineering have to be carried
out in conjunction with detailed design work. A price contingency of 12% has
been provided on the basis of an expected 5% average annual increase in world
prices for the equipment and materials involved; the price contingency for
local costs is also based on anticipated dollar price increases, since
inflationary conditions in Brazil make it difficult to assess an effective
contingency for cruzeiro costs. However, and more important, port charges are
annually adjusted for inflation, the overall financial position of the port
and DIPVN is strong (see Section 7), and no difficulty is anticipated in meeting
local costs.
5.o8      Beyond the physical works, a most important and integral part of the
project is its contribution to institution building in the port sub-sector,
as an essential part of the Bank's efforts to promote improvements in institati,na2
and policy-making areas of the transport sector as a whole. Items (vii)
(management consultants) and (xiii) (overall port studies) are intended to help
realize these objectives in the port sub-sector.
C. Project Execution and Financing
5.09      DNPVN will be directly responsible for the execution of all project
items except that: (i) railway works both inside and outside the port area on
the left bank will be carried out by RFFSA and Sorocabana; and (ii) the overall
port planning study will be carried out by GEIPOT. RFFSA and GEIPOT are Federal
Government organizations under the Miinistry of Transport, which has already
issued instructions to RFFSA to undertake the railwiay work and to GEIPOT to
carry out the port planning study. A committee will be set up consisting of
representatives of DI\PVN, RFFSA and Sorocabana, to ensure: (i) coordination of
port and railway track works; (ii) conversion of existing boxcars for dumper
handling prior to the completion of the corn silo (this work is not included
in the project); and (iii)that RFFSA and Sorocabana will conclude a satisfactory
agreement for Sorocabana's running rights over the new common rail access wTh1ich
will be owmed by RFFSA.
5.10      The Bank loan will be made to the Government of Brazil which will
relend on the same terms US$6.84 million equivalent to RFFSA and Sorocabana
towards the foreign costs of rail works outside the port. The signing of these
relending agreements is a condition of loan effectiveness. DNPVN will be able
to meet the expenditures on its five-year investment program from its resources,
including local currency costs on Bank-financed items. However, RFFSA and
Sorocabana may need Government assistance in carrying out the rail works



outside the port. The Government has undertaken to make available the required
financial resources to RFFSA, Sorocabana and, if necessary, DNPVN to complete
the project.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
5.11      All civil works and purchase of equipment to be financed under the
proposed loan wiill be subject to international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Guidelines. Bids will be invited from prequalified
contractors for all major items of construction. There will be separate
contracts for corn and container terminals, railway connections, services and
as water and power supply, corn and container equipment, dredging equipment and
other smaller items of construction and procurement.  In the case of materials
and equipment, Brazilian manufacturers may participate in international
competitive bidding with a margin of preference of 15% or the relevant rate of
customs duty, whichever is lower.
5.12      Construction is expected to start early in 1972 and the project should
be completed towards the end of 1975. The estimated schedule of disbursements
is given in Table 4. Disbursements will be made: (i) on the
basis of agreed percentages for all civil works and for services of consultants
and foreign specialists (Annex 5 and para. 5.o6); and (ii) on the basis of
delivered costs at Santos for equipment and materials excluding local assembly
and erection costs. Retroactive financing is recommended to reimburse up to
US$0.5 million of payments to management and engineering consultants made
after September 1970. Savings, if any, on any items would be used to meet
overruns on other items. Any amount unspent on completion of the project would
be cancelled.
E. Land Acquisition
5.13      Land acquisition will be necessary for the container and corn
terminal and for rail and road access. According to Brazilian law, the Govern-
ment can take immediate possession of land declared to be for public use,
before compensation is established. Therefore, there is no likelihood of delay
on this account as the Government has agreed to use its powers for the timely
acquisition of all land needed for the project.
6. ECOc:OUffC EVALUATION
A. Traffic Forecast
6.01      Santos is the most important general cargo port in Brazil, serving
a hinterland that encompasses Sao Paulo State and city, which are spearheading
the country's industrial and economic development.  Sao Paulo city, with some
10 million people, is one of the fastest growxing cities in the world. In 1969,
the port handled 3.7 million tons of general cargo, that, is about 30% of



- 15 -
general cargo traffic handled in all of Brazil's ports, and 3.7 nillion tons of
solid bulk and 5.8 million tons of liquid bulkc; in all, 13.1 nnillion tons of
cargo. A total of 3,268 ships visited the port during the same year, of which
2,572 were in international trade and 696 in coastal trade.
6.02      Past traffic trends in Santos have generally been a reflection of the
trade policies of the Government and of the movement of the economy of Brazil
as a whole, with some ups and downs, but with a generally upward trend.
Between 1960 and 1969, total traffic excluding bulk liquid grew from 5.0 million
tons to 7.4 million tons. Dry bulk traffic more than doubled from 1.7 million
tons to 3.7 million tons, and general cargo rose from 3.3 million tons to 3.7
million tons.
6.03      Traffic forecasts for Santos had been made separately by the Govern-
ment's consultants, King & Gavaris - OESA, as well as by BCCL. These forecasts
were reviewed by the Bank. The agreed forecast is given in Table 5 and a
detailed explanation is given in Annex 8. This forecast is in line with the
macro-economic and trade forecasts of the 1970 Bank economic mission and, in
the case of farm products, with those of the 1969 agricultural mission. (See
also para. 2.02).
6.04      Details of the traffic data for 1969, estimates for 1970 and fore-
casts for 1975 and 1980 given in Table 5 are summarized below (t000 tons):

All traffic is expected to grow by substantial amounts except bulk liquid,
which will become less important because a major part of the traffic <ill
move to private terminal facilities. General cargo in containers is expected
to be 0.4-0.5 million tons in 1975, rising to 1.5-2.0 million tons by 1980.
B. Cost-Benefit Evaluation
6.05      The proposed works were evaluated in three stages:  (i)  development
of the left bank compared with continued expansion on the right bank; (ii) the
proposed improvement and development wJorks were separated into several separate
and meaningful groups each of which could possibly be undertaken independently
of the others (a few items which were felt to be common and essential to all
the works were left out of the evaluation at this stage); and (iii) all the
works, including the common works.
(i) Left Bank Location
6.o6      The location of certain facilities on the left bank involves the
construction of over 40 km of connecting rail links and an access road. (The
provision of water supply, sewerage, power and2 telephone services would be
necessary even if these berths were to be located on the right bank.) The
alternative to providing rail and road access to the left bani would be to
ferry about 80% of the port's fertilizer traffic that would be handled in the
fertilizer berths nearing completion on the left bank and to provide the
required facilities for handling corn and container traffic on the right bank.
The ferrying cost plus the additional labor costs for handling fertilizers
would be about US$l.50 per ton. The additional cost of providing the proposed
bulk and container facilities on the right bank, compared with the left bank,
is estimated at about US$6.0 million in investment costs, mainly for capital
dredging and land acquisition, and US$0.4 million a year in operating and
maintenance costs. Data are not available to quantify the cost of additional
traffic congestion in the city and the port area on the right bank. Provision
of rail and road access to the left bank will help avoid these costs. The
resulting savings would yield a minimum return of 12% on the investment,
including the provision for contingencies.
(ii) Evaluation of Separate Investment Packages
6.07      The investments in the separate facilities were identified to compare
the costs involved wJith the directly identifiable benefits arising from them
over their estimated useful economic life of 30 years.
(a) Fertilizer Facilities. The investments in the fertilizer handling
facilities wTill result in savings in ship time 1/ at berth due to faster
1/  Ship time is conservatively valued at US$2,500 per day for all ship's tine
savings considered in this section.



- 17 -
unloading (US$3.84 mill'on in 1975 rising to US$5.85 million in 1980), ship
time spent waiting for berth (US$0.75 million to US$3.25 million) and labor
costs (US$0.65 million to US$0.99 million). These savings yield a return of
almost 35%.
(b) Corn Silo and Berth. The benefits of these investments will be
savings in ship time at berth arising from faster loading (US$1.06 million in
1975 rising to US$1.76 million in 1980), ship time waiting for berth (US$0.15
million to US$0.70 million), labor costs (US$0.90 million to US$1.40 million)
and wastage reduction (US$0.90 million to US$1.40 million). These savings yield
an economic return of 17%.
(c)  Container Berths. The construction of two container berths will
eliminate the need to construct additional conventional cargo berths (about
one every year from 1974), save ship time at berth due to faster cargo-
handling (US$0.20 million in 1975 rising to US$2.00 million in 1982), and
save labor costs (US$1.08 million rising to US$5.00 million). These benefits
work out to an economic return of over 32%.
(d) 14Theat Facilities. Improved wheat storage and handling facilities
will save ship time at berth due to faster unloading (US$0.89 million in 1975
rising to US$1.02 million in 1980), ship time waiting for berth (us$0.64
million to US$0.72 million) and labor costs (US$0.71 million to US$0.82 million).
These yield an economic return of 14%.
(e) General Cargo Berths. The extensions to general cargo facilities
on the right bank, proposed and under way, will help to handle general cargo
traffic of 5.0 million tons in 1974, rising to 5.4 million tons in 1980
(excluding general cargo that may be handled in containers). Savings are
expected to arise from ship time at berth (US$1.10 million in 1974 to US$1.32
million in 1980), ship time waiting for berth (US$1.32 million to US$2.70
million) and labor costs (US$2.94 million to US$3.24 million). These benefits
work out to a return of 45%.
(f)  Dredging Equipment.  Annual maintenance dredging is estimated at
more than                 a year after the completion of the proposed project.
Since it is essential to have this work done regularly, the purchase of
dredging equipment was compared with the recurring cost of having this done
by contractors, wdhich is estimated at the very competitive figure of US$1.2
million a year. The proposed purchase will help avoid this cost. After
allowing for operating and maintenance cost, the incremental economic return
would be 11/%.
(iii) Evaluation of Program as a Whole
6.o8      The cost-benefit evaluation of the investment program as a whole,
including the cost of the rail access to the left bank, the capital costs
of dredging the channel and miscellaneous improvements, yields an economic
return of almost 23%O over an assumed 30-year useful economic life for the
facilities.



- 18 -
(iv)  Sensitivity Analysis
6.09      A sensitivity analysis of the investment program as a whole and
of each separate package discussed under B (i) and (ii) above was under-
taken. The economic returns were tested for a 10% adverse change in costs
(over and above the provision for contingencies) as well as benefits. The
results are shoun in Table 6 and indicate that the proposed investment
program as well as all but two of the items listed under (ii) above would
still produce adequate economic returns.  The two items which appear likely
to yield rather low returns in te event of either a rise in costs or a fall
in benefits are the investments in developing the left bank and the purchase
of dredging equipment. In both cases, however, the cost estimates are
conservative, and benefits are likely to be higher, not less.  Returns on
some items also tend to be relatively low (e.g. dredging equipment, wheat
facilities) because of the "lumpiness" of the investment which provides for
a certain amount of excess capacity. Consequently, the program as a whole
and each of its main components has adequate economic justification.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. The CDS Concession
7.01      Details of the financial aspects of the CDS concession are given in
Annex 2. Essentially, repayment to the concessionaire for his invested
capital (as agreed with the Goverment) on expiry of the concession is pro-
vided by a series of sinking funds, the oimnership of the assets then passing
to the Government. The concessionaire is entitled to a fixed return (now
10%) on his capital which, since 1958, has been adjusted for inflation by
applying annually the Government monetary correction index. All profits in
excess of the fixed return are paid into a special account, to be used to
maintain the concessionaire's fixed return. Upon termination of the concession
the balance reverts to DNPVN. Payment out of this account can only be made
under DNFVN's authorization. The sinking fund system of capital repayment
overlooked the necessity of providing funds for asset replacement, but
depreciation was not recognized as an operating cost to be recovered in port
charges, and no replacement reserves wrere built up.
1B. Tariffs and Investment Financing
7.02      Until 1956 all funds for new investments came from CDS, either from
share issues or by capitalization of undistributed profits. Since then,
except for NCr$ 2.5 million of new capital subscribed in 1969, most of the
funds have had to be provided by DNPVN, because CDS had no depreciation
reserves and no substantial undistributed earnings available for investment.
To provide D\TPVN with funds the Government instituted various special charges,
In 1958 a depreciation surcharge on general port rates was authorized (now 10%),
which is recognized as an operating cost but which is paid  over to DIHPVN and
not credited to a depreciation reserve in CDSts books; thus DNPVN provides
the funds for replacement of fixed assets originally provided by CDS.
7.03      To provide capital funds for port development, the Government also
instituted in 1958 a Port Improvement Charge of (now) 2% on value of all
imported merchandise and 0.2% on value of all outgoing coastal traffic, col-
lected by ports and paid over to DNPVN. Of the proceeds, 40% goes to a Port
Improvement Fund for investments solely in the port concerned and 60%5 to a
National Port Fund available for investment in any port in Brazil. The use
of these funds is entirely in the hands of DNPVN. This charge provides by
far the largest part of capital funds available for port investments.  In
addition, DNPVN's funds include proceeds from a Dredging Charge imposed at
certain ports (from 1968), payments from port earnings for use of DNPVNTs
investment funds, excess earnings of the concessionaire, and Federal Govern-
ment appropriations. N1one of these charges is related to the cost of
providing port services. BCCL's forecast of DNPVNts cash flow position
indicates that ample funds -will be available to undertake the Santos program.
7.04      The accounting consultants report that, although in theory the rates
for port services charged by CDS are supposed to reflect the relative differences
in operating costs of the various services, in practice the present cost
and accounting systems do not permit a system of tariffs based on costs.
Furthermore, the present form of tariffs is complex and impractical. IMany



- 20 -
rates have been set to serve special interests. CDS can propose rates; only
DNPVN can sanction them. Adjustments are made annually for inflation, but
there is a delay of several months between authorization of wage increases
and authorization of tariff increases. The tariff system that has developed
(and this is true for all ports) is unrelated to costs. During loan nego-
tiations the Covernmnent agreed: (a) that the tariff structure at
Santos will be reviewed with a view to simplification and coordination of the
various tariffs and special charges into a single schedule of services,
(b) that rates wilU be fixed for services reasonably related to the
costs of providing them, derived from the costing systems to be set up (paras.
3.09, 3.10), (c) that the new tariffs will be in force no later than December
31, 1973 and (d) that the new tariffs will apply to all port users.
C.  Present Accounting Systems and Past Earnings
7.05     The peculiarities of the concession contract and the subsequent
legislation have resulted in an unusual form of published financial accounts.
CDSb balance sheet does not show the financial position of the port as a whole.
It is rather the balance sheet of the company with a mixture of its investments
and rights as concessionaire, sources and application of Government funds and
various other items, some of which are not found in normal commercial-type
accounts. Fixed assets are not shown as such; investments from CDS funds are
shown after monetary correction, while those from DNPVN resources are given
separately at historical cost without monetary correction since under
Government fiscal procedures investments are not distinguished from current
expenditures. In no case is depreciation deducted or shown as a reserve.
The revenue account is also unusual, following the lines dict-ated by the
application of the legislation and concession contract. Although accrued
expenditure is taken into account, accrued revenue is not. The remuneration
on the concession capital is charged as an expense, the balance on profit
and loss account representing excess or deficit earnings. Although CDS
manages the port as a whole and charges are levied on all facilities ir-
respective of the source of financing, the company is only entitled to
remuneration on its own capital with no fee for managing facilities financed
from DNPVNIs investments.
7.06     Table 7 gives a summarized version of the published balance sheet
as at Decdmber 31, 1969, adjusted to bring it into line with commercial
accounting on an accrual basis; monetary correction has been applied to DIWPVNIs
investment, but no allowrance has been made for depreciation. In brief, all
that can be said of past earnings is that tariffs charged by CDS hare been at
rates sufficient to cover all expenses and items chargeable to revenue, in
accordancea, ith the legislation and concession agreement, to earn the company
the 10% remuneration to which it is entitled and to leave surplus earnings
either to offset future deficits or for investment by DNPVN4
D. Financial Forecasts
7.07     For the financial forecasts, BCCL set up a computer model wihich
enabled them to prepare forecasts based on different traffic forecasts and
investment cost estimates. The assumptions used are detailed in Annex 9;



- 21 -
the main ones are summarized as follows:
(a)  valuies of all fixed assets will be adjusted for monetary
correction;
(b)  all fixed assets will be depreciated on normal financial
bases; and
(c)  the Port Improvement charge will continue and Santos port's
40% portion has been treated as DNPVN's revenue from the
port. Port charges will continue at present rates.
The incomo that mzay properly be considered revenues of thle port of Santos
is derived from various tariffs and charges received by tlfo agencies: CDS
receives general port tariff charges as authorized by DIPVN: DIPVN receives the
40% Port Improvement Fund (Santos), Dredging Charge and Depreciation Charge.
To evaluate the future financial situation of the port as a whole, BCCL has
prepared consolidated statements of forecast revenues and costs and funds
flow statements for each agency and consolidated balance sheets of the two
agencies in respect of their operations at the port of Santos.
7.08      Substantial operating surpluses are generated by CDS from port
operations in excess of the fixed remuneration CDS is entitled to (para. 7.01).
These surpluses could be said to represent the return on DNPVI's investments
in the port. In preparing the financial forecasts sho-m in Table 8, the whole
of these surpluses have been treated as revenues of DUPVN available for
financing port investment at Santos. On this basis sufficient funds will be
generated (except for a small deficit in 1973) to finance the development
program up to 1975, with the help of the proposed Bank loan and a grant from
the Government of Canada for investments in wheat handling and storage
facilities, without recourse to the 60% National Port Fund or other government
resources. Ample funds will also be generated to finance further development
that may be needed beyond 1975. The Government has agreed to make available
from DNPVLIts resources, or otheruise, whatever funds are needed to finance
the development program at the port of Santos; it has also confirmed that the
excess profits earned by CDS can be made available to help finance capital
investment at the port of Santos.

The financial rates of return are more than satisfactory (taking into account
the relatively high return on investment expected from industrial undertakings
in Brazil) whether related to net fixed assets, total capital employed or
DNPVN's equity. Operating ratios are relatively low considering that the port
provides shorehandling services. Interest and debt service coverages are
high because of low debt/equity ratios (para. 7.L4).
7.10     A sensitivity analysis was undertaken for a 10% adverse change in
traffic, in investment costs and in operating costs. Even for a combination
of all three unfavorable changes, net income on average net fixed assets
averages 11% and on total capital employed close to 9.5% for 1976 to 1980.

7,12     Taking into account only those resources of DNPVN treated in this
report as port revenues, there will be sufficient funds available over the
construction period of the Bank-financed project items although there may be
some stringency in 1972 and perhaps a small deficit in 1973. Howrrever, there
are ample additional funds available from the 60% ilational Port Fund derived
from Santos.
7.13     Consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 1969 to 1980 are
given for Santos as a whole in Table 12, for CDS in Table 13 and for DNPVN
(Santos) in Table 14. For convenience and purposes of comparison, the
balance sheets including that of December 31, 1980 give the position as it
would be if the concession were not terminated. The consolidated balance

7.14     The balance sheets illustrate the extent of investments planned
at the Santos port in the 1970's, increasing the investment in fixed assets
by NCr$ 1,095 million (US$226 million) to more than six times the value in
1969 from NCr$ 208.6 million to WCr$ 1,304 million. This investment will
be financed entirely by funds accruing to or raised by DPWTN. On December
31, 1969, DINPVTls share of the total equity had reached 66.6% (on commercial
accounting bases) and will increase to 88.9% in 1980. DNPVN is already,
in fact, the senior partner in a joint venture to own and operate the port
of Santos, and by the time of expiry of the concession, CDS 's share in capital
employed in the undertaldng will be little more than 10,%. The balance sheet
position remains strong throughout, apart from the stringency in the cash
position in 1973. The debt/equity ratio is low, falling from a high of only
24/76 to 10/90 in 1980.



- 25 -
7.15      In October 1969, Law No. 74 was passed relating to ports, laying
down that; (a) no further monetary correction (for inflation) could be
applied to the fixed assets of port concessionaires; and (b) that both
depreciation and the value of retired assets should be deducted from the
value of fixed assets, even though these values ha-e not been repaid to the
concessionaire. The law appears to be somewhat arbitrary but CDS has no
foreign shareholders and it is proposed to leave the settlement of differences
to local negotiations, since the Government appears to be anxious to reach
a reasonable settlement. It is not known yet whether the Government will
insist that the capital to be repaid to the concessionaire will be reduced
by the accumulated unrecorded and unrecovered depreciation to 1969, in
accordance with Law No. 74, or whether it will be agreed that the capital
will be maintained in the amount of CDSts actual investment, although it is
clear that ample funds will be available for the latter. Alternative
estimated balance sheets have therefore been drawn up showing the state of
affairs of DNPVNts port undertaking at Santos at December 31, 1980, on the
basis (i) that CDS's capital will be reduced by unrecovered depreciation or
(ii) on the basis that CDSts stockholders will be repaid their invested
capital in full (Table 15).
7.16      The Government has agreed that, at the termination of the concession
and transfer of port operations to a new entity, the assets would be valued
on bases acceptable to the Bank and that the port would continue with the
accounting, management information and other systems to be installed as pdrt
of the present project.
E. Financial Objectives and Tariffs
7.17      The present level of port charges at Santos, together with the 40%
of the Port Improvement Charge paid into the Santos Port Improvement Fund and
the proposed Bank loan, will enable the port of Santos to finance the very
substantial 1971/75 development program with relatively moderate assistance
from other resources of DNPVN, e.g. the 60% of the Port Improvement Charge
paid into the National Port Fund. However, after completion of that program,
with rising profits from growing traffic, with dividends restricted to CDSts
capital, and in the absence of any return on Government capital by way of
dividends or income tax, substantial and increasing cash surpluses would be
generated, year after year, even after financing a relatively substantial
volume of additional investment. Cash surpluses would increase by about
NCr$ 470 million (nearly US$100 million) between 1975 and 1980, considerably
more than would be necessary for future requirements as far as can be foreseen
now. The financial rate of return on average net fixed assets would rise
from 16.3% to 18.8%, averaging 16.7% over the five years; the return on
capital employed would average about 12%.
7.18      In view of the financial position indicated, it is not proposed to
specify a minimum financial return for the port.  It is, however, clear that,
even without taking into account the 60% of the Port Improvement Fund earmaAked
for the National Port Fund (which is more in the nature of a tax than a charge
for port services), the general level of port charges at Santos will be higher



- 26 -
than necessary from 1976 orward. Wihat would be a reasonable level of tariffs
at Santos cannot be determined until the various studies on DNPVN, Santos port
and overall port planning are completed, the new costing systems at Santos are
in operation, and the financial situation and requirements of Santos port in
particular and of DNPVN in general have been reviewed, and the portrs financial
objectives agreed with the Bank. The tariffs should then be set at levels
appropriate to the agreed objectives.
7.19      The new tariffs should be set and amended from time to time as may
be necessary, at levels sufficient to yield a reasonable return on total
investment, as may be agreed from time to time between the Borrower and the
Bank. A reasonable return would be such as would enable the port as a whole
to generate sufficient cash funds, after meeting all operating costs, to
service debt, meet commitments to CDS, replace plant, pay dividends on DNPVN
equity capital and income tax (if any), maintain adequate working capital,
maintain reasonable emergency reserves, and help finance the 1971-75 Santos
Development Program and a portion of future investments without excessive
accumulation of cash. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Borrower that, prior to the introduction of the new tariff at Santos, the
financial situation of DNPVN and of Santos port would be reviewed with the
Bank and financial objectives agreed upon. Further, in order to maintain an
adequate cash position, an undertaking was obtained that the Bank would be
consulted before any further investments or development programrs are undertaken
at Santos at a cost of US$2 million equivalent or more in any one year.
F. External Audit and Insurance
7.20      CDS's financial accounts are not audited by independent auditors.
Brazilian company law does not make the audit of company accounts obligatory,
and, while Stock Exchange regulations require audit of the accounts of
companies whose shares are quoted, CDS is exempt from this requirement. CDSfs
accounts are subject to audit by DIPVVI, but in fact no audit has been completed
and no report issued since 1956. The position is unsatisfactory, and all
financial accounts submitted to the Bank in respect of Santos would in future
be audited. During negotiations the Government agreed that from the year 1971
on all financial accounts of DNPVN, CDS and the port of Santos, would be
audited by the Ministry of Finance or by independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank.
7.21      CDS, as the port concessionaire, has adequate third-party insurance.
But there is no fire insurance for any of the port installations. In view
of the layout of the port which is conducive to localizing any outbreaks of
fire, and the financial strength of both CDS and DNPVN to handle any unforeseen
losses, such insurance is not considered necessary.

8. RECOEIINDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) implementation of management consultants' recommendations
(paras. 3.05 and 3.10);
(b) revision of salary levels in DIJPVN and Santos (para. 3.06);
(c) setting up of a new entity for Santos port (para. 3.07);
(d) autonomy for the Santos silo management (para. 5.07 (ii)):
(e) modification of boxcars by RFFSA and Sorocabana and
running rights over access lines (para. 5.09);
(f)  availability of finance for RFFSA, Sorocabana and DNPVN
(paras. 5.10 and 7.08);
(g) acquisition of land (para. 5.13);
(h)  revision of tariff structure (paras. 7.04 and 7.19);
(i) valuation of assets and continuing new systems (para. 7.16);
(j) consultation with Bank on further investments (para. 7.19); and
(k) appointment of auditors (para. 7.20).
8.02      The following will be conditions of effectiveness:
(i)  the signing of contracts, approved by the Bank, between
DNPVN and the management and engineering consultants
(paras. 3.05, 3.10 and 5.07 (vi and xi)): and
(ii) the signing of subsidiary loan agreements, approved by the
Bank, by the Government with RFFSA and Sorocabana for re-
lending up to US$6.84 million equivalent to the latter
from the loan proceeds (para. 5.10).
8.03      The proposed Santos port project provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$450. million to the Government of Brazil. The appropriate
term would be 25 years, including a five-year period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF SANTOS PORT PROJECT
Details of Railway, Highway and Air Transport Sectors
A. Railways
1.        The railway network comprises about 30,000 route km of which
roughly 24,800 km are operated by the Federal Railway Company (Rede
Ferroviaria Federal - RFFSA) and 5,000 kn by a State company (Sao Paulo
State Railway). In addition, some 600 km are owned and operated by a
Government-owned mining company (Cia Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD) and carry
mostly iron ore traffic. About 90% of the network is meter gauge track.
Between 1961 and 1969 railway freight traffic (excluding CVRD) increased
from 10.5 billion ton/km to 14.5 billion tcn/km, but passenger traffic
declined from 18.0 billion passenger/km to 13.0 billion passenger/km.
In relative terms, the railways have been losing traffic to other modes
of transport. The rail share of total freight traffic movements declined
from 18% to 14%, and of passenger traffic from 22% to about 8% betwieen
1961 and 1969.
2.        In recent years, railway operations - both Federal and State -
have been characterized by heavy financial deficits. In 1963 the
operating ratio for RFFSA reached 358 with an operating deficit of
US$237 million equivalent. Excess labor, obsolete equipment, maintenance
of uneconomic lines and lags in tariff adjustments were largely responsible
for these deficits.
3.        Under PA-1 a series of measures were envisaged to improve EFFSA
operations. The principal measures were: administrative reorganization,
closing of uneconomic lines and stations, improvements in operating
efficiency (dieselization), reorganization of accounting, restructuring
of tariffs, and reduction in personnel. Implementation of this program
has progressed satisfactorily, with encouraging results. The 1968 operating
deficit vias reduced to US$142 million equivalent (US$102 million equivalent
if concessionary services to Government are "normalized", i.e. priced at
commercial rates) and the operating ratio - before normalization - reduced
to 200. Further progress can be expected, provided strict redimensioning
and rehabilitation policies are followed. PA-2 gives the objectives and
aims of such policies and lists the required measures.

B. Highways
4.        Brazil has a total road network of about 933,000 km of which
40,000 km are national and 114,000 km are state. The balance includes
mainly earth roads and tracks - feeder roads and links between minor
towns - under the jurisdiction of municipalities.  About 16,500 km, or
40% cf the national network, are paved, but only 19,300 km and 3,800 km of
the state and municipal networks have concrete or bituminous surfacing.
In all states except Sao Paulo and Guanabara, only a small percentage of
the national and state highway network is paved. In general, there is
need to extend the road system and to improve existing roads, including
upgrading of the surfacing.
5.        The total vehicle fleet in 1967 was estimated to be about 1.9
million cars and pick-ups, 53,000 buses, and 429,000 trucks.  In recent
years, the growth of the fleet has averaged 8% a year, and in 1967 the
vehicle density was one for every 28 persons, the third highest in Latin
America. Practically all vehicle needs are met by domestic production
(300,000 p.a.) and future growth of the fleet is not expected to be limited
by production capacity. About half of the truck fleet is 5-9 tons capacity,
gasoline powered; heavy diesel trucks of over 15 tons capacity account for
only 7% of the truck fleet.
6.        Between 1961 and 1968 total freight traffic in Brazil increased
from 75 billion ton/km to 148 billion ton/km, at an average rate close to
10.5% p.a. Road traffic over the same period rose by approximately 12.5%
p.a. while rail transport and coastal shipping grew only at 7.2% and
4.5% p.a. respectively. This was reflected in an increase of the road
share of total freight traffic from 63% in 1961 to over 72% in 1968. Total
intercity passenger traffic expanded from 49 billion passenger/km in 1961
to 108 billion passenger/km in 1968. Over the same period the road share
of passenger traffic rose from 78% to 92%.
C. Air Transport
7.        Because of its large size, Brazil is relying increasingly on air
transport. In recent years the annual passenger traffic growth rate has
been 12.5%. The major commercial airline company (VAPIG) has extensive
domestic and international networks linking Brazil with other cities in
South and North Armerica, Western Europe and Africa. The airports generally
need improvements and extensions, particularly the Galeao International
Airport at Rio de Janeiro.

APPRAISAL OF SATTOS PORT PROJECT
Details of CDS Concession
1.        The CDS concession was originally granted in 1888 for a tenn of
39 years, which was later extended; it will now expire on November 7, 1980.
The original contract authorized the concessionaire to construct and operate
specified port facilities at Santos, and to find the whole of the necessary
capital. The profit to which the concessionaire was entitled was restricted
to 12% of capital employed. This profit was not subject to income tax.
An amortization fund (sinking fund) was to be set up, the annual payments
being made out of the profits, to provide sufficient noney at 6% interest
to repay the concess4onaire's capital at expiry when the port assets would
pass to the Govermment without payment. No provision was made to charge
depreciation on fixed assets so that no funds were expected to be accumulated
for fixed asset replacements or to recoup the investment, and no provision
was made for funds for expansion. The capital employed was to be agreed
and "recognized" by the Government, having regard to the authorized works
and their cost.
2.        During the concession the investment management of the Amortization
Fund has been in the hands of the concessionaire who, in practice, retains
the revenue from it as extra port income and contributes 6% yearly to the
fund. CDS cannot appropriate the capital until the concession expires.
3-        Over the years, various laws and decrees were enacted bearing upon
the concession, includ4ing authorization of additional works and recognition
of additional capital and, in 1958, making the annual contributions to the
Amortization Fund a chbrge against revenue, reducing the remuneration to
10% on the investment, and relating the concessionaire's capital to fixed
assets.
4.        Also, in 190., the principle of depreciation was recognized as an
operating cost to be included in port charges. Hovwever, depreciation was
not related to the econamic life of the assets and the charge was fixed at
1% of port charges. Further, the amount was to be paid to DNPVN which had
exclusive authority over its use. The depreciation fund, therefore, became
a source of capital to the Government, either for replacement of fixed
assets at Santos or for any other investment, but not a source of funds to
repay the concession capltal. From 1970 the depreciation charge was
increased to 10% of general poat tariff charges.  In 1958 the Government



ANNSEX 2
Page 2
recognized the impact of inflation on fixed asset values in commercial firms
and authorized periodic monetary adjustment according to official indices
(later made obligatory). For port concessionaire firms this had the effect
of revaluing the recognized capital.
5.        The concessionaire's recognized capital is separated into initial
capital (investments to 1937) and additional capital invested in the
foll owing periods: (a) 1938-46, (b) 1946-55, (c) 1955-64, (d) 1965 onward.
Separate amortization funds were to be created, maturing in 1980 for the
initial capital, 1990 for additional capital A, 2000 for addiltional capital
B and 2010 for capital C.  In fact, although no investments can be made
without DMPVU's approval, the Government has not "recognized" any invest-
ments made from 1957 onwards either for purposes of remuneration or for
capital repayment; it has not approved contributions to the Amortization
Fund for such investments and has, therefore, not approved the concession-
aire's published accounts.
6.        Finally, in October 1969, a Supplementary Act, No. 74 was passed
supported by a Decree Law, No. 973 regulating monetary adjustment for port
enterprises. Honetary correction applies only to investments made out of
the concessionaire's own funds and not to those financed from Government
resources, whichl are considered "dead capital". This latest legislation is
complicated, but the result appears to be:
a) the value of fixed assets (and therefore the concession
capital) is to be reduced by the value of retired assets,
even though the capital representing them has not been
repaid;
b) depreciation is to be deducted, again although the
depreciation values in the concession capital have not
been repaid; and
c) there is to be no further monetary correction applied
to the values of fixed assets of port concessionaires
after the date of the law (October 1969).
7.        The Government set up a comittee to advise on the application of
the law. The committee appointed consultants to advise it. It is under-
stood that the consultants have submitted a report but the committee has
not yet done so.

APPRAISAL OF SANTOS PORT PROJECT
Description of Santos Port Facilities, kncillary Services
Floating Craft, Plant and Cargo-Haridling EquiLment
A. Facilities
1.       The port of Santos (Map 3) situated on the Santos estuary
extends over 12 Im and has quays over 5,500 m in length with alongside
depths varying from 5 m to 11 m at low water. The port has all its
facilities on the right bank of Santos estuary with the exception of
two oil berths located on Barnabe Island and two almost-completed
fertilizer berths further downstream on the left bank. The port facilities
are divided into seven sections and are described below from the
upstream end of the port.
Alamoa Area
2.       An oil tank farm is located in Alamoa.  BuLk liquids are
pumped from tanksers at Saboo quay to the oil tanks. Behind Alamoa
there is a small storehouse for explosives unloaded fron ships at a
special jetty downstream.
Saboo Quay
3.       This section has 970 m of quay with 10 m alongside depth;
of this length 580 m quay is used for handling bulk liquids and
390 m for bulk solids. Bulk solids ere loaded or unloaded by means
of grabs. Approximately 200 m knoTwn as the Saboo cut is used for
unloading coal and 190 m at the downstream end for other bulk solids.
There are no sheds. Downstream of the Saboo cut a small strip of
approximately 49 m length is used for tugboats and other small craft;
upstream of Saboo there is a terminal for ferry boats to Barnabe
Island. The quay and its apron are well maintained.
Valongo - Pagueta Quay
4.       The Valongo-Paqueta section, which has 1,961 m length of
quay with alongside depth of 7 m, is generally used for overseas and
coastal general cargo. 209 m in front of Transit Shed 9 is used for



ANNEX 3
Page 2
unloading wheat and corn and 200 m length in front of Transit Shed 12
is used for bulk-handling directly to and from trucks and freight cars.
There are 12 transit sheds on the quay.
5.         This quay is very old, having been constructed between 1892
and 1902, and includes only a very narrow strip of land within the port
limits. iMany of these berths are gradually being given up for improve-
ment of road and rail services in the port.
Paqueta - Outerinhos Quay
6.         This section has 2,025 m length of quay with alongside depth
of 11 m. Special wheat, corn and salt handling facilities occupy about
1,625 m and overseas general cargo is handled at the remaining 400 m
of quay., There are 11 transit sheds. The quay, its apron and the sheds
are well maintained.
Outerinhos - Macuco Quay
7.         The Outerinhos - Macuco section has 1,220 m of quay. The
depth along 920 m of this section from the upstream end is 8 m and
along the remaining 320 m is 5 m. About 260 m of quay (8 m deep)
opposite the Cold Storage Warehouse and Transit Shed 23 at the up-
stream end is used for overseas general cargo. Grain and salt are
unloaded in bulk on the remaining length of 8 m deep quay. The grain
is conveyed to and stored in the port silo behind Transit Shed 26 and
salt to storage facilities downstream of Mortona channel. The 320 m
of quay having an alongside depth of 5 m is used for harbor craft.
405 m of the 8 m deep quay upstream of Mortona channel is proposed to
be widened by bringing the quay face 10 m forward; this would also give
11 m depth alongside to accommodate deeper and larger wheat ships. The
quay has four transit sheds and is well maintained.
Macuco Quay
8.         The Nacuco Quay is 1,170 m long, and an additional 370 m is
under construction. The depth alongside this quay is 11 m. It is the
newest of all the port facilities and is used for overseas general
cargo. Three spacious transit sheds, each 50 m x 120 m, serve about
700 m of quay. On the remaining 840 m length of quay, part of which is
still under construction, four sheds are proposed to be constructed.
It is intended to extend Macuco Quay 470 m on the downstream side as
part of the five-year investment program.
Left Bank
9.         The port also has 301 m of quay on Barnabe Island with
alongside depth of 10 m which is used for handling liquids. There is



ANNEX 3
page 3
a ferry boat terminal upstream of Barnabe Island quay for transport-
ing rail cars to the right bank.
10.        A new quay 567 m long with alongside depth of 13.5 m
for loading fertilizers will shortly be completed on the left bank
opposite the downstream end of the Macuco quay. Since there is no
railway or road connection to this quay, a ferry-boat terminal has
been constructed on either bank for the transport of fertilizers.
Fertilizer unloading equipment is being erected on the quay.
B.  Ancillary Services
'Water Supply
11.        Water supply to the port on the right bank is the
responsibility of the Santos municipality. It supplies water to the
Port Administration which in turn distributes it in the port for
shore operations and ships' requirements. The supply is inadequate
and the port has plans to augment the supply from other sources it
is investigating. The supply of water to the left bank extension
will be from a main supplying water to Guaruja town. The cos  of
this forms part of the project.
Fire Fighting Services
12.        The port has no fire brigade but depends on the local
Santos fire brigade. However, in emergencies the tugboats, which are
provided with fire-fighting equipment, render assistance at fires near
the water front.
Drainage and Sewerage System
13.        Rain water and sewage in the town of Santos use a common
drainage system which requires improvement. Several schemes have
been under consideration. Drainage in the port area is, however,
adequate and maintenance is good.
Electric Power
14.        The port has its own prime source of electric power
consisting of five 3 MW generators at a hydroelectric power plant,
which is ample for its needs. A new power line from the network for
the left bank extension will be necessary and the project cost
estimates provide for this.
C. Floating Craft
The port has the following floating craft. All the craft
are well maintained and in good operating condition.

Evaluation of the Corn Silo
Introduction
1.        The lack of a corn silo at Santos has been a critical bottle-
neck in corn movement through the port which now handles about half of
Brazil's corn exports. The silo to be constructed under the present
project would handle corn exports through Santos from Sao Paulo, 14inas
Gerais, Hatto Grosso, Goias and possibly Parana.
Present Corn-NHandling Facilities at Santos
2.        Corn exports through Santos are handled by the Brazilian
Storage Company (CIBRAZ12I), the official Federal storage agency, and
CDS, which operates the port. CIBRAZEM receives corn in bulk at three
warehouses leased from CDS and equipped for bulk grain handling.  CDS
handles shiploading operations.
3.        The present three warehouses have an aggregate capacity of
about 45,000 tons and handle over 92% of the total corn exports shipped
through Santos. They have no facilities for infestation control,
cleaning and drying, and provide only temporary storage space. Since
grain cannot be efficiently fumigated in the warehouses, it is treated
in the ship's hold after loading. During the peak months of July to
December, grain stays in the warehouses for only 8 to 12 days and is,
therefore, not overly exposed to infestation.
4.        The equipment now used in the warehouses has a total nominal
capacity to unload corn at 420 tons/hr and load at about 900 tons/hr.
The nominal ship loading capacity is 300 tons/hr, but the average
attainable operating rate is only 67 to 80 tons/hr due to:
(a) slow and unsystematic movement of corn from floor stockpiles
into hoppers;
(b) the noed to move vessels being loaded, since loaders are
stationary and are too few to allow flexibility; and
1/ A mission consisting of J.F. Zarandin (Bank) and D. Macgregor and
r-. Pelon (Consultants) visited Brazil in August/September 1970 to
appraise the silo.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(c) the need for time-consuming trimming operations.
5.        Recorded losses at the warehouses generally do not exceed
2%, and these are due mainly to physical grain handling. An
efficient silo operation would cut losses to 0.1A$.  In addition, it
is estimated that installation of an efficient export grain-handling
system in Santos could reduce time needed to load a 20,000-ton ship
from the present 13 days to about two days, and may thereby raise the
F.O.B. Santos price of corn by up to US$3.50 per ton.
Overseas Markets
6.        An assured market exists for Brazil's corn.  Italy, Japan
and Spain are Brazil's principal overseas markets. An analysis of
the Italian and Spanish markets indicates that these two countries
can absorb as much as five times their present purchase from Brazil.
The Japanese corn market will also continue to grow and Britain and
other European countries are other prospective markets.
7.        In 1968, with a record corn export of 1.3 million tons,
Brazil's share of the international market stood at only about 5;.
This indicates that the country's corn exports will not be limited
by overseas markets but rather by the availability of exportable
surpluses at home and the facilities to handle them efficiently.
Transport
8.        Two railroad lines, the Sorocabana and the Santos-Jundiai,
carry bulk corn and other dry bulk solids to Santos. Sorocabana has
about 800 standard-design boxcars suitable for bulk-grain handling.
Santos-Jundiai is in the process of replacing 50 boxcars with units
capable of being "dumped". Most of Sorocabana's boxcars are,
however, unsuitable for "Idumping"I. Fortunately, these deficiencies
carn be remedied through relatively minor modifications. Assurances
uTere obtaiined durinr negotiAtions th_t the required modificm-
tions would be carried out prior to completion of silo construction.
9.        Trucks are not currently allowed to haul corn into the
port warehouse because of congestion and lack of space to queue.
The proposed silo site on the left bank would have more than adequate
waiting area since the high speed unloading dumper would enable trucks
to move almost continuously at the rate of six per hour.
Silo
10.       The project includes a 62,000-ton grain silo equipped to
receive, elevate, clean, dry, fumigate and load corn and other exp6rt-



ANNEX 6
Page 3
able grains and pulses. It would be equipped wjith a temperature-
indicating system and an aeration system. This would be the first
major facility of its kind in Santos and is expected to increase the
ship-loading rate to 1,200 tons/hr.
11.       The main storage space would consist of 32 individual bins,
with an aggregate capacity of about 62,000 tons. Receiving equipment
would include: (a) two rail boxcar dumpers; (b) four power shovel
pits; and (c) one truck dumper. Q1 the basis of current boxcar and
truck capacities, the facilities' overall unloading capacity would be
about 750 tons/hour. The headhouse would have four automatic scales,
capable of handling 600 tons/hr each, two grain cleaners, each rated
at 150 tons/hr. A grain dryer would be between the headhouse and the
bins, with 50 tons/hr capacity at a moisture reduction rate of 5%
(from 20% down to 15%) per pass.
12.       The present sizes of ships carrying corn, as well as those
expected in the next two decades, require that at least five loading
towers be available to cut loading time and eliminate delays and
extra costs. Two belt conveyors would move grains from the silos
to the five loading towers which would have swinging spouts and
trimmers to dress the ship's hold. This system would have a total
effective capacity of 1,200 tons/hr.
Mknagement and Training
13.       DNPViN would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
operation of the silo.  In the alternative, and until such arrangements
are made CIBRAZEM would continue to operate the silo under existing
arrangements. Assurances were obtained that the silo management would
be given sufficient autonomy to determine day-to-day operating policies.
14.       The project provides for overseas training of key operating
personnel to ensure staff familiarity with the relatively sophisticated
equipment proposed to be installed. The cost of sending the manager
and th-ree of his staff members for a three-month practical training-
cum-observation tour abroad is included in the loan.

Rail Access to Left Bank
1.        A connection is required to the Santos-Jundiai and Sorocabana
railways from the terminals to be constructed on the left bank of the
Santos estuary. The track gauge of the former is 1.6 m, and of the latter
1 m.
2.        The Santos-Jundiai connection requires construction of a new
line southward from existing lines leading to COSIPA, about 24 km from
the port terminals to be served. The track would have three rails to
provide for the two gauges. The 16 km first section will terminate at
a holding yard at Barnabe.  The second section wfill provide an 8 km
service line from Barnabe with spurs to the new terminals.
3.        The Sorocabana connection is to be provided by the completion of
a new 21 km line already under construction, joining tle existing Sao Paulo-
Santos line (of the Santos-Jundiai system) in the COSIPA area, but work
is proceeding slowly through lack of funds. A third rail will be laid over
existing Santos-Jundiai track connecting with the new line to the port.
4.       IUhile the engineering of the Sorocabana connection is almost
complete, and work is now in progress, much work remains to be done to
complete the engineering of the Santos-Jundiai line. The section to
Barnabe will cross difficult terrain. Line construction will require
heavy earthwork, and the construction of bridges and a 1 km long tunnel.
The line will pass through marshy land which will call for special measures
to support the track. The remaining engineering work requires 7 to 10
months to complete, and includes further topographical surveys and investi-
gation of subsoil conditions at the tunnel and the rest of the route.
5.        Project management will be by a Cornmission consisting of repre-
sentatives of DNYVN, RFFSA and Sorocabana, which will be responsible for
overall coordination of port aid railway works. DNPVN is taking steps
to appoint a consortium of two or more consulting firms for detailed
engineering and supervision of project execution. On the railway side,
this will include survey, examination of subsoil and detailed design for
the Santos-Jundiai connection, and help where required by Sorocabana.
Appointment of consultants is expected in iay   1971, with completion of
engineering by the end of 1971.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        Present estimated costs are based on a preliminary survey by
consultants from which maximum minimum and probable costs were assessed.
In view of the uncertainties involved, the appraisal is based on probable
costs with a 25% allowance for physical contingencies. The estimates
also provide for a possible average 12% world price increase over the
construction period. The costs are shown in Table 3.
7.        The cost of work outside the port area includes:  (a) comple-
tion of construction work on the new link of the Sorocabana Line to join
up with Santos-Jundiai; (b) the three-rail link serving both from their
junction to the new berths on the left bank; and (c) addition of a
third rail to about 6 km of existing Santos-Jundiai track.
8.        The portion of the rail connection having three rails will be
owned and operated by RFFSA. It has been agreed that RFFSA would permit
the Sorocabana railway to have running rights over this section on terms
and conditions to be mutually agreed prior to commencement of railway
operation.
9.        Of the estimated cost of rail access outside the port area,
about NCr$ 45 million is apportionable to RFFSA and about NCr$ 34 million
to Sorocabana. In addition, the latter has already spent NCr$ 27 million
on its access line, making a total of NCr$ 61 million for its part of the
project. Estimates of the additional rail traffic to and from the left
bank, and including other traffic expected to be carried by Sorocabana,
show that the net financial benefit accruing to RFFSA and Sorocabana would
be about NCr$ 9 million each. The financial returns on the railway invest-
ments would be 21% and 16% to the two railways, respectively.
10.       The Bank has maintained a continuing dialogue with RFFSA and
Sorocabana in recent years as a result of wahich active steps are being
taken to improve their financial situations which are discussed fully in
an appraisal report covering a proposed loan to RFFSA for the transporta-
tion of iron ore (the NBR Project). The inclusion in the proposed Bank
loan of a small, but essential, element of financing for rail transport
facilities included in the project, while making possible the viftal contri-
bution of the railways to the port development, will at the sare time enable
the railways to effect improvements in their operations and finances.

Traffic Forecasts
A. EXPORTS
Forecasts of exports are based on the past and anticipated future
trends in the world markets and the forecast demand for Brazilian exports.
Figures so derived were reviewed for consistency with expected levels of
production and consumption in the service area of Santos port which includes
the State of Sao Paulo and parts of the States of Minas Gerais, Parana, Mato
Grosso and Goias. The major export items are reviewed below:
i)  Coffee:  In the past few years, world imports of coffee have
grown at about 3% per year. For the immediate future, the
International Coffee Organization expects an annual growTth of
only 2%, mainly because of the leveling off of coffee consumption
in the U.S. which absorbs about 45% of world coffee exports. It
is expected that, as in the past, Brazil's share of world exports
will be 30%. The ports of Santos and Paranagua handled over 85%
of Brazil's coffee exports. In accordance with expected coffee
production in the service areas of the two ports, Santos is expected
to handle about 45% of the country's coffee exports.
ii)  Sugar:  About half of Brazil's sugar exports go to the U.S. under
the U.S. Sugar Quota System. An annual growth in sugar consumption
in the U.S. of 1.3% is expected on the basis of 1961-67 experience,
and it is assumed that the U.S. would continue to import about 42%
of its sugar requirements. It is reasonable to expect that Brazil's
quota would continue to be 12% in U.S. sugar imports, and that as
in the past it would continue to export an equal quantity to other
countries. Over one-third of Brazil's sugar exports during 1965-68
went through Santos, and it is expected that this wTill be the case
for the next 10 years.
iii)  Cotton:  Cotton export forecasts are based on the following
assumptions:
a) the world market for cotton exports wqould show a modest
growth of only 1% per year;
b)  Brazil's share of world exports would be 6<, the average
for 1958-69 (although in 1969 it was above 10%) and that
Santos would handle over 70% of Brazil's cotton exports,
as it did on the average duling 1958-69.



ANN EX 3
Page 2
iv)  Bananas:  Santos handles more than 30% of Brazil's banana
exports, almost all of which go to Argentina and Uruguay.
Since 1958, these exports by sea have declined owing to com-
petition from faster truck transport. Also, Ecuador is now
competing with Brazil in the Argentine market. For these
reasons, it is forecast that banana exports through Santos
would continue to decline at about the same percentage rate
as in the recent past.
v) Oranges: Exports of fresh oranges from Brazil, almost all of
it through Santos, have averaged 100,000 tons during 1958-68.
For the future, an export level of about 120,000 tons per year
is projected.
vi) Corn: Between 1965 and 1969, corn exports through Santos have
averaged 380,000 tons a year. Exports in 1970 may be double
this average. Future exports have been forecast at about 1.4
million tons in 1980, which is consistent with the Bank Economic
ivIission's projected export level of 2.0 million tons for the
country as a wshole in that year and the Agricultural Projects
Department's judgment that about 70% of this quantity would
go through Santos (on completion of the corn silo facilities)
and the rest through Paranagua.
vii)  Other Foodstuffs and Beverages:  Included in this category are
peanuts, peanut meal, frozen orange juice, frozen meat, etc.
The forecast for this group was based on trends in the past 10
years and visualizes a modest annual growth for the next 10 years.
viii)  Other Manufactures:  Because of the growing industrial importance
of the Sao Paulo region, exports of manufactures through Santos
have grown at more than 15% a year in the last 15 years, com-
pared with an average of under 9% for the whole of Brazil. This
trend is expected to continue.
B.  IMPORTS
Import forecasts are based on anticipated requirements in the Santos
service area minus what can be met from domestic production. Major commodities/
commodity groups are reviewed below:
i)  Foodstiuffs and Beverages:  The forecast of imports of this
category is based essentially on past trends. The average
growth rate anticipated is less than 2.5% a year.
ii) Manufactures: The import requirements of manufactures were
analyzed by major product groups - iron and steel, chemicals,
and other products. Forecasts are based on a projection of



ANNEX 8
Page 3
Brazilian requirements, domestic production possibilities,
and the shortages in the aao Paulo area which will have to
be met by imports.
iii) Wheat: There is very little wheat production in tne Santos
service area, and all wheat requirements have to be imported.
Per capita consumption of wheat for Brazil as a whole has
recently averaged 37 kg per year and somewhat higher for the
Sao Paulo region.  Wheat imports through Santos are projected
on the basis of anticipated population growth in the&area and
per capita annual consumption of 40 kg.
iv) Fertilizers: Past fertilizer imports through Santos have con-
stituted about 40% of the region's requirements. Future imports
have been projected on the basis of anticipated regional needs
and regional production plans and possibilities.
v)  Sulphur:  Almost the whole of Brazil's sulphur requirements are
met'by imports. Sulphur imports through Santos are forecast to
double between 1970 and 1980.
vi) Coal:  Coal imported through Santos is mainly for the steel plant
and the gas company in the region. Since the steel planit has
built its own terminal for unloading coal and the gas company
is switching to naphtha, only a small quantity of coal destined
for some of the smaller coal users in the area is expected to
use the Santos port facilities.
vii) Other Dry Bulk: Only a small quantity of other dry bulk cargo
is forecast.
viii)  Crude Petroleum:  Crude petroleum imports via Santos port
dropped sharply in 1969 because of the commissioning of a
separate private oil terminal to supply two of the three
refineries in the area. The oil terminal will be operating
at full capacity in another year's time; thereafter crude
petroleum imports at Santos will be solely for one small
refinery which will not be served by the special oil terminal.
ix) Boscan oil: This is a special type of crude petroleum used in
asphalt production. Projections are based on estimated asphalt
requirements of the region.
x) Petroleum Products: Consumption of petroleum products has
been growing at about 11% a year for the past 20 years in
Brazil. For thie purpose of this exercise, consumption in the
Santos service area is assumed to grow at 7% a year. Imports
from abroad, as well as exports and imports in the coastal
trade, are projected on the basis of consumption estimates so
derived and estimates of production of the different products

in the Santos area. Products -for which there will be a short-
fall in both the region and the country are assumed to be
imported in quantities sufficient to meet the region's needs.
Products for which there is a shortfall in the region but none
in the country are assumed to move in coastal trade (where this
is the most practical and economic means). Surpluses of the
region are assumed to move in coastal trade to other ports to
meet the needs of those areas.
xi) Other Liquid Bulk: This includes chemical solvents and a
modest growth rate is assumed, based on past experience.
C. COASTAL TRADE
i) Incoming and outgoing general cargo: These are projected on
the basis of past experience.
ii) Salt: Based on estimated requirements in the Santos service
area for human, animal and industrial uses. Most of it comes
from the north-east of Brazil.
iii) Other Dry Bulk: Only a modest movement of other dry bulk is
projected.
iv) Liquid Bulk: With the expansion of refineries in the Santos
area, the import of petroleum products via coastal trade is
expected to cease; on the other hand, some exports are antici-
pated.

Financial Forecasts Bases and Assumptions
1. Nature and Scope
Financial forecasts made for the period 1970 to 1980 were based
on traffic forecast for the period and on historical financial data.
The pattern of CDS costs and tariffs in the port was used as a
basis in developing assumptions for the projections. The relationship
between costs and types of traffic flow was established in order to calculate
activity rates. These assumptions were formulated after considering histo-
rical trends, laws and regulations, and management and government decisions
and policies. To these, the consultants' judgment and experience were
applied to arrive at final assumptions.
The definition of future variable costs and volume wias based on
estimated tonnage per year. Fixed costs and other costs were based on
historical data and other applicable factors.
2. Traffic
The traffic forecast used for this analysis was the joint traffic
forecast developed by the engineering and management consultants under the
direction of DI\PVVN. This forecast was reviewed by World Bank economists
and accepted by them, except for solid bulk exports (corn). In respect to
this last item, the consultants have used the figures developed by the
Bank's agricultural mission to Brazil. This adjustment was made with the
agreement of DINFITN.
3. Income Statement
Revenue and variable cost rates have been adjusted to reflect
changes in the value of the Brazilian currency from. 1969 to 1970, since
tariffs are adjusted annually to cover inflationary increases in costs of
labor and materials. Consultants have estimated the inflation rate for the
year 1970 to be 20% for port revenues and expenses. This is in line with
the actual increase in the cost of living in the Sao Paulo area, which rose
about 20.9% in 1970. Revenue from operations and variable costs, when pro-
jected on the adjusted rates and on actual tonnage, are within less than 1%
of actual figures for 1970.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Fixed costs (both administrative and operational) were also adjusted
to reflect actual 1970 values. The same reasoning applied to other income
and other expenses.
The revenue from port operations was calculated by applying a simp-
lified set of tariff rates (based on the published CDS tariffs) to forecasts
of tonnage by commodity.
Since the revenue for depreciation (a special tariff set up to
cover the increasing costs of depreciation) is calculated at 10% of the
revenue from operations, the inflationary increase in the latter causes a
corresponding increase in the former.
The revenue from 40% of the Port Improvement charge plus the 50%
dredging revenue are calculated over the value of imported merchandise.
This value has gone up in 1970 not only due to inflation, but also due to
the change in the composition of imports at Santos. There is now a larger
portion of high tariff general cargo than heretofore. The two effects
described above (inflation and change in cargo composition) have caused a
real increase in the value of this revenue. Consultants have used tonnage
as a basis for projection, since the value of imported merchandise is very
hard to forecast. The revenue receipts have been projected at the rate of
NCr$ 4.50 per ton of cargo traffic. This figure is used from 1970 to 1980,
the assumption being that the value/tonnage relationship will remain constant
throughout the forecast period.
The yearly sinking fund provision will provide for the repayment
of about one half of the total CDS investment in the port by 1980.
4. Variable Cost
Variable cost was calculated by applying variable cost rates to
forecast of tonnage by commodity.
A calculation of estimated maintenance costs per year arising from
neu investments, using historical cost patterns, has been included in the
growth rate shown for both variable and fixed costs for operations. In
forecasting maintenance costs for new investments in the port, materials
used for maintenance are classified as variable cost vwhile labor is considered
a fixed cost. IWhile it is expected that the application of modern management
techniques to maintenance will result in savings which will partially offset
the additional costs arising from new investment, no estimate of these savings
has been included in the forecast.
5. Fixed Costs - Operational
The increase in operational fixed costs has been estimated at a
compounded rate of 5% per year. Records indicate that these costs have
increased at a higher than 5% rate per year in the past.  However, new



ANNEX 9
Page 3
investment and additional traffic volume will help to improve organization,
operating methods, and use of more sophisticated equipmpents all of which will
tend to lessen the rate of increase in these costs.
6. Fixed Costs - Administrative
These costs were projected at a compound rate of 2% increase per
year. Again, despite higher rates of increase in the past, the effect of
improved administrative techniques and systems and a better organizational
structure is expected to hold the increase to 2%.
7. Depreciation - CDS, Port and DNPVN
All CDS and DNPVI fixed assets at the Port of Santos were analyzed
and yearly depreciation calculated from 1966 through 1980. The resulting
amounts were verified and used to prepare the projections. The recognition
of depreciation on both existing assets and proposed additions to assets as
an item of operating cost is a business practice and accounting concept
that has not previously been used by the ports of Brazil.
In this analysis, it is assumed that the cost of depreciation is
an operating cost and the investment in port facilities rlll be recovered
during the period of useful (economic) life. This charge-back of depreciation
to operating expenses also implies that the cost of depreciation will be
included in the tariff rates. Tariff rates used in this analysis have been
adjusted to include an amount to cover depreciation.
The rates used to calculate depreciation are those CDS developed
based on the economic life of existing assets. These rates have been
compared item by item with the rates recently issued by DNPVN, and no
significant differences exist.
Rates have been applied only to the undepreciated value of existing
assets on a year-by-year basis. Both the original asset value and the amount
of depreciation have been recalculated year by year in terms of the November
1970     value of the new cruzeiro, using official Brazilian indices for these
adjustments.
For proposed additions, depreciation rates have been applied year
by year to the remaining economic values, assuming constant value for the
cruzeiro during the period.
8. Remuneration for DNPVN Investment
This araount is a rent paid to DNPVN by CDS as compensation for the
use of DTPTl2  fixed assets at the Port of Santos.  Law No. 3421 of July 7, 1958
regulates this payment and stipulates that it be derived from CDS port operations
revenue. The yearly rental represents 0.5% of the total value of DNPVN's
fixed assets at the Port of Santos. (This has been omitted from the forecasts,
since it represents a very small part of DNPVN's real return on investment,
which includes CDS's excess earnings.)



ANNEX9
Page 4 
9. Other Income
Other income has been forecast to increase 5% per year.  Higher
rates recorded in the past were not used because they varied wi-dely and
included temporary sources of income. Other income basically consists of
income generated in port-related activities not included in tlhe tariffs.
These include:
Discounts on billings
Sale of obsolete material
Insured damage - collected
Interest on Government bonds
Other items of a similar nature
The 6% return on investment legally required for the sinking fund is included
as one of the items under "Other Income".
10. Other Expenses
Other erpenses have been forecast to increase 5% yearly. After
analyzing the composition of these expenses, it was concluded that they
would increase at about the same rate as "Oth1er Income".
11. Sinking Fund Payments
This is a yearly amount deducted from CD3 port revenue destined
to repay capital invested by CDS stockholders at the end of the concession.
The fund is, therefore, increased every year by the amount charged to the
income statement, including interest at 6%. In theory, the fund amount should
be sufficient to repay all CDS stockholders, but in practice a deficit must
be made up by a supplementary fund entitled "Supplementary Amortization
Reserve" (part of surplus, not a sinking fund liability). Since CDS does
not plan additional investments of its own at Santos, the sinking fund
schedule of payments will not change during 1970-1980. The 6% interest
earned on the fund is added to principal annually.
12. Interest Expense - CDS Port
This item consists of interest payments on current outstanding
CDS debts. No interest payments of this kind have been calculated for the
projected period since CDS is not planning additional borrowings.
13. Revenue - DNPVN - Port Improvement Charge and Others
This heading includes the following sources of income:
Port Improvement Charge - this is calculated as follows,
according to Law No. 3421/58: 2% on value of all
imported merchandise and 0.2% on value of all coastal
exports.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
The income collected is distributed according to the formula:
60%/ for DTPViN to be invested at its discretion in any Brazilian
port.
h0% for DNPVN to be invested only in the port of collection,
in this case Santos.
Surtax (50%) on all tariff rates for port utilization
by regulation #654/68 - Dredging Tax.
An analysis of the value of imported merchandise in the port and revenue
collected on it does not show a consistent trend. It was, therefore,
necessary to calculate a value based on total tonnage handled.
The following relationships were arrived at for the years 1966,
1967, 1968 and 1969 (10 months) after all values were converted into 1969
cruzeiros using official monetary indices:
(10 months)
1966     1967     1968      1969      1970
40% Port Improvement Tax     12,812   12,183   15,632   28,119*   42,052
50% Dredgir,g Tax                -        -      5,583    6,733-<-  8,5h7
Total NCr$               12,812   12,183   21,215   34,852    50,599
Number of tons                13,971   14,562   16,562   11,041    11,732

Total /Ton                 0.92     0.84     1.28      3.15      4.30
A rate of 4.30 was selected for use in the projections as a reasonable
average.

14. Revenue for Depreciation
This revenue is based on a 1% surtax on all port tariffs except
those related to transit shed utilization. Yearly data, converted into 1969
cruzeiros, show:
(In '000 NCr$)
1966         1967        1968     Average
Depreciation
Surtax collected (1%)          1,059         973       1,203        1,078
CDS Revenue from Port
Operations                  125,577      121,195     139,262     128,678
Ratio                           0.91%        0.80%       0.86%       0.86%
The average figure of 0.86% was not used for the projections,
since it was insufficient to cover the total forecast depreciation of the
existing and proposed fixed assets of the port. To cover this depreciation,
the port will need a yearly allocation of about 10% of CDS's revenue from
operations.  This percentage was used for the projection,
15. Interest Expense - DNPVN
This item reflects the interest paid by DINPVN on existing debts
to Eximbank - BNDE and for future facilities resulting from planned invest-
ments. An annual interest rate of 7.5% on outstanding balances is assumed.
This charge would be paid from DlI VN revenue from the port of Santos.
A grace period of five years before repayment of the loan was
assumed after each group of projects is completed and in operation.
16. Balance Sheet
The actual 1969 balance sheet of the port of Santos was recast
using U.S. accounting procedures. This balance sheet, as shown in the
tables, was then used as a basis for the financial projections. M4ajor
differences from the original statements lie in the classification of
accounts, recognition of bad debts, separation of port and non-port accounts
whenever possible, and the revaluation of CDS and DNPVN fixed assets in
Santos to January 1, 1970 prices. On the liabilities side this monetary
correction (official Brazilian Government index) is recognized in the
revaluation fund account for CDS and on the capital investment account for
DNPVN.
Most assumptions affecting balance sheet items were based on
historical relationships determined by analysis. Exceptions are fixed
assets where the programmed investments have been added in the year following
scheduled completion; depreciation reserve, where the basis is that defined

in this annex; and miscellaneous current assets and expenses. In the case
of inventories (maintenance stores), a substantial decrease from previous
trends has been assumed, based on application of good control procedures.
Inventory is forecasted to vary at a more modest rate than in the past.
A growth rate of only 2% per year has been assumed, due to the expected
use of modern inventory management techniques.
17. Miscellaneous
The investment project will be partly financed by a World Bank
loan.  The terms of the loan assume a 90-day period between expenditure
and disbursement from the loan, a 20-year repayment period, five years of
grace and interest rate at 7.51% per year on outstanding balances. A
commitment charge of 0.75% per year is also charged on committed balance
remaining to be used. The repayment ef principal and interest is small
and varies during the period 1971 to 1975; from 1976 to 1995 it becomes
about TNCr$ 8.5 million per half-year.  The investment outside port area
and left bank highway construction was not included in this analysis since
it will not be paid out of port income.
