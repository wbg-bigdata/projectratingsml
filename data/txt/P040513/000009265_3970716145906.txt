1.    General
Luoyang-Sanmenxia expressway, a section of the national trunk road from Lianyungang to
Huoerguosi, has already succeeded in project identification by a World Bank mission. Linking
roads to this expressway, including Jiangzhuang-Baiqiang linking road in Xinan County, Yima
linking road in Yima and Mianchi linking road in Mianchi, are also proposed to partly financed
by the World Bank. Background of these roads is described in Table 1-1.
In accordance with relevant requirements of the Government and the World Bank, the linking
road project is identified to be a Class B construction project which also needs environmental
impact assessment. As entrusted by the Highway Administration under Henan Provincial
Communications Department, Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Institute is held
responsible for the EIA of the linking road project.

Note: Of the total length of Xinan linking road, the 3 km section south of the expressway
(from Jiangzhuang to the expressway) has roadbed width of 1 5.5 m and surface width
of 15.0 m while the rest 6.3 km north the expressway (up to Baiqiang) has roadbed
width of 12 m and surface width of 9 m.
2.1.3 Project Cycle and Construction Schedule
All preparatory works are proposed to be completed by the end of 1996. As planned, the
project is to be commenced in March 1997 and completed in September 1998. Each of these
linking roads will be constructed as a separate lot on LCB (local competitive bidding) basis.
However, the internationally applied FIDIC management model will be applied to the project
construction management to ensure high quality completion as scheduled.
2.1.4 Requirement, Origin and Hauling of Major Materials
Major materials required for these linking roads are as shown in Table 2-2.
Xinan linking road: Steel, timber and asphalt will be purchased from Luoyang at a hauling
distance of 25 km and will be transported via road. Cement will be supplied by Tiemen
Cement Factory. Lime will be locally supplied. Macadam, sand and gravel will source from
Yiyang at a hauling distance of 40 km and will be transported via road while middle-sized and
coarse sand is obtained from Ruyang at a hauling distance of 110 km and is transported via
road.
Page-4



Yima linking road: Cement, lime and gravel will be procured from Mianchi, Tiemen Township
and Hongyang while steel and timber are supplied by Yima. All these materials will be hauled
via road since the hauling distance is short. Originating from Nanyang, however, middle-sized
and coarse sand will be transported, via railway, to Yima railway station at a hauling distance
of 490 km and then to the worksite via road (with a hauling distance of 6 km).
Mianchi linking road: With cement,lime, gravel, steel and timber all purchased from Mianchi,
the hauling distance is very short. Asphalt will be transported from Luoyang via road. But
middle-sized and coarse sand will be transported from nanyang, via railway, to Mianchi
railway station at a hauling distance of 500 km and then to the worksite via road at a hauling
distance of 6 km.
2.1.5 Traffic Flow
As predicated in the feasibility report, traffic flow of these linking roads in different base years
is as described in Table 2-3.

According to investigations as included in the project feasibility study report and the local
vehicle constitutions, vehicles on these linking roads are considered herein-to be composed
of 20% large-sized, 50% middle-sized and 30% small sized ones.
2.2  Identification of Project-related Environmental Impact
In line with the project features, possible environmental impact factors include:
Construction stage:  noise and vibration due to construction activities
fume due to construction activities, blown dust due to material transportation
waste gas arising from asphalt preparation
waste water resulting from construct:o, activities
sewage contributed by construction workers
land use for temporary use
borrow/spoil area operations
Operation stage:   noise and vibration due to vehicles
exhaust gas discharged from vehicles
land coverage for permanent use of roads
blown dust arising from vehicles
road surface erosion by precipitated water
traffic accident
Environmental element impacts by these environmental factors are identified, by using an
expert identification system, as illustrated in Table 2-5.
As seen from Table 2-5, most of the environmental impacts in the construction stage will only
exist in limited time, but impacts will exist in prolonged time during the operation stage.
With short construction stage, short length, low roadbed and small earthwork quantity, the
impacts during the linking road construction were carefully assessed. In line with the local
actuality and the environmental impact identification, such impacts as soil erosion, alteration
of hydrological regimes, noise and air are regarded as key environmental elements of the EIA.
3.    Physical Environment and Socioeconomy
3.1   Physical Environment
3.1.1 Topography and Geomorphology
Xinan and Yima linking roads are situated in mountain and heavy-hilly areas where gullies are
well developed. Along these two roads, the land declines from north to south.
Mianchi linking road is situated where the land is rather flat and fluctuates to a less extent.
3.1.2 Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology
All these roads fall within mountain and hillyland areas in Cascade II terrace of China, with
strata mainly composed of Quaternary system, local Triassic system, Permian system,
Ordovician system, Cambrian system and middle Proterozoic erathem.

As being located in the Yellow River basin with less developed surface water flow, none of
these roads goes across any large river..
The loc?l groundwater is phreatic water which lies at a greatly-varying depth (60-80 m in
most cases) under the ground. The local aquifer is lower Pleistocene series gravel and Triassic
system sand and conglomerate. Yima and Mianchi respectively take the Yellow River and
Yanghe reservoir as drinking water source to fill up the gap of groundwater unavailability.
3.1.3 Basic Earthquake Intensity
In accordance with Henan Provincial basic earthquake intensity mapping, it is verified by
Henan Provincial Earthquake Association that Xinan and Yima linking roads are distributed in
6-degree areas while Mianchi linking road is situated in 7-degree areas.
According to historical records, sensible earthquakes have ever occurred in all of these
counties (city) involved in the project.
3.1.4 Climatology
All these counties (city) fall within the temperate semi-wet continental monsoon zone with
four distinct seasons. Based on the meteorological statistics provided by the local
meteorological stations, the annualaveragetemperaturerangesfrom 12.40Cto 14.1 °C, with
an annual average air pressure 955-987 hpa, relative humidity about 66% and precipitation
of 667-670 mm which is concentrated in the period from June to September. The annual
evaporation is larger than precipitation, which puts this region in a dry position.
In Xinan County, west wind prevails in the year while WNW wind prevails in Yima and
Mianchi. The average wind speed is 2.9-3.3 m/s.
3.1.5 Physical Resources
With large mountainous areas, the locai farmland area is relatively small.
However, there are varying and large mineral dt:posits such as coal, bauxite, iron and sulfur.
The local flora is predominated by artificial plants and there are few large-sized animals though
there are some natural plants and some wild life distributed in mountainous areas.
3.2   Socioeconomy
3.2.1 Population and Economy
With a total population of 508000 people, including 219000 under property line and 160000
not ensured of basic requiremEnts for food and clothes, Xinan is one of the poorest counties
in Henan Province. There are rich mineral deposits here, though, economic development is
Page-8



very slow as a result of inconvenient linking to the outside world. In 1994, the gross social
product was 1145 million RMB and the gross output value of industry and agriculture was
1411 million RMB. Coal and electric power are industrial backbone of the county.
With a total population of 130000, Yima generated a total social product of 455 million RMB
and 914 million RMB gross output value of industry and agriculture in 1993. With 1000
million t proven deposit, coal is the industrial backbone. Yima Mining Administration, a super-
large state-owned enterprise, produces more than 10 million t coal each year.
In 1994, the total population of Mianchi was 330000 people who generated a total social
product of 1025 million RMB. With 11 proven mineral deposits, such as 600 million t coal,
270 million t bauxite and 500 million t quartz, Mianchi has built up an industrial systim with
coal mining, metallurgy and machinery among other sectors playing the leading role.
3.2.2 Communications Situation
Xinan County is only 20 km from Luoyang. With Long-Hai railway and National Road 310
passing across the county from eastto west, Miao-Si, Xin-Yi and Xin-Yu highwvays connecting
south and north parts, a highway network has been practically created. However, all these
roads, except National Road 310, are of a low grade, which somewhat restricts the local
communications development.
Although Long-Hai railway and National Road 31 0 pass across Yima from east to west, there
are few south-north roads, which makes linking between the south and north parts difficult.
With Long-Hai railway and National Road 310 from east to west, Nan-Yan and Mian-Bai
highways from south to north, as well as a county-xiang highway network, communications
in Mianchi is quite easy.
3.2.3 Archeology
As explored and verified by the provincial and local archeological agencies, there are not any
archeological sites or cultural relics involved in these roads. So the project will not cause any
archeological impact.
3.2.4 Environmentally Sensitive Sites along the Alignments
There are altogether 7 sensitive sites within the distance of 200 m from these roads, including
3 sites (at least 200 m from the road) along Xinan linking road, 3 sites (at least 140 m from
the road) in Yima and 1 site in Mianchi. The sensitive site involved in the last linking road is
separated by the road.
Page-9



All of these sensitive sites are villr,ges, without any hospitat, sanitorium or other sites
requiring any special protection measures.
Table 3-1 illustrates the background of these sites.
4.   Investigation and Evaluation of Environmental Quality Situation
4.1   Eco-environmental Setting
With four distinct seasons and adequate illumination, the climate is so favorable to meet the
requirements for two-crops-a-year farming model. But precipitation is on the lower part and
is too concentrated such that this region is susceptible to droughts which are the bottleneck
to the local agricultural development.
The soil here is all drab soil with pH value more than 7.0. With poor moisture and fertility-
retention ability, the soil is less cultivable.
Vegetation coverage here is relatively low, with the surface vegetation predominated by
crops. Most of the arbor is created with artificial efforts. There is little natural timber forest.
As investigated, there is no rare and endangered animal or plant species along these roads.
There is no wintering ground of migratory birds or major habitat of wild life.
Since vegetation coverage is low, Slope scouring and soil erosion are serious to bring about
water and soil loss.
Cereal crops grown along these linking roads include wheat, corn, Chinese sorghum and
sweet potato. Cash crops are mainly soybean, peanut, rape, cotton and tobacco, etc. As a
consequence of natural catastrophes, agricultural productivity is far from high. Over the past
years, the local government has encouraged engagement in fruit tree planting on the principle
of fitting into the local situation such that the local agriculture has been greatly promoted.
As investigated and monitored, lead content of soil is at a normal level at full length of these
roads and is not above the provincial background value.
4.2   Evaluation of Acoustic Environmental Situation
It is investigated that there is no major noise source in the range 200 m off these roads.
4.2.1 Monitoring of Acoustic Envirornmental Situation
4.2.1.1     Arrangement of Monitoring Point
Two monitoring:points for such purposes are arranged along Xinan linking road, namely,
Heishangou and Baiqiang.
Page-1 0



As for Yima linkirg road, one monitoring point has already been arranged at Rugeta for such
monitoring involvad in Luoyang-Sanmenxia expressway. This linking road passes by the east
part of this village. The environmental setting has never changed and there is not any new
noise source n this village since the monitoring for the expressway carried out In January
1995, so the monitoring results obtained in January 1995 are used herein.
This is also the case for Mianchi linking road. For the purpose of such monitoring, one
monitoring point has ever been arranged at Maling which is separated by this linking road. As
the environmental situation has not changed in any way and there is not any new noise
souroe in this village since the above mentioned monitoring, the monitoring results obtained
in January 1995 are adopted herein.
Background of these monitoring points are as summarized in Table 4-1.

4.2.1.2      Monitoring Time
Monitoring of acoustic environmental situation was carried out on June 12, 1995 at both
points arranged along Xinan linking road. The monitoring lasted one day when monitoring
was conducted once in day and once in night.
4.2.1.3      Monitoring Methodology
Such monitoring was carried out by monitoring and statistic method as provided for in the
"Measurement of Environmental Noise in Urban Areas" (GB/T14623-93).

Linking Road     Monitoring Point                    Background                               Remarks
Being 200 m south of the joint (interchange) of Luoyang-
Heishangou       Sanmenxia expressway and Xinan linking road and east
of the linking road, this village is dwelled by some 200
villagers.
Xinan                                 Being 300 m from the endpoint of Xinan linking road,
with Xinan-Sicun road passing through the west part,
Baiqiang         this is a large village populated by some 1000 villagers,
including 200 teachers and pupils in a primary school at
the north part.

Being 1.5 km north of Mianchi County seat, with the
expressway 300 m north of the village and the linking
Mianchi             Maling            road passing through the east part, this is the only village
in the range 200 m of the linking road. There are 400-
odd residents, including 200 pupils in the primary school.

4.2.2 Monitoring Result and Evaluation
4.2.2.1     Selection of Evaluation Standard
All of these linking roads are distributed in rural areas. There is no environmental noise
standards available for such areas. As accepted by the local environmental agencies, the
environmental situation evaluation is conducted using environmental noise standards for
Category II areas as spelled out in "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban Areas" (GB3096-
93), i.e. 60 dB(A) in day and 50 dB(A) in night hours.
4.2.2.2     Analysis of Monitoring Result
Monitoring results of acoustic environmental situation along these linking roads are analyzed
as stated in Table 4-2.

Note: Monitoring results obtained from Rugeta and Maling in January 1995 are used in the
table.
As comparison of the above statistics and EIA standards suggests, environmental noise L,.
at Heishangou and Baiqiang is not above the standard both in day and night hours. At
Heishangou monitoring point, the environmental noise L,, is below the standard by about 20
dB(A) in day hours and 13 dB(A) at night hours. Furthermore, the instantaneous environmental
noise level does not fluctuate to a considerable extent (with a not being more than 1). The
environmental noise L, at Baiqiang is below the standard by about 7dB(A) in day hours and
8 dB(A) at night hours. But the instantaneous environmental noise level fluctuates to a larger
extent. With reference to monitoring records, traffic noise arising from Xinan-Sicun road west
of this village is the major noise source which poses some effect on the monitoring results.
With regards to Yima linking road, the environmental noise L. at Rugeta is not above the
standard both in day and in night.
This is also the case in respect of Maling monitoring point on Mianchi linking road.
The above analysis reveals that the local environmental noise situation is fairly good.

4.3   Evaluation of Air Environmental Quality
As investigated, there is no industrial pollution source in the range 1 km off these roads.
4.3.1 Air Environmental Situation Monitoring
4.3.1.1     Arrangement of Monitoring Point
Such monitoring points are the same as used for environmental noise situation monitoring, see
Table 4-1 for the background of these point-.
4.3.1.2     Monitoring Time and Frequency
With respect of Rugeta and Maling, data retrieved from the monitoring IJanuary 1995)
involved in the expressway are used herein. Since there is no air pollution source at these
points, the previous monitoring results are still representative.
Air environmental situation monitoring was conducted at the two points arranged for Xinan
linking road June 9-13,- 1995. The monitoring lasted 5 days each of which experienced 4
monitoring activities respectively at 6:30, 11:30, 16:30 and 21:30. Each monitoring included
observation of wind direction, wind speed, air temperature and air pressure among other
meteorological elements.
4.3.1.3     Monitoring Item and Sampling Method
Air environmental situation monitoring items include TSP, CO and N0O.
Sampling, analysis and quality assurance involved in air environmental situation monitoring
activities are incompliance with the "Specification for Air Environmental Monitoring" and
'Environmental Monitoring and Analyzing Method". In detail, sampling and analyzing methods
used for these items are as follows:
Item  Sampling Method   AnalyzingMethod
TSP  filter membrane    weight method
CO   air-sampling bag    gas chromatography
NO.  solution absorption  hydrochloric naphthaleneacetic diamine colorimetry
4.3.2 Monitoring Result and Evaluation
4.3.2.1     Monitoring Result
Statistics on air environmental situation monitoring along these linking roads are as listed in
Tables 4-3, 4-4 and 4.5.
4.3.2.2     Evaluation Standard
As accepted by the local environmental agencies, Class 2 standards of the "Air Environmental
Quality Standard" (GB3095-82) are applied to air environmental situation mnonitoring involved
in these roads. Table 4-6 gives instantaneous and daily average concentrations of TSP, CO
and N0O included in this current national standard.<.

4.3.2.3     Analysis and Evaluation of Air Environmental Situation
As comparison of monitoring statistics and evaluation standards suggests, the instantaneous
TSP concentration at the two points along Xinan linking road is not above the standard. The
daily average is respectively 40% and 60% above the standard at Heishangou and Baiqiang
but the excess multiple is rather low. With a value of 0.579 mg/m3, the daily average is only
0.93 times above the standard. At these two points, both instantaneous and daily mean
concentrations of CO and NO. are not above the standard. At Baiqiang, the maximum daily
average of CO is 3.76 mg/m3 which accounts for 94% of the evaluation standard, but both
instantaneous and daily average concentrations of NO. only contribute a small portion to the
standard.
At Rugeta monitoring point, the instantaneous TSP concentration is not above the standard.
The daily average is 20%° ab=e the standard, but the maximum of 0.349 mg/m3 is only 0.1 6
times above the standard. The instantaneous CO concentration is neither above the standard
Page-1 6



though the daily average, with a maximum of 5.45 mg/rnml 1.36 times above the standard),
is 100% above the standard. Both instantaneous and daily average NO. concentrations here
are far below the standard.
At Maling monitoring point, instantaneous and daily average concentrations of such pollutants
are not above the standard except the daily average of TSP which, with a maximum of 0.343
mg/m3 (only 0.14 times above the standard), is 20% above the standard.
The previous analysis indicates that the local air environmental situation is not so desirable.
TSP is the outstanding pollutant here. Also, CO pollution is relatively significant along Yima
linking road. With a low background value, NO, does not pose significant air pollution along
these roads. Relatively, air environmental situation along Mianchi linking road is good, but the
situation goes from worse to worse in the case of Xinan and Yimna linking roads.
The concentration of CO along Yima linking road is rather high. As analyzed, this is because
that 11 gas arising from coal pits is discharged from ventilation shafts; 2) considerable CO
results from coking activities by local method; and 3) CO is produced by coal combustion used
for heating purposes in winter days. In addition, the -monitoring happened to be carried out
in the winter (January 1995) when air diffusion is poor. As for Xinan linking road, CO
concentration is not above the standard because the monitoring is conducted in the summer
when no CO results from heating purposes and air diffusion is good. However, TSP content
in air goes up as more and more blown dust rises as a result of the drought this year. This
indicates that air pollutant concentrations varies as the season changes.
5.   Environmental Impact Assessment and Analysis
5.1   Environmental Impact Assessment in Construction Stage
5.1.1 Eco-environmental Impact
Eco-environmental impact during the construction stage is mainly reduction of green plants
as a result of land use for the roads. With a total length of 14.4 km, these linking roads will
cover a total of 34 ha land. However, disappearance of plants on 34 ha land will not pose
significant eco-environmental impacts.
With low-lying roadbed, these roads will require a total of 650000 m3 earth works which are
proposed to be borrowed from side ditches and longitudinally allocated in the range of
acquired land. As a result, no damage will be caused to farmland and vegetation out of this
range.
In line with the local topography, the roadbed works are almost free from high cuts and
extensive excavations, which will only bring about minor change, if any, to the natural slope
and topography. Therefore, no extensive water and soil loss will be suffered.
5.1.2 Agricultural Impact in Construction Stage
These linking roads will cover a total of 34 ha land which is converted to 510 mu. If the land
area for permanent use would be all farmland and the unit yield would be 650 kg/mu, grain
Page-1 7



loss as a result of such land use would be no more than 331.5 tlyear. With respect of the
total grain yield produced by these 3 counties (city), such loss is negligible.
With a short length, none of these roads will cause remarkable impacts on farming activities
and irrigation facilities.-
5.1.3 Archeological Impact in Construction Stage
It is investigated and verified that there is no surface or underground cultural relics along these
linking roads. Thus no archeological impacts will be caused in the construction stage.
5.1.4 Analysis of Noise Environmental Impact due to Construction Activities
Construction machines will be engaged in construction activities. Commonly used construction
machines include bulldozer, grader, roller, paver and asphalt concrete mixing plant, etc. These
machines generates a noise source intensity about 80 dB(A), with a maximum not being more
than 90 dB(A). Based on analogical investigation and projection results, the affected area of
such construction machines will not be farther than 50 m in day hours although it will be
about 200 m in night hours.
With short length and few villages involved, these roads do not have many targets to affect.
Also, such impact is of a periodic nature. If construction activities will suspend in night hours,
such impact will not ;ze significant.
5.1.5 Analysis of Air Environmental Impact due to Construction Activities
In the construction stage of highways, air pollution mainly sources from blown dust arising
from lime-soil mixing, asphalt smoke and material transportation. Main pollutants are fume,
smoke, phenol and benzopyrene.
In-situ lime soil mixing will be employed in roadbed construction of all these linking roads. As
analogical investigations suggest, TSP concentration 50 m leeward of a mixing place is 0.389
mg/m3 which is not aboue the limit of standards used for the EIA. Since the length is very
short, the affected range will be limited.
Asphalt concrete mixing required for the road pavement will bring about asphalt smoke. All
of these linking roads will use central asphalt concrete mixing method. Based on analogical
data, CnHm concentration 100 m leeward of asphalt concrete mixing plant is above the
standard in some cases, but phenol and benzopyrene concentrations are at a low level.
Asphalt smoke concentration may satisfy Class I standard limit provided for in the "Pollutant
Emission Standard for Asphalt Industry" (GB491 6-85) which states that the average 8-h
concentration of asphalt smoke in the smelting and mixing process is not allowed to be more
than 150 mgiM3. Demanding a total of some 2000 t asphalt, these roads will cause limited
asphalt smoke and corresponding pollutants. Air environmental impact in this respect will not
be significant.
All these linking roads are aligned to be close to county seat or city proper. Little construction
material will be transported via rural earth path. So blown dust due,to material transportation
will not be much.
Page-1 8



All of these linking roads are very short, and Yima linking road will be expanded on the basis
of the existing earth road. The construction stage of all these roads will not be more than one
and half years. So the magnitude, range and duration of such environmental impacts as noise
and fume will only exist in limited time during the construction stage. And it is construction
workers that are to be affected in such respect, so it is very necessary to provide them with
physical protection measures.
5.1.6 Relocation and Resettlement
These linking roads involve 3 xiangs distributed in 3 counties (city) governed by Luoyang and
Sanmenxia.
5.1.6.1     Land Coverage and Relocation Work Quantity
A total of 34 ha land will be acquired for construction of these roads, including 15 ha for
Xinan linking road, 15 ha for Yima road and 4 ha for Mianchi road. Any other land to be used
will be all wasteland.
Since Xinan linking road is aligned to avoid any village, no relocation work will be required.
However, land acquisition will affect 570 people in 114 households.
Yima linking road will require relocation of 159 people in 35 households, and land acquisition
will affect 21 people from 8 households.
As for Mianchi linking road, 34 people from 8 households will have to be relocated. Also, 59
people from 1 2 households will be affected as a result of land acquisition.
A total of 5080 m2 housings will have to be relocated.
Generally, relocation work quantity is not great.
5.1.6.2     Resettlement Work Quantity
For the construction of Xinan linking road, 570 people from 1 14 households will be affected
as a result of land acquisition, 513 labor forces and 57 non-labor forces.
As for Yima linking road, a total of 184 people from 41 households will be involved, including
130 labor forces and 54 non-labor forces.
The affected population involved in Mianchi road will be 93 people from 20 households,
including 74 labor forces and 1 9 non-labor forces.
All these will have to be resettled.
5.1.6.3     Resettlement Plan
Any housings to be relocated will be compensated according to relevant policies and
provisions of the local government at various levels. Land compensation and young-crop
Page-19



compensation will be provided for any farmland to be acquired. A total of 2.4747 million RMB
compensation cost will be required, including a component of 1 .1 625 million RMB for land and
young- crop compensation, and 1.3122 million RMB for housing relocation and resettlement
compensation.
All of the 45 households involved in housing relocation (35 in Yima and 10 in Mianchi) expect
to be resettled nearby within their original villages rather than be moved out. Resettlement of
such populations will be handled by the local government.
Resettlement of the 847 people involved in land acquisition is as listed in Table 5-1.
Table 5-1  Resettlement of Affected Population
Item                         Xinan Yima Mianchi Total
To go on with part-time job after land redistribution  570   156   59    785
To be also involved in part-time job after land redistribution  23    18  41
To go to township enterprise                               5      16     21

Being close to county seat or city proper, all these people have their part-time jobs. So they
will not be greatly affected as a result of land acquisition.
The Highway Administration under Henan Provincial Communications Department as well as
counties (city) involved have established their separate leading agencies for relocation and
resettlement work. All of such agencies have been provided with full-time staff. Relocation
and resettlement work will be all completed prior to the commencement of these roads.
5.2   Environmental Impact Assessment in Operation Stage
5.2.1 Eco-environmental Impact
When these linking roads are put into service, their traffic flow will not be far from that of the
expressway. Also, mixed traffic flow will constitute a large portion of their total flow. In the
operation stage, these linking roads will not pose significant impacts on the local temperature
and illumination among other physio-ecological conditions.
These roads have low roadbed and will not be closed in the operation stage. The local people
will enjoy more direct benefits. Also, land use model both sides of the roads will be induced
to change.
With perfect slope protection works and complete drainage ditches, none of these linking
roads, when completed, will cause more water and soil loss.
When these roads are put into service, lead may cumulate in the soil on both sides of the
Page-20



roads. Based on the predicted traffic flow, such accumulation of lead up to the late operation
stage will not be more than 100 mg/kg which is far from the limit 300 mg/kg for soils with
pH value at 7.5 as recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture. Also, it will not be beyond
the world average of 2-200 mg/kg.
When put into service, these linking roads will not pose great agricultural impacts.
5.2.2 Prediction and Analysis of Traffic Noise Impact
5.2.2.1     Selection of Prediction Model
For predicting traffic noise impacts to be posed by these linking roads, the American EPA
traffic prediction model is selected. The prediction result is traffic noise L_q.
In day hours when the traffic flow is large, vehicles driving on the roads are deemed as a
disconnected linear noise source. The model is expressed as follows:
Leqi=LAim,+10O1g(Qi/V1T) +lOlg(r0or) X a+&S-13
In night hours when the traffic flow is small, vehicles on the roads are deemed as a
disconnected point noise source. The prediction model is expressed as follows:
leqj=LAL.av'11Olg(Q1/VjT) -201g(X,/r) -1O1g(z./r).+as-13
Then, the traffic noise L,q at a given prediction point is:
Leq=10lg(L 10QO.-) -AL
in which,
L,,q=traffic noise L,,, dB(A), of "i" type vehicles;
I,= equivalent traffic noise level, dB(A) at prediction point;
I     ^,,,reference maximum average energy level, dB(A), ce "i" type vehicles;
Q=traffic flow of "i" type vehicles (vehicle/h);
V,=average driving speed of 1i" type vehicles Ikm/h);
T=sampling time (h);
ro=observation distance of reference maximum average energy level (im);
r=distance from prediction point to effective lane (m);
a=factor relating to sound-absorption behavior of appurtenances on the ground
between sound destination and road;
AS =revision factor, composed of road surface and longitudinal slope components;
• L = total revision, depending on road configuration, length and noise source spectrum.
5.2.2.2     Determination of Relevant Parameters and Revision in the Model
j.    LAfma
This parameter relates to vehicle type and average speed as follows:
Page-21



small-sized vehicle  LA ,,,=59.3 +0.23V
middle-sized vehicle LN,,,,,,=62.6+0.32V
large-sized vehicle  Lm,. = 77.2 + 0.1 8V
in which, V=driving speed of motor vehicles.
As calculated, LAI,.. is 68.5 dB(A) in case of small-sized vehicles, 75.4 dB(AO in case of
middle-sized vehicles and 84.4 dB(A) in case of large-sized ones.
ii.    Traffic Flow
Assuming that large-sized vehicles account for 20% while middle-sized and small-sized ones
respectively account for 50% and 30% of the total tr.affic flow, the traffic flow by vehicle
type is calculated as listed in Table 5-2.

Such distance is calculated as follows:
in which,
DN=distance from prediction point to nearer lane;
DF=distance from prediction point to farther lane.

iv.   Revision &S
Revision &S is composed of two components, one is revision due to the longitudinal slope and
the other is revision due to the road surface, with the former component calculated as
follows:
large-sized vehicle   AS-98*8
middle-sized vehicle &S  73e8
small-sized vehicle AS=50*8
On the basis of the design maximtim longitudinal slope, longitudinal slope revision is calculated
as listed in Table 5-3.
Tablk 5-3 Longitudinal Slope Revision
unit: dB(A)

Yima Linking Road       +5                + 3.6               + 2.5
Mianchi Linking Road    +-3               +2                  1.5
All of these linking roads will be paved with asphalt concrete. With a low coarseness, the
revision due to road surface is considered at zero.
v.    Total Revision aL
The total revision AL is composed of 3 components respectively due to road bend or finite
length, air absorption and road configuration.
For the purpose of traffic noise prediction, the roads are regarded as a linear source with finite
length. The revision component due to road bending or finite-length section is considered at
zero.
As measured, air absorption is significant in case of high-frequency sound above 2000 Hz.
However, spectrum analysis suggests that traffic noise is middle and low-frequency sound
ranging from 1 25 to 1000 Hz. The effect of air absorption is so insignificant that it may be
neglected. That is to say such revision may be considered at zero.
Since the roadbed of these linking roads is relatively low, there is no seeable shadow or
insonified zone. The revision component due to road configuration may be neglected.
5.2.2.3     Predicted Traffic Noise
Equivalent traffic noise levels 200 m from these roads are predicted as listed in Tables 5-4,
5-5 and 5.6. Table 5-7 includes the predicted traffic noise levels at the sensitive sites.
Page-23



5.2.2.4     Traffic Noise Impact Assessment
Table 5-8 includes standards used to assess the environmental noise at sensitive sites along
these roads.
Table 5-9 gives the above-standard values which are based on comparison of the resutts
included in Table 5-7 and the standards stated in Table 5-8.
i.    Xinan Linking Road
All the sensitive sites along this linking road are 200 m away from the road centerline, so the
traffic noise level at day time will only exceed the standard a little in the in the initial phaso.
At the average traffic volume in day time, it will not exceed the standard although it exceeds
the standard by 1 dBMA) at the peak traffic volume. At night time, It will exceed the standard
by 5.7 dB(A).
In the middle operation phase, the traffic noise level will exceed the standard by 4.5 dB(A) at
the peak traffic volume and by 1.5 dB(A) at average traffic volume in day time. In night time,
it will be 9.3 dBMAI above the standard.
The noise level in the late operation phase will exceed the standard to a great extent,
especially at night time when the excess will be 11 dB(A).
ii.    Yima Linking Road
Out of the 3 sensitive sites along this linking road, Rugeta will not be exposed to any excess
traffic noise at day time during all operation phases. At night time, however, the maximum
excess may be as high as 7.0 dB(AI above the standard in the late operation phase.
Such excess at Dongcun and Xiarugou will not be much at day time although it will be
relatively significant at night time. By the late operation phase, the traffic noise L. at night
time will exceed the standard separately by 9.9 and 7.7.
iii.   Mianchi Linking Road
This linking road will pass through Maling Village which will not be subject to high traffic noise
excess at day time up to the late operation phase. At night time, however, the excess will be
so high that the traffic noise L,< in initial, middle and late operation phases will exceed the
standard by 10 dB(A), with a maximum of 14.3 dB(A).
iv.   General Evaluation
None of the sensitive sites along these roads witl be subject to significant traffic noise impacts
at day time. However, such impacts at night time will be relatively significant such that
excess will happen in all operation phases. As predicted, the maximum excess of traffic noise
L,, at night time will be still less than 15 dB(A).
Table 5-10 gives the superimposed results of the traffic noise L. and present levels at all of
the sensitive sites. Since the present environmental noise levels are not high at these sensitive
sites, the excess values, when superimposed, do not greatly differ from thoLse as listed in
Table 5-9.

5.2.3       Prediction and Analysis of Air Environmental Impact
5.2.3.1     Polluted Meteorological Condition
Since these roads are all adjacent to county seat or city proper, ground observation data
obtained from Xinan, Yima and Mianchi meteorological stations are used to analyze the
polluted meteorological conditions of corresponding linking roads. These meteorological data
were collected over the past 5 years, i.e. 1989 to 1993. o n
i.    Conventional Meteorological Element Value
Based on the meteorological statistics provided by Xinan, Yima and Mianchi, the local annual
mean temperature ranges from 12.4°C to 14.1 °C, with annual mean air pressure of 955-987
hpa, precipitation of 631-670 mm and relative humidity of 66%. As annual evaporation is
larger than precipitation, these 3 counties (city) are comparatively dry.
ii.    Ground Wind Direction' and Speed
In Xinan County, W is the predominant wind with a frequency about 14% while WNW, with
a frequency about 20%, predominates in Yima and Mianchi.
The annual average wind speed is at 2.9-3.1 m/s, with a maximum being 20 m/s. In the year,
wind speed in the winter and spring is higher than that in the summer and autumn.
iii.   Air Stability
According to the meteorological data over the past 5 years, air stability is classified by
Passiquil method which takes the net input of ground long-wave radiation as air-stability
determining factor which is then revised with ground wind speed. Air stability is classified,
in this report, into unstable, middle and stable categories. As the statistics suggest, the sum
of stable and middle frequency is over 70% while the rest 30% is contributed by unstable
frequency. This implies that the near-earth air is of general air diffusivity and that it is not easy
for the near-earth air pollutants to diffuse in a rapid way.
iv   Inverse
Among different types of inverse, it is the bottom-layer inverse that affects diffusion of
pollutants contained in exhaust discharged from vehicles. Based on the local measured data,
such inverse generally begins in 17:00-20:00 hours and then the top height builds up to reach
its climax at 2:004:00 in next morning. As the sun rises, it rapidly disappears as ground
temperature rises. The measured data also indicates that the duration, top height and intensity
of such inverse in the winter are higher than those in the summer. All these counties (city) are
susceptible to bottom-layer inverse of a high frequency. The minimum top height is generally
30-50 m while the maximum may be as high as 300 m. The average strength of such inverse
is about 1.50C/100 m.
The existence of bottom-layer inverse is unfavorable to diffusion of vehicle exhaust. However,
most of such inverse occurs in night hours when a small discharge of exhaust results from
low traffic flow. Therefore, no significant air impacts will' be brought about by exhaust of
vehicles at presence of bottom-layer inverse.

5.2.3.2     Prediction Factor and Source Intensity
In line vvith typical pollutants contained in vehicle exhaust, CO and NO, are herein selected
for predicting air environmental impacts.
The linking roads are regarded as an infinite linear source, with the source intensity calculated
as follows:

S,=traffic flow of "j" type vehicle (vehicle/s);
K1j=discharge of "i" type pollutant by unit "j" type vehicle;
B,i=revision of "i" type pollutant by "j' type vehicle.

5.2.3.6     Prediction Result and Analysis
Predicted air environmental impacts to be posed by these roads are as stated in Tables 5-14
through 5-19.
Air environmental impact assessment is carried out in compliance with Class 2 standards of
the "Air Environmental Quality Standard" (GB3095-82).
i.    Xinan Linking Road
Upto the late operation period (2018), the maximum instantaneous ground CO concentration
will be only 0.075 mg/iM3 which is not more than 1 % of the EIA standard. Such concentration
beyond 100 m leeward of the road will be less than 0.010 mgIM3 which is less than 0.1%
of the EIA standard.
In the same period, the maximum instantaneous ground NO. concentration will be probably
0.004 mg/rn3 which is less than 3% of the EIA standard. At 60 m leeward of the road, such.
concentration will be lower than 0.001 mg/m3. This means that NO, contained in vehicle
exhaust will almost pose no effect beyond 60 m leeward of the road.
ii.   Yima Linking Road
In the early, middle and late operation periods, the maximum instantaneous ground CO
concentration will be separately 0.021, 0.042 and 0.055 m/lm3 which are all less than 1 %
of the EIA standard. Beyond 60 m leeward of the road, instantaneous ground concentration
Page-31



of NO. will be practically under 0.010 mg/mr which only accounts for a very small portion of
the standard.
Upto the late operation period, the maximum instantaneous ground concentration of NO. will
be no more than 0.003 mg/m3 which is 2% of the EIA standard. At 40 m leeward of the road,
such concentration will be all under 0.001 mg/rn3.
iii.   Mianchi Linking Road
By the late operation period, the instantaneous ground concentration of CO will have a
maximum of 0.059 mg/m3 which is still less than 1 % of the EIA standard. At 80 m leeward
of the road, such concentration will be all less than 0.01 mg/m3.
In the same period, the maximum instantaneous ground concentration of NO. will reach 0.003
mg/m3 which is 2% of the standard. At 60 m leeward of the road, such concentration will be
lower than 0.001 mg/m3.
iv.   General Evaluation
Exhaust impacts at leeward of these roads will be insignificant. Even in the late operation
stage, the instantaneous ground concentration of CO and NO. will be still under and will
account for a small portion of the EIA standard. Exhaust impacts beyond 80 m leeward of the
roads will be almost zero.
Since pollutant concentrations at leeward of the roads are predicted to be at a low level, the
local air environmental quality will not be significantly changed as a consequence of the road
construction.
Also, the instantaneous ground concentrations of pollutants at leeward of these roads will not
greatly vary as times passes by and traffic flow goes up.
It is herein deemed that there will be only minor air impact upon completion of these roads.
5.3   Other Environmental Impact upon Completion of Linking Roads
The linking roads, when completed, will lead more long-distance vehicles to the expressway
such that the due benefits of this expressway will be brought to full play. As a result, the
transportation turnover will be accelerated to generate enormous economic benefits. People
in the local areas involved in the linking roads will also directly benefit therefrom.
Providing easy and fast lnking to the expressway, these linking roads will be of significance
to promoting the local economic development.
Since these low-roadbed roads will not be closed, farming activities and normal association
of the local residents will not be interrupted. However, more traffic accidents may be
encountered.
None of these linking roads will go across any large river. All and any small rivers and streams
will be bridged with provided with culverts. As a result, creation of these roads will not
interrupt the normal operation of irrigation facilities. Designed to withstand floods once in 100
years, these bridges and culverts will not affect the flood discharge of rivers and streams.

6.          Environmental Protection Measures, Environmental Management[
Monitoring Programs
6.1         Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures
6.1.1       Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures in Design Phase
The following mitigation measures have been incorporated into the project design:
6.1.1.1     Every effort will be made to complete earth works within the property line of
the roads such that minimum farmiand will be destroyed beyond such line.
6.1.1.2     All and any streams and canals to be crossed by these roads will be provided
with bridges and culverts designed lo withstand floods once in 100 years such that the
existing functions and discharge capacity will not be adversely affected.
6.1.1.3     Archeological agencies have explored the areas involved in these roads for
possible cultural relics in line with the alignment provided by the project design. It is proven
that there is no cultural relics involved in construction of these roads.
6.1i.1.4    Detailed resettlement action plans and well-established resettlement agencies
are available such that all relocation and resettlement work will be completed prior to the
commencement of these roads.
6.1.1.5     All of these roads are provided with complete slope protection design schemes
and side ditches will be provided to catch road surface run-off. Shoulders of the roads will be
planted with shrubs while arbor is planted beyond the side ditches. The afforestation design
has considered aesthetic effect.
6.1.1.6    In the operation stage, traffic noise will be the principal environmental impact.
So mitigating/offsetting measures are developed to mainly deal with such impact.
6.1.1.7     Perfect afforestation efforts will proceed with the main works.
6.1.1.8     Green belts with a width not less than 10 m will be provided for the village side
immediately facing any of the roads.
6.1.2       Environmental Impact Mitigation Measures for Construction Stage
6.1.2.1     At any road section far from villages, lime soil will be in-situ mixed. At any
section close to villages (at a distance less than 200 m), lime soil mixing time will be properly
arranged in light of ground wind direction in the due course such that blown dust impacts on
the local residents will be minimized. Workers to be engaged in such activities will be provided
with necessary protection devices such as gauge masks and goggles.
Water spray will be undertaken as appropriate. Stockpiles and hauling trucks will be covered
to minimize dust. An adequate hauling plan will be developed.
Page-39



6.1.2.2     Central mixing of asphalt concrete will be carried out at least 200 m leeward
of any village.
6.1.2.3     Land use for temporary purposes will be minimized such that use of farmland
beyond the property line will be minimized as far as possible. Soil works will be longitudinally
allocated. Any unavailability of soil will be gained from waste highland.
6.1.2.4     To avoid possible disturbance to the normal livelihood of the local residents as
a result of construction noise, work will suspend from 22:00 to 8:00 in the next morning.
6.1.2.5     Road sections under construction will be watered at least twice a day
(especially in the summerl to reduce blown dust, once in the morning and once in the
afternoon.
6.1.2.6     Any solid and liquid waste stemming from construction workers' camps will be
centrally treated before discharged.
6.1.2.7     Afforestation efforts shall proceed together with the main works.
6.1.2.8     All of the aforesaid environmental measures should be incorporated into the
project tender documents such that all contractors will be aware of and implement, in deed,
such measures.
6.1.3       Envirconmental Impact Mitigation Measures for Operation Stage
6.1.3.1     Fences on the side facing any of these roads will be raised and double-windows
will be provided for the first-row of housings on such side.
6.1.3.2     New hospital, school and residential site among other noise-sensitive points
shall not be located within 200 m off the roadside.
6.1.3.3     Enhanced efforts will be made for traffic management and public awareness of
traffic safety so as to reduce traffic accidents.
6.1.3.4     Separating measures will be taken, as necessary, to take motorway apart from
bicycle lane such that traffic accidents as a result of mixed traffic will be reduced.
6.1.3.5     Enhanced management and check will be exercised on vehicles and drivers to
get rid of driving in drunkness among other defaults.
6.1.3.6     Any vehicle transporting hazardous materials will be required to obtain
permissions from public security, communications and fire departments.
6.1.3.7     Coal transportation must be covered and any overloading shall be forbidden.

6.2   Environmental Management Program
6.2.1 Each of the involved counties (city) has established its own project office staffed with
a full-time environmental inspector.
6.2.2 Any contractor to be engaged in construction of these roads will provide a part-time
environmental worker who will assist the full-time environmental inspectors in fulfilling
environmental responsibilities.
6.2.3 Upon completion of the roads, environmental responsibilities will be handed over to
environmental protection sections under the local communications agencies. Each of such
environmental sections will be provided with 1-2 full-time staff who will be responsible for
environmental management during the operation stage of their separate road but also such
environmental management of any other graded highways within their boundaries.
6.3   Environmental Monitoring Program
6.3.1 The local environmental monitoring stations will be entrusted with the environmental
monitoring activities in both construction and operation stages of these roads.
6.3.2 The environmental monitoring program for both construction and operation stages is
as stated in Tables 2 and 3 attached hereto.
6.3.3 Environmental monitoring data to be obtained in the construction stage will be
submitted to relevant project offices as may be concerned. In the operation stage, such data
in the operation stage will be submitted to environmental protection sections under the local
communications agencies. In addition, such data to be obtained in construction and operation
stages will have to be provided for the relevant local environmental protection agencies as
may be concerned.
6.4   Personnel Training Program
6.4.1 Training services for the full-time environmental staff of project offices will be provided
by the Highway Administration under Henan Provincial Communications Department. When
these roads are completed, such full-time staff will be incorporated into the environmental
protection section of corresponding communications agencies.
6.4.2 Environmental monitoring staff of the county (city) environmental monitoring stations
to be responsible for monitoring activities in both construction and operation stages will be
separately trained by Luoyang and Sanmenxia Environmental Monitoring Stations. Nobody will
be allowed to be engaged in such monitoring activities unless he is trained to be competent
for his duty. This will ensure correct and reliable monitoring data.

7. Public Participation
In the environmental situation monitoring process, villagers involved in the construction of
these roads were consulted and interviewed. The villages involved in such consultation are
Jiangzhuang, Heishangou, Getahou, Shimiao and Baiqiang along Xinan linking road, Dongcun,
Xiarugou and Rugeta adjacent to Yima linking road, as well as Maling on Mianchi linking road.
In this process, general description of the project was also presented to the villagers while
their opinions and suggestions toward the road construction were heard.
As investigated, the local villagers expressed more enthusiasm for construction of these
linking roads as compared with the expressway. In their opinion, they would enjoy more direct
benefits fromn these linking roads which, upon completion, would provide easier linking to the
county seat or city proper such that they would do much good to livelihood and amenity
improvement. With regard to land acquisition, the local viltagers said that they would be
willing to comply with the resettlement plan provided seasonal compensation would be made
available. Also, they suggested that such compensation be open to the public such that they
would be able to know what's what. Most of the villagers show their willingness to take part
in the road construction in order to partly get more income and partly contribute to the road
construction.
In the investigation process, non-government organizations such as people's representative
congress and political consultative conference were also specially interviewed. While agreeing
to the alignment as determined in the project design, these agencies thought the construction
of these linking roads would be beneficial to the local economic development. They also
promised to make contributions to the road creation by using their influence.
8.   Conclusion
i.    With a low vegetation coverage, the local area is susceptible to droughts which are the
major ecological restraint. There is no rare and endangered species along these
alignments.
ii.   Since there are no underlying cultural relics, the project will not cause any
archeological impacts.
iii.   These linking roads are all aligned in quiet areas where the equivalent noise level at day
and night hours are not above the EIA standard.
As a common air pollutant in the project area, TSP is above the standard in some
cases. Along Yima linking road, the concentration of CO is relatively high and is above
the standard in some cases. But the present NO, concentration is very low in all areas
involved in these 3 roads.
iv.   Xinan linking road does not involve any relocation or resettlement work. Such work
quantity required for the rest two roads is not much. All relocation and resettlement
work will be completed before the project proceeds.

v.    Traffic noise will turn a major environmental problem in the operation stage. But other
impacts will not be significant.
Although the sensitive sites will be subject to relatively significant traffic noise impacts
at night hours, the noise L,, will not exceed the standard by more than 15 db(A).
vi.   Both of the local residents and local agencies accept the idea of building these roads.
The affected villagers say they will accept the prepared resettlement plan provided
they will be provided with proper compensations.
vii.   With the environmental measures included herein implemented in construction and
operation stages, adverse environmental impacts will be minimized.
viii. Environmentally, these linking roads are properly aligned and are therefore feasible.
