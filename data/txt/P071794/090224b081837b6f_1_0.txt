                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to close on December 31, 2012 meeting its main objective of increasing access to electricity in rural areas of Bangladesh. Together with support from IDA and
                         other development partners, Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and its partner organizations have installed more than 1.7 million SHS in remote rural areas of
                         Bangladesh. The World Bank is committed to continue its support to the off-grid rural electrification program of Bangladesh. The World Bank Board has already approved the Rural
                         Electrification and Renewable Energy Development II (RERED II) project to continue its support to the solar home systems and other renewable energy options for increasing access
                         to electricity in remote rural areas of Bangladesh. The new project would also support the second phase of the Efficient Lighting Initiatives of Bangladesh (ELIB), which will finance
                         deployment of Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in exchange for incandescent lamps.

                         Government has taken a number of steps to strengthen the REB and the rural cooperatives (PBSs) to meet the challenges of universal access by the year 2021. The Bank continues
                         to remain committed to support the government in its efforts to address the challenges in the rural electrification sector of Bangladesh.
