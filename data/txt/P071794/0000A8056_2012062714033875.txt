                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been making satisfactory progress in meeting its main development objective of increasing access to electricity in rural areas of Bangladesh. Together with support
                         from IDA and other development partners, Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and its partner organizations have installed more than 1.3 million SHS in remote
                         rural areas of Bangladesh. Considering the funding needs, IDA Board has approved a second additional financing of US$172 million for supporting another 630,000 systems, which is
                         expected to be met by the project closing in December 2012.

                         The project is also supporting the Government's Efficient Lighting Initiatives for Bangladesh (ELIB) program under which about 10 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) were
                         distributed in exchange of incandescent bulbs. There have been concerns about the quality of the CFLs distributed. The implementing agency Rural Electrification Board (REB) has
                         claimed replacement of poor quality bulbs from the supplier. A second phase procurement could not be concluded due to issues related to bidders' submission of performance
                         guarantees. The second phase is expected to be financed from a proposed new project currently under preparation.

                         Government has taken a number of steps to strengthen the REB and the rural cooperatives (PBSs) to meet the challenges of universal access by the year 2021. The Bank continues
                         to remain committed to support the government in its efforts to address the challenges in the rural electrification sector of Bangladesh.
