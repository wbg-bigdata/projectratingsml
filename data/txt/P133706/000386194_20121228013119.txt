                       CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
                   THE REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF MYANMAR
                 REENGAGEMENT AND REFORM SUPPORT CREDIT
Borrower               Republic of the Union of Myanmar
Implementing           Ministry of Finance and Revenue
Agency
Financing Data         IDA Credit of SDR 287.75 Million (US$440 Million equivalent)
                       The credit has a final maturity of 40 years including a grace period of
                       ten years.

Operation Type      Development Policy Operation
Main Policy Areas   The main policy areas supported are: (a) strengthening macroeconomic
                    stability through development of the financial system, improving
                    exchange rate policy, and instituting fiscal discipline; (b) enhancing
                    transparency, accountability, and external oversight in the management
                    of public finances, improving revenue management through tax policy
                    and administration and improving budget planning and preparation, and
                    (c) improving the climate for investment by increasing access to finance;
                    establishing a financial sector infrastructure to facilitate business
                    transactions; reducing barriers to entry and the cost of starting and
                    doing business; and removing barriers to trade.
Key Outcomes        The following outcomes are expected as a result of the proposed
                    operation:
                     An exchange rate regime that is more supportive of private sector
                         development
                     Increase in public expenditures on pro-poor sectors due to more
                         inclusive and transparent budgeting
                     Expansion in bank credit to unbanked men and women
                     Increase in foreign direct investment
                     Increase in the volume of international trade
                     Full clearance of arrears to IDA
Program development The DPO’s development objectives are two-fold (i) to support
Objective(s) and    Myanmar’s critical reforms for strengthening macroeconomic stability,
Contribution to the improving public financial management, and improving the investment
ISN                 climate, which will in turn help grow the economy, create jobs, and
                    reduce poverty; and (ii) to facilitate the clearance of Myanmar’s arrears
                    to IDA, which is required in order to restore normal relations between
                    Myanmar and the World Bank.

                       The proposed Myanmar Reengagement and Reform Support Credit
                       contributes to all the areas of strategic focus under the Interim Strategy
                       Note. First, the operation also contributes to the ISN pillar on
                       transforming institutions since it supports critical policy and institutional
                       reforms for attaining macroeconomic stability, improving public

                                                i
                 financial management, and improving the investment climate. Second,
                 the DPO will support the ISN pillar on building confidence by sending a
                 strong signal of the World Bank’s support for the reforms. Finally, the
                 DPO contributes to the ISN pillar on preparing the way for the
                 resumption of a full country program since the proceeds will be used to
                 support Myanmar's foreign exchange needs, including those associated
                 with IDA arrears clearance. The Bank’s full country program can only
                 resume after arrears are cleared.
Risks and Risk   Macroeconomic risk: There is a risk that a suboptimal sequence of
Mitigation       reforms could lead to deterioration in the macroeconomic framework due to
                 the significant changes that are being implemented in a context of limited
                 capacity. For example, a modern monetary policy framework is still
                 being designed as is the treasury function. Relatedly, increased access
                 to commercial and concessional borrowing increases the risk of debt
                 distress. Further, the Government has adopted a policy of granting
                 greater operational autonomy to SEEs which were previously managed
                 in the same way as other Government ministries and departments, by
                 being funded through the budget. Given that the financial management
                 capacity of these entities is not known, there is risk that they could be a
                 source of contingent liabilities. Finally, as the economy opens up, a
                 surge in imports poses a risk to the country’s macroeconomic program
                 by putting pressure on foreign reserves. To mitigate these risks, the IMF
                 is supporting the authorities through a Staff Monitored Program (SMP).
                 Further, the Bank is also working with the IMF and other donors in
                 providing the required TA for establishing a robust framework for
                 macroeconomic management.

                 Political risk: First, although a number of ceasefire agreements have
                 been signed with armed rebel groups, political settlements are yet to be
                 attained. Furthermore, a ceasefire agreement is yet to be reached with
                 one of the armed groups, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO).
                 Therefore, a return to wide-scale conflict could destabilize the existing
                 political environment. Second, reforms are still in their early days.
                 Myanmar’s future depends on the nature of compromises reached between
                 multiple stakeholders with often incompatible interests. There is a risk of a
                 backlash especially if some well-intentioned reforms end up having
                 negative consequences in the short-term. The 2015 elections are shaping up
                 to be an important turning point for the longer term sustainability of the
                 reforms. To mitigate these risks, the World Bank and other donors will be
                 working to support various initiatives in Government for consolidating
                 peace and the reform process, including through support to the planned
                 Peace Center, supporting community based projects that will generate quick
                 tangible dividends to communities, and support to institution building so
                 that reforms transcend personalities.

               Implementation capacity risk:            Following a long period of
               underinvestment in public institutions, education and the civil service,
               there is a concern that institutional capacity will be a binding constraint
               in implementing the reforms and improving service delivery so that the
               benefits of reforms are distributed widely. While donor support is a
               mitigating mechanism for the lack of institutional capacity, there is an
               additional risk that aid will not be coordinated and will thus not have the
               desired impact. These risks can be mitigated by donors actively seeking
               to scale up support to address the capacity issues, while the Government
               takes the lead in actively managing donor support. It will be important
               that non-traditional donors are also brought into the process. The
               Government has recognized the importance of donor coordination and
               set up a high level Foreign Aid Management Coordination Committee to
               manage the coordination of aid.

                                  IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT

                     THE REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF MYANMAR
                   REENGAGEMENT AND REFORM SUPPORTCREDIT

                                     I.    INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Support Credit
(RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for SDR287.75 (US$440 million
equivalent). It will be a standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed at
supporting the full normalization of relations between Myanmar and the World Bank as well as
the Government’s efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy reforms in the
implementation of its medium-term development strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar
is eligible for exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar is projected to be at a
low risk of debt distress after arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit terms,
per the stipulations of the credit allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period
(FY12-FY14).

2.      In less than two years, a reformist administration has ushered Myanmar on an
unprecedented path of political and economic reforms. After decades of military rule and
ethnic conflict, a civilian administration was sworn in on March 30th, 2011 following elections
that were held in December 2010. The new Government immediately embarked on a range of
political and economic reforms aimed at attaining national reconciliation, good governance, and
economic development. Some of the key political reforms have included the re-admission of the
country’s opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party into the country’s mainstream
politics, the signing of ceasefire agreements with the majority of ethnic armed groups some of
which have waged war with the Government for the past six decades, large-scale releases of
political prisoners and re-admittance into the country of former critics of the Government, and
increased freedom of expression. Key economic reforms include discussion of the budget in
Parliament for the first time and publication of the budget, adoption of a more liberal exchange
rate policy, relaxation of trade restrictions, rationalization of tax rates, and fiscal decentralization.

3.      Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge will be to ensure that
these reforms translate into improved living standards for the majority of the population,
and that gains registered are sustained. Following years of political and economic repression,
Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in the East Asian region. The challenge for the
Government is to ensure that the reforms being implemented translate into positive and tangible
benefits for the majority of the Myanmar people. Similarly, it will be critical that the current
reform momentum transcends individual personalities and that any gains are sustained.

4.     In order to deal with these challenges, the Government is seeking to undertake
further reforms and in this endeavor, is seeking the support of the international
community. There is recognition by Government that significant policy and structural
bottlenecks remain in the economy that would prevent the country from realizing its potential,
and that more and far reaching reforms will therefore be necessary. It is for this reason that in
June 2012, the President announced a second wave of reforms which he said were aimed at

                                                   1
achieving higher rates of growth that would be necessary if to achieve a more significant
reduction in poverty.

5.     Considering the Government’s commitment, and the pace and scale of the reform
process, a window of opportunity exists for the international community to help ensure that
the reforms succeed and are sustained. The authorities believe that development partners
could contribute significantly to meeting the country’s financing needs and providing global
knowledge and policy advice that Myanmar critically needs as it continues with its reform
agenda. After being closed to the outside world for a long time, the Government is keen to learn
from the experiences of other countries that have gone through transitions, and therefore see
development partners as key to facilitating that knowledge transfer and peer learning process.
Further, the increased presence of donors will have a positive signaling effect on potential
investors, particularly to sectors outside natural resources.

6.     It is against this background that the proposed development policy lending support
is being extended. The support is consistent with the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
Myanmar and institutional guidelines on the clearance of arrears. While risks exist, in Staff’s
assessment, they are outweighed by the benefits, and costs of inaction.

7.      The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction.
Section II discusses the country context which gives an overview of Myanmar focusing on the
political and economic context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook, and
debt sustainability. Section III presents the Myanmar Government’s development program;
section IV discusses how the Bank is supporting the government’s program, while section V
describes the proposed DPO. Section VI outlines implementation issues, including risks and
mitigating measures.

                      II.     THE COUNTRY AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT1

8.      Myanmar is one of the largest countries in South East Asia, both in terms of land
size and population. At 676,578 km2, it is the largest in mainland South East Asia, larger than
Thailand (513, 120 km2) and second only to Indonesia (1,904,569 km2) in the ASEAN region..
The last population census was conducted in 1983, but it is estimated that there may now be
between 48-60 million people, which would put Myanmar around 5th position in the region after
Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand. It shares borders with India, Bangladesh,
China, Laos and Thailand. Myanmar is an ethnically diverse country. It is believed that there are
at least 135 distinct ethnic groups and 108 different ethno-linguistic groups in Myanmar.
Administratively, the country is divided into seven states and seven regions which represent the
tier below the Union (Central) Government.

  The main sources of data and information under this section are various Government of Myanmar data sources
including the data released on the website of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development by the
Central Statistics Organization, various IMF and World Bank Reports, the UNDP/SIDA funded Integrated
Household Living Conditions Survey Report (2009-2010), and other published academic reports.

                                                       2
A. Political context

9.      Myanmar is leaving behind decades of isolation, fragility, and conflict, which began
with armed insurgencies in the border areas soon after independence that eventually provided the
justification for an army coup by General Ne Win in 1962, who pursued an isolationist “Burmese
path to socialism? that included a nationalization of the economy and a severing of linkages with
the outside world. While some of the country’s self-imposed isolation ended following Ne
Win’s resignation in 1988, the government’s suppression of the political opposition at that time
made it the target of a broad range of international sanctions. Despite intermittent attempts to
forge peace with armed ethnic groups (notably a series of ceasefires in the late 1980s and early
1990s) and tentative efforts at economic reform and political opening (including Myanmar’s
accession to ASEAN in 1997 and a limited opening towards foreign investment), the country’s
potential has been held back by poor governance and sanctions.

10.     However, since the new Government came to power, it has undertaken far reaching
steps towards improving the political environment. In particular, significant steps have been
taken towards reconciliation with people having different political views. For example, there has
been a phased release of political prisoners, including the largest such release in Asia’s history
when a total of 651 prisoners were freed at once. Further, exiled critics of the Government have
been encouraged to return home and are being welcomed. The Government also reached out to
the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi which resulted in her party being re-registered as a legal
political party. Following parliamentary by-elections on 1 April 2012, the NLD became the
largest opposition party in parliament, with Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 other NLD delegates
taking their parliamentary seats in May 2012. The Government has also embarked on an
important process of reconciliation with ethnic minorities, reaching ceasefires with several armed
groups and renewing ceasefires that had come under strain. Finally, civil and political freedoms
have also significantly improved. After enacting the necessary laws, formation of trade unions
and public gatherings are now allowed for the first time in 20 years. There is increased freedom
of expression and the Government has been holding workshops to consult stakeholders,
especially the media, on a new media law that is being drafted.

11.     As a result of the improved political situation, the international community has been
reengaging. In recognition of these developments, the international community has been taking
steps in the direction of normalizing relations with Myanmar. For example, there has been a
number of high profile visits to Myanmar by western leaders; most western Governments have
removed or suspended the economic and financial sanctions, including travel bans imposed on
most politicians, and are re-establishing diplomatic relations with the country; and donors are
taking steps towards re-engagement. For instance, Japan has announced a plan for resolving
Myanmar’s arrears to it which consists of a phased cancellation of two-thirds of the arrears and a
re-scheduling of the balance that will pave the way for the resumption of normal lending. Other
development partners, including the World Bank, have also started discussing with the
Government authorities modalities of re-engagement. Further, the ASEAN has accepted
Myanmar’s bid to take up the chairmanship of the association in 2014.




                                                3
12.     Remaining political challenges include reaching political settlements with ethnic
groups that have signed ceasefire agreements and resolving the plight of the Rohingyas in
the western state of Rakhine. Myanmar has 11 major armed ethnic groups spread across seven
states, and many smaller groups and militias. Ceasefires have been agreed or renewed with 10
out of the 11 groups. However, an agreement with the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO)
has not yet been reached. Further, the negotiations will now need to focus on coming up with
permanent political settlements with the groups. In order to improve the chances of finding long
lasting peace, the Government is planning to establish a Peace Center whose role will be to
improve the coordination of the peace process between government, international organizations,
civil society, NGOs, and donors. An ongoing challenge relates to the conflict in the North
Western state of Rakhine involving the Rohingyas.

13.    Myanmar is governed as a presidential republic with a bicameral legislature
consisting of the 440-seat People's Assembly (lower house) and the 224-seat National
Assembly (upper house). However, 25 percent of the seats in Parliament are still reserved for
the military. The current constitution is the third since it gained independence from Britain in
1948 and was published in September 2008 after it was adopted through a referendum in May
2008. As mentioned earlier, the current head of state was inaugurated on March 30th, 2011, after
winning the December 2010 general elections.

B. Economic context

14.      Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the South East Asian region2. The
country’s GDP is approximately US$50 billion, but with population figures ranging between 48
million and 60 million, per capita income is estimated to be in the range of $800 - $1,000. A
nationwide integrated household living conditions survey conducted by UNDP, UNICEF, and
Sida in 2009-2010 found that 26 percent of the population was living below the poverty line
which was estimated at USD1 dollar a day. However, caution is urged in the interpretation of data,
since the surveys did not include populations in parts of the border areas, potentially masking large
pockets of poverty and skewing final results. The country’s level of infrastructure development is
still very low. About 75 percent of the population has no access to electricity and power outages
are common throughout the country. Almost half of the roads are not passable during the
monsoon rainy season while railways are old and rudimentary, with few repairs since their
construction in the late 19th century. Telecommunications and internet access is also very limited.
Most social indicators are also poor. For example, 32 percent of children under five suffer from
malnutrition, the highest in the East Asia region. Myanmar’s government has been spending the
least percentage of its GDP on health care of any country in the world.

15.    Gender disaggregated data are still scanty but the little available present a picture
of women being poorer and more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in
Myanmar. The constitution provides for equal treatment and opportunity of citizens irrespective
of race, birth, religion, official position, status, culture, sex and wealth in the areas of public
2
  A key limitation in understanding the development challenges in Myanmar is the lack of accurate and consistent
data, especially at the national level. Confounding statistics give at best a partial picture of the country, especially
given the diversity across the country. The last national census took place in 1983, and population figures used
today range from 48 to 61 million, with an estimated 3 million people living abroad. Similarly, there are divergent
data on indicators from economic growth and national income to health and education outcomes.

                                                            4
employment, occupation, trade, business, technical know-how and vocation, exploration of art,
science, and technology. It contains further specific provisions for protecting the rights of
women. Myanmar is also a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. However, in
practice, inequalities still exist between men and women. For example, women's participation in
the labor market is low at 63.1 percent compared to 85.1 percent for men; women make up only 4
percent of members in parliament. Education data from a 2010 national household survey paints a
very positive picture of the situation in Myanmar but has been widely criticized on grounds that
it did not cover many conflict areas. Myanmar’s maternal mortality rate in Myanmar is estimated
at 360-380 per 100,000 births which is the highest in the region.

16.      Myanmar has lagged some of its richer neighbors, because of its checkered political
history, bad economic policies, and its isolation from the international community. At
independence, it was one of the wealthiest countries in South-East Asia and used to be the
world's largest exporter of rice. However, as previous regimes pursued more centralist policies,
its economy started deteriorating while the other countries in the region flourished. For example,
it is estimated that at some point, 15,000 firms and businesses were nationalized. There was also
pervasive Government interference in the economy including setting prices of basic
commodities, having multiple exchange rates, imposing restrictions on imports and exports,
controlling foreign and local investments, and interfering in the banking and financial systems.
Because of the isolationist policies, outside information was obstructed through controlled
imports of news and a state-dominated press. Therefore Myanmar did not benefit from any cross-
fertilization of knowledge and transfer of technology that played a prominent role in the
development of the East Asian tiger economies. Even revenues from natural resources such as oil
faltered (until foreign investors were invited to sign natural gas concessions) as production limits
were limited to the level of technology available to the state, which did not want onshore foreign
intervention at that time. Rural households also found it difficult to invest significantly in
agriculture for a number of reasons, including lack of secure legal title to their land holdings and
lack of access to formal sources of finance.

17.     Although the gas sector is the highest contributor to foreign reserves and fiscal
revenues, agriculture is still the dominant sector in terms of contribution to national output
and people’s livelihoods. The country has large natural gas reserves, with current production
accounting for 33 percent of export revenues and 75 percent of fiscal revenues. The contribution
of the gas sector will likely increase by 2014. Contracts were signed in July 2010 for two other
gas fields (Shwe and Zawtika), with reserves that will almost double existing capacity and
potential to increase annual production by about 60 percent in 2014/2015. However, agriculture
is currently still the largest contributor to national output and to people’s livelihoods. It accounts
for 43 percent of GDP, generates about 54 percent of employment, and provides livelihoods to
more that 70 percent of the population. The major agricultural product is rice which covers about
60 percent of the country's total cultivated land area and accounts for 97 percent of total food
grain production by weight. Other prominent agriculture products are pulses, forestry products,
fisheries, and livestock. Apart from gas and agriculture products, Myanmar is also a major
exporter of gems. Manufacturing is still in its infancy, and is largely limited to agro-processing.
The nascent garments and textiles industry was at one time vibrant, but was decimated by poor
policies and sanctions.

18.     Myanmar’s major trading partners are regional, with Thailand, China, Singapore
and India (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Myanmar’s trade has been limited to the region because of
international sanctions. China has been the main source of imports while Thailand has been
Myanmar’s main export destination. As mentioned above, the country’s principal export product
is natural gas. Other major exports are wood products, pulses and beans, fish, rice, clothing, jade
and gems. Its principal imports are fabrics, petroleum products and crude oil, fertilizer, plastics,
machinery, transport equipment, cement and construction materials, and food products and
edible oils.

19.     Going forward, the country’s economic opportunities lie in its strategic location
within a large regional and global export market, vast untapped natural resources, and the
improving prospects for trade, investment, and development aid as it re-engages with the
wider international community. Being close to the large export markets of China, India, and
other countries in the ASEAN region places Myanmar in an advantageous position for an export-
led transformation of its economy, particularly in areas where it has a comparative advantage
such as natural gas, agriculture products, textiles, and minerals. The market potential for
Myanmar’s products in these countries remains large. Second, there are still significant
opportunities for Myanmar to increase production and export levels in its natural resource sector.
Finally, with many Governments lifting sanctions on Myanmar and development partners re-
engaging, the country will start enjoying favorable market access opportunities in OECD
countries as well, and will have expanded opportunities for inflows of portfolio and direct
investments. Similarly, the country will also be able to benefit from financial and technical
support from development partners.




                                                  7
20.     In order to fully exploit these opportunities, ensure sustainable and responsible
extraction of natural resources, and achieve broad-based development, certain critical
challenges need to be overcome. These include weak institutions, a poor business environment,
a huge infrastructure deficit, and under-developed service sectors. After years of
underinvestment and poor policies, filling the energy gap and improving the road network is key
to attracting investors and improving service delivery. Further, development of the
telecommunications industry and the financial sector has the potential to catalyze development in
many areas. In order to build investor confidence and ensure sustainable and responsible
extraction of natural resources, maintenance of a stable macro-economy, creation of strong legal
systems, and greater transparency and accountability will be essential. Finally, the majority of
the population will be expecting these opportunities to be broadly shared. This will therefore
require undertaking policies and initiatives that seek to empower people to participate in
productive economic activities, provide social protection for the vulnerable. In addition, it will
require reforms in the public financial management system that seek to facilitate improvements
in the delivery of services.

21.     Decades of underinvestment have taken a toll on public institutions and the civil
service. The reach of government and its ability to provide services, in particular in rural areas,
remains limited. Health, education, and agricultural extension services all suffer from having
been underfunded for extended periods of time. Salaries of many civil servants – in particular at
the lower levels of the bureaucracy and those in rural areas – are often insufficient to cover living
costs, although the FY2012/13 budget provided a significant raise to civil servants. Partly as a
result of these limitations, households have relatively high out-of-pocket costs to access public
health and education services (a 2007 survey showed out of pocket expenditures accounting for
84 percent of total spending on health). A lack of funds to cover the cost of transportation has in
many cases confined agricultural extension workers to the areas they can reach easily.

22.     Corporate governance of larger companies and financial institutions is still limited
as most are closely held by families and elite groups. Patronage and state capture have been
significant features of the economy, with firms close to the government undertaking public
investment projects in return for concessions and/or access to natural resources. In addition,
accounting and auditing are weak across the board and enforcement of regulations is uneven,
including unequal treatment among state-owned enterprises (or those with close links to the
state) and private firms. Furthermore, a substantial portion of economic activity in Myanmar is
informal, with small and medium-sized enterprises accounting for over 90 percent of the
country’s enterprises.

23.     Poor regulations, a lack of enforcement, and extractive investment have also done
significant harm to Myanmar’s environment. Once considered the last frontier of biodiversity
and with a long tradition of sound forest management practices, Myanmar today is facing the
results of extensive deforestation as a result of both increased commercial logging and illegal
logging activities, particularly in border areas. This has led to soil erosion, landslides, and
decreased soil fertility, depriving many families of their traditional sources of income. Similarly,
overfishing, including by foreign vessels, is endangering the livelihoods of fishing villages.




                                                 8
24.     Myanmar has had a history of corruption reported to be widespread in various
parts of the public sector, including through offers of large infrastructure contracts to
cronies or in return for bribes. Bribery has been common at every level of Government in the
past because of weak institutions of transparency and accountability. It is believed that the
practice started with the Myanmar tradition and culture of paying respects along with gift items
but was further complicated by low salaries in the public sector. As a result, amongst other
factors highlighted earlier, corruption has also contributed significantly to Myanmar’s
underdevelopment. If not tackled, the problem could undermine Myanmar’s transition to a
market economy by increasing the actual costs and risks for potential private investors, both
domestic and foreign. Further, if not tackled, corruption could undermine the trust that the
citizens are expected to have on the Government’s overall capability to govern.

25.     With the ongoing spate of reforms, some aspects of governance have improved,
including the fight against corruption. The government has made efforts to improve
transparency, with the national budget being presented and debated in Parliament for the first
time in 2012 (leading to significant cuts in the Executive’s proposal), and subsequently published
in national newspapers. The government established a Financial Commission and undertook a
significant de-concentration of budgeting and planning functions, including a move towards
more bottom-up planning and budgeting. Myanmar also has a semi-independent Auditor
General whose purview spans the entire public sector. Restrictions on media have been lifted,
leading to greater coverage of previously sensitive topics such as corruption. Finally, to show its
commitment towards the fight against corruption, the new Government has recently submitted a
draft law on anti-corruption, which seeks to ensure that corruption is investigated and that those
who are involved in it are prosecuted.

26.    An ongoing assessment suggests that the public financial management system has
some strong features. Budget classification is consistent across various ministries and
departments but not in line with international standards. Systematic reporting exists by ministries
and State Economic Enterprises (Myanmar’s equivalent of State Owned Enterprises) to the
Ministry of Finance and Revenue, the Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development, and that such reports are cross checked for accuracy with the Central Bank of
Myanmar, the Myanmar Economic Bank, and the Myanmar Foreign Exchange Bank. The
external audit function is well established, financial audit coverage is high, agencies respond to
audit opinions, and the newly established Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament provides
an appropriate forum for discussing audit report and the budgetary bill.

27.     Notwithstanding these strengths, the PFM system has a number of weaknesses. The
system is characterized by a high degree of informality and process based systems. In particular,
foundational and legal underpinnings have lagged the system. As the regulatory system has
lagged the practice, ministries have adopted different approaches which are not fully articulated.
There is considerable de-concentration of authority to ministries and state economic enterprises
(SEEs). A high degree of virement powers are held at ministry level. Ministries determine their
own procurement systems although the general guiding principle is that these must be open
tender, based on Presidential Regulation. The control environment appears to be relatively weak
and financial management capacity of SEEs is variable. There is also limited availability of
public fiscal information and the system is largely manual, with very limited use of ICT. The

                                                9
extent of off-budget and quasi-public spending is not clear, as is the role of the military in the
economy.

28.     In line with the new constitution, Myanmar has from 2011 moved from a centralized
unitary form of government to a hybrid system of central local relations, falling somewhere
between unitary and federal systems. While the Union (central) level of government has sole
legislative authority and key financing responsibilities, regions and particularly states (both first
order sub-national government units) exercise varying degrees of autonomy in service delivery
and administration. In particular, the 14 states and regions have their own parliaments and
executive governments, headed by a Chief Minister. They also prepare their own budgets which
have to be approved by their respective parliaments. However, unlike in fully fledged federal
systems, the state and regional budgets also need to be approved by the national parliament.
Further, there are no publicly known guidelines or formulae, if at all they exist, that guide
vertical allocation of resources between central and the lower tier of government and horizontal
allocation, amongst the 14 states and regions.

C. Recent economic developments

29.    The Myanmar economy continued to accelerate in 2011/12. Real GDP growth has
increased steadily from 3.6 percent in 2008/09 to 5.5 percent in 2011/12 and is projected at 6.3
percent in 2012/13.3 On the supply side, the manufacturing and services sectors were behind this
acceleration: real growth in agricultural value-added (43 percent of total GDP) fell from 4.7
percent in 2009/10 to 4.4 percent per annum in 2010/11 and 2011/12. Heavy flooding in in some
parts of the country in August 2012 may have a further negative impact on real agricultural
growth. Demand side drivers included higher fiscal spending before the April 2012 by elections,
growth in commodity exports, and strong investment.

30.     Inflation has been easing because of the positive impact of recent economic reforms
and falling food prices, although higher international food prices and domestic non-food
costs have been pushing inflation up again in recent months. Although the CPI price index
suffers significant deficiencies, adjusted figures suggest that prices have been falling in recent
months. Inflation during the period 2009- 2011 had been around 8 percent but is now estimated
to have declined to around 5 percent year-on-year. This is partly because of the new
Government’s efforts to move away from financing the fiscal deficit by printing money towards
use of treasury bonds. The other reason has also been falling domestic food prices which have
the dominant weight in the consumer price index. However, there are indications that prices
have been going up again in recent months, driven by higher international food prices and
increasing prices of non-food commodities such as housing. Since Myanmar’s economy does
not yet have developed money or capital markets and has been largely closed to the outside
world, the impact of the Eurozone crisis on capital flows has not had any effect on Myanmar’s
monetary aggregates, and hence, on domestic inflation.

 IMF staff estimates. Official estimates are twice as high and flat through 2010/11. Official estimates for 2011/12

31.     The introduction of a managed exchange rate system in April 2012 has been
relatively smooth. Until this reform was introduced, the official exchange rate was pegged to
the SDR at 8.5 Kyat per SDR. Based on this exchange rate, the USD had for a long time been
trading at 6 Kyat with a wide range of unofficial rates used within the economy that were much
closer to the level of 800 Kyat to the U.S. Dollar. The new system involves daily sealed bids
from certain domestic banks to the CBM for specific quantities of foreign currency. Overall, the
nominal exchange rate has depreciated by about 4 percent since it was floated. As at November
30, 2012, it was trading at 852 Kyats per one US dollar compared to 819 Kyats on the first day of
trading when it was floated in April.

32.     Money supply growth has been slowing. Growth in broad money supply (M2) has
slowed in 2011/12 to 26.3 percent from 36.3 percent in 2010/11 and 34.8 percent in 2009/10.
Broad money growth is expected to slow even further to 18.8 percent in 2012/13. Growth in
private sector credit exceeded that of net credit to the government for the first time in many
years, increasing by 65.4 percent in 2010/11 and 60.1 percent in 2011/12. By contrast, net credit
to the government grew by 28.5 percent and 16.6 percent respectively, in the same years. The
administratively controlled central bank policy rate was reduced to 10 percent at the start of
2012-13 from 12 percent previously. In addition, since September 2011, the deposit and lending
rates were cut by a cumulative 4 percentage points to 8 and 13 percent, respectively. The
September adjustment also placed the Treasury bond rates above the minimum deposit rate,
which provides an incentive for banks to hold Treasury bonds, and helped reduce deficit
monetization.

33.    The fiscal deficit of the consolidated government worsened from -5.5 percent of
GDP in 2010-11 to -6.0 percent in 2011/12. While total revenues remained unchanged at 13.0
percentage of GDP, expenditures increased from 18.4 percent to 19.0 percent of GDP. As a
consequence, the stock of domestic public debt grew from 22.9 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to
25.1 percent of GDP in 2011/12.

34.     Myanmar’s current account deficit has been increasing recently. In 2011/12, the
current account deficit was at -2.5 percent of GDP, up from -1.2 percent in 2010/11. This was
because of a worsening trade balance as imports grew at a much higher rate (24.4 percent) than
exports (13.3 percent). The Government has been easing restrictions on imports as well as
exports, and this development shows that the response has been stronger on the imports side. The
current account deficit is projected to increase further to -3.9 percent of GDP in 2012/13.

35.     Although the current account deficit has increased, the nominal external reserve
position has been improving. Gross official reserves grew from US$2.9 billion or 3.8 months of
imports in 2009/10 to US$3.3 billion in 2010/11. In 2011/12, reserves increased further to
US$3.8 billion although this is equivalent to 3.3 months of imports because the import
requirement has also increased.

36.     The natural resource sector continues to attract foreign direct investment. Portfolio
capital flows remain limited and therefore recent developments have mostly been on account of
inflows of foreign direct investments. In 2011/12, the overall external balance registered a deficit
of -1.0 percent of GDP. However, due to the projected increase in foreign direct investment from

                                                11
3.8 percent of GDP to 4.5 percent, it is expected that the overall external balance in 2012/13 will
register a surplus of 2.1 percent.

D. Macroeconomic outlook

37.    Myanmar‘s growth prospects over the medium-term remain positive, although the
strength of growth performance will depend on how well the economy responds to
investment and trade opportunities as most economic sanctions are lifted. It is expected that
in the medium-term growth will increase to around 7 percent if the reform momentum is
maintained, and could even be higher, as the economy opens up to the outside world and the
Government continues on its reform path. In particular, foreign direct investment is expected to
increase in the financial sector, telecommunications, gas and mineral sector, textile, energy, and
tourism. Similarly, the tradable sectors, particularly agriculture, textile, and mineral sector are
expected to grow as Myanmar starts benefiting from export markets in Europe and America. A
combination of these factors should see growth accelerate further in the medium term. However
the extent of growth acceleration will depend on how well the country responds to these
opportunities and the sustainability of reforms.

38.     Similarly, fiscal prospects remain positive as revenue increases are likely to outstrip
expenditure increases. In the medium term, it is expected that revenues will increase noticeably
for a number of reasons. First, there will be a substantial increase in gas revenues when the two
gas projects of Shwe and Zawtika come on stream in 2014. As mentioned earlier, these have
potential to increase gas production in Myanmar by 60 percent. Second, as other sectors grow
due to increased trade and investment, non-gas revenues are also expected to increase. Finally,
there are prospects for increased tax revenues as the country undertakes tax policy and
administration reforms. Meanwhile, expenditures are also expected to increase but are likely to
lag behind revenue increases. It is expected that there will be increases in infrastructure spending
particularly in energy and transport sectors as the country tries to close the infrastructure deficit
which could be a binding constraint to growth. At the same time, it is expected that the
Government will increase spending on social sectors as the country tries to catch up with
regional patterns. Similarly, the 2015 general elections are likely to put pressure on the budget.
On balance, is it expected that the fiscal deficit will decline from 6 percent in 2011 to around 4½
percent

39.     Inflation is expected to remain moderate, at around 5 percent year on year. This will
be due to a combination of supply and demand side factors. It is expected that increased
investment will increase the supply of goods and services. While increased investment and
consumption expenditure would put pressure on prices, initiatives towards the substitution of
deficit monetization with bond financing as well as improved reserve money targeting are
expected to have a dampening effect on prices.

40.     The trade and current account balances will continue to be under pressure due to
projected higher increases in import demand vis-à-vis exports. In spite of the expected surge
in exports due to increased gas production as well as increases in other export commodities, it is
expected that import demand for investment and consumption goods will be relatively higher as
further restrictions are relaxed. Over the years there has been a pent-up demand for imports due
to various forms of import restrictions, such as in the importation of vehicles, most of which are
now being relaxed. Further, as the country opens up to foreign investment, demand for imported

                                                 13
investment goods will increase before exports catch up. Therefore on balance, it is expected that
the current account will worsen to 5½ percent of GDP.
E. Debt sustainability

41.     Myanmar’s total external debt outstanding is estimated at US$15 billion as at
December 2012, which is equivalent to 28 percent of GDP, and of which 72 percent (US$11
billion) is in the form of arrears. Table 1 below provides a detailed breakdown of arrears and
current debt outstanding by various creditors. In terms of arrears, 92 percent (US$10.1 billion)
are owed to the Paris Club of which arrears to Japan alone (US$6.6 billion) account for 65
percent. Other major Paris Club creditors are Germany, France, and Norway. Arrears to
multilateral institutions account for 9 percent of the total, with 5 percent due to the ADB and 4
percent to IDA. As can be seen, Myanmar does not have arrears to non-Paris Club members or to
commercial creditors. This is because the country has been servicing debts to those bilateral
creditors that did not impose sanctions. As at October 31, Myanmar’s actual arrears to IDA were
US$411 million.

42.     To normalize relations with the international community, the Government has been
discussing with the various creditors on modalities for clearing the arrears, and significant
progress has been made that would see the arrears decline in the coming year. In April
2012, the Japanese Government reached an agreement with the Myanmar Government on how
arrears to Japan would be cleared. Similarly, agreement has been reached on a coordinated
approach to clearing Myanmar's arrears to IDA and ADB of which the proposed DPO is an
integral part. A resolution of Myanmar's arrears to Paris Club Creditors, consistent with the
implementation of the agreement with Japan, is also expected to be reached soon after Board
discussion of the DPO.

43.     A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on Myanmar has recently been conducted
jointly by IMF and Bank staff. The DSA has made the following assumptions under the
baseline scenario: (i) GDP growth is expected at 7½ percent in the long-term; (ii) inflation will
be around 4¾ percent; (iii) the primary fiscal deficit will narrow from about 4.3 percent in
FY2011/12 to 2¼ percent in the medium-term; (iv) revenues will increase significantly from
11.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 20.3 percent of GDP in the medium term and to 21.9 percent
of GDP in the long-term, owing to the positive impact of a higher exchange rate and an expected
substantial increase in gas exports revenues; (v) growth in exports will average around 12.3
percent while the growth in imports will be around 14 percent; (vi) the current account will
remain in deficit and stabilize around -5.5 percent of GDP in the long-term; (vii) new financing
needs will be met by both foreign direct investment and disbursements of medium and long-term
debt from bilateral and multilateral creditors.

44.         The conclusion of the DSA is that due to the presence of arrears, Myanmar can be
classified as being in debt distress. However, going forward, if these arrears were to be
cleared, Myanmar would be at low risk of debt distress. As the graphs in Figure 3 show,
Myanmar’s debt-burden indicators including arrears are generally low and remain below the
critical thresholds during the projection period under the baseline and when subjected to the most
extreme shock. In spite of these favorable indicators, Myanmar is currently assessed to be in
debt distress given the presence of arrears.

Overall macroeconomic assessment

45.      While risks remain, Myanmar’s macroeconomic policies are broadly appropriate.
The authorities have limited tools especially for conducting monetary policy, but also for fiscal
policy. Nonetheless, operating within these constraints, macroeconomic policy has sought to
contain inflation such as taking steps to limit monetization of the fiscal deficit. The introduction
of a managed float exchange rate system will ease pressure on the external balance. Most key
macroeconomic aggregates are at reasonable levels and the outlook is positive. At around 5
percent, inflation is moderate. Similarly, while a fiscal deficit of 6.2 percent in FY2011/12 is
relatively high, it is projected to fall in the short to medium-term. Debt indicators remain low
while gross official reserves are above the 3 months of import cover that is sometimes used as a
critical benchmark. Further, the IMF and other donors are providing support on macroeconomic
issues, including through intensive monitoring which reduces risks to the macroeconomic
framework in the context of weak capacity and further strengthens the already positive
macroeconomic outlook.

     III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

A. Myanmar’s development strategy

46.     The Government has prepared a five-year development plan for the period 2011-
2015 and which has since been submitted to parliament for discussion. The plan outlines
various initiatives, in terms of programs and investments that the Government will undertake in
order to achieve the following strategic objectives: (i) agricultural development; (ii) balanced
growth among regions and states; (iii) inclusive growth; and (iv) improving the quality statistics.
These objectives are in turn translated into further operational detail, for example with a “Rural
Poverty Alleviation and Development Framework? identifying eight tasks covering a broad
agenda for rural development, including developing the agricultural production sectors,
developing micro saving and credit enterprises, rural energy, and social and economic
development of rural areas. This plan builds on a long tradition of planning in Myanmar and is
particularly noteworthy for a commitment to accurate statistics as a pillar for better planning.

47.     Additionally, the specific reform initiatives that will underpin the implementation of
the five year development plan are contained in the “Framework for Economic and Social
Reform? that is under preparation and which will form the basis for further consultations.
The framework will seek to give coherence to the government’s reform efforts. It will also aim to
articulate the sequence in which they are to be implemented, and identify areas where further
analytical work and consideration of options is required. In terms of scope, the reform
framework will cover the following areas: macro-economic reform; sector policy reform; the
social and environmental dimensions of development; national harmony and regional
development; improving governance; and repositioning Myanmar in the international
community.

B. Coordination

48.     To ensure that Myanmar’s medium-term development strategy is properly
coordinated across the various sectors and tiers of Government, a Planning Commission
has been established. The Commission is headed by the President and includes Union Ministers
and chief ministers from all regions and states. The role of the Planning Commission will be to
guide medium-to-long term economic planning and development in the country. The
Government is increasingly taking a leadership role in donor coordination including through the
high level Foreign Aid Management and Coordination Committee.




                                                17
C. Consultations

49.      Government has consulted on the reforms implemented and planned, including
those underpinning the proposed operation. In a break from past practice, the new
administration made has sought to move away from a top-down approach to planning and policy
formulation to a seeking the views of various stakeholders including, at grassroots, will be taken
into account. In the early stages of the reform, several workshops have been organized by
Government for purposes of consulting stakeholders on the design of various reforms. Box 1
below outlines some of the consultation workshops organized. In a significant step towards
institutionalization of consultations, the debates in Parliament on legislation are usually rigorous
and often televised and covered in the print media.

      Box 1: Key Government Consultation Platforms and Initiatives on Economic Reforms

 The Government has used various platforms and initiatives for purposes of seeking stakeholder views
 on the reform process. For example, a workshop was held from May 20-22, 2011 at the Myanmar
 International Convention Centre in Nay Pyi Taw. The theme of the workshop was “National
 Workshop on Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation in Myanmar.? Participants included
 Government officials, civil society representatives, private sector, and the media.

 Soon thereafter, a watershed national workshop was organized by the Office of the President from
 August 19-21, 2011 at the same venue. This workshop was titled “National Workshop on Reforms for
 Economic Development of Myanmar.? Some of the topics covered at the workshop included
 “corruption: causes, consequences, and cures? and “Exchange Rate Reforms?. Like the first
 workshop, participants came from within and outside Government. Most significant was the fact that
 the workshop was also attended by the President himself and the opposition leader, Daw Aung San
 Suu Kyi, at the personal invitation of the President.

 Another notable workshop was held from November 7-8 in Yangon with the title “Workshop on the
 Development of the Financial Sector in Myanmar and its role in supporting inclusive Economic
 Growth and Poverty Reduction?. Some of the topics covered were “Role of the Financial Sector in
 Supporting Growth and Poverty?, “Reform of the Banking Sector,? “Development of a Capital
 Market?, and “Strengthening of the Central Bank?. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi attended this workshop
 again, and for the first time, donor representatives were also invited.

 Besides these workshops which have been organized by the executive branch of Government,
 Parliament is increasingly becoming a forum for national debate. All bills that go to Parliament are
 now published in local newspapers and the public is invited to submit views and comments. For
 example, relevant to this operation is the fact that the budget bill, the foreign exchange management
 bill, and the foreign investment bill were all widely debated in parliament before being passed, and
 public inputs were solicited. With regard to the foreign investment bill, the speaker of the lower house
 of parliament went further to organize a special workshop to seek stakeholder views on the bill.


50.    Going forward, the Government also plans to undertake further consultations on
the framework for economic and social reform before it is finalized. The reform framework
has drawn on recommendations from the workshops referred to above and Government agencies
have provided comments on the draft document. The plan now is to solicit comments from all
other stakeholders. In this regard, the Government plans to hold additional consultation

                                                   18
workshops in states and regions. There are also plans to seek comments from development
partners.

D. The Government’s Gender Strategy

51.     A national plan to enhance gender equality and empower women is underway, but
the capacity to implement the plan is limited. As mentioned earlier, the 2008 Constitution
grants equal rights, opportunities and legal protection to all citizens, and Myanmar is a signatory
to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).
The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, and the Myanmar National
Commission on Women’s Affairs oversee the implementation of CEDAW. In addition, the
government is developing a National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (NSPAW)
2012-2021 which includes 12 key activity areas along the lines of the Beijing Platform of Action.
While the government is working on enhancing women’s status and protection, there is a need to
enhance public perceptions of the importance of gender equality in development, and to
strengthen the capacity of national institutions to effectively implement CEDAW and the
proposed NSPAW.

              IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A. Link to the Interim Strategy Note

52.    Before the Board approved a pre-arrears clearance grant on November 1, 2012 to
support a Community Driven Development (CDD) project, The Bank had not approved
any new projects in Myanmar since 1987. The Bank’s first project in the country was approved
in May 1956, supporting the Government’s rehabilitation and modernization of the railway (damaged
during World War II) and inland water transport sectors. There have been a total of 35 projects in
Myanmar. In 1998, the Government went into arrears to IDA but has remained a member. In the
period since 1987, the Bank has supported only one project in Myanmar, the “Avian Influenza
Support? project financed by the Avian and Human Influenza European Union trust fund and
implemented through the Food and Agriculture Organization, which was closed in 2011. IFC has not
had any engagement in Myanmar to date.

53.     The proposed Myanmar DPO is consistent with the Bank’s strategy for supporting
re-engagement in Myanmar as outlined in the ISN for the period FY13-14. The Myanmar
ISN was discussed by the Board on November 1st, 2012 together with the CDD project referred
above and an IFC investment in ACLEDA Myanmar which is a microfinance institution. The
strategy has been prepared to support re-engagement with Myanmar as the country goes through
a triple transition – from an authoritarian military system to democratic governance, from a
centrally-directed economy to market-oriented reforms, and from conflict to peace in the border
areas. In so doing, the ISN draws on the WBG’s experience in other countries, and the findings
of the 2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security and Development, in particular in
its emphasis on a continuous effort on transforming institutions and building confidence. At the
same time, the ISN aims to lay the foundation for the resumption of a full country program,
including by supporting diagnostic work to build a shared understanding of key development
challenges facing the country.


                                                19
54.     The DPO is explicitly provided for in the ISN under the pillar on preparing the way
for the resumption of a full country program. The ISN focuses on three pillars: the first aims
at supporting government’s efforts to transform institutions to allow them to deliver for citizens;
the second at building confidence in the ongoing reform process; and the third at preparing the
way for the resumption of a full country program. Under preparing the way for resumption of a
full country program, the strategy provides for the provision of a DPO to Myanmar to support
the government's reform program with proceeds used to support Myanmar's foreign exchange
needs, including those associated with IDA arrears clearance.

55.      The reforms to be supported by the DPO are also consistent with the pillars on
transforming institutions and building confidence. The ISN emphasizes the need for strong
institutions to effectively manage and sustain Myanmar’s triple transition. Institutional reforms
are seen as critical to help the authorities successfully mediate competing demands, steer an
increasingly complex economy, and navigate the country on its development path. As stated
earlier, strong institutions will also be important for investors to have confidence in the country.
Therefore, the policy and institutional reforms being supported under this program will
contribute towards achieving this strategic objective of the ISN.

B. Relationship with other bank operations

56.      The DPO is also closely linked to on-going and planned Bank diagnostic tasks and
projects. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment funded by
DFID is at an advanced stage of being finalized. It is in the course of carrying out the PEFA
assessment that the Bank has already been able to provide policy advice on specific requests,
including in areas being supported by the proposed DPO. Once completed, recommendations
from the PEFA assessment and a planned Public Expenditure Review (PER) will inform the
design of further reforms that need to be implemented in public financial management which is
one of the policy areas covered by the proposed DPO. The policy dialogue under the DPO is
providing useful insights into some of the key areas which planned future support will need to
cover. Possible future TA projects will ensure that some of the specific reforms supported under
the planned DPO are sustained through the provision of the required capacity building support.
Finally, the Bank and IFC plan are carrying out diagnostic work and providing TA in the areas of
financial sector reform and private sector development funded by AusAID. The dialogue under
the DPO has provided useful insights in designing the scope of this support. Further, the planned
TA will in turn generate relevant knowledge and help build institutions and strengthen capacity
that is necessary for the sustainability of reforms supported by the proposed DPO.

C. Coordination with the IMF and other donors

57.     In preparing the operation, the Bank has consulted with the IMF on the assessment
of Myanmar’s macro-economy and its outlook. Although the Fund has not had a formal
program in Myanmar, it has maintained a surveillance relationship through the Article IV
consultations. IDA staffs have neon participating in most of these Fund surveillance missions. In
preparing this operation, there has been close collaboration with the Fund particularly in the
preparation of a joint DSA. Further the IMF has been consulted on the assessment of the macro
economy and its outlook, and has provided a letter of assessment which is attached in Annex 4 of
this document.

                                                20
58.     The Bank also collaborated with the Fund in other areas, particularly PFM and
financial sector reforms. In PFM, the Bank team working on the PEFA assessment collaborated
closely with the IMF team that carried out a review of Myanmar’s PFM system. The teams had
joint meetings when the missions overlapped and also peer reviewed each other’s reports.
Similarly, the IMF and World Bank teams have collaborated in providing support and policy
advice to the authorities on financial sector reforms, including through the fielding of joint
missions.

59.     More recently, Bank Staff have also collaborated with the IMF during the
preparation of an SMP. A Fund mission was fielded during November 5-23, 2012 to discuss
the details of the program. The Bank was asked to provide comments on the draft briefing paper
prepared by Fund staff ahead of the mission. The Bank team also fully participated in the
mission and has provided comments on draft staff report on the program. Further, Bank Staff
were consulted on specific issues that fall under the purview of the Bank. The proposed SMP
seeks to support the authorities’ efforts towards maintaining macroeconomic stability during the
reform process and laying the foundations for lasting macroeconomic stability by building a
macroeconomic framework, and developing the institutions and instruments to use it effectively.
It will cover the period through December 2013, and will be monitored through semi-annual
reviews using quantitative and structural benchmarks. The specific quantitative and structural
benchmarks agreed under the program seek to ensure low and stable inflation within a consistent
macroeconomic framework, build international reserve buffers in light of the on-going
liberalization of imports and foreign exchange regime, and continue building institutions and
instruments needed to ensure macroeconomic stability.

60.     There has also been close coordination with the ADB in preparing this operation in
the context of a collaborative approach to arrears clearance. Myanmar’s arrears to the ADB
stand at around US$517 million. As part of a coordinated international approach to arrears
clearance, World Bank and ADB staffs have collaborated closely throughout the process. After
the authorities expressed interest to normalize relations with the international community, the
two institutions indicated that the clearance of arrears owed to them would be a pre-requisite for
normal lending relations to resume. Subsequently, the process of reconciling the arrears amounts
commenced and to assist the authorities in clearing the arrears, a joint note laying down possible
approaches was prepared by the two institutions. In the end, the authorities settled for the option
of clearing the arrears using a bridge loan. Over the next several months detailed consultations
with the Government of Myanmar, the Asian Development Bank and the bridge financier took
place to iron out the details of the transaction. This included several joint missions in Myanmar,
and a series of technical discussions between the parties involved in the IDA transaction.




                                                21
D. Lessons learned

61.     This operation builds on lessons emerging from DPOs in fragile environments,
especially those prepared as part of a reengagement process. Similar DPOs have been
prepared for Guinea (2011), Togo (2008), Cote D’voire (2008), Liberia (2007), and Central
African Republic (2006). One common feature in all these operations, which is also highlighted
in an IEG report on engaging with fragile states, is that they carefully focused on politically
feasible reforms that can build momentum for future changes, with a particular emphasis on
restoring and strengthening basic state functions. In other words, the key lesson is to strike an
appropriate balance between ambition and realism. This lesson is even more relevant for
Myanmar which is emerging from a much longer period of fragility and isolation than the
countries listed above.

62.      The choice of critical prior actions has also drawn from the experiences of other
countries that have gone through transitions on the need to strike the right balance
between policy changes and institutional reforms. One of the key lessons from the Bank’s
engagement in supporting reforms in countries that have gone through transition such as
Vietnam is that there was greater emphasis on policy changes with less attention paid to building
institutions. For example, the focus in Vietnam was more on getting the exchange rate right and
less on how it was to be set and managed. As will be seen from the policy matrix to be presented
later in the document, this operation has learnt from this experience by having prior actions that
seek to build institutions, such as through the passage of laws, and prior actions that focus on
actual changes in the way of doing things.

E. Analytical underpinnings

63.     In spite of the Bank’s long absence in Myanmar, the majority of reforms supported
under this operation are consistent with the Bank’s recommendations from analytical work
conducted before the suspension of formal operations. For example, a 1995 comprehensive
Country Economic Report on Myanmar analyzed critical issues the country was facing in the
areas of macroeconomic stability, getting the structure of incentives right for exports and private
sector development; and in reforming state owned enterprises. A comprehensive Economic and
Social Assessment was further conducted by the Bank in 1999 and also included analyses on
macroeconomic policy, private sector development, and strengthening the role of Government in
poverty reduction.

64.      Although it has been a while since the above reports were produced, their findings
and recommendations have remained valid, and have been reconfirmed by recent non-
bank analytical work and policy dialogue. Examples of specific recommendations that have
been reconfirmed in recent reports such as the 2012 IMF Staff Report on Article IV consultations
(and subsequent IMF country team and technical missions) but which featured in earlier Bank
reports include the need for unification of Myanmar’s multiple exchange rates; the need for
Central Bank operational autonomy, financial sector modernization and removal of overly
restrictive controls on financial intermediation; rationalization of certain taxes and improved tax
administration. Recommendations for achieving broad-based growth through structural reforms
focus on improving the investment climate through removal of non-tariff barriers to trade,
elimination of foreign exchange controls, and reduction in company licensing and registration

                                                22
costs. These are recommendations that the Bank has consistently made in various discussions on
Myanmar and which have informed the design of this operation.

65.     More recently, the Bank has been conducting a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Assessment which has informed the design of this operation in the
area of public financial management. In light of the current operating environment, the PEFA
is being carried out with funding from DFID under a fee-based service agreement and is at an
advanced stage of being finalized. One of the key findings of the PEFA is the limited availability
of public fiscal information, stemming from the closed nature of the previous political
environment. It is for this reason that the proposed operation supports the efforts that the
authorities are now making in improving transparency in the management of public resources,
including in the area of natural gas revenues.

F. Incorporating gender dimensions

66.      The Bank is planning to fill existing knowledge gaps in the gender area while
utilizing available entry points for incorporating gender dimensions in its operations. As
mentioned earlier, disaggregated data with gender dimensions remains scanty. In order to
properly support the Government in promoting gender equality, the donors will be investing in
filling data and knowledge gaps in this area. In particular, there are plans to support a population
census as well as the next round of national household living conditions survey. Given that
peace is returning to most areas that were previously in conflict and therefore not accessible, it is
expected that the new data will be more representative of the situation in the country and will
therefore provide useful insights into challenges that remain in order to improve gender equality.
Meanwhile, the Bank will be utilizing all possible entry points to incorporate gender dimensions,
including those available in this operation.

                V.     THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT

A. Overall description

67.    The proposed DPO is a standalone operation whose aim is to support the
Government’s medium-term policy and institutional reform program in three main policy
areas: (a) strengthening macroeconomic stability, (b) improving public financial management,
and (c) improving the investment climate. These policy areas constitute the main pillars of the
DPO.

68.    The critical prior actions supported by the DPO are a combination of actions that
seek to build institutions and those that relate to changes in policies and practices. These
can be summarized as follows:

      Strengthening macroeconomic stability: two prior actions are supported under this
       policy area. The first seeks to improve the exchange rate institutional framework and
       policy through the passage of a foreign exchange management law and the floatation of
       the local currency while the second seeks to institute measures for ensuring fiscal
       discipline by including a borrowing limit in the budget law.

                                                 23
      Improving public financial management: the DPO also supports two prior actions
       under this policy area. The first seeks to achieve a more inclusive budget by increasing
       allocations to education and health, and the second seeks to improve budget transparency
       through the publication of the budget law.

      Improving the investment climate: there are three prior actions under this policy area.
       The first seeks to improve access to finance by permitting commercial Banks to accept
       additional types of assets as collateral while the second seeks to reduce barriers for
       foreign investments through the enactment of a foreign investment law while the third
       seeks to remove barriers to trade through the abolition of a policy that required importers
       to “export first? in order to access foreign exchange.

B. Program development objective

69.     The DPO’s program development objective (PDO) is two-fold (i) to support Myanmar’s
critical reforms for strengthening macroeconomic stability, improving public financial
management, and improving the investment climate, which will in turn help grow the economy,
create jobs, and reduce poverty; and (ii) to facilitate the clearance of Myanmar’s arrears to IDA,
which is required in order to restore normal relations between Myanmar and the World Bank.

   PDO Level Result: At the end of the program period, the main result of this operation will
   be the full clearance of IDA arrears from a baseline value of $411 million as at October 31,
   2012, to zero.


C. Operation design

70.     The amount of the credit is estimated at around US$440 million equivalent under
IDA terms and to be disbursed in a single tranche. Upon approval of the credit and
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, and at the request of the authorities, the proceeds of
the credit would be disbursed to support the Government’s foreign exchange needs including
through the reimbursement of a bridge loan extended to clear Myanmar’s arrears to IDA. In
order to ensure that the bridge loan is adequate to cover any exchange rate fluctuations between
the time the facility amount was determined and the date arrears will be cleared, the bridge loan
amount, and hence the DPO, incorporates a 5 percent operating margin. The actual amount of
arrears on the day they will be cleared will be notified to the borrower and any unused margin
will be cancelled from the Credit.

D. Policy areas

71.     This section describes in more detail the reform program supported by the DPO.
The key measures (prior actions) under this broad reform program are summarized in a policy
matrix that is presented in Annex 3 while Figure 4 below provides a broad overview of the scope
of the reform program. Following the structure presented in Figure 4, this section presents a
detailed description of the issues under each policy area and under each reform objective and
concludes each policy area with the expected key outcomes at the end of the program period. At

                                               24
the end of the section, Table 4 presents the implementation status of the prior actions. It must
also be mentioned that these prior actions have been identified selectively. Therefore, as will be
observed, the prior actions do not feature under every reform objective.

     Policy Area 1: Strengthening macroeconomic stability

Prior actions:
1. Enacted the Foreign Exchange Management Law and introduced a managed float system of
exchange rate determination
2. Included a limit on borrowing in the Union Budget Law for Fiscal Year 2012/13

72.     The Government recognizes that macroeconomic stability and predictability is a
crucial foundation for growth and poverty reduction. In this context, it has embarked on
several reforms aimed at creating the essential building blocks for macroeconomic management.
In particular, it recognizes that attaining macroeconomic stability will entail the pursuance of
prudent monetary and fiscal policies so that key macroeconomic variables such as inflation,
interest rates, exchange rates, budget deficits, and international reserves are conducive for
productive economic activities to flourish. Consequently, Government has started taking the
necessary first steps to build a modern financial system that would be amenable to monetary

                                                   25
policy making based on market-based principles. The Government has also taken more specific
steps to improve exchange rate policy, and carried out the necessary measures to start instituting
fiscal discipline.

Laying the foundations of improved monetary policy through the development of a modern
financial system

73.     The financial system in Myanmar is very small and inefficient, coming out of a
transition from a form of centralized economic structure. It is still at the earliest stages of
development and lags far behind its neighboring countries and most low income economies. For
example, Myanmar has some of the lowest levels of penetration of financial services in the world
with domestic credit to GDP at 8.2 percent – one of the lowest in the world. The overall level of
deposits is 17.6 percent of GDP, low compared to other low income economies.

74.      The Central Bank is not currently a traditional, operationally independent entity
with clearly defined roles, however reforms are now underway. Under the current legal
framework, the CBM lacks autonomy to carry out its functions; it is currently structured as a
department of the Ministry of Finance and Revenue (MOFR). The CBM provides resources to
finance the government deficit and manages the new, managed floating exchange rate system,
but it has no monetary policy role. It is also the primary regulator and supervisor of financial
institutions. In order to change this situation, the GOM has drafted a new Central Bank of
Myanmar Law (CBML). Under the new CBML, conflicts of interest will be removed, the CBM
will be strengthened both in terms of autonomy status and its accountability, and the functions
and powers of the CBM will be strengthened to execute monetary policy. Going forward, the
CBM will need substantial improvement in a wide range of capacities and systems to carry out
its newly granted functions once the CBML is passed. In addition, the state owned commercial
banks (SOCBs) will have to be substantially restructured and the central banking functions that
some of the SOCBs carry out will have to be transferred to the CBM. The CBM is receiving
assistance from the IMF and World Bank on the draft CBML.

75.     Apart from the improving the legal framework, the Government also recognizes the
critical need for the CBM to be reorganized for it to assume its new role as a monetary
policy making institution. As mentioned above, the CBM is currently structured as a
department in the Ministry of Finance and Revenues. Most departments at the CBM as they
currently exist are not consistent with the structure of a traditional central bank. In order to
support the implementation of the CBM’s expanded and strengthened mandate, the Cabinet
approved a new organizational structure for the Central Bank in July 2012. The new
organizational structure provides for oversight of the Central Bank by a Board of Directors
which will include significant representation by independent directors, and provides for a
significant increase in staff numbers as well as broader and deeper skills.

76.     Going forward, strengthening the CBM’s regulatory, supervisory, analytic, and
policymaking functions will also be critical. The CBM will need to deal both with the existing
the financial system, and the changing environment of a more open economy, the development
of government debt and money markets, and the 2015 regional financial integration of ASEAN.


                                               26
The Bank is providing TA in this area and is collaborating with other development partners such
as the IMF.

77.     In addition to reforms focused at the CBM, reforms are also underway aimed at
modernizing the financial system more broadly. First, given its urgency, the Government has
initiated the process of drafting a new Financial Institutions Law (FIL). Myanmar’s current legal
framework for the financial sector falls below international standards and urgently needs
wholesale modernization in all aspects, particularly with respect to the banking sector in areas
such as corporate governance, accounting, capital adequacy, loan classification and provisioning,
liquidity requirement, and other areas. Second, the authorities are formulating a financial sector
development master plan to ensure a systematic approach to reforms in the sector. In both cases,
the Bank is providing TA with funding from AusAID.

Improving exchange rate management institutional framework and policy

78.     For a long time, Myanmar pursued a fixed, multiple, and restrictive exchange rate
policy that was damaging to the economy. The official exchange rate was greatly over-valued
as evidenced by the huge margin between its value that the rate in trading in unofficial markets.
As stated earlier, the Government applied different exchange rates for different purposes and
players in the economy. Further, until recently, only state owned commercial banks were
officially license to buy and sell foreign exchange. This policy has been a source of distortions
and uncertainty in the economy, and had far reaching effects including on Myanmar’s external
competitiveness, fiscal framework, and business environment.

79.     In order to create a conducive environment for a market-based exchange rate
system, the CBM has increased the number of authorized foreign exchange dealer licenses,
and issued them to private banks for the first time. The CBM has recently issued three types
of foreign exchange dealer licenses; Money Changer License (MC), Foreign Exchange Acceptor
and Holder (AH) and Authorized Dealer (AD). In September 2011, CBM issued MC licenses to
17 private banks and AD licenses to 3 state-owned banks and 11 domestic private banks. The
MC license holders are allowed to open exchange counters to deal with trading of foreign
currency and local currency kyat at market rate while the AD license holder may engage in
handling, buying, selling, collecting and dealing in foreign exchange.

80.      Meanwhile, the Government has started taking steps towards unification of the
exchange rate. On April 1, 2012, the CBM introduced a managed floating exchange rate system.
The new system involves daily sealed bids from certain authorized domestic banks to the CBM
for specific quantities of foreign currency. Besides, an interbank exchange market is in the
process of being established to allow the CBM to intervene and influence the exchange rate. The
initial trading band was set at 820 kyats to the US Dollar on April 1, 2012, plus or minus 2
percent.

81.    At the same time, in order to ensure that the new exchange rate policy is anchored
in a robust institutional framework, the Government has passed a Foreign Exchange
Management Law (FEML). The law provides the CBM with powers to regulate, manage and
develop the foreign exchange markets. The FEML also allows for much greater flows of foreign


                                               27
exchange into and out of Myanmar, which may facilitate foreign investment and trade.
However, there are risks associated with opening the capital account more fully, and thus the
CBM will have to be vigilant in monitoring and supervising the markets to ensure stability and
buffer against sudden inflows or outflows of funds. Further, priority will still need to be given to
eliminating inefficiencies as well as regulatory treatments that lead to wide-spread use of
informal markets.

Instituting measures for fiscal discipline

82.     The Government recognizes that instituting fiscal discipline is essential towards the
creation of a stable macroeconomic environment. In the past, Myanmar’s economy was
characterized by high inflation as the Government simply instructed the Central Bank to print
more money in order to finance the budget deficit. This was exacerbated by the fact that even
commercially oriented SEEs were almost always guaranteed funding from the budget, even for
raw materials. As the Government seeks to achieve private sector led growth, it recognizes
ensuring fiscal discipline will be critical to creating a stable macroeconomic environment where
inflation is low and the private sector is not crowded out in the money market. As a result, it has
embarked on a number of reforms aimed at institutionalizing fiscal discipline in its conduct of
fiscal policy.

83.      First key actions the Government has introduced to institute fiscal discipline seek to
reduce the dependence of SEEs on the budget, reduce deficit monetization, and limit
annual borrowing. In particular, starting from FY2012/13, the Government introduced a limit
on the level of Government subsidy that would be funded directly through the budget for
meeting SEE raw material requirements. This means that SEEs are in this fiscal year expected to
finance some of their raw material requirements using revenues generated from their commercial
activities. Further, as mentioned in Section II, the Government has also started taking steps
towards the reduction of deficit monetization. In particular, the Government has established a
bond market auction system with so that the Government should be able to borrow from the
money market to meet its financing needs than through the printing of money. Finally, since
borrowing is inevitable, the Government has included a limit on borrowing in the Union budget.
This limit is explicitly specified in the Union Budget Law.

84.      Going forward, a number of further reforms are planned. Some involve the
completion of the ones already started while others will be new initiatives. For example, in
developing a modern financial system, the Government plans to eventually pass the new Central
Bank of Myanmar Law as well as the Financial Institutions Law. Under improving exchange rate
policy, the authorities plan to achieve full unification of the exchange rate. Finally, under
instituting fiscal discipline, the plan is to introduce further reforms for reducing the impact of
SEEs on the budget. In this context, it will be important that such reforms are informed by
rigorous analytical work. A planned PER will include a study of the impact of SEE’s on
Myanmar’s fiscal program and will therefore help fill some of the existing knowledge gaps.




                                                28
Expected outcomes on ensuring macroeconomic stability: At the end of the program period, it
is expected that these critical actions for improving exchange rate policy institing fiscal
discipline will be manifested in the following outcomes: (i) more efficient foreign exchange
market evidenced by a reduction in the margin between the official and parallel market exchange
rate; and (ii) a reduction in the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio.


Policy Area 2: Improving Public Financial Management


Prior actions:
1. Increased allocations to education and health in the FY2012/13 budget
2. Published the Union Budget Law in a local newspaper

85.     The Government has been undertaking significant public financial management
reforms since 2011. On the revenue side the focus of the reforms has been on simplification of
revenue policy and fostering transparency in revenue administration. This is expected to enhance
compliance and increase revenue collections in an efficient and accountable manner.
Concurrently, expenditure side reforms have been aimed at fostering inclusive budgeting and
planning whilst enhancing transparency, and strengthening external oversight. These reforms are
geared to promote efficiency and accountability in managemnt of public finances. This section
presents a summary of the PFM reforms supported by this Development Policy Operation as well
as the government’s further reform plans.

Increasing non-gas revenues through improved tax policy and adminstration

86.     The Ministry of Finance and Revenue has started implementing a number of tax
policy and administration reforms in order to improve on Myanmar’s very low tax revenue
effort. It is estimated that in FY2011/12, the total revenue-to-GDP ratio was 13 percent. Of this,
tax revenues accounted for only 4.1 percent. From FY2012/13 the Government: (i) replaced
gross profit tax with net profit tax, (ii) increased taxable income thresholds for salary earners and
brought public servants into the tax net; (iii) abolished differential corporate tax rates on foreign
exchange earnings; (iv) rationalized commercial tax on most goods and services to 5 percent and
reduced the number of different tax rates applied, as well as increasing the number of services
subject to the commercial tax. These reforms are aimed at simplification of revenue in order to
enhance compliance and increase revenue collections in an efficient and accountable manner.

87.     The Government has also taken steps to improve transparency of tax policy and its
administration. In April 2012 the Government published the revised personal income tax code
and corporate tax code in both Myanmar and English on the website of the Internal Revenue
Department (IRD). The IRD also published and distributed a simplified guide to taxpayers for
calculating taxable income based on the revised tax code for all major tax instruments. This was
followed up by a countrywide taxpayer outreach program, including training to tax officials on
application of the revised tax laws.

                                                 29
88.     However there are still significant shortcomings in tax policy. Myanmar does not
have a unified tax code which compromises the consistency of the overall tax policy and leads to
tax cascading. Major tax instruments are legislated separately and are quite dated, different tax
laws allow for significant leeway in granting tax exemptions without estimating tax
expenditures. Additionally the rate structure of commercial taxes could be simplified further for
efficiency.

89.     Tax administration also faces major challenges. Myanmar practices the administered
tax assessment system which allows for significant collusive interactions between taxpayers and
collectors. Although the government has implemented a General Index Registration system for
taxpayers, only 0.4 percent of the population is registered. Additionally, the GIR number is used
only within a specific geographical area. It is not unique and can duplicate across regions and
tax-type directorates. The same taxpayer may have multiple GIRs if she/he operates in different
types of businesses in different regions. As such the GIR is not an effective control mechanism
and fails to facilitate communication with third parties. The compliance management system is
weak, showing collection rates of less than 30 percent for Commercial Tax and 60 percent for
Income Tax.

90.      The Government is cognizant of these weaknesses and is planning to address these
deficiencies looking ahead. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance plans to develop a sequenced
revenue policy and administration reform program which focuses to further simplify revenue
policy, modernize administration, enhance revenue transparency, and promote compliance.
Potential reform elements include: (i) comprehensive revision of tax policy along with rules and
regulations governing tax administration; (ii) modernizing the tax assessment system; (iii)
strengthen taxpayer identification system concurrent with progressively building a modern risk-
based tax audit system; (iv) develop more efficient and modern tax instruments; and (v) improve
the arrears management system. These reforms will require significant change management,
institutional restructuring and capacity enhancement.

Ensuring a more inclusive budget

91.     Establishment of the Union, Region and State parliaments and election of the new
government in 2011 has heralded a fundamental change in the Government’s quest for a
more inclusive budget in a country with many ethnic groups. Prior to 2010 the budgeting and
planning system was top-down with the head of state signing off on the budget without any
external consultation or scrutiny. This changed with the establishment of the Parliamentary
system of government and establishment of regional and state parliaments. Starting with fiscal
year 2012/13, the government separated regional and state budgets from the Union budget. This
is aimed at giving people at grass root levels the opportunity to have a greater say in the
allocation of budgetary resources for meeting their development needs.

92.    Since budgeting and planning in a decentralized system needs to be coordinated, the
Government has also established new institutions. First, township level planning committees
were established to provide inputs into the formulation of regional and state budgets. Second,
the Union Financial Commission (FC) was established to coordinate the Union budget with

                                               30
regional and state budgets. The FC is chaired by the President and comprises the Minister for
Finance and Revenue (Secretary), Chief Ministers from the regions and states, the Minister for
National Planning and Economic Development, the Auditor General and the Attorney General.
The FC reviews the proposed union and state and regional level budgets and subsequently
submits them to Parliament for approval. Third, in June 2012, the Government also constituted
the Planning Commission (PC) – chaired by the President and comprising the Minister for
National Planning and Economic Development (Secretary), all Union Ministers, all Chief
Ministers from Regions and States, the Union Auditor General, and the Attorney General. The
PC shall coordinate the formulation and implementation of the National Development Plan along
with providing high level guidance to agencies on project implementation issues on a case-by-
case basis.

93.     The budget is not well aligned with development priorities, but some improvements
are now being made. One of the characteristic features of past budgets has been the dominance
of allocations to defense, while allocations to such critical sectors as health and education have
been relatively very low even compared to peers and neighboring countries. In order to ensure
that the budget is more inclusive, the Government has started the process of realigning the
budget to critical development priorities. In the FY2012/13 budget, allocations to health and
education were significantly increased. The allocation to education was more than doubled from
310 billion Kyats in FY2011/12 to 752 billion Kyats in FY2012/13. At the same time, the
allocation to health was more than quadrupled from 92 billion Kyats in FY2011/12 to 392 billion
Kyats in FY2012/13.

Enhancing transparency in the management of public finances

94.     Since 2011 the government has also been undertaking reforms aimed at enhancing
transparency of public finances. In FY2012/13 the Government changed the budget and
accounting processes to use a more market based exchange rate for foreign currency transactions.
This reform is significant as it allows for greater transparency in tax collections from foreign
transactions and also allows agencies greater realism on the expenditure side by minimizing the
need for fictitious adjustments on expenditures made in foreign exchange. Furthermore, in
addition to publishing in the Official Gazette as has been the tradition, the Union Budget Law for
FY2012/13 was for the first time also published in a local newspaper which is more widely
accessible to the public. This marks a significant step towards improved transparency since the
published budget provides such useful information as recurrent and capital expenditures for each
ministry and transfers to states and regions.

95.    The government has expressed its intent to implement the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative. Based on a formal invitation from the government, the EITI
Secretariat visited Myanmar in June 2012 to discuss the mechanics of the EITI with authorities.
The authorities are now considering the appointment of the appropriate EITI Champion and the
independent external EITI national coordinator. The discussions are being facilitated by the
UK’s Department for International Development and the Bank is providing technical support.




                                               31
96.     Notwithstanding these positive developments, fiscal transparency remains quite
constrained and practice based, hence the need for legislation. The legislative instruments
and the financial regulations are mostly silent on disclosure of fiscal information. The
publication of the FY2012/13 budget in the newspapers was simply based on the
recommendations of the PAC. Myanmar does not publish some of the fiscal information that
frameworks like PEFA consider good practice. These include in-year budget reports; year-end
financial statements; external audit reports; information contract awards; and financial resources
availed to primary service units such as elementary schools and primary health clinics. Hence,
there is significant room for legislatively mandating greater fiscal disclosure and ensuring
compliance.

97.     The authorities appreciate the weaknesses that still remain and are thinking
through an appropriate PFM reform program to address these challenges sequentially. In
this regard, the Ministry of Finance and Revenue together with the Ministry of National Planning
and Economic Development are undertaking a comprehensive review of the PFM system4 in
order to articulate a sequenced PFM reform action plan. Some of the core reform elements could
focus on: (i) updating and revising the financial rules and regulations to be in-line with the new
budget-planning practices in the short term and progressively developing an organic budget law
over time; (ii) institutional restructuring, improving data management, including reporting and
accounting, upgrading information technology and capacity building to deliver on core PFM
mandates; (iii) articulating clearly the central-local government fiscal relations system while
incorporating measures to mitigate risks of contingent liabilities that may arise from borrowings
by state and regional governments; and (iv) improving public procurement system. Apart from
these, the Government also plans to formally become a member of the EITI and commence
implementation.

Expected outcome on improving public financial management: At the end of the program
period, it is expected that the critical policy actions of increased budgetary allocation to health
and education and increased transparency of the budget will result in increased actual public
expenditures on health and education.

Policy Area 3: Improving the Investment Climate


Prior actions:
1. The Central Bank of Myanmar has permitted commercial banks to accept various additional
forms of collateral
2. Enacted the Foreign Investment Law
3. Abolished an export first policy on access to foreign exchange for importers

98.      As opportunities for trade and investment open up for Myanmar, improving the
climate for investment will be critical. Ultimately, the most sustainable way of delivering the
dividends of peace, democracy, and economic reforms will come by empowering people to
participate in productive income earning activities. It is for this reason that the Government is
committed to carrying out reforms for increasing private sector investment in the country,
whether foreign or domestic. Increased private sector investment provides opportunities for self
and wage employment, and therefore poverty reduction. Furthermore, increased business
activities and higher employment result in the expansion of the tax base, and hence increased
revenues which can be used to improve the delivery of public services. The reforms that the
Government has been carrying out to improve the climate for investment seek to improve access
to finance, improve the financial infrastructure (platform) to facilitate business transactions,
reduce barriers to entry and the cost of starting and doing business, and removing barriers to
trade.

Improving access to finance

99.     Today, the Myanmar people rely on informal financial services at a very high cost .
Access to formal financial services has been extremely limited and significant unmet demand for
financing remains. It is estimated that no more than 10 percent of population use formal financial
services and formal bank financing reaches only a small sub-set of firms. In the absence of
reliable and accessible formal financial services, the population in both urban and rural areas
turns to informal lenders paying interest rates of up to 20 percent a month. Qualitative surveys
indicate high levels of indebtedness. This lack of financial intermediation is a significant
contributor to Myanmar’s lower levels of economic growth as compared to the region.

100. The Government has taken various measures to improve access to finance. In order
for Myanmar to achieve long-term, broad-based economic growth, it will need a functioning
financial system that provides access to financial services to all types of firms, as well as
households. As a first key step, the Government passed the Microfinance Business Law (MFL)
in November 2011. According to Government plans for improving access to finance, the formal
banking system will be supervised and regulated by CBM while the Myanmar Microfinance
Supervisory Enterprise (MMSE) will take the lead in microfinance sector. The MMSE was
established to serve as a secretariat of the Microfinance Supervisory Committee after the
enactment of the MFL. This law provides a legal basis for the establishment of deposit taking
and non-deposit taking microfinance institutions (MFIs). Currently, the MMSE granted


                                               33
microfinance license to 51 providers by July 2012 and plan to issue 22 licenses more in the near
future.

101. The Microfinance supervisory body was developed from a lending operator but
segregation of duty is now underway. The MMSE was recently upgraded from a lending arm
of GOM to in the chief supervisory body for the Micro-Finance sector. However, the MMSE still
operates both lending operations and supervisory functions, which may lead to a conflict of
interest. It is planned to formally segregate lending functions from supervisory body. In
addition, the MMSE has very limited capacities and knowledge of supervising financial
institutions and thus, there is a risk given the rapid pace at which the MMSE is licensing MFIs.
The MMSE is now receiving technical assistance from the World Bank on enhancing capacities
and the regulatory framework.

102. Reforms are also being implemented to facilitate the expansion of bank lending
more widely. For example, the CBM allowed commercial banks to accept new forms of
collateral including gold, three exportable crops (rice, beans and pulses, sesame), bank deposits,
and personal and organization guarantees in addition to the existing immovable properties.
Besides, there are plans to develop the policy framework for credit information systems in the
CBML, which will help build credit histories of borrowers to enable them to access additional
funds from banks at potentially more favorable terms. These reforms may result in expansion of
bank credit to unbanked individuals and businesses.

Improving the financial sector infrastructure to facilitate business transactions

103. The lack of financial infrastructure poses a major constraint to the CBM’s ability to
execute its functions, and to the overall development of the sector and ultimately to the
efficiency of the economy. Myanmar’s economy is being largely run on a cash basis with high
dollarization and the financial system lacks basis financial infrastructure, including critically a
payment system, which poses a major constraint to the CBM in monitoring, analyzing and
policymaking. Progress in building an interbank payments system has begun, but check clearing
between banks is still manual. Also, the system of automated teller machines (ATMs) is not
coherent and the banks’ systems cannot yet communicate with each other, nor is there any form
of mobile phone or internet banking available.

104. Several reforms have been implemented to improve financial services with easy
accessibility. Firstly, the CBM relaxed its deposit control and allowed commercial banks to
accept deposit up to 25 times of its capital base. Although this is a step in the right direction, the
CBM will need to move to more modern approaches to this, with a focus on standard capital
ratios, which would likely result in more flexibility for many banks to expand. Secondly, the
CBM has also allowed commercial banks to offer more financial products including hire
purchase and foreign exchange services. Also, the CBM continues to allow the expansion of
bank branch networks, especially for the private banks. Currently, state-owned Myanmar
Economic Bank (MEB) has the most branches network (325 branches) and the Myanmar
Agricultural Development Bank (MADB) has 223 branches. In comparison, 19 private banks
have 332 branches in total; of which 14 private banks have 20 branches or less. Again, the CBM
will have to move away from its current approach of requiring additional capital per bank branch

                                                 34
to an overall view of capital for each bank, which should also enable many banks to expand their
outreach more rapidly.

105. The Government has also started payment system reform by introducing the
Myanmar Payment Union (MPU). As a critical and initial step, the CBM launched the MPU
with 17 commercial banks to develop the network for retail payments (i.e., credit cards) and
ATMs. The CBM also plans to implement payments system reform, in particular setting up a
national payment system covering Real Time Gross Settlement and Automated Clearing House
(RTGS/ACH) system. This reform will reduce the risk of a costly payment default and the
possibility of a generalized crisis. This also will eventually decrease the reliance on cash-based
transactions and form the basis for other banking business, such as mobile banking and internet
banking.

Reducing barriers for foreign investment

106. The Government sees attracting high quality foreign investment in key sectors of the
economy as critical to Myanmar’s development. For example, it sees foreign investors playing
a critical role in building the needed infrastructure, such as in telecommunications and energy.
There is also an appreciation that foreign investors can bring technological know-how and
resources not available in Myanmar, and can transfer this to build capacities within the country.
In 2012, the GOM passed the Foreign Investment Law in order to increase foreign direct
investment (FDI). This is a needed first step to bringing in foreign investors as it will provide
clarity on the sectors eligible for investment, how investments need to be structured and licensed,
and what to expect in the process.

107. In anticipation of an increase in demand for business registration as the investment
climate improves, the Government has also started undertaking initiatives for reducing the
transaction cost of starting a business. For a long time, there was only one office in the whole
country for registering a company, located in the capital city, Nay Pyi Taw. Recent increases in
the number of new companies registering have led to congestion at the office, which has
contributed to an increase in in the transaction cost of starting a business. Further, now that the
Foreign Direct Investment Law has been passed, the Government anticipates that demand for
company registration will increase even further. In this regard, an additional company
registration office has been opened in Yangon. There are plans to open a third office in
Mandalay and to introduce a one-stop service and to streamline procedures for registration. In
order to reduce transaction costs for businesses already in operation, the Government has also
extended the registration renewal period from 2 years to 3 years. Going forward, the Directorate
of Investment and Companies Registration is will be receiving TA from the ADB to develop a
roadmap for upgrading the companies registration process itself.




                                                35
108. In parallel, the Government is also taking steps to develop the domestic private
sector, particularly small and medium scale enterprises. In this regard, an SME Center has
been established under the Ministry of Industry (MOI) with the objective of establishing an
institutional and regulatory framework for SME development. This center will also be
responsible for coordinating and developing an SME Policy / Master Plan to help those domestic
entrepreneurs who wish to start up small and medium scale businesses.

Removing barriers to trade

109. The Government also recognizes that removing barriers to trade is critical to
creating a conducive environment for investment and has therefore also undertaken a
number of measures in this direction. First, although Myanmar has been a long time member
of the WTO, it has never gone through a trade policy review exercise. As part of its reform
agenda, the Government has now formally requested the WTO for the review to be undertaken
and preparations for the exercise are now underway. Second, in order to facilitate import and
export processes, the Ministry of Commerce has commenced a pilot of automatic import and
export licensing for a selection of commodities. Third, the Government has relaxed barriers to
trade in the importation of several major agricultural commodities and other products. Examples
include prepared canned foods, confectionary, fruits, and vehicles. Finally, and more critically,
the Government has relaxed some of the restrictions that were in place on access to foreign
exchange. In particular, on April 1st, it abolished the export first policy where previously, only
those importers who had earned foreign exchange through exports could be allowed to buy
foreign exchange for imports. This means that businesses focused on the domestic market faced
limitations on capacity to import goods and services required to meet their capital and operating
requirements. Ultimately, it also limited the country’s capacity to trade internationally.


Expected outcomes on improving the investment climate: At the end of the program period, it
is expected that critical reforms for improving access to finance, reducing barriers to entry and
the transaction costs of starting a business, and removing barriers to trade will result in the
following outcomes: (i) Expansion in bank credit to unbanked men and women based on a wider
range of collateral to be monitored by an increase in the percentage share of credit to the private
sector, (ii) Increase in foreign direct investment, and (iii) Increase in the volume of international
trade

                      Box 2: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality


Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The policy areas being supported by the DPO are aligned to the Government’s strategic objectives
as outlined in the five year development plan and reform priorities as outlined in the draft
framework for social and economic reform. Further, all the prior actions were identified in
consultation with the Government. In turn, as described in an earlier section, the Government has
consulted widely in the formulation of the policy and institutional changes represented by these
prior actions. It has used various platforms for undertaking these consultations.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
There are no other development partners who will be contributing financial resources to the DPO.
However, the preparation has been done in close collaboration with the ADB in the context of a
coordinated approach to arrears clearance. Agreement has been reached with Government and the
ADB on joint monitoring of the reform program.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
Implementation and monitoring arrangements have been appropriately customized to Myanmar’s
own institutional arrangements. The Ministry of Finance and Revenue has the role of coordinating
other ministries and agencies in the fulfillment of prior actions supported by the operation.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
While the DPO supports a broad medium-term reform program, only a few critical actions have
been selected as conditions for disbursement. As outlined in the program document and
summarized in the policy matrix presented in the annex, the reform program underpinning this
operation is broad. However, a conscious effort was made with the authorities to identify critical
actions as conditions for disbursement. The critical actions identified are those with the highest
potential impact on achieving the program’s development objectives.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support
Since this is a standalone operation, monitoring of progress will be with respect to the program
outcomes contained in the results matrix rather than the prior actions. In this context, the process
will be transparent since it will be led by the Government’s own implementation arrangements and
in coordination with the ADB. Progress review meetings will be held with relevant focal persons
from each ministry and agency.

                         VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Poverty and social impact

110. Past and ongoing research highlights the ways in which previous policies have hurt
the lives of ordinary people in Myanmar, particularly in rural areas, which have
necessitated the need for reform. These studies include previous research supported by the
World Bank in Myanmar, such as the Post-Nargis Social Impacts Monitoring (2008-2010) and
the ongoing Qualitative Social and Economic Monitoring of livelihoods in Myanmar (2012).
Such problems included issues related to landlessness, a lack of credit, high interest rates, and
high household debt burdens, which have affected poor and especially landless households the
most and made it difficult for households to cope with shocks. Households have employed a
variety of coping mechanisms to help cope with hardship, including migration and seeking
remittances from relatives, but many of these, such as reducing consumption of food, taking
children out of school and selling or pawning land and other assets, have a negative long-term
impact, and in rural areas households have struggled. Against this background, the reforms
supported under this operation are therefore expected to have a beneficial impact on the poor,
given that they are meant to help address some of these problems.

111. The prior actions for strengthening macroeconomic stability are expected to benefit
the poor, both men and women, through reduced inflation and interest rates. The passage of
the exchange rate management law provides a robust framework for the management of the new
exchange rate policy. Given the paucity of household survey data, a thorough empirical analysis
for assessing the distributional effects of adopting a managed float exchange rate system is
currently not possible. Nonetheless, it is expected that this policy change will have limited
negative effects on the poor. First, depreciation of the local currency following the floatation of
an exchange rate usually tends to result in increased inflation in the short-term as the cost of
imported commodities rises. However, because the vast majority of the private sector had
already been using the parallel market exchange rate which was already high, the adoption of a
managed float has not had any noticeable negative impact on inflation. Second, the depreciated
exchange rate has had a muted impact on inflation because of other policy reforms with
countervailing effects such as the reduction in deficit monetization.

112. Similarly, the prior actions under the policy area on improving the public financial
management are aimed at improving the quality of spending in Myanmar, which is
expected to benefit the poor. Increased allocations to education and health are usually expected
to benefit the poor, especially if allocated to primary and secondary education and primary health
care. The publication of the budget is expected to ensure that citizens are informed about
resources mobilized by Government and how they are eventually utilized through the budget to
meet their development needs.

113. The prior actions under improving the investment climate are also expected to be
beneficial to the poor in Myanmar through increased opportunities for self-employment
and wage employment. The fact that commercial banks are now allowed to accept new forms
of collateral will increase credit access, especially to poor men and women who rely on
microloans. Once passed, the Foreign Investment Law and the abolition of the “export first?

                                                39
policy for access to foreign exchange by importers are expected to boost economic activities in
the country. This will result in the creation of more job opportunities for the poor. Given
Myanmar’s potential in the garment sector, women are expected to benefit even more from new
investments since the sector tends to employ relatively more women than men.

B.     Environmental aspects

114. The specific reforms supported by the proposed DPO are not likely to have
significant direct effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources.
The first two policy areas focus on improving macroeconomic and public financial management
which would not have any direct impact on the environment. However, there is a possibility that
policy area on improving the investment climate may have an indirect impact on the environment
since some of the ensuing investments may not be environment friendly. Given that Myanmar is
emerging from international isolation and that capacity in Government remains weak, a big
environmental agenda lies ahead. Other development partners are providing TA to Government
to more broadly strengthen environmental governance in Myanmar.

Implementation entity

115. Implementation of this operation is being coordinated by the Union Ministry of
Finance and Revenue. However, the actual implementation of the DPO supported reforms will
be done by relevant government ministries, departments, and agencies that are mandated to carry
out the respective reforms. Each agency has a focal person who is responsible for mobilizing
fellow Government officials for meetings and for compiling information and documentation
required for the DPO supported program.

Implementation capacity and available TA

116. Due to weak implementation capacity, the Bank in partnership with the ADB, IMF
and other development partners is providing relevant TA to the extent possible under the
current authorizing environment. Because Myanmar is still in non-accrual status, it is not yet
possible for the Bank to provide TA lending. However, in the context of the diagnostic work that
is currently underway and funded by other development partners, the Bank has been able to
provide policy advice in certain areas as requested by the Government. For example, we have
already been providing policy advice public financial management and financial sector reforms,
including microfinance. Similarly, the IMF has been supporting the Government on
macroeconomic reforms, including central bank reform. The ADB has also been providing
short-term TA with trust funding from Japan in the areas of tax policy and administration, and in
trade policy reform.

Program monitoring and evaluation

117. Monitoring and evaluation of the reform program will be undertaken jointly by the
Bank and Government teams. The Government team will meet regularly to monitor progress in
implementing the reform program supported by the operation. Apart from the policy and
institutional reforms to be implemented by the Government, an M&E framework has also been
developed. The framework describes expected outcomes at the end of the program, the

                                               40
monitoring indicators and specific end of program targets. A Bank mission will be fielded after
one year to assess if the program outcomes have been achieved.

C.     Credit Administration, Disbursement, and auditing

118. Credit amount and waivers to Operational Policies 13.00 (Signing of Legal
Documents and Effectiveness of Loans and Credits) and 13.40 (Suspension of
Disbursements). The Recipient is the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, represented by the
Ministry of Finance and Revenue. The Credit is for 287,750,000 Special Drawing Rights
(US$440 million equivalent). Over and above the usual conditions for effectiveness (receipt of a
legal opinion satisfactory to IDA, the macroeconomic program being satisfactory, and the reform
program on track), Board approval is being sought subject to an additional effectiveness
condition which is reflected in the Financing Agreement, requiring Myanmar’s arrears to the
Bank to be cleared first before the Credit can be disbursed. The Credit will only be released in
one tranche following notification by the Association of Effectiveness of the Financing
Agreement.

119. This operation entails two waivers. The first waiver is to OP13.40 (Suspension of
Disbursements) which provides that no new credits be presented to the Board for approval when
a member country’s credits are in non-accrual status. The second waiver is to OP 13.00 (Signing
of Legal Documents and Effectiveness of Loans and Credits), which does not permit the Bank to
sign legal agreements for a credit if there are overdue payments from the borrower. Both
waivers, which have been endorsed by Management, are necessary to facilitate the complex
transactions involved in the clearance of Myanmar’s arrears.

120. Disbursement mechanism. The proposed operation will follow IDA’s disbursement
procedures for development policy credits. Upon approval of the Credit, effectiveness of the
Financing Agreement, and fulfillment of the disbursement conditions, the proceeds of the Credit
will be disbursed by IDA for direct reimbursement to the institution that extended the bridge loan
for the arrears clearance.

121. Reporting and accounting. The government will provide an irrevocable instruction to
IDA for direct disbursement to the institution that will extend the bridge loan. As a due diligence
measure, IDA will obtain written confirmation from the bridge lender that funds have been
received.

122.   Closing date: The expected closing date of the Credit will be October 31, 2013.

D.     Fiduciary Assessment

123. While Myanmar’s financial management systems remain weak, the overall fiduciary
risk to this operation is rated as ‘low’ because the whole credit amount will be disbursed
into an account outside the Government system. As stated above, while the recipient of this
credit is the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, an irrevocable instruction
will be issued to disburse the proceeds of the credit directly into an account belonging to the
institution that will extend the bridge loan to the Government.


                                                41
E.      Risks and Mitigation

124. Potentially, the risks to the program are high, and are of three main types. The first
is macroeconomic; the second is political risk while the third is the risk due to weak
implementation capacity of the reform program. The three main risks outlined above are
compounded by the paucity of data and knowledge gaps. However, since this operation is aimed
at paving the way for the Bank’s full re-engagement, the country will soon have an enhanced
level of support, including for tackling some of the identified risks and weaknesses. For example,
a multi-donor group that includes the Bank has already started discussing with the authorities a
systematic approach and corresponding TA for improving the quality of data and statistics in
Myanmar.

Macroeconomic risk

125. There is a risk that a suboptimal reform program could lead to deterioration in the
macroeconomic framework due to the significant changes that are being implemented in the
institutions for economic management in the context of limited capacity. For example, a
modern monetary policy framework is still being designed as is the treasury function. Relatedly,
increased access to commercial and concessional borrowing increases the risk of debt distress.
Further, the Government has adopted a policy of granting greater operational autonomy to SEEs
which were previously managed in the same way as other Government ministries and
departments, by being funded through the budget. Given that the financial management capacity
of these entities is not known, there is risk that they could be a source of contingent liabilities.
Natural gas prices can be volatile and a shock to world natural gas price could be destabilizing
given the importance of gas exports for Myanmar’s balance of payments. A mitigating factor
here is that Myanmar’s natural gas exports are under long term contracts with the p rice
determined by a complex formula that should smooth volatility. Finally, as the economy opens
up, a surge in imports poses a risk to the country’s macroeconomic program by putting pressure
on foreign reserves. To mitigate these risks, the IMF is supporting the authorities through an
SMP. Further, the Bank is also working with the IMF and other donors in providing the required
TA for establishing a robust framework for macroeconomic management, including for debt
management.

Political risk

126. In these early days of the transition, there is a risk to the stability of the political
situation in Myanmar, including the peace process and the reform program. First, although
a number of ceasefire agreements have been signed with armed rebel groups, political
settlements are yet to be attained. Furthermore, a ceasefire agreement is yet to be reached with
one of the armed groups, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). Therefore, a return to
wide-scale conflict or an escalation of the conflict in Kachin could destabilize the existing
political environment. Second, reforms are still in their early days. Myanmar’s future depends
on the nature of compromises reached between multiple stakeholders with often incompatible
interests. There is a risk of a backlash especially if some well-intentioned reforms end up
having negative consequences in the short-term. The 2015 elections are shaping up to be an
important turning point for the longer term sustainability of the reforms. To mitigate these risks,


                                                42
the World Bank and other donors will be working to support various initiatives in Government
for consolidating peace and the reform process, including through support to the planned Peace
Center and supporting community based projects that will generate quick tangible dividends to
communities and support to institution building so that reforms transcend personalities.

Implementation capacity risk

127. The systemic problem of capacity constraints in Government will be another risk to
the program that could also cause delays in the implementation of reforms. Since the
country has been isolated for a long period of time, it has not benefited from cross-country
transfer of knowledge or from outside technical assistance in managing the economy. As a result,
while political will to implement reforms is strong, the technical capacity to carry these reforms
remains weak. For example, as outlined earlier, outlined earlier, the country is still in the process
of establishing a proper framework for macroeconomic management as it emerges from years of
international isolation. This is especially a concern since the authorities do not yet have in place
all the instruments for macroeconomic management to ensure macroeconomic stability at a time
when they are embarking on several reforms, which are altering the fundamental economic
landscape. Similarly, there are institutional capacity weaknesses for carrying out reforms in the
other policy areas such as public financial management and the investment climate. In order to
mitigate this risk, concerted efforts are already underway by donors, including the World Bank,
to provide the required TA for strengthening the Government’s capacity to carry out reforms.

128. Overall assessment of risks: In IDA’s assessment, although risks to the operation are
high, potential benefits outweigh the residual risks and warrant IDA’s assistance for
implementing critical policy and institutional reforms in a coordinated fashion with other
development partners, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize the sustainability of
the reform agenda.

Dr. Jim Yong Kim
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20433

Dear Dr. Kim,

                       Subject: Myanmar’s Letter of Development Policy

       On behalf of the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, I write to
request for a Development Policy Credit of US$440 million equivalent from the International
Development Association (IDA) to be provided through the Myanmar Reengagement and
Reform Support Program. The program will support our reform initiatives while the proceeds of
the credit will help to meet our foreign exchange needs as we clear Myanmar's arrears to IDA
and other development partners in the context of our re-engagement with the international
community.

       Since coming to power on March 30th, 2011, the current administration has embarked on
a wide range of reforms aimed at re-integrating Myanmar with the international community and
improving the living standards of our people. This letter outlines some of the key reforms that we
have already implemented and those that we intend to carry as we move ahead.

Economic Situation

        Myanmar is one of the least-developed countries in Southeast Asia. A recent survey does
show that the poverty head count index declined from 32 percent to 26 percent index between
2005 and 2010 but the overall incidence of poverty is still very high. Poverty incidence is around
twice as high in rural than urban areas, with the result that rural areas account for almost 85% of
total poverty. Although poverty incidences are high in nationality areas such as Chin, Rakhine
and Shan States, two central regions account for the highest shares of those in poverty-
Ayeyawaddy (19%) and Mandalay (15%) due to their high populations.

       Other indicators of human development are also low relative to other countries in
Southeast Asia - life expectancy for example is only 62.7 years and the mean years of schooling
for adults is only 4. Myanmar has made some progress towards achieving its Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). However, Myanmar's performance matches that of other ASEAN
nations on only a small number of indicators (gender parity in education, for example). In

                                                45
general, Myanmar is striving to keep up with its ASEAN neighbors as well as progress made in
other developing regions towards attaining MDGs.

        Within ASEAN, Myanmar most similarly resembles the much smaller countries of Laos
and Cambodia, and lags significantly behind Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam on MDG
indicators. When Myanmar's indicators are viewed in the context of ASEAN countries, as well
as against averages in other developing regions across the world, it becomes clear that there is
much room for improvement to reach the 2015 targets. This fact is also reflected in Myanmar's
ranking in the "Low Human Development" category in the recent Human Development Report
(2011), compared with Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand who are all ranked in the
"Medium Human Development" category.

        The Government of Myanmar (GOM) has estimated that it has achieved 10.4% GOP
growth rate in 2011, while the IMF has estimated at 5.3%. Inflation has decreased from double-
digit rate in 2009-2010 to 8.2% in 2011, and it is likely to even decrease further to around 3%
this year. Myanmar is expected to face only weak inflationary pressures in the rest of 2012-13
mainly due to combined effects of falling global food prices as well as surplus of agriculture
produce; however, such scenario can be abruptly changed in case of unforeseen shocks and
disasters. Given the onset of deflation in the first half of 2012, the rate of inflation has eased to
2.6% in mid-2012. By end of 2011, trade balance remains positive with a healthy trade surplus of
800 million dollars; however, imports are also estimated to pick up from 2012 onward.

Myanmar's Reform Framework

        The reforms the administration has been undertaking and plan to implement going
forward are outlined in the Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR). The FESR
draws upon guidelines set by the President as well as the existing priorities set in the Fifth Five-
Year Plan and other annual sector plans and priorities. It sets out the policy areas where
Myanmar will undertake necessary economic and social reforms in the next three years while
laying the basis for subsequent long-term reforms that ought to be implemented. While the
framework is focusing on delivering immediate and tangible benefits to the people of Myanmar
in the shortest possible time frame, it also aims for two broad objectives that are attainable in the
medium-term: First, it seeks to move the on-going reform process forward and make it
irreversible so that Myanmar can become a modern developed nation that meets the aspirations
of its people for a better life. Second, it seeks to accelerate Myanmar's greater integration with
the international community where her cooperation and support can be counted upon in meeting
the regional and global challenges of the twenty-first century. In saying that the FESR aims at
meeting the aspirations of the people of Myanmar, "people" is used in an all-inclusive sense. It
includes members of the Tat-ma-daw, civilians, ethnic nationalities, and members of the
Myanmar community abroad. It is also envisaged that the FESR will help Myanmar achieve
sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, which in turn will facilitate further progress in
the national reconciliation and democratization process currently underway, facilitating
synergistic progress of economic and political advancement necessary for this country to
establish itself as a modern developed nation.




                                                 46
         The FESR emphasizes on the need to move Myanmar towards a market-driven economy,
adopt a bottom-up approach to planning, and move from direct to indirect levers of government
policy in nourishing the development of free markets. It identifies four main policy priorities as
follows: (a) Sustained industrial development in catching up with global economies while
keeping up momentum of agricultural reforms and attaining poverty alleviation and rural
development (b) Equitable sharing of resources, budgetary or foreign aid, among regions and
states while promoting foreign and local investments for regional development, (c) Effective
implementation of people-centered development through community-driven, participatory
approaches to improvement of education, health and living standards, (d) Reliable and accurate
statistics and information to inform public policy decisions.

        Guided by the above policy priorities, the FESR outlines specific reforms and strategies
under six pillars as follows: (i) macroeconomic policies for growth, stability and poverty
reduction, (ii) sector policies for inclusive growth and poverty reduction, (iii) social,
environment and cultural dimensions of development, (iv) national harmony and regional
development, (v) improving governance, and (vi) repositioning Myanmar in the international
community. This letter seeks to highlight the key reforms we have already undertaken and plan
to implement, some of which are being supported by the Development Policy Operation (DPO).
In this regard, the reforms in this letter are presented under the three policy areas covered by the
DPO as follows: strengthening macroeconomic stability, improving financial management, and
improving the investment climate.

Strengthening macroeconomic stability

        GOM recognizes that maintaining macro-economic stability is critical to putting the
economy on a sustainable high growth path while tackling poverty and ensuring effective use of
the country's rich natural resources. To this end, significant reforms have already been
undertaken and further reforms are planned. On April 1, 2012, the GOM embarked on a process
of exchange rate unification by introducing a managed float exchange rate system. A formal
inter-bank foreign exchange market was established to be mediated by the Central Bank of
Myanmar (CBM). Further, in August, a foreign exchange management law was enacted to
provide a legal framework for managing the new policy regime. In order to complete the process
of exchange rate unification, the GOM also plans to remove the remaining restrictions against
exchange rate convertibility and phase out the use of foreign exchange certificates with a
redemption plan by 2013.

        GOM has also undertaken appropriate legal and institutional preparations to be able to
grant operational autonomy and accountability to the independent CBM and is collaborating with
international financial institutions in building the competency and capacity of CBM. The
Government is also preparing a financial sector master plan as the basis for major reform of the
financial sector covering both public and private institutions as well as the development of the
capital market. Part of the plan will be development of the banking sector and strong
encouragement of competition between the private banks in boosting commercial credit and
other financial instruments available to the public.

        On the fiscal front, the budget deficit in FY2011/12 has been narrowed due to lower
capital spending. The GOM suspended major public works and construction projects by strictly
scrutinizing the cost-benefit of these undertakings; therefore, deficit reduction became more
sustainable despite of recent increase in pensions and temporary tax exemptions on key
agricultural exports. The adoption of a market-based exchange rate in April 2012 is expected to
further reduce the budget deficit in FY2012/13. By having a series of in-depth debates on the
FY2012/13 budget, the new parliament is also contributing to lower deficit targets by vigorously
scrutinizing spending priorities and reallocating more resources to poverty reduction, health and
education while cutting major capital spending. To ensure that fiscal discipline is instituted, the
budget law for FY2012/13 includes a borrowing limit. Further, the CBM is gradually limiting the
role of deficit monetization by facilitating more effective use of bond financing, particularly the
development of a retail market for treasury bonds, which would further improve the effective
implementation of monetary policy in the country. It plans to introduce further measures to
completely eliminate deficit monetization.

Improving public financial management

        The Government of Myanmar also appreciates that improving public financial
management through the budget process will be central to achieving its development objectives.
In the FY2012113 budget, the Government increased allocations to education and health which
have generally been underfunded in the past. In order to ensure transparency and accountability
in managing public resources, the approved budget law was published in the Government
Gazette and the local New Light of Myanmar newspaper.

        With the assistance of international financial institutions, GOM is also undertaking a
public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA) and is planning to conduct a
public expenditure review (PER) to provide the basis for more fundamental reforms of fiscal
policy and public expenditure management. Once these reviews are finalized, a sequenced
reform action plan will be prepared to guide implementation of more detailed reforms in the area
of public financial management.

        The Ministry of Finance and Revenue (MOFR) has also begun reforming its tax policies
and revenue administration. In August 2011, the Internal Revenue Department (IRD) abolished
the withholding tax on imports, and also simplified commercial tax on domestic sales to nine tax
rates in April 2012. The IRD also plans to introduce single tax payer identification and self-
assessments to expand the tax base, while plans are underway to replace the commercial tax with
a general sales tax. GOM also plans to convert the existing commercial tax regime into a value-
added tax system using the invoice-credit system. GOM is also actively learning from experience
in other countries in order to mobilize a significant public education campaign prior to the
adoption of such a change.

       Given GOM's reliance on non-tax revenue from extractive industries, the MOFR is now
developing a medium-term public expenditure framework that can streamline all revenue flows
and effectively target them to building infrastructure and human capital. Also, as part of the
process of reforming management of natural resources, the government is committed to
implementing the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), which requires


                                                48
governments to publicly disclose their revenues from oil, gas and mining assets, and for
companies to make parallel disclosures regarding payments.

Improving the Investment Climate

         In order to ensure that Myanmar maintains and accelerates further its recent high growth
rates, the Government is steadily implementing measures to improve investment and business
environment. In November 2012, it enacted a new Foreign Investment Law (FIL). The new law
permits increased ownership by foreign firms while introducing a series of tax breaks and easing
restrictions on the lease of land. The GOM is also preparing the final passage of new law on
Special Economic Zones (SEZ), which is expected to provide additional incentives in strategic
locations along the 1300-mile long coastal region in Myanmar.

        The government is also planning to build capacity among the domestic judiciary with
regard to their regulatory enforcement and intermediations. The investment commission is
currently undergoing a reform process to become an independent board where non transparent
licensing practices will be eliminated. Meanwhile, the GOM is cooperating with international
financial institutions to conduct a comprehensive investment climate assessment to determine the
full spectrum and magnitude of constraints to private sector development. GOM is also taking a
vigorous approach to reducing the transaction costs facing firms in doing business. It will reduce
burdensome regulations and remove restrictive and unnecessary government controls while
streamlining he company registration process and incentives.

        Improving access to finance is also a critical part of Government policy for improving the
investment climate. A Microfinance Law has been passed to improve access to credit by small
and micro-enterprises. More broadly, the CBM has allowed commercial banks to accept a wide
range of collateral from borrowers. It will also encourage public savings through private banks as
well as development of financial instruments such as hire-purchase agreements, mortgage
packages and other credit instruments. CBM also plans to support efficient financing of trade and
export of manufacturing goods, and consider permitting foreign banks to finance externally
oriented economic activities. It will also introduce a policy framework for credit information
systems and credit bureaus in the Central Bank of Myanmar Law and issue underlying
regulations.

        Given the previous history of trade imbalances, Myanmar adopted an "export first" policy
in 1997 while imposing strict limits on import. However, the policy discriminated against
businesses that were oriented towards the domestic market. Therefore, as part of current reforms
for improving the business environment, the export first requirement for importers wishing to
access foreign exchange has now been abolished. GOM has also liberalized import of vehicles,
particularly of low fuel use vehicles and passenger buses, in order to ease the burden of high cost
of transportation in major urban centers. It has also introduced e-licensing systems for export and
import businesses on a pilot basis and plans to introduce this fully once the pilot is proved to be
successful. GOM expects that the easing of economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar by
Western countries will provide more market access for exporters, which will compensate
potential trade imbalances from liberalization measures.



                                                49
        Presently, Myanmar’s export structure is heavily focused on a few primary commodities -
natural resources, notably gas and wood, along with agricultural and marine products. GOM will
therefore pursue an active policy of encouraging the diversification of export products while
promoting value-added processes for primary commodities, including by focusing on improving
support services in areas of trade financing, market access and trade facilitation. It will also carry
out more liberalization measures such as setting up of national single-window, liberalizing
services as well as removing all non-tariff barriers in accordance with the 2015 targets for
ASEAN integration. GOM will also emphasize further cooperation with the World Trade
Organization in removing all its trade barriers as well as with international chambers of
commerce in promoting business-to-business collaboration. It will also strengthen regulatory
capacities to improve inspection and quality assurance services for both export and import
operations and set up a new public facility on consumer protection.

Conclusion

         In conclusion, I am confident that the outlined reforms will help Myanmar realize its
potential as it re-engages with the international community and seeks to improve the living
standards of its people. In this regard, we believe that the support from the World Bank for our
reform efforts through the Development Policy Operation will be critical to ensuring their
success and sustainability. I would therefore like to reiterate the Government of Myanmar's
appreciation for the support received under this program. We look forward to the World Bank's
full re-engagement with Myanmar as we work towards the development of our country.

                     Annex 4: Myanmar—IMF Letter of Assessment
                  MYANMAR—ASSESSMENT LETTER FOR THE WORLD BANK
                                 DECEMBER 7, 2012

Myanmar is in the midst of a historic political and economic transition. After decades of
isolation and conflict, the new government of Myanmar has started an ambitious program of
political and economic reforms with the aims of becoming a modern developed nation and better
integrating Myanmar with the international community. The authorities have already taken steps
to improve their macroeconomic management capacity and begun implementing reforms in key
policy areas, including the exchange rate regime, financial sector and central bank reform, and
the fiscal sector.

Partly as a result, economic performance has improved. In FY 2011/12, growth accelerated
slightly to 5½ percent, bolstered by foreign investment in energy. Inflation fell to 5 percent y/y,
almost half of that the previous year, mainly due to declining food prices, and supported by
reduced central bank financing of the budget deficit. Despite a widening of the current account
deficit to 2½ percent of GDP, FDI inflows saw international reserves rise to US$4.2 billion at
end-September, covering 3¼ months of recorded prospective imports of goods and nonfactor
services. The fiscal deficit rose moderately to 6 percent of GDP. Credit to the private sector
continues to grow rapidly, at 63 percent y/y at end-July, but from a very small base (8¼ percent
of GDP), mainly due to structural factors.

The short-term outlook is favorable. Notwithstanding the difficult external environment,
Myanmar’s economic prospects have improved, reflecting reform momentum and improved
business sentiment following the suspension of sanctions. In FY2012/13, growth is projected to
accelerate to 6¼ percent on the back of rising investment. Inflation is expected to pick up to
around 6 percent, as food prices bottom out. The budget deficit is projected to decline to about
5¼ percent of GDP, with increased spending on health, education and infrastructure. Due to
recent import liberalization and the lifting of some exchange restrictions, the current account
deficit is expected to widen to 4 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, gross international reserves are
projected to rise to around 4 months of imports mainly due to continued robust FDI inflows.

There are several risks to the outlook. On the downside, the main domestic risks arise from
limited implementation capacity. Separately, a potential escalation of the ethnic conflict in
Rakhine state and other border regions could undermine confidence and slow reforms. Global
economic uncertainty also weighs on the outlook, although Myanmar remains mostly insulated
from developments in advanced markets. Myanmar’s largely agriculture-based economy also
remains vulnerable to severe weather events as well as global commodity price shocks. On the
upside, faster response from foreign investors to ongoing reforms could further boost FDI and
growth.

Medium-term prospects appear promising. Over the next five years, growth is projected to
rise to around 7 percent, provided the reform momentum is maintained. The current account
deficit is expected to rise to 5½ percent of GDP, reflecting increased import demand for
investment and consumption goods, and financed mainly by higher FDI. Gas exports, forecast to
peak in FY2014/15, should help boost international reserves and government revenue. Spending

                                                 53
on health and education is projected to increase, consistent with the authorities’ goals. Improved
revenue performance, however, should see the medium-term fiscal deficit narrow to around 4½
percent of GDP, which remains sustainable even under conservative revenue and foreign aid
assumptions.

A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Myanmar is classified as in debt distress
due the presence of arrears. However, the planned resolution of arrears to the World Bank,
Asian Development Bank and Japan would reduce arrears by more than half. Rescheduling of all
arrears on concessional terms and a gradual reduction in reliance on nonconcessional borrowing
as assumed under the DSA baseline, would change the rating to low risk of debt distress. The
standard stress tests do not reveal significant vulnerabilities for external debt under the baseline
although risks to public debt sustainability could emerge in the event of a permanently higher
primary fiscal deficit, permanently lower growth over the medium to long term, or a large
depreciation of the exchange rate. The authorities recognize that a successful resolution of
arrears is essential for Myanmar to re-engage with the international community and ensure debt
sustainability.

Fund relations. The authorities have agreed ad referendum with Fund staff on a 12-month staff
monitored program (SMP) through December 2013 to support their macroeconomic goals, which
include raising growth in a sustainable way, opening the economy, reducing poverty, and
achieving greater equity. To realize these goals, the government recognizes the need to preserve
macroeconomic stability, build a framework and institutions for macroeconomic management,
and continue reforms in key economic sectors. The SMP incorporates critical steps in these
areas. Its central objectives are three-fold: maintaining low and stable inflation within a
consistent macroeconomic framework; building international reserve buffers in light of the on-
going liberalization of imports and the foreign exchange regime; and continuing to build the
institutions and instruments needed to ensure macroeconomic stability. The program takes into
account capacity constraints and focuses on realistic but ambitious measures that equip Myanmar
to manage the risks arising from opening up and liberalizing the economy. It emphasizes moving
toward a unified exchange rate and a more independent monetary policy at an early stage, and
prioritizes strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework before further financial
liberalization to guard against vulnerabilities that may arise from dismantling financial sector
controls in a rapidly changing environment. On the fiscal front, limiting deficits and ensuring
their noninflationary financing will be key to maintaining macroeconomic stability. The program
therefore envisages initial steps to increase tax revenues to allow higher spending on priority
areas while limiting central bank financing and reducing dependence on natural resource
revenues over time. In all these areas, the authorities’ policies will continue to be supported by
IMF technical assistance in coordination with other development partners.
