MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMKARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project in the State
of Mysore for which an IDA credit of US$40 million equivalent is proposed.
It would support a three-year lending program for investments in minor
irrigation, land reclamation and development and farm mechanization, and
would also assist in financing equipment required for Project implementation
and consultancy services.
ii.       Mysore is giving priority to agricultural development aimed
principally at achieving self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Of the State's
total area of about 19 million ha some 11.8 million (62%) are cultivated,
about 75% of the cultivated area being devoted to foodgrain production.
However, production of foodgrains has shown only a 20% increase during the
last decade (from an annual average of 3.8 million ton in 1959/60 to 4.5
million ton in 1968/69). Low crop yields and productivity are largely
attributable to the uncertain rainfall and in some areas drought conditions
are the rule rather than the exception. Substantial surface and groundwater
resources exist but have not yet been fully developed for irrigation purposes.
Only about 10O (1.2 million ha) of the cultivated area is presently irrigated
although it is estimated that water resources are sufficient to irrigate 25%.
The State Government plans to increase substantially the irrigated area over
the next few years and several schemes are already underway.
iii.      Other investments to which the State Government attaches importance
are land reclamation (mostly levelling) and farm mechanization. Land level-
ling is a vital element of irrigation schemes to enable optimum use to be
made of irrigation water. Because of the shortage of manpower and bullock
power in some areas, farm mechanization will be essential if farmers are to
take full advantage of the potential for increased cropping intensity made
possible by increased irrigation facilities, and the use of new high yielding
varieties and fertilizers.
iv.       The Project would assist in financing on-farm investments in minor
irrigation (US$25.0 million), land reclamation (US$18.0 million), farm
mechanization, tractors, and initial spare parts (US$17.3 million), Project
equipment (well-drilling and earth-moving equipment - US$9.7 million), and
consultancy services (US$0.4 million). The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$20.0 million equivalent or about 28% of total Project costs.
IDA would finance US$40 million equivalent, being the foreign exchange compo-
nent and about 40% of the local currency costs. Farmers' contributions would
normally be 20% for minor irrigation and land reclamation investments and 25%
for farm mechanization, except in the case of small farmers (as defined by
the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) and agreed with IDA) when the
contribution for certain minor irrigation investments would be reduced to 10X.



- ii -
v.        It is expected that the remaining finance would be provided by the
Mysore State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB). participattng comert-l4
banks, and the Agricultural Refinsnce Corporation (ARC) which ia already actlnr
as the refinancing and supervising agency for five other IDA supported
agricultural credit projects. However, the LDB and its federated Primary
Land Development Banks (PLDBs) require substantial reorganization. Whllst
the covmercial banks in Mysore are active in the field of agricultural credit,
it is unlikely that they could undertake the entire Project, particularly the
land reclamation component. The reorganization of the LDB and PLDBb is,
therefore, a matter of priority and a financial and administrative reorganiza-
tion program, acceptable to IDA, has been agreed and partially implemented.
By the time of credit effectiveness sufficient PLDBs will have been rehabili-
tated to ensure that the Project will be implemented.
vi.       The IDA credit to the Government of India (GOI) would be relent
to ARC which would be repay about 70% after nine years at an interest rate
of 4-3/4% per annum and the balance after 15 years at 5-1/4% per annum. ARC
would supervise and refinance at 6-1/2% per annum the loan operations of
agreed participating banks. Loans to individual borrowers would bear interest
at 9% per annum and would be repayable over periods of up to ten years, but
extending to 15 years in the case of loans for land reclamation and minor
Irrigation to small farmers.
vii.      The implementation of the minor irrigation and land reclamation
schemes would be by local contractors or hired labor using local materials.
Some 36,000 individual on-farm investments would be made and international
competitive bidding would, therefore, be inappropriate. Tractors to be
procured under the Project would be imported and sold to farmers through
existing commercial channels and orders would be based on individual farmers'
preferences and bulked to obtain quantity discounts. At present eight
foreign tractor suppliers from Bank-member countries are eligible to supply.
Well-drilling and earth-moving equipment would be procured through international
competitive bidding and licenses would be issued for the import of an initial
stock of tractor and earth-moving equipment spare parts procured under the
Project.
viii.     ARC has competent management and is in sound financial condition.
The LDB and PLDBs are being reorganized, and they and the commercial banks
can provide a good framework for Project lending. Financial returns to
farmers, based on prevailing prices, are estimated to range from 19% to 59%.
The rates of return to the economy, based on projected world market prices,
are estimated to be from 12% to 41%. The risks inherent in this Project are
greater than in the previous five agricultural credit projects when the banking
systems were stronger. Nevertheless the risks are considered to be acceptable
in view of the benefits which would accrue to a large number of comparatively
small farmers, and to the economy as a whole. In addition the LDB and PLDB
banking structure would be strengthened which would enable the pace of agri-
cultural development to be accelerated. The appropriate assurances having
been obtained, the Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$40 million.

MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968, an IDA mission, with assistance of the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program, reviewed agricultural credit institutions and on-farm
investment requirements in selected parts of India and identified high
priority agricultural credit projects. Five of these projects (Gujarat,
Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana) have been approved by IDA,
totalling IDA financing of US$147 million; in addition to the proposed
project for Mysore a seventh agricultural credit project in Maharashtra is
under consideration and several others are being prepared with help fro
the FAO/1BRD Cooperative Program.
1.02      Bank Group lending for Indian agriculture (excluding US$23 million
for the Beas Equipment Project under the Indus Treaty) totals US$342 million.
In support of the Government of India's (GOI) agricultural strategy, the
Bank Group continues to give emphasis to on-farm investments.
1.03      This Project was prepared by the Mysore Government, with guidance
from the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC), and follows closely the
pattern established for this type of project by preparation assistance made
available for earlier projects by the FAO/IBRD program. In March/April 1971
Messrs. W. H. Spall, S. J. Khoo, and M. Burer (IDA), and K. E. Anderson and
B. C. Bilbo (consultants) appraised the Project in the field. This report
is based on the Government's project submission and the mission's findings.
II. BACKGROUND OF AGRICULTURE
A. India -/
2.01      The key change in India's Development Plan strategy since the mid
1960's has been to shift the emphasis away from heavy industrialization
towards agricultural development, principally to make the most of improved
agricultural technology supported by water resources development. Accordingly,
priority has been given to increasing irrigation facilities and new inputs such
as farm machinery, improved seed, fertilizers, and pesticides. Increased
emphasis is also being given to research on dryland farming to increase yields
and output of crops.
2.02      Although significant yield and output increases have been achieved
for wheat, the new technology for the other foodgrains has shown to be more
complex than expected. Furthermore, growth in fertilizer and pesticide con-
sumption has slowed down in recent years and difficulties have also been ex-
perienced in the production of certified high yielding seeds. Nevertheless,
1/   A detailed discussion of the present situation and prospects of agricul-
ture in India is given in Economic Situation and Prospects in India,
Report No. SA-25a, May 11, 1971.



-2-
Indian foodgrain production has reached a new record of about 107 million tons
or about 5% above 1969/70. Whilst the new technology has now encompassed more
farmers, its coverage remains restricted, and much needs to be done to enable
more cultivators to make use of irrigation facilities and new inputs that go
with the change from traditional to modernized agriculture.
2.03      An important means to achieve this objective would be to provide
farmers with adequate credit facilities. The Reserve Bank of India has esti-
mated credit institutions will require Rs 15,000 million (US$2,000 million) for
agricultural investment during the current Fourth Plan (1968/69 - 1973/74), or
an annual average of Rs 3,000 million, compared with about Rs 600 million
invested in the crop year 1966/67. The short-term credit requirements would
Increase by an estimated 11% annually, rising to about Rs 20,000 million
(US$2,666 million) by 1973/74. The overall agricultural credit requirements
would increase five-fold from the mid 1960's to the end of the current Plan
period in 1973/74.
2.04      Farm mechanization is still at an early stage.  Some forms of
mechanization such as the use of pumps for irrigation wells, mechanical or
power threshers, and sprayers have increased significantly. The present
number of tractors is estimated at about 120,000. GOI plans to increase the
production of tractors from the current annual output of about 20,000 to 60,000
by the end of 1973/74 1/. During the same period the demand for tractors is
expected to increase to 70,000 a year. High domestic foodgrain prices and
relatively low tractor prices have encouraged the rising trend in tractor de-
mand though this demand can be expected to slow down in view of the decision
taken in May 1971 by the GOI to impose import (30% on CIF prices) and excise
taxes (10%) respectively on imported and locally produced tractors (Annex 1).
The five previous IDA credit projects would assist in financing 19,200 tractors
over the period 1970-1974.
B. The State of Mysore
Area and Population
2.05      The present enlarged State of Mysore (which is divided into 19 dis-
tricts comprising 175 taluks) was constituted in 1956. With an area of about
192,000 kmZ and a population estimated at 28 million in mid-1970 (most of
which live in rural villages), Mysore is the sixth largest and eighth most
populous State in India, accounting for about 6% of the total area and 5%
of the population of the country. About three-fourths of the working force
are engaged in the agricultural sector.
1/ Actual tractor output has lagged critically behind rated production ca-
pacity primarily because of component supply difficulties. In 1970/71
production at 20,000 units represents two-thirds of capacity. Production
by the end of the current Plan has been estimated at 30,000 units
compared with a planned output of 60,000 units (see Annex 1).



-3-
2.06      The State forms the western part of the Deccan Plateau.  Agro-clima-
tically it can be broadly divided into four regions, primarily based on rain-
fall and associated factors. The first is the coastal region of the west with
an annual rainfall of over 3,000 mm; the second is the hilly region, including
the Western Ghats, running from north to south parallel to the coast with an
annual rainfall range of 1,300 mm to 2,500 mm; the third region (the transition
zone), a narrow strip along the eastern slope of the hilly region, has a rea-
sonably assured annual rainfall of from 800 to 1,000 ma; and the fourth is the
dry region of north, central, and south-eastern Mysore where annual rainfall
varies from 400 to 800 mm (Annex 2 and Map). Nearly 70% of the geographic area
of the State is within the low rainfall zone and requires supplementary irrigation.
Agricultural Structure
2.07      Of the total area of about 19.0 million ha, some 11.8 million ha or
62% is cultivated, 14% is under permanent pastures and miscellaneous tree
crops and another 14% is forested. Only about 102 of the land is barren,
uncultivable, or used for non-agricultural purposes. During 1968/69 about
5% of the total cultivated area was double-cropped.
2.08      There are approximately 2.47 million farms in the State.  The average
farm size is about 4.4 ha. About one-half of the holdings are of less than
2 ha; they account for only 10% of the total farm land while 70% of the farms
are less than 4 ha and make up about 25% of the farmland. Holdings between
4 and 18 ha (28% of farms) account for 50% of the total farmland. The remain-
ing 2% of holdings are over 18 ha and represent 25% of the total. About one-
fourth of the total farm land is cultivated by tenants. The State Government
has enacted several laws to provide occupancy (security of tenure) and other
rights, e.g., ceiling on land rents, to tenant cultivators. In addition, the
Small Farmers' Development Agency of Mysore provides subsidies and credit for
on-farm development for the large number of small farms with less than 2 ha,
many of which operate at subsistence level.
2.09      About three-fourths of the cultivated area is devoted to the produc-
tion of foodgrains, essentially cereals and pulses. Cotton, oilseeds (mainly
groundnut), sugarcane, and tobacco are the major nonfoodgrains grown on the
remaining one-fourth. Of total cropped area, the single most important crop is
sorghum or jowar (30%), followed by rice (10%), cotton (9%), groundnuts (8%),
and millets (12%) 1/. Despite the high priority accorded to agricultural
development by the State, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in foodgrains
(cereals and pulses), the increase in output of foodgrains during the past
decade has been relatively small. Production increased only about 20% during
the last ten years, from an annual average of 3.8 million tons in 1958/59-
1959/60 to 4.5 million tons in 1967/68-1968/69 2/. The rate of expansion
barely kept pace with the rate of increase in population, and the State con-
tinues to experience foodgrain deficits.
1/   The millets are ragi (7%) and bajra (5%0.
2/   Foodgrain production would be higher if not for the decline in the output
of pulses.



- 4-
Agricultural Inputs and Services
2.10      Supply and use of fertilizers, improved seed, and pesticides have
increased considerably in recent years. Though fertilizer consumption rose
from about 100,000 tons in the 1960/61 crop season to 308,000 tons in 1968/69,
the latter figure, which represents about 26 kg per cultivated ha, is still
low compared to world consumption.  During the same period, a-large number
of seed farms and seed processing centers (both public and privately owned)
were set up and distribution of improved hybrid seed increased from 1,600
tons to almost 30,000 tons. Pesticides were used on about 2 million ha in
1968/69 compared with 28,000 ha in 1960/61.
..11      The University of Agricultural Sciences in Bangalore (established in
1965) provides an integrated research and education service and post-graduate
training. It operates two agricultural colleges, a veterinary college, a
fisheries college, an agricultural engineering institute, and several research
stations for all the important crops grown in the State. In addition, there
are seven agricultural schools, five in-service training centers, and five
farmer training centers which provide training to lower level agricultural
workers and farmers. The work of the Department of Agriculture includes ag-
ricultural development and extension and arranging for the supply of agricul-
tural inputs to farmers through various agencies as well as exercising effec-
tive control to ensure the supply of quality inputs.
Agricultural Development Priorities
2.12      In common with many of the other states,  the most important objec-
tives of Mysore's current Development Program (1969-74) are to expand the
output of foodgrains to the point of self-sufficiency and to increase the
production of commercial crops, particularly for export. This can be achieved
only by bringing more agricultural land into production and raising the produc-
tivity of existlng farm land through irrigation facilities, and improved in-
puts and methods of cultivation. Reliable and adequate water supplies would
not only increase yields, but would also enable increased intensity of land
use through multiple cropping. To permit timely cultivation and harvesting in
a multi-cropping system, farm mechanization must be resorted to in areas where
there is a shortage of animal power and labor and extensive areas of-such
shortages exist, especially in the north (para 2.17). To obtain maximum out-
put from high-yielding seeds, mechanization would have to be used in conjunction
with adequate amounts of complementary inputs, such as water, fertilizers, and
pesticides. Thus, on-farm investments for land development (Annex 3), irriga-
tion (Annex 2), and mechanization (Annex 1), assume high priority. Since
there are extensive areas which for lack of water cannot be irrigated, the
State has given increasing emphasis to improved dryland farming techniques to
increase crop yields and output.
Irrigation
2.13      There is presently no legislation to control groundwater development,
but it is expected to be enacted within two years. The principal organization
dealing with groundwater is the State Groundwater Cell (SGC) of the Department
of Mines and Geology (created in 1966) which is currently surveying 48 taluks
to define areas suitable for groundwater development (Annex 2). In addition,



- 5 -
studies are in progress on rainfall, run-off, well inventories, water-level
fluctuations, and well design and construction. SGC is adequately staffed and
equipped, but does require technical assistance for detailed hydrologic studies
(para 3.08). Well drilling is done by SGC, the Public Works Department (PWD),
Hysore Agro-Industries Corporation (MAIC), development agencies (such as as-
sistance programs of the Governments of Switzerland and Denmark) and private
contractors. Prices are reasonable and equipment adequate for present re-
quirements, but additional drilling units will be required to complete the
program proposed under the Project (para 3.04).
2.14      Irrigation facilities are far from adequate.  Only about 10% (1.2 mil-
lion ha) of the total cultivated area is irrigated compared with an average of
20% for India as a whole. The most important sources of irrigation are canals
(41%), tanks (33%), and wells, mainly dugwells (26%). Presently about 291,000
wells are scattered throughout Mysore, of which some 40% have electric or
diesel engined pumps, the remainder using animal or manual power. To stimu-
late well construction, loans have, over the past several years, been made to
farmers at a subsidized interest rate (6% per annum), the subsidy (3%) being
contributed to lending banks by the State Government. The popularity of wells
is now established and there is no longer any economic justification for con-
tinuation of such a subsidy program which has been discontinued, except for
loans under the aegis of the Small Farmers Development Agency.
2.15      The p5esent annual discharge from existing wells is estimated at
2,200 million m  whereas the annual reSharge to the groundwater reservoir
is estimated at about 18,500 million m . There is, therefore, considerable
potential for an increase in groundwater use.  In five taluka there are indi-
cations of local overpumping (Appendix 2-3).  Pending the collection and
analysis of more detailed geologic and hydrologic data (para 2.13), the mini-
mum distance between wells should be 250 2 and the adjacent area irrigated
from wells should not exceed 20 ha per km (20% of the surrounding area).
For typical cropping patterns in the Project areas, the adoption of this
criterion would prevent overdevelopment.
2.16      Although several large river irrigation projects and many minor
irrigation works have been completed in recent years, the potential irrigable
area has not been fully utilized, nor has optimum use been made of the
water available, because of lack of land levelling and lift irrigation. Land
levelling and development is essential if the full benefits of existing and
projected schemes are to be realized. The beneficial use of available surface
water supplies could also be increased by lift irrigation schemes.
Mechanization
2.17      In areas of scarce rainfall, particularly in the north (para 2.06),
crop yields have been poor and famine conditions have often prevailed with
consequent low population and bullock densities. However, many of these
areas are changing with the advent of irrigation facilities. Due to scarcity
of animal power, which is not susceptible to quick increase, full advantage
of the new opportunities cannot be taken unless mechanical power is provided.
It is estimated that by 1974/75 an additional 200,000 ha will be sown more
than once a year and this extension of the double-cropped area will of itself



-6-
require additional power on the farm. In much of the newly developed area
there is also an absolute shortage of labor at the critical times of harvest-
ing and land preparation (Annex 1).
2.18      In 1971 about 5,000 tractors were in use in Mysore.  The State Gov-
ernment and MAIC estimated the demand over the next three years, at the then
current prices and price relationships (para 2.04), to be about 5,500 before
replacements. However, the recent rise in prices due to the imposition of
Import and excise taxes (para 2.04), coupled with an expected further rise in
manufacturers' prices (Annex 1), will induce higher levels of tractor utiliza-
tion and will reduce speculative purchases. These factors will undoubtedly
reduce the demand for tractors and although this is difficult to quantify, an
analysis (Annex 1) shows that about 2,000 additional tractors with implements
(taking into account Indian production and imports and allowing for obsoles-
cence) would be needed over the next three years to make reasonably efficient
use of the additional land which would come under irrigation largely as a
result of the proposed Project (Para 3.06).
2.19      Existing sales, repair, and servicing facilities are adequate for
the limited expansion of mechanization foreseen for the next three years.
There are 35 tractor service centers, 25 of which are maintained by dealers
appointed by existing tractor manufacturers in India. The network of dealer-
ships is adequate and well spread. Manufacturers' standards for dealer work-
shops, spare parts facilities, warranty inspections and post-warrauty service
programs are generally high. Dealers are also required to provide on-farm
training to the tractor operator. One manufacturer maintains a training school
for tractor operators and service personnel in Bangalore. In addition, MAIC
handles within the State the distribution, maintenance, and spare part facili-
ties for tractors imported from East Europe. MAIC maintains eight service
centers and plans to establish additional centers. There are also many in-
dependent service shops operating in villages and towns.
2.20      Supply of tractor implements is adequate from two main sources;
tractor manufacturers who either make their own implements or contract with
implement manufacturers to build to their specifications, and small scale
Independent manufacturers. There are 20 implement manufacturers in Mysore.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The Project would be part of the lending program of the State Land
Development Bank (LDB) and its federated Primary Land Development Banks (PLDB)
and commercial banks. It would help finance over a three-year period farmers'
investments in land levelling and reclamation (25% of total Project costs),
wells (32%), lift irrigation (3%), tractors and implements (22%) and an
initial set of tractor and land reclamation equipment spare parts (3%), land
levelling equipment (12%), well drilling equipment (2%), and technical assist-
ance (1%). The Project would be implemented through the LDB and its federated
PLDBs and commercial banks (Annex 6) under refinance arrangements with ARC.



-7-
It would involve lending to individual farmers for land levelling and reclama-
tion (17,000 loans) and for wells (16,000); cooperatives for lift irrigation
(30); farmers and contractors for tractors and implements (2,000); and con-
tractors for self-propelled scrapers, landplanes, and crawler tractors (180).
B. Detailed Features
Land Reclamation
3.02      Investments in land reclamation (about 114,000 ha) would take place
in selected irrigation areas (Annex 3). The major component would be land
levelling, which is essential for the efficient use of available water, but
would also include ditching, bunding, and ripping. Operations are presently
carried out by manual labor, bullock power, bulldozers, and wheel tractors
with levelling blades. These methods are not only slow because of insuffi-
cient power of all kinds, but are also inefficient and costly. Land reclama-
tion can be done more efficiently and cheaply using equipment specifically
designed for the job. Currently costs vary between Rs 2,000-3,000 per ha
whereas with proper machinery it is estimated that it can be done to proper
standards for Rs 1,250 per ha. The Project, therefore, provides for the pur-
chase of 110 self-loading scrapers, 37 land planes, and 37 crawler tractors
for use with the planes and auxiliary equipment (ridgers, dozer blades, sub-
soilers, etc.) which would be purchased by contractors and cooperatives.
Minor Irrigation
3.03      Investments in minor irrigation would involve the sinking of about
5,000 borewells (costing about Rs 10,500 each), 5,000 dugwells (Rs 10,000 each)
in specified areas (Annex 2 and Map), converting 6,000 existing dugwells into
dug-cum-borewells, and the construction of 30 lift irrigation schemes. The
sinking of wells under the Project would be confined to the 48 taluks (sub-
division of a district) where SCC has completed groundwater surveys or where
such surveys will be completed within the Project period (Appendix 2-3). The
wells would only be sunk in the surveyed areas which have adequate groundwater
supplies, and where the minimum spacing between wells would be 250 m and the
adjacent area irrigated from wells would not exceed 20 ha per Km2 (Annex 2).
All wells would be electrified and over and above the investment costs farmers
would be required to deposit Rs 3000 per well with the Mysore State Electri-
city Board (MSEB) to obtain priority for electricity connections. Assurances
were obtained that the MSEB would provide this priority. The deposits (which
are pald direct to MSEB) would be included in the loans extended to farmers
and accordingly have been included in total Project costs. Such deposits
are repayable by MSEB to LDB (on behalf of the farmer) by annual installments
over the life of the farmer's loan together with interest at the appropriate
rate.
3.04      To complete the proposed program within a three-year period,
additional rapid drilling units (down-the-hole, air hammer type) would be
required. Provision has, therefore, been made in the Project for ten
drilling rigs at an estimated cost of Rs 5 million. Most of these would be
purchased by SGC, but other entities (including private contractors) could
purchase if they so wished. Contractors are presently experiencing considerable



-8-
delay in delivery of bits for air hammer drills and it seems unlikely that
Indian manufacturers will be able to supply the increased demand for such bits
generated by the Project. Importation of bits (for an aaount of Rs 3.5 *ll-
lion) has, therefore, been included in Project costs.
3.05      Investments in lift irrigation would involve the construction of
30 schemes designed to irrigate some 14,000 ha. Many such schemes have been
constructed and are being operated by the PWD although in September 1969 the
cooperative movement was given responsibility for promoting lift irrigation.
Farmers are reluctant to form cooperative societies to undertake such schemes
(although 44 Lift Irrigation Cooperative Societies do exist, they operate
mostly old schemes constructed before the present PWD program began) since
they have to pay more for water than under subsidized schemes run by the
PWD. Assurances were obtained that the State Government would cease to
subsidize the financing of lift irrigation schemes and would insist that
beneficiaries pay a water charge which would cover the costs of the schemes.
Under the Project, finance for the construction of lift irrigation schemes
would be made available to cooperatives.
Mechanization
3.06      Mechanization investments would be for imported tractors (2,000
in the 25-55 hp range) and appropriate sets of implements. The higher
powered tractor unit would be used in the black cotton soil areas where
greater power is needed. To ensure maximum tractor utilization and economic
benefits, farmers and contractors would be required to have at least three
Implements for use with their tractors and to purchase post-warranty service
on tractors for the life of the loan. Assurances on these matters were
obtained.
3.07      The Project would also include provision for an initial spare
parts set of 15% of CIF value for tractors.
Consultancy Services
Groundwater
3.08      Although the SGC is considered to be among the best such State
organization in India, there is a need for technical assistance for setting
up and carrying on detailed geologic and hydrologic analysis (para 2.13). The
Project would accordingly include a component for financing such technical
assistance, including the necessary hydrological equipment, to carry out
such studies and train SGC counterpart personnel (Annex 2). It is considered
that two specialists (a hydrologist and a hydrogeologist) would be required
for a two-year period. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that after consultation with, and on terms acceptable to IDA, a hydrologist
and hydrogeologist, recruited from international sources, would be appointed
by the effective date of the credit unless alternate arrangements, accentable
to IDA, for the provision of expertise through a reorganized CGWB could
be made.                             I

/4   Dealers pay cash on delivery of spares which they hold for future sale.
As a local currency contribution to minor irrigation investments, GOI
would make available to ARC the equivalent in rupees of the amount
disbursed by IDA in foreign currency for spares.
3.11      The proposed IDA Credit of US$40 million (Rs 300.0 million) would
finance about 57% of total Project cost and its refinancing (Rs 275.3 million)



- 11 -
of the lending program would supply about 80% of ARC support of the Project
(Re 337.4 million). The transfer by GOI to ARC of the amount for tractor and
land levelling equipment spare parts (Rs 15 million) would increase IDA's
share of ARC's refinancing to about 85%. IDA financing of the total Project
cost is based on (a) the foreign exchange cost of tractors (plus initial
spares), land reclamation and well drilling equipment (plus spares and
accessories) and consultancy services, and (b) the foreign exchange costs and
about one-half of the local costs of minor irrigation and land reclamation
investments. IDA financing of foreign exchange items would amount to Rs 150.2
million (US$20 million) or 50% of its total contribution while local cur-
rency financing would total RB 149.8 million.  No IDA finance would be provided
for the tractor implements for which GOl insists on local procurement.
3.12      The IDA credit would be on normal terms to GOI which would make
the proceeds relating to the lending program available to ARC under a
subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to IDA and partly repayable at the end
of nine years at an interest rate of 5% for ultimate loans not exceeding this
period (estimated at about 70% of the total) and partly at the end of 15 years
at 5-1/2% per annum for longer maturities; in each case there would be a
rebate of 1/4% per annum for prompt payment and GOI would bear the exchange
risk.  ARC would on-lend to the LDB and participating commercial banks under
agreements acceptable to IDA at an interest rate of 6-1/2% per annum computed
on outstanding indebtedness. LDB would, in turn, on-lend to PLDBs at 7-3/4Z
per-annum which would lend, like commercial banks, to ultimate borrowers at
9% per annum. The balance of the IDA credit in respect of drilling rigs and
consultancy services would be made available by GOI to the Mysore Govern-
ment. Assurances on these arrangements were obtained during negotia-
tions.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.13      The execution of minor irrigation and land reclamation works
would involve small and labor intensive operations on individual farms and
would not, therefore, lend itself to international competitive bidding.
Adequate well drilling and mechanized custom services are available within
the State.
3.14      Tractors, including an initial set of spare parts, would be
imported, but would be limited to makes from Bank-member countries (and
Switzerland) which have either manufacturing facilities in India or have
been licensed to manufacture by GOI and have obtained clearance for import
of capital goods. Presently eight firms would be eligible for importing
under this Project; David Brown, Massey Ferguson, International Harvester,
Ford and John Deer all from the U.K.; Deutze (Federal Republic of Germany);
Nuchimen Co. (Japan); and Daimler (Austria).



- 12 -
3.15      Tractor procurement would follow the arrangements agreed for the
previous five agricultural credit projects in India and would combine bulk
purchase based on farmers' demand with sales effected through the establish-
ment of a committee with representatives of GOI, the State Government, and
ARC which would, in consultation with IDA, direct the procurement of tractors
(and other imported goods - para 3.17). Organizational responsibility would
rest with the MAIC, working under the direction of the comuittee. Assurances
were obtained that tractor procurement would be in accordance with these
procedures.
3.16      While procurement would be restricted to local sources and there-
fore no IDA financing would be provided, supply of tractor implements Including
trailers, from Indian manufacturers is adequate for Project requirements.
Implement prices are reasonable and the quality of the implements is of an
acceptable standard.  However, there has been a shortage of hard steel for
some components which has caused delays in the delivery of certain implements.
An assurance was obtained that the GOI would ensure that adequate supplies-
of hard steel would be made available to implement manufacturers for implements
required under the Project.
3.17      Some well drilling equipment and earth-moving equipment is
manufactured in India. Procurement would be by international competitive
bidding (Indian suppliers would be given a 15% preference or the prevailing
customs duty, whichever is lower for purpose of bid comparison). Bits for
hazuaer drills, would also be procured by international competitive bidding.
All such goods would be procured under the direction of the committee (para
3.15) and assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
3.18      Initially spare parts for tractors and earth-moving equipment (at
15% of CIF value) would be imported under Project finance. Additionally,
it would be agreed that annually over the succeeding four years after dis-
bursement, GOI would make available foreign exchange for spare parts for each
make of tractor imported under the project, equal to 10% of their CIF prices
or such other percentage as agreed between GOI and IDA from time to time.
In the case of earth-moving equipment, GOI would undertake to make available
foreign excha-ge for spare parts for each make of earth-moving machine
imported under the project up to an amount necessary to ensure an adequate
supply of spares during the execution of the project.
Disbursement
3.19      IDA disbursements are expected to extend over 3-1/2 years (Annex
8). Against appropriate statements, disbursements would be 661 of loans
for minor irrigation and 60% of loans for land reclamation. IDA would also
make disbursements against the CIF cost of tractors and earth-moving equip-
ment and spare parts for both; well drilling equipment and accessories; and
the foreign exchange cost of consultancy services and related equipment.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Introduction
4.01      The Project would be implemented through the LDB apex systes
(para 4.06) and commercial banks, whose lendling operations would be controlled
by ARC through its refinance mechanism. While LDB's management needs strength-
ening, many of its federated PLDBs are presently in such financial and manage-
rial difficulties they could not participate in the project without prior
rehabilitation (para 4.15). Progress of such rehabilitation would be a
decisive factor in setting the pace of Project implementation. Consequently
ARC was invited, prior to niegotiations, to review the financial and
managerial position of all PLDBs and prepare a detailed rehabilitation program.
During negotiations the criteria to be applied by ARC to PLDBs for participa-
tion in the Project were agreed (para 4.15). At the time of negotiations
14 PLDBs had already been satisfactorily reorganized.
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
4.02      ARC, which is already well-known to IDA, is a suitable institution
for the overall administration of this Project and is described in detail in
Annex 4. A medium-term staff development program, acceptable to IDA, has been
agreed and is being implemented. In addition, RBI has established a depart-
ment to assist ARC with the rehabilitation of cooperative credit institutions
in all states whose administrative and financial position make them unsuitable
for participation in ARC lending schemes.
4.03      ARC would ensure that all lending banks follow policies and pro-
cedures agreed with IDA (Schedule A). Loan agreements, acceptable to IDA,
would be entered into between GOI and ARC (this agreement incorporating the
terms and conditions specified in para 3.12) and the execution of such an
agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness. ARC would also
enter into loan agreements, acceptable to IDA, with LDB and participating
commercial banks.
4.04      Commercial banks would be expected to play a significant role in
Project implementation. Three large banks are already engaged in
substantial lendings to agriculture. These banks have separate agricultural
credit departments with adequate trained staff. Under the Project, ARC
would determine the suitability of any bank to participate on the basis of
its past performance in agricultural lendinS, including record of loan
collection, and the adequacy of qualified staff to handle an increased
number of agricultural loans effectively. Assurances were obtained from
ARC that only those commercial banks capable of effective implementation of
agricultural loan operations, would be allowed to participate in the
Project. ARC would invite such banks to participate.
4.05      ARC would instruct participating commercial banks to maintain
separate accounts for Project lendirg and would ensure that such accounts
were audited by auditors acceptable to IDA. In all instances, it is expected
that these would be the present auditors which are reputable firms. ARC's



- 14 -
own auditors would continue to be subject to IDA approval. Assurances on
these points were obtained during negotiations.
Mysore State Cooperative Land Development Bank Ltd. (LDB)
Organization and Management
4.06      The LDB (Annex 5) was registered on November 25, 1929 with head-
quarters in Bangalore. It has 19 branch offices (one in each district) and
is the apex organization for a network 170 PLDBs. Since PLDBs can borrow only
from the LDB, the LDB and its federaited PLDBs have an operational relationship
similar to that of a bank head office to its branches.
4.07      LDB's operations are regulated by the Cooperative Societies Act
1959 and its bye-laws. Its 23 member Board consists of 19 members elected
by PLDBs, three nominated by the State Government (one of whom shall be the
managing director of the LDB) and the president of the Mysore State Coopera-
tive Apex Bank (Ex-officio). The Board works through an eight-man Executive
Committee. The PLDBs, with a total voting membership of some 400,000, also
elect their own committees which control their operations and appoint staff,
including the managers.
4.08      The managing director of the LDB is its chief executive.  He is
appointed by the State Government, in consultation with the Board, and must
be an officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service Cadre of Mysore
State or an officer of the Cooperative Department or an RBI officer. The
secretary of the LDB, who is the managing director's deputy, must be an
officer of the Cooperative Department and is appointed by the Board in
consultation with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Whilst the
present incumbents of these posts are able administrators, neither,
unfortunately, has had any previous banking experience. Such a situation
may have been acceptable when the LDB's operations were concerned with
loans based on the value of collateral only instead of development criteria
and lending volume was comparatively small, but under present conditions a
much greater degree of banking and financial expertise is required. The
present serious overdue position (para 4.13) and 4.14) may, to a large
extent, be attributed to lack of guidance and control from the apex
organization. The LDB managerial staff, therefore, needs strengthening by
the addition of at least two experienced credit specialists who would
assist the managing director in the proposed reorganization of the LDB and
PLDBs (para 4.15). ARC has indicated that it would be able to assist in
providing personnel of the required caliber. An assurance on this was
obtained during negotiations. The appointments would be a condition of
credit effectiveness. It would be preferable if, in future, LDB employed
experienced banking staff (which could come from within the organization)
to fill the top managerial positions. Assurances were therefore, obtained
at negotiations that the by-laws of LDB would be changed to permit the LDB
to employ and appoint a managing director and secretary with suitable
qualifications and experience irrespective of their former affiliations.
This would be a condition of credit effectiveness.



- 15 -
4.09      Each district branch manager of the LDB has discretion to approve
loans, sent to him from PLBDs in his district, up to a limit of Rs 5,000 each.
Larger applications are sent to headquarters for approval. Branch managers
do not supervise PLDBs nor do they check or evaluate loan applications from
PLDBs. They are largely concerned with checking the collateral offered as
security. Managers and loan supervising officers (LSOs) lack knowledge of
appraisal techniques, particularly those relating to incremental returns,
and training courses for these officers have been instituted so that they
can effectively supervise PLDBs and properly evaluate loan applications
(para 4.15). The LDB maintains a pool of 129 trained officers for
secondment to PLDBs. As at March 31, 1971, there were 83 such officers (not
all managers) working in PLDBs and this number is being increased. A
further 50 officers are now under training.
4.10      Presently the staff of LDB numbers some 200 (including the PLDB
pool) many of whom are graduates with considerable service with the bank
(from 15 to 25 years). In recognition of the change in lending policy
towards loans based on development criteria rather than value of collateral
a further five technical officers (graduates in economics and/or agricul-
ture) are being recruited who would assist in training loan officers in new
appraisal and lending techniques relating to incremental returns.
Resources
4.11      The LDB derives its resources from share capital contributed
by PLDBs and the State Government; the issue of ordinary, rural and
special debentures; and short-term borrowing from the State Bank of Mysore.
As at June 30, 1970, paid-up share capital amounted to Rs 28.7 million
(US$3.8 million) of which the State Government's contribution was Rs 6.0
million (US$0.8 million) or about 21%; ordinary debentures outstanding were
Rs 357 million (US$47.6 million); rural debentures Rs 13 million (US$1.7
million); and special debentures Rs 42 million (US$5.6 million). Borrow-
ings may not exceed 20 times the paid-up share capital plus reserves.
4.12      The main resources of funds of PLDBs are members' share capital
(each borrower must own share capital equal to 5% of loans) and loans from
the LDB. As at June 30, 1970, total share capital of all 170 PLDBs amounted
to Rs 27.2 million (US$3.6 million) whilst total outstanding borrowings
from LDB amounted to 363 million (US$48.4 million).
Operational Results
4.13      The LDB's loan portfolio has increased steadily, from Rs 93 mil-
lion (US$12.4 million) in 1964/65 to Rs 366 million (US$48.8 million) in
1969/70. Presently LDB's lending rate to PLDBs is 7-3/4% per annum and
small profits have been made (Rs 1.7 million or US$226,000 in 1969/70).
Reserves amount to Rs 2.2 million (USS293,000 or only about 0.5% of loan
portfolio). The arrears position was ihowever, most unsatisfactory. The
collection rate by LDB from PLDBs was 70% in 1969/70 compared with 71% in
1967/68 and 68% in 1968/69. Such a situation was endangering LDB's finan-
cial viability. Ilowever since appraisal drastic action has been taken



- 16 -
(para 4.15), and LDB can now be considered a suitable channel for IDA
lending. The collection rate has improved to 75%.
4.14      Operating results of PLDBs vary but, on the whole, are unsatis-
factory. The arrears position is bad, overall default being some 47% com-
pared with 43% in 1968/69.  Out of 170 PLDBs only 45 have a default rate
of 25% or less and of those only some 25 are in proposed Project areas
(15 in one area alone). In April 1971 profit and loss accounts for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1970, were not available from more than half of
the PLDBs. Of the remainder some 35 (or nearly 50%) were operating at a
loe. Such a situation is the result of poor management, relaxed lending
policies, particularly use of inadequate appraisal techniques and ineffective
supervision and collection of loans, as well as lending on the basis of
borrowers' political influence with little regard to the proper use of loans.
Reorganization of LDB and PLDBs
4.15      Since their inception the LDB and PLDBs have been dependent on
Government assistance and this is reflected in their organizational and
managerial structure and poor finanicial situation. A substantial re-
organization is required. A financial and managerial rehabilitation
program, acceptable to IDA, has, with the assistance of ARC, already
commenced. There are 153 PLDB in Project areas, 12 of which are not
susceptable to immediate rehabilitation. Of the 141 remaining 50 are
already acceptable as lending channels for IDA funds. The rehabilitation
plan requires that LDB, with continuing assistance from ARC, will carry
out the financial and managerial reorganization of the remaining 91 PLDBs,
50 by the date of credit effectiveness and 41 by September 30, 1971. It
is anticipated that by the effective date all 91 PLDBs will have been
rehabilitated; 14 have been reorganized since the program was approved by
IDA in October 1971 and the State Government has provided Rs 7.5 million
to enable the program to be completed. The main features of the rehabili-
tation scheme will include:
(a) Financial reorganization. No PLDB will be permitted to
participate in the Project where arrears (adjusted as
below) exceed 25%. An analysis of arrears as at June 30,
1971, has been made and overdues for each PLDB will be
reduced to 25% or less by transferring to a suspense
account the amount of chronic overdues (e.g., those deemed
irrecoverable; outstanding for three or more years;
resulting from non-productive lending such as debt redemp-
tion, etc.). Collection efforts in respect of these debts
will, however, continue. Where such financial restructuring
effects the viability of PLDBs (as determined by LDB and
ARC) the State Government will, to the extent necessary,
provide assistance in the form of redeemable share capital.
To this end the State GovernmenL has paid over to the LDB
Rs 7.5 million which is considered adequate to enable the
rehabilitation to take place. These measures will constitute



- 17 -
the first stage of a continuing program for PLDBs and
efforts will be made to increase the percentage of
recoveries, including the institution of legal action
against persistent defaulters. If any PLDB fails to
maintain a recovery rate of 75%, ARC will, after consul-
tation with and agreement by IDA, discontinue refinancing
such PLDB under the Project.
(b)  Managerial reorganization.  A financial reorganization
would not be effective unless at the same time management
and lending procedures and criteria were improved. To
this end: (l) the management of LDB will be strengthened
by the appointment by the effective date of two experienced
credit specialists (para 4.08); (ii) any PLDB requiring
major financial reorganization will, under directions from
the Registrar of Cooperatives, be brought directly under
the management of LDB and statutory orders to this effect
have been issued; (iii) the LDB branch offices will, with
ARC assistance, be reorganized to maintain effective
supervision over PLDBs within their districts; (iv) proper
appraisal and lending procedures based on development
criteria rather than on the value of collateral will be
introduced; and (v) training courses (in collaboration with
ARC) for managers and staff of both the 1DB and the PLDBs
to teach new appraisal and lending techniques, particularly
those relating to incremental returns resulting from
investments, have been established.
The implementation of the above mentioned rehabilitation program will ensure
that by the effective date there is an adequate banking structure to adminis-
ter the Project.
4.16      The LDB accounting system is adequate but the accounting system
of PLDBs needs examtnatlon a- *c #*-t of reorganization (para 4.15).  Since
results for the year ended June 30, 1970, were not available in April 1971
in respect of some 85 PLDBs, the auditing system needs to be improved. As
is the usual Indian practice, the accounts of the LDB and PLDBs are required
to be audited by auditors from the State Cooperative Department. The LDB
should arrange for the auditors to assist the PLDBs to reorganize their
accounts to conform with good accounting practice, thereby facilitating
the auditing function. The State Cooperative Department should also ensure
that the auditing of the PLDBs would be done efficiently and on time, so
that the audited financial statements of the PLDBs would be available within
4 months following the close of the fiscal year. Assurances that these
measures would be implemented were obtained during negotiations.
Commercial Banks
4.17      There are 13 major commercial banks operating in Mysore of which
ten are nationalized. Together they provide about 1,000 branches throughout



- 18 -
the State, the most important being the Syndicate Bank (218 branches),
Canara Bank (159), and the State Bank of Mysore (131).
4.18      Since nationalization in 1969 commercial bank lending to agricul-
tzre has increased substantially and as at December 31, 1970, some Rs 240
illion (US$32 million) was outstanding. Downpayments by borrowers vary
ftom 25 to 40% and interest rates range from 8-1/2% to 10-1/2%, repayment
usually being required within five years. Security requirements consist of
i charge on equipment purchased and usually, though not invariably, a
ibrtgage over land to the extent of double the amount of the loan.
*.19      It is envisaged that commercial banks would play a significant
role in Project implementation. They indicated their willingness to do so
and three such banks (the Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, and the State Bank
of Mysore) are already active in this field. As at December 31, 1970, they
had a total of some Rs 166 million (U';$22 million) outstanding in
agricultural loans. Whilst it is at yet too early to assess the trend in
civerdues, the indications are that they are substantially less than those
dt the LDB or PLDBs and active steps are being taken against defaulters.
4.20      Participating commercial banks would be required to agree that
they would accept the terms laid down by ARC for Project loans 8nd would
naintain separate accounts for Project funds, such accounts to be subject
tb audit by auditors acceptable to ARC and IDA (para 4.05).
Mysore Agro-Industries Corporation Ltd. (MAIC)
4.21      MAIC's organizational role in the Project would provide the
mechanism required to carry out the various procedures involved in
establishing farmers' tractor requirements and arranging for procurement
of goods under the Project. The various procedures and procurement arrange-
ments are detailed in Annex 7. MAIC has the necessary experience and
competence to carry out this role effectively (para 2.19). In all delibera-
tive matters, MAIC would be under the direction of the committee to be
established for the purpose (para 3.15) and there would, therefore, be no
cbnflict of interest if a tractor manufacturer decided to use its facilties
as distributing agent.
State Groundwater Cell (SGC)
4.22      The SGC would be responsible for prescribing the criteria for
the sinking of wells (para 3.03). It would also assist lending institutions
by field visits to applicants' farms and certification as to whether a loan
application met the specified criteria. No loan would be issued without an
SMC certificate.
Lending Policies and Terms
4s.23     Loan conditions would conform with agreed terms and appraisal
criteria as provided for in Schedule A. Interest rates would be as specified



- 19 -
in para 3.12. An assurance to this effect was obtained during aegotiations.
4.24      Based on their cash flows, the following maximum repayment periods
for loans and minimum contributions from borrowers under the Project would
be appropriate:
Grace   Years of              Borrowers' Contributio/a

/1   Includes borrowers' contribution to PLDB share capital and value of
farmers' own labor.
/2   Repayment would commence in year following completion of well.
The downpayment by borrowers for land reclamation equipment (contractors
and cooperatives) has been fixed at 10% to encourage the purchase of new
types of equipment without which the proposed land reclamation program
could not be completed within the Project period.
4.25      It is recognized, however, that some small farmers may have
difficulty in finding the full proposed contribution to investment costs
and accordingly for minor irrigation investments not exceeding a cost of
Rs 10,000 each, borrowers' contributions would be reduced to 10% while for
land reclamation investments and minor irrigation investments (excluding
pump sets) the maturity would be extended to 15 years. ARC has evolved
criteria (acceptable to IDA) for the definition of small farmers.
4.26      An assurance was obtalned that for all similar types of
lending participating banks (LDB, PLDBs, and commercial banks) would apply
the same criteria as for Project loans and would not charge lower interest
rates, except for schemes submitted under the aegis of the Small Farmers
and Marginal Farmers Development Agencies in Mysore.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARMERS' BENEFITS
Production
5.01      Under the Project, about 142,000 ha would be irrigated which would
allow about 36,000 farmers to: (a) obtain more reliable and higher yields
from areas of sparce and uncertain rainfall; and (b) increase the cropping
intensity on these areas of which some 50,000 ha would benefit from the use
of the tractors to be supplied under the Project. At current prices, farmers
are expected to expand output of foodgrains, cotton, grourinut, vegetables,
and mulberry for the production of raw silk (Annex 11). The annual increase



- 20 -
In production at full development is estimated at about 192,000 tons of
foodgrain, 21,000 tons of seed cotton, 44,000 tons of groundnut (unshelled),
87,000 tons of vegetables and US$5.25 million equivalent of silk cocoons
(Anex 9).
Marketing
5.02      The incremental output of foodgrains under the Project (about 5%
of the current production) would help reduce the current deficit. Host
farmers sell their produce at any one of the 186 regulated main and sub-markets
which are well spread throughout the State. These regulated markets ensure
that fair marketing practices prevail and farmers are able to sell at
competitive prices (Annex 10). Substantial investments to establish more
regulated markets, expand storage and grading facilities and increase the
staff of the Marketing Department have been included in the State's current
Development Plan.
Prices
5.03      The GOI continues to encourage agricultural production, particularly
of foodgrains, through price incentives; the minimum support prices
reco-muended for Mysore have been lower than the actual market prices received
by farmers in that state.  Current farm prices for the various crops grown
under the Project are shown in Annex 11. As India expects to achieve
self-sufficiency in foodgrain production within the present decade, the
substantial increase in production envisaged for the country as a whole can
be expected to exert a downward pressure on prices, though it is unlikely
that the Central Government and particularly the state governments would
permit any significant reduction in prices. In Mysore, the State Government
sets minimum prices which ensure a fair return to the farmer. The financial
returns to farmers of Project investments have been subject to a sensitivity
test to allow for possible future price declines (para 5.04). Domestic
prices are significantly higher than world market prices for several
commodities which would be produced under the Project. For example, proj-
ected world market prices 1/ are lower than current domestic farm prices
for sorghum (jowar) by about 23 per cent and wheat by 30 per cent. Projected
world market prices for these and other crops grown under the Project
(Annex 13) have been used to estimate the economic rate of return.
Farmers' Benefits
5.04      Production and incomes of farms under the Project would
increase substantially. Financial returns and income to farmers have been
estimated on the basis of sample farm models (Annex 11). Family labor has
been included in production costs because in most of the Project areas there
is a labor shortage. The imputed family labor has been valued at prevailing

Export Projections Division of IBRD's Economics Department.

market rates for farm labor. On the basis of investment costs, estimated
yields and current prices detailed in the _wdels, farm incomes after debt
service would increase as follows at full development:

/3   The financial rates of return should not be looked at in relation to
the investment cost and net incremental income figures in this table
as the figures are incomplete for the purpose of estimating the
financial rates of return. For detail figures on which the rates of
return have been estimated, see Appendix 12.
The six illustrative farm models show that significant increases in the
net incomes of farmers would result from the proposed Project investments
when combined with the use of improved seeds, fertilizer, adequate water
and other inputs which can reasonably be expected. On moderately well
managed farms, the financial rate of return is estimated to range from 19%
to 59% at current producer prices (Annex 12). Assuming a decline of 10%
in prices or yields, the financi#1 rates of return would range from 12 to 44%.



- 22 -
5.05      Except for the plantations, farmers in Mysore do not *ay any
agricultural income tax. Though a minimal fixed land tax, education and
local fund cess are imposed, they are not based on farmer's income. The
Project would not therefore generate any direct tax to be collected from the
estimated incremental incomes. However, some tax benefits would accrue to
GOI and the State Government through import, sales and excise taxes imposed
on tractors and other machinery and equipment to be procured under the
Project (para 6.01).
5.06      The contemplated levels of mechanization which would be required
in order to make the most productive use of the expected increase in irri-
gated land, would generate a net increase in employment through the year.
This would be brought about by the increase in the intensity ol land use
which would require additional labor, both family and paid l*bor. A rough
estimate is that farming operations under the Project would generate an
increase of about 20 million man days of work a year of which about one
half would be additional hired labor. Assuming each hired labor would
work 250 man/days a year, this would mean the equivalent of about 40,000
additional workers would be hired by farms under the Project.
5.07      Current high foodgrain prices combined with low tractor pricee
could if continued lead to an over-capitalization of Indian agriculture, since
high financial returns can be obtained even with low levels of t;actor
utilization. However, this potentially undesirable development will
be avoided in view of the recent decision by the GOI to impos- a.
30% import tariff plus a 10% excise tax on tractors. The resultant signifi-
cantly higher tractor prices are desirable leading to not only M slowing
down in tractor demand, but also to a fuller and more economic use of
tractors. In addition, the tendency to substitute tractor power for
labor, encouraged by the previously low and unrealistic pricing of
tractors, would be reduced.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      Investments in land levelling and reclamation, minor irrigation,
and farm mechanization under the Project would benefit at least 36,000
farmers, including many small farmers who would be able to take advantage
of tractor custom services. Benefits to the Indian economy would include:
(a) reduced instability in agricultural production and (b) an annual incre-
ment in production of about Re 316 million as a result of greater intensity
of land use and shifts to more labor intensive and higher value crops; and
(c) tax benefits accruing to GOt and the State Government through import,
excise, and sales taxes levied on tractors, machinery, and other equipment
under the Project, which are estimated to bring in a total of 2out Re 70
million.
6.02      Based on producer prices, the rate of return to the economy would
be high. However, prices received by producers are high compared with world
market prices. Making the appropriate adjustments in respect of tames and



- 23 -
taking projected world market prices for 1975, the economic rates of return
for the enterprises would range from 12% to 41% (Annex 13).
6.03      It is becoming increasingly necessary to be able to judge more
precisely the financial and economic benefits which actually result from a
project.  To this end, during negotiations, an agreement would be sought
with ARC for the establishment of a system for monitoring and evaluating the
financial and economic benefits resulting from agricultural credit projects.
6.04      Secondary benefits such as the value added from processing Project
products have not been taken into account in estimating Project returns.
In addition, there would be the indirect benefits which are difficult to
quantify, such as the demonstration effect on other farmers, the strength-
ening of the lending institutions, and more year-round employment for farm
workers. These factors, though not quantifiable would add to the already
adequate economic rates of return.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) tractors and their initial spare parts would be imported
on the basis of farmers' choice and through arrangements
for bulk procurement (para 3.15);
(b) land reclamation equipment, including spare parts, and
well-drilling equipment, including bits, would be procured
through international competitive bidding (Indian supplies
having a 15% preference or prevailing customs duties,
whichever is lower) (para 3.17);
(c) lending banks would follow agreed lending policies and
procedures as set out in Schedule A (para 4.03); and
(d) LDB, with the assistance of ARC, would, by September 30,
1972, complete the financial and managerial rehabilitation
program of PLDBs (para 4.15).
7.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be:
(a) the appointment, after consultation with and on terms
acceptable to IDA, of a hydrologist and hydrogeologist
(para 3.08);
(b) the execution of subsidiary loan agreements between GOI
and ARC acceptable to IDA (para 4.03);



- 24 -
(c) the change of LDB by-laws to permit the LDB to employ
and appoint a managing director and secretary with
suitable qualifications and experience irrespective of
their former affiliations (para 4.08);
(d) the appointment by LDB in consultation with ARC, of two
experienced credit specialists (para 4.08); and
(e) the completion by LDB, in consultation with ARC, of a
financial ancl managerial reorganization, acceptable to
IDA, of 50 PLDBs (para 4.15).
7.03      The proposed Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$40
million under normal IDA terms.

SPACING OF DUGWELLS AND TUBEWELLS IN AREAS OF CRYSTALLINE ROCKS
In order to prevent groundwater mining and, at the same time,
to minimize overcapitalization of wells in areas where wells yields may
vary considerably due to local aquifer conditions, the minimum spacing of
wells shall be determined by the following formula, applicable to elementary
watersheds:

where:          S    =    distance between wells in meters.
m   _    annual watering of irrigated land in mm.
rmm   =    annual recharge, in millimeters, to
groundwater from rainfall, seepage from
canals and tanks, return flow from
irrigation occurring in the likely
recharge area of the well, to be calculated
from field observations on water level
fluctuations, run-off gauging and soil

FARM MECIANIZATION
A. Tractor Economic Justification
The Effects of Technological Caanges in Agricultural Production
1.        A large part of Mysore suffers from sparse and variable rainfall.
In consequence traditional agriculture based itself in the areas of rivers,
tanks (small reservoirs), and more dependable rainfall. In the regions of
undependable rainfall cultivation was spasmodic. Many areas in the dry
north were considered famine areas and are still characterized by low
population and bullock density.
2.        This situation is rapidly changing with the advent of the new
technology. Canal projects, lift irrigation schemes, and wells are giving
farmers an assured water supply applicable as and when they need it. With
the new high-yielding seed varieties come substantially increased production
opportunities, provided planting is timely and fertilizer is applied. The
new technology calls for a greatly increased supply of power on the farm.
Alternative Power Sources
3.        Timeliness of cultivation is not presently possible in many areas
of Mysore because of scarcity of manpower and bullock power (the overall
ratio of bullock pairs per ha is estimated at 1:9). It is estimated
(Appendix 1-1) that if all available power were used there would still be
about 2.5 million ha of cultivatable land which could not be properly
and timely prepared.
4.        Theoretically increased animal power could be provided by
breeding more bullocks or by importing from other States. However, increased
bullock power requires additional fodder production which prevents expansion
of other higher value crops. The present total bullock population of
Mysore requires about one million ha of fodder crops to be grown.
5.        In addition, in the black cotton soil areas it is difficult to
develop enough power with bullocks to plow to the optimum depths. Two and
three pairs of bullocks are used to pull a single plow which is held in the
ground by from three to five men. This further exacerbates the power
shortage.
6.        In order to meet the power shortage and improve the standard
of land preparation in the black soil areas Mysore farmers are turning to
mechanization. Extended use of mechanical power permits timely olanting of



ANNEX 1
Page 2
rabi crops after kharif crops and enables the area sown to both kharif and
rabi crops to be increased because of more speedy land preparation. In
the critical periods of peak power demands (May - July and September -
November) a tractor can be worked 24 hours a day whereas a pair of bullocks
can only do eight hours. With bullock power cropping intensities can be
raised only by adding a short duration crop or a crop requiring relatively
little labor in the rotation.
Effects of Tractor Cultivation
7.        The argument against the introduction of mechanical power where
unemployment or underemployment exists is that it displaces labor with no
alternative work opportunity, thus aggravating the unemployment problem.
However, in Mysore there is a general overall shortage of manpower at
peak periods (para 3) and the Project development areas, where most of the
irrigation development will take place over the next three years, and
where it is envisaged most new tractors will go, are located in regions
of low population and bullock density. Although labor inputs per operation
are reduced by mechanization, the increased production from the double
cropping, which is facilitated by more timely and speedier land preparation,
increases labor requirements for harvesting and marketing thereby helping
to counter any negative employment effect.
8.        In addition, there will be a number of indirect employment
effects in the agricultural and other sectors which will influence the
overall employment situation. The need for tractor maintenance and supply
services as well as increased factor and produce marketing facilities in
use will have a positive effect on overall employment.
9.        The net effect on total labor use is difficult to quantify with
any precision. There is, therefore, an urgent need for in-depth research
to study the problems that follow in the wake of the present rapid spread
of mechanization in India. Arrangements have been made for such special
studies to be undertaken with financial support from the Bank at both the
Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Punjab Agricultural University,
Ludhiana.
Tractor Pricing
10.       In previous agricultural credit projects (Punjab, Andhra Pradesh,
Tamil Nadu, and Haryana) concern was expressed over the relative underpricing
of imported tractors in relation to current crop prices in India (particularly
wheat). It was considered that at the then prevailing prices there was a
danger of farmers underutilizing tractors with a consequent waste of scarce
capital resources. It also tended to distort the farm power-mix to the
detriment of labor. IDA, therefore, made representations to GOI which has
now obtained release from GATT arrangements which bound tractors at a zero
import duty. GOI has imposed an import duty of 30% on all imported tractors
and farm machinery plus a 10% excise duty on all tractors, effectively
increasing the price of imported tractors by 43%.  In addition, manufacturers
in some Bank-nmeiber countries have indicated that by early 1972 they expect
tractor prices will have increased by about 25% over current CIF prices.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
These increases, which are greater than the premium on imported tractors
in the second-hand market (50%), will restore the hp/price relationship,
which has been distorted. It will also discourage investment in tractors
unless high levels of utilization are achieved, thereby preventing uneconomic
-use of scarce capital resources and over-capitalization of farmers and will
avoid artificially favoring mechanized power against labor.
Tractor Price and Tractor Utilization
11.       The Tractor model for this Project (Model VI at Annex 11) gives
a financial rate of return (using the higher prices mentioned in para 10) of
28% on the basis of 1,200 hours of tractor use per year on 40 cropped ha
of irrigated land. However, this return is not strictly attributable to
the tractor alone but reflects the better use of all inputs made possible
by tractor power. The increase in investment costs will necessitate an
increase in the number of hours worked as compared to other credit projects
which has always been considered desirable.
12.       Assuming that, instead of buying a tractor himself, the farmer
has all tractor services provided by a contractor, and that these are
charged at current rates for normal tillage operations of Rs 18 per hour,
the financial rate of return on the tractor model goes up to more than
100%.  In practice, because he cannot rely on getting contracting services
as and when he needs them, the farmer prefers to invest in a tractor himself
to reduce uncertainty.
13.       On the assumption that service charges remain constant at current
levels, the financial rate of return to a contractor, under varying levels
of intensity of tractor utilization is illustrated at Appendix 1-2. This
shows that at the higher tractor prices forecast tractor utilization must
be of the order of 1,200 to 1,500 hours per annum to give a reasonable rate
of return to the contractor.
14.       In future lending banks must appraise tractor loan applications
much more carefully than in the past to ensure that borrowers will be able
to achieve a sufficiently high rate of tractor utilization to service the
loans. Indications are that in future a tractor would require to be worked
for 1,200-1,500 hours per annum to be an economic proposition.
Tractor Supply
15.       Tie following table sets out the supply position over the past
three years, together with estimates of the tractor availability position
in India during the next five years (1971/72 to 1975/76):

2/  Excluding imports under IDA credits, as these are earmarked for
specific States under credit projects. As at June 1971 maximum
limits for such tractor imports during 1971-75 amounted to 19,200
made up as follows:
Gujarat              2,200
Punjab               8,000
Andhra Pradesh       1,500
Tamil Nadu           1,500
Haryana              6,000
19,200
16.       There are at present six Indian tractor plants, three of which
manufacture in association with companies in Bank member countries. In
addition, GOI was considering proposals for establishing five further plants
which would involve collaboration with Bank member countries, to bring
the aggregate additional licensed capacity to over 100,000 tractors per
annum. Hitherto mainly because of component supply difficulties, Indian
tractor output has lagged behind rated production capacity, reaching only
17,099 in 1969/70, against a licensed capacity of 30,000 units. Indications
are that 1970/71 production will not exceed 20,000 units. It is thus
extremely difficult to forecast the expected future increase in Indian
production, but it would appear that by 1975/76 total tractor output from
existing and new plants might be of the order of 38,000 units per annum.
Thereafter, as initial establishment difficulties are overcome, production
might well increase at a faster rate.
17.       In the last decade, most tractor imports have come from Eastern
bloc countries under trade agreements. Agreements negotiated during 1969/70
covered a further 25,000 tractors expected to arrive during the next three
years. Thereafter, such imports may be expected to decline, particularly
since the program of future Indian production envisages the manufacture
of Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, and Russian tractors at plants with a total
licensed capacity of 32,000.



ANNEX 1

18.       On average, Mysore has been receiving about 3-1/42 of total
Indian supplies over the past three years. On the basis of this share
remaining unchanged and the forecast supply position outlined above,
Mysore would receive about 3,400 tractors during the three years ending
1974/75.
Tractor Demand
19.       After reviewing Mysore's future irrigation and reclamation programs
and taking into account past performance, it is estimated that between
1972/73 and 1974/75 some additional 200,000 ha will be sown more than once
and this extension of the double cropped area will of itself require
additional power on the farm. Little increased availability of human and
animal power can be expected, so mechanical power must be provided if the
full benefits are to be achieved from the increase in cropping intensity.
2o.       The State Government and MAIC estimated the demand over the
three-year period at about 5,500 additional tractors. Previous agricultural
credit projects have assumed a minimum coverage of 40 ha per tractor.
However, with the increase in tractor prices (para 10) with a consequent
high utilization requirement it is reasonable to assume that the minimum
coverage will increase. Hlours of productive agricultural work will, in
future, have to be of the order of 1,200-1,500 hours per tractor per year
rather than 1,000 hours as previously estimated. The price increases will
also undoubtedly influence consumer demand. Assuming a coverage in future of
50 ha per tractor per year and an increase (over the three-year period) in
the area sown more than once of 200,000 ha some 4,000 additional tractors
would be needed. As calculated in para 18 above, Mysore's share of Indian
general tractor availability during the three years ending 1974/75 would be
about 3,400. When deduction is made for replacements of the existing park,
the additional supply will amount to about 2,000 tractors. Importation of
2,000 tractors under the Project would thus be economically justified to
enable the planned expansion to take place and the benefits realized, most
of which would derive from other Project investments (land reclamation and
minor irrigation). It is considered that even at the enhanced prices there
will be a sufficient number of farmers and/or contractors willing to purchase
2,000 imported tractors.
21.       On this basis, the tractor park in Mysore would grow from
4,700 in 1970/71 (at 40 ha per tractor, representing coverage of 2% of the
total cropped area - 10 million ha) to about 9,700 units in 1974/75
(representing coverage of about 3% of the cropped area). The increase in
number of tractors would lead to improved service and spare part facilities,
thus increasing the efficiency of the existing park.
Future Trends
22.       Mysore farmers are accepting the new technology at an increasing
pace.  The completion of additional irrigation and land reclamation projects
during the next few years will further increase the demand for power on farms.
The increased cropping intensity coupled with higher yields will lead to a
growth of marketing, transport, storage, and processing services. Increased



ANEX 1
Page 6
'mechanization will also lead to an expansion in manufacturing and servicing
facilities for tractors and other farm machinery. These factors should create
mew employment opportunities in rural areas.
B. Tractors - Technical Considerations
'Background
.23.       In Mysore the land in Project areas, where most of the development
Utn irrigation and land levelling will take place during the next three years,
falls into two main types - heavy black cotton and red loam soils. Whilst
,bullock power may be adequate for land preparation on the red soils, the
'black cotton soils are much more difficult to work and better results are
;Obtained with mechanization. There is also the problem of sparse population
and limited animal power.
24.       The demand for muore power for farming operations is reinforced
,by the farmers' rapidly growing transport needs arising from the increase
in marketable surpluses. Farmers continue to market the bulk of their
outPut as and when it is harvested because of lack of proper on-farm storage
facilities and because there are no incentives to compensate for on-farm
storage costs and losses. In Mysore rural roads are lacking and many of
those which exist are in poor condition and unsuitable for lorry transport.
Additional power is, therefore, required not only to enable farmers to market
their increased Oroduction resulting from the new technology, but also to
bring to their farms inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizer, and
pesticides. Until an adequate road network is constructed, farmers will
rely increasingly on tractors for transportation.
25.       The ultimate selection of tractors will, under Project procedures,
be governed by "farmers' choice". It is anticipated that the demand will
be for tractors in the 35-50 hp range with the higher powered machines going
to the black cotton soil areas where greater power is required.
26.       In view of the present supply/demand position in India, tractors
required for the Project would need to be imported. The importation of
tractor components which are either not manufactured in India or are in
short or unreliable supply would not meet the case as prompt delivery of the
finished tractor could not, under present conditions, be assured.
Tractor Outlet, Repair, and Spare Part Facilities
27.       Indian tractor manufacturers maintain in all some 35 tractor
service centers in Mysore, 25 of which belong to dealers appointed by
manufacturers with technical collaboration in Bank member countries
(Appendix 1-3). Dealers are required to maintain designated standards of
workshop, servicing, and spare part facilities and to provide on-farm
training to tractor operators and farmers. They also offer free warranty
inspection and post warranty service schemes.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
28.       MAIC handles the distribution within the State of tractors
imported under bilateral trade arrangements with East European countries,
notably from Czechoslovakia, Russia, Rumania, and the German Democratic
Republic. To provide service, repair, and spare part facilities for the
tractors it distributes, MAIC maintains a main workshop in Bangalore
and eight diatrict workshops. It has plans for four more district
workshops plus some mobile units as well as the appointment of private
contractors as sub-centers.
29.       In addition to the dealer and MAIC network of servicing units
there are many small workshops in towns and villages often run by
mechanics trained by tractor manufacturers or MAIC. One tractor cooperative
has started a repair and spare parts service for farmers' tractors as well
as its own.
30.       Whilst existing repair and servicing facilities are reasonably
adequate, tractor suppliers under the Project would be required to
demonstrate that they have adequate facilities in Mysore to handle the
increased demand. If such suppliers do not already have such an organization,
it would be open to them to provide it either through the appointment of new
dealers or by utilizing the services of MAIC, or by a combination of both
methods.
Tractor Implements
31.       Under existing LDB credit schemes a farmer acquiring a tractor
and implements is limited to a loan of Rs 30,000 which acts as a disincentive
for him to purchase sufficient implements for the full utilization of the
tractor. Under the Project, loans would be made to cover 75% of the combined
cost of a tractor and at least three approved implements (including a trailer)
to ensure maximum tractor utilization and economic benefits.
32.       The most commonly used implements in Mysore are those required
for preparatory tillage work, plows and disc harrows, together with trailers.
There is, however, a growing demand for levellers, cultivators, seeders,
ridgers, and spraying equipment. There appears to be an adequate supply of
reasonable quality and prices from three main sources, namely:
(a) tractor manufacturers who either make themselves or
contract with implement manufacturers to construct to
their specifications, implements for use with their
make of tractor;
(b) local small-scale manufacturers of whom there are
20; and
(c) small-scale manufacturers in other States.
In most cases implements manufactured under the control of tractor
manufacturers are the most satisfactory.

MINOR TRRIGATION
A. Wells
Geology and Hydrology
Geology
1.        The State of I!ysore is situated on the Peninsular Shield of
Southern India, an ancient plateau developed on the underlying igneous and
metamorphic rocks. Physiographically, the State can be divided into four
regions:
(a) Coastal Region - a narrow coastal plain along the Arabian
Sea at the wesLern boundary of the State, extending in
places as far as 40 km inland to the western Ghat edge;
(b)  Malnad Region - the hilly or mountainous area lying east
of the Ghat edge and coastal plain, with elevations up to
1,500 m;
(c) Northern Mfaidan Region - a broad, undulating plateau in the
northern half of the State east of the Malnad, with elevation
generally 350-650 m; and
(d) Southern Maidati Region - a broad, undulating plateau in the
southern half of the State, with more local relief and with
elevations generally 600-1,000 m.
2.        Essentially all of the State has igneous and metamorphic rocks of
pre--Cambrian age either exposed at the surface or covered with a thin mantle
of alluvium or residual soils. Principal rock types are granites, gneisses,
and schists. In the extreme northern part of the State, stretching from
Belgaum to Bijapur, these ancient rocks are covered by the horizontal basalt
(trap) volcanic flows of the Deccan plateau; these basalts are up to 100 m
or more thick in Mysore, becoming much thicker to the north in Maharashtra.
3.        The igneous and metamorphic rocks are weathered to depths of
as much as 30 m in places, the depth depending upon such factor as rock type,
topography, and climate. Deepest zones of weathering are generally beneath
the broad valleys, becoming thinner on slopes and with only a minor amount
under ridges. The weathered materials are predominantly sandy or gravelly
with varying amounts of clay.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        All of the proposed minor irrigation projects (wells and lift
irrigation) are within the Northern Maidan and Southern Maidan regions of
the State.
Climate
5.        Annual average rainfall within the Project area generally varies
from 550 to 850 mm with the lower values in the central and eastern areas.
Most of the rainfall comes froim the southwest monsoon, beginning in late May
or early June and continuing until late September or early October. Almost
no rainfall occurs in the period December to March. The total annual rain-
fall in all areas is subject to wide variations; rainfall in individual years
ranges from less than 50% to nearly 200% of the average annual rainfall.
Maximum rainfall observed in a 24-hour period is generally from 150 to 180 mm.
6.        Mean monthly temperatures vary from 20-25C in the cooler months
of November through February to 27-33C in April and May. A summary of
rainfall and temperature data is given in Appendix 2-1 for the northern area
(Gutbarga), north-central area (Raichur), south-central area (Chitradurga),
and southern area (Kolar).
Surface Water
7.        The Project area is drained by several major river systems which
flow eastward through the States of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to discharge
into the Bay of Bengal. The principal rivers, from north to south, are the
Bhima, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Hagari and Cauvery.
8.        Storage reservoirs have been constructed on the larger rivers to
supply water to canals for irrigation. The largest of these reservoirs
is the Tungabhadra with maximum storage of about 3,700 million m3 and a
potential for irrigating, on a famine-relief basis, an area of 235,000 ha.
The total area irrigated in Mtysore from Government or private canals was
375,000 ha (in 1967) or about 37* of the total irrigated area in the State.
Much of the surface runoff is also utilized for irrigation by the construction
of tanks (small reservoirs) created by low dikes across the natural drainage-
ways.  These tanks, particularly numerous in the Southern Maidan region,
furnished irrigation water to 320,000 ha (in 1967).
Groundwater
9.        Essentially all available groundwater within the Project area
occurs witlhin the zone of residual weathered materials overlying the igneous
and metamorplhic bedrocP or in joints or fractures within the upper zone of
unweathered bedrock. Alluvial deposits along major river valleys, potentially
suitable for groundwater development from shallow tubewells, are of minor
extent and the lands in such valleys are already largely irrigated from
canals, tanks, or shallow open wells. In the extreme northern areas, with
basalt (trap) flows at the surface, groundwater occur: in the somewhat more
permeable interflow zones as well as in the upper zone o'i weathering. The
thickness of the upper weathered zone in areas of potential groundwater



ANNEX 2
Page 3
development is typically about 10 to 15 m, occasionally reaching a maximum
of about 30 m. Significant joints or fractures in the bedrock, which can
yield some water to wells, are usually found only above a depth of 30 to 40 m.
Essentially no water is found in the bedrock below a depth of 50 m and drill-,
ing or boring beyond that depth is useless.
10.       Recharge to groundwater occurs primarily from direct infiltration
of rainfall, supplemented by seepage from streams, tanks, reservoirs, and
irrigation applications.  Groindwater discharge includes the withdrawal of
water from wells, evapotranspiration by plants and from soils, and lateral
flow to low-lying areas where the groundwater surfaces to contribute to the
base flow of streams. Because of the geological and hydrological conditions
that exist in M!ysore, any intensive development of groundwater must rely
primarily upon the amount of recharge that is available in the immediate
vicinity of the development.
11.       Groundwater quality throughout most of the State is of suitable
chemical quality for all uses, including irrigation. In some localized
areas, particularly in the northern part of the State, shallow groundwater
is brackish. This condition probably results from the concentration of
dissolved salts by evaporation. In a few instances the mineral content of
the water is too high for either domestic or irrigation use.
Groundwater Organizations
12.       There are a number of public and private organizations that are
directly concerned with the investigation or development and utilization of
groundwater in Mysore.
State Groundwater Cell (SGC)
13.       The principal organization dealing with groundwater in Mysore is
the State Groundwater Cell which was established in September 1966 as a wing
of the Department of Mines and Geology (Ministry of Industry). The Director
of the Department of Mines and Geology is in overall charge of the SGC, aided
by a Technical Assistant in the Bangalore head office.
14.       The 5CC operates in the field through 11 division and two sub--
division offices, each such office staffed by a division geologist and two
assistant geologists and with additional supporting personnel (junior
engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, and clerks) as necessary. The location of
the division offices is as follows:

15.       In addition to the field offices, four additional units of the SCC
are maintained in Bangalore:  the drilling, geophysical, laboratory, and
well testing units.  The drilling unit also maintains a general purpose
workshop at Ingaldhal near Chitradurga. The unit is headed by a drilling
engineer with a staff of four assistant drilling engineers, four junior
engineers (mechanical), 12 drillers, 33 assistant drillers, 33 helpers, and
an additional supporting staff of 20 to 30 persons (mechanics, drivers, etc.).
The unit is presently operating about 30 calyx boring rigs throughout the
State wlich are completing about 300 borewells each year. The geophysical
unit is staffed by a geophysicist, two assistant geophysicists, and supporting
personnel for field and office work. The unit is presently equipped to
conduct electrical resistivity and magnetic surveys and plans to have
shallow seismic capability in the future. The laboratory unit maintains
facilities for chemical analysis of water samples at Bangalore and at
Dharwar, each headed by a chemist. These laboratories have been analyzing
400 to 500 samples of surface water or groundwater per year. The well
testing unit was establislhed to provide information to agencies such as the
Mysore State Electricity Board and Agriculture Finance Corporation on the
suitability of existing wells for electric pumpset installations. The unit
is staffed with a senior geologist and 12 assistant geologists.
16.       The principal activities of the SGC are concerned with the collection
and evaluation of information relating to the occurrence and utilization of
groundwater in Mysore. Surveys have been completed in 24 taluks, and are
in progress in 24 additional taluks, to define the areas suitable for ground-
water development. Each such taluk survey includes a general report on the
estimated quantity and the quality of groundwater and a map (scale 1 inch =
1 mile) showing location of wells, water table, and land surface contours,
recommended arcas for groundwater development and location of electrical
distribution lines. In addition, many villages have been mapped (scale
1 inch = 660 feet) to show actual areas irrigated from wells. General studies
are in progress, on a state-wide basis, concerning rainfall and runoff, well



ANNEX 2
Page 5
inventories, water-level fluctuations, geophysical studies to determine
depth of weathering, and well design and construction.
17.       The SGC is considered to be the best such State organization
in India. It is well staffed and equipped and has already developed much
information in its survey reports to guide properly the future development
of groundwater. The principal need of SGC at the present time is technical
assistance in basic and detailed hydrologic studies of typical environments
to permit a refinement of estimates of recharge and the quantity of ground-
water that may be developed safely.
Central Groundwater Board (CG'B)
18.       The Central Grounidwater Board, under the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, was established recently by the Government of India to replace
the Exploratory Tubewells Organization which for 15 years had been engaged
in the investigation and testing of thick alluvial and sedimentary aquifers
in India.  Although the CGWB will continue with exploratory deep drilling,
the emphasis of the new organization will be on overall water resource
studies and the operations will be extended to include the "hard rock" areas
of Indiai (which includes Mysore and adjacent States).
19.       At the present time the professional staff of CGWB includes
46 hydrogeologists, 15 engineers, eight chemists, and one hydrometeorologist
witlh headquarters at Faridabad near New Delhi. Additional staff will be
employed in 1971 to meet the requirements of special projects in Rajasthan,
Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh, involving 28 hydrogeologists, 14 engineers, and
three hydrometeorologists. Transfer to CGWB of the activities and staff of
the groundwater wing of the Geological Survey of India is scheduled for the
immediate future. This sector of the Geological Survey, which for 20 years
has been engaged in well inventory projects, comprises a staff of 126 hydro-
geologists.
20.       A part of the CG14B proposed activities will be of direct benefit
to the Mysore SGC, incltuding a cooperative program with USAID which would
comprise a team of seven experts to study "micro-project" hard rock areas
of approxitiiately 13,000 km2 (5,000 mi2) each. One such "micro-project" would
be in flysore State.
Otlher Organizations
21.       Otlher organizations dealing with groundwater in Mtysore are
concerned primarily witlh drilling and water development. Such organizations
include the Agro-Industries Corporation, IMinistry of Agriculture (Agricul-
tural Engineering), Public Works Department (Minor Irrigation and Public
llealth Engineering), Foreign Cooperative Programs (Swissteco, AFPRO, Myrada,
etc.), and numerous Taluk Development Boards as well as private water devel-
opment contractors.



ANNEX 2

Present Groundwater Development
22.       In 1968 there were about 290,000 irrigation wells in the State.
Each well, on the average, irrigates an area of about 1.5 ha. About 12,000
new irrigation wells have been completed each year since 1961. The total
annual withdrawal of water from wells for irrigation is estimated to be
2,200 million m3. The number of wells, and average irrigated area per well,
for the 48 taluks within the State that will have had groundwater surveys
completed and which are the taluks recommended for inclusion in this Project
are given at Appendix 2-3.
Well Types
23.       Almost all of the existing irrigation wells are open dugwells.
These wells are typically 10 m across (either square or circular) and about
10 m deep. The wells are dug by hand labor, usually employing groups or
families in a village that specialize in this work, supplemented at times
by members of the owner's family. When the digging has reached the water
table, temporary portable pumps are installed to lower the water level so
that excavation can proceed. A stone wall (steining or curbing) is constructed
when necessary, to prevent caving of the walls of loose or unconsolidated
weathered rock and soil. Digging normally stops when relatively fresh bed-
rock is reached although in some instances it is necessary to blast the rock
in order to reach an adequate depth below the water table. The time required
to complete a dugwell ranges from a few months, in exceptional cases, to as
much as two years or more. Typically, a well is completed in about 1-1/2
years, depending upon geological conditions and the availability of labor.
The surface area occupied by the well and spoil piles ranges from 0.1 ha to
as much as 0.4 ha.
24.       The yield of water from the dugwells is usually from 65 to 90 m3
per day. This volunme is typically pumped from the well in a period of four
to six hours and it then requires the remainder of the 24-hour period for
the water level to recover in the well. Because it is not possible to dig
the well much below the water table, the availability of water is affected
greatly by the general lowering of water levels during the dry months each
year. Many dugwells become dry for a few months each year, and even in the
case of the better wells it is usually impossible to irrigate as much area in
the rabi season as in the kharif.
25.       The cost of a dugwell varies considerably, depending upon the
size, depth, and excavation conditions. Costs for a well, without pumping
equipment, range from about Rs 3,500 to more than Rs 20,000 with an average
of Rs 6,000 to 8,000.
26.       In recent years, largely through the educational efforts of the
SGC, many owners of dugwells have improved their yield and irrigation capa-
bility by boring small diameter holes inside the well to tap the fissured
or jointed bedrock at greater depth. These "dug-cum-borewells", or "revital-
ized" wells, have almost always shown some increase in the availability of



ANNEX 2
Page 7
water in m3 per day. Another particular benefit, because the wells then
penetrate to a greater depth below the minimum water table, is that the
yield is maintained throughout the year and the area irrigated in the kharif
season can also be watered in thie rabi.
27.       The boring inside the existing dugwells is done with small,
portable calyx--type rigs which are readily available throughout the State.
Boring a total of 30 to 50 m, in three or four shallow holes, usually
requires two to three weeks. The cost of the boring is usually not more
than Rs 2,000.
28.       With the increased availability of equipment, particularly the high
speed air-rotary haimer drills, an increasing number of farmers are installing
borewells for irrigation. These small diameter (150 mm) wells are also being
installed for village water supplies. There are presently at least 2,000
such borewells in the State, several hundred of which are used for irrigation.
2 '.      A typical borewell is about 38 m deep with steel casing installed
to bedrock. The casing is slotted or perforated opposite the permeable
water-bearing zones. TIhe average sustained yield of the borewells is 1 to
1.25 liters per second (800-1,000 gphr) and the supply is maintained through-
out the year. The total area that can be irrigated fron a borewell is
comparable to that which can be served from a good dugwell or dug-cum-borewell.
The cost of a borewell is about Rs 6,000 and the total cost, including pumping
equipment, is comparable to a dugwell with pump. The special advantages of
the borewell are that it can be completed and put into production rapidly
(less than one week), it does not require removing valuable irrigable land
from production in order to construct it, and it provides dependable water
supplies for irrigation in both kharif and rabi seasons - even in dry years.
Pumping Equipment
30.       About 40% of all irrigation wells in Mysore are equipped with
small centrifugal pumps driven by electric motors or diesel engines. lWater
is taken from the remaining wells, using bullocks or manual power. The
pumps are generally three to five hp units unless the yield of the well
justifies a larger installation. Borewells are typically equipped with two
to three hp submersible pumps or, in larger capacity wells, with small line-
shaft vertical turbine pumps. The cost of pumping equipment ranges from
Rs 2,000 to 6,000 depending upon the type, size, and capacity of the instal-
lation. Wells equipped with pumps typically supply 12,000-15,000 m3 per year
compared to about one-half that volume from other wells.
31.       Electrically driven pumps have an advantage over the small diesel
engines in that maintenance and repair costs are much lower.  Some areas have
experience(d occasional problems with electrical installations because of
voltage fluctuiation (particularly low voltage conditions) but these are
being overcome by the MSEB.  A large part of the State is presently served
by distribution lines of the MSEB and new construction each year is making
electrification of existing wells possible. At the present time the rate
charged by TISrB for electricity (low voltage) for irrigation pumping is 12
paise per kwh with a minimum of Rs 36 per hp per year.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
Development Intensity
32.       In the taluks that have the greatest groundwater development,
the area lrrigated from wells is from 5 to 102 of the total taluk area
and the average overall density of wells is five to ten per km2. Because
well developments usually occupy only 1/3 to 1/2 of the gross area of a taluk,
the actual density of wells in some areas probably is as much as 30 per km2.
33.       As yet there are no large areas that are reportedly overdeveloped
with respect to the available groundwater supply although there is insuffi-
cient data in most instances, nor has there been sufficient time since some
areas have been developed, to confirm this. At the present time, the SGC
recommends that new wells be located at least 200 m from existing wells to
minimize the likelihood of excessive interference or overdevelopment-.
34.       There are no regulations or laws controlling the development or
use of groundwater in India.  The CGIB has prepared a draft of a model law
for consideration by the States and such legislation is being evaluated by
the Mysore Government. In all probability it will be at least two years
before any such legal controls are adopted in Mysore.
Proposed Groundwater Development
Areas
35.       The areas proposed for groundwater development under the Project
are the 48 taluks for which the SGC groundwater surveys are completed or
in progress (Appendix 2-3) or such additional taluks that may be surveyed
by the SGC during the course of the Project. The total area of these 48
taluks is approximately 56,000 km2 of which possibly one-third would lie
within the areas recommended for development as a result of the SGC surveys.
Water Supply and Requirements
36.       Experience througlhout the Project area has shown that a typical
well, properly constructed, can yield from 65-90 m3/day and is capable of
irrigating a command area of about 1.5 to 1.6 ha. With the limitation
of wclls under this Project to the parts of taluks that have already been
surveyed by SGC and recommended for groundwater development, it is expected
that the average well performance will be somewhat improved and that the
typical command area per well will be 1.75 ha. In some localized instances,
geological condlitions are encountered that result in wells of higher yield
capable of commanding a larger irrigated area of up to 3 or 4 ha. It is
hoped that t1le further geological and hydrological studies to be carried on
during the coursc of this Project will permit an even better site selection
in the future and an increase in the typical or average well yield.
37.       The average water requirement for typical crops and cropping
patterns has been calculated from climatological data (Appendix 2-1 and 2-2).



ANNEX 2
Page 9
Assuming an average well yield of about 75 m3/day (16 to 20 hours pumping
per day for borewells), each well would be capable of meeting the peak daily
irrigation requirement for an area of 1.75 ha. The peak requirements would
occur during the dry or rabi season (January-February) each year and in the
kharif season (July-August) in years of low rainfall. After allowing for
effective rainfall, the net irrigation requirement from wells will be from
10,000-12,000 m3 per year for an irrigated area of 1.75 ha per well.
Borewells
38.       It is proposed that 5,000 borewells will be installed under the
Project. A typical well will be 38 m deep with 150 mm steel casing to a
depth of 15 m. The average yield will be 1-1.25 liters/second and capable
of supplying 75 m3 per day to irrigate 1.75 ha in both kharif and rabi
seasons. Most borewells will be equipped with small submersible pumps of
1/2 to 2 hp size, depending upon the yield and pumping lift. Small lineshift
vertical turbine pumps or dual-pipe jet pumps may be installed in particular
circumstances. Estimated costs for borewell installations are given in
Appendix 2-5.
39.       Borewells can be completed in less than a week with the high-
speed air-rotary hammer drills, in about three weeks with a percussion
(cable--tool) drill, and in about one month with a calyx drill. The avail-
ability of equipment and its use and estimated rate of progress on the Project
is given in Appendix 2-6.
Dug-cum-borewells
40.       It is proposed that 6,000 existing dugwells will be improved
as dug-cum-borewells under the Project. Typically an existing well to be
improved is presently capable of irrigating only 1.5 ha in the kharif season
and 1 ha in rabi. The improvement will be by boring 150 mm diameter holes
in the bottom of the existing well with two to four such holes, having a total
drilling of 38 m. Upon completion of this improvement work a typical well
should be capable of irrigation 1.75 ha in both kharif and rabi seasons.
41.       Following the boring, it will be necessary in many instances
to make some modifications or additions to the existing pumping equipment.
I)ug-cum--borewells can be complcted, starting with an existing inadequate
du&wclls, in less tlhan a montlh. The estimated cost for the work is given
in Appendix 2-5 and the availability of equipment in Appendix 2-6.
Dugwells
42.       Dugwells are not generally as efficient or economical for the
development and utilization of groundwater as borewells (or dug-cum-bore).
Althouglh the cost of dugwells and borewells are about the same, dugwells
generally require muchi longer to complete, occupy a significant surface
area of the limited farm holding, and because of their limited depth, are
unable to provide a full supply of water in rabi season to the irrigated
area. The lower financial rate of return to the farmers for dugwells

(Annex 12) reflects these less desirable features. The lending Institutions
also find it much more difficult to administer loans for dugwells than for
borev elas
43.       Contrary to the popular conception of most farmers, the yield
of a well does not increase directly with the diameter. Most of the
large diameter dugwells in Mysore, in fact, yield no more water (in terms
of volume per day) than is available from the small diameter boresells;
during dry months, or successive dry years, the borevells generally provide
more water than dugwells. With the increasing availability of drilling
equipment and the opportunity for farmers to see the several advantages of
borewells, coupled with an educational effort by State agencies (comparable
to that which was required for the adoption of new techniques such as
fertilizers and hybrid seeds), it is anticipated that borewells will be
increasingly in demand. There are some parts of the Project area, however,
particularly where the depth of weathering is greater and where the water
table is near land surface, where good dugwells are feasible. Because of
this, and because of the interest still evidenced by farmers for dugwells,
it is recommended that 5,000 new dugwells be included in the Project.
44.       In order to minimize some of the deficiencies in existing dugwells,
the new wells should be smaller (6 m across) and deeper (averaging 12-15 i).
Using these criteria, a typical project dugwell could irrigate 1.75 ha in
the kharif season and 1.25 ha in rabi. Most dugwells should be equipped
with 2 to 3 hp centrifugal pumps, depending upon the daily volume of
water available, the hours of pumping, and the lift. The estimated costs
for dugwell installations are given in Appendix 2-5.
45.       Selection of the number of new dugwells in the Project is based,
in part, upon the estimated physical capability for the work within the
Project area and the length of time needed to complete the average well
in relation to the Project duration. Since 1965 the LDB has made loans
available to farmers for construction of dugwells. Records of accomplish-
ments under this program, for the taluks in the Project area, show that
only about 50% of the number of wells sanctioned have been completed
(Appendix 2-4). Under this same program, in recent years, the disbursement
of LDB funds for wells within the Project area would provide for approxlmately
2,400 wells per year. Allowing for a completion rate of as much as 70%, no
more than 5,000 wells could be completed during the three-year Project.
Pumping Equipment
46.       Typical pump installations and sizes for different types of wells
have been described above. These recommended sizes (hp) are smaller than
those generally in use in the existing wells. Many existing pumps appear
to be of larger rating than is justified by the source of water with the
result that operating costs are higher than necessary. Each new well
constructed under the Project should be tested and the proper selection of
a pump made, based upon the test results.



ANNEX 2
Page I 1
47.       Only electrically driven pumps should be included on Project
wells and all new wells must be equipped with pumps (existing pumps to be
modified or supplemented, where necessary, In dug-cum-borevells). Cost
estimates for completed installations (Appendix 2-5) include an allowance
for the Rs 3,000 per well deposit required by the MEB to ensure that electri-
city will be made avallable to the pump site. The financial and economic
calculations (Annexes 12 and 13) are based on the assumption that a consider-
able number of wells will not require new electrical connections and therefore,
electrical connection costs have not been included in the calculations.
Well Spacing
48.       To prevent local overdevelopment of the groundwater supply at
this time, pending the collection and analysis of more detailed geologic
and hydrologic data, ic is necessary to adopt certain criteria concerning
minimum well spacing and maximum density of wells for a unit area. From
field examinations and a consideration of available information, it seems
appropriate at this time to assume that:
(a) essentially all recharge to groundwater comes from local,
direct rainfall - supplemented in part by infiltration
from streams, canals, tanks, and areas irrigated from
surface water;
(b) there is very little lateral movement of groundwater;
(c) the total evapotranspiration of water by crops, irrigated
from a well or group of wells must, therefore, come from
recharge at and immediately adjacent to the well or wells;
and
(d) to the extent that lateral groundwater movement or
recharge does occur, it is offset by the fact that not
all of the local recharge can be utilized by a well or
wells.
49.       It is reasonable to assume, at this time, that a total of 20%
of rainfall becomes available as recharge. For a total annual rainfall
of 600 to 750 mm the recharge then amounts to 120 to 150 mm. This amount
of recharge, assuming a specific yield of the weathered zone of 5%, should
produce annual water-table fluctuations of 2 to 3 m which is in agreement
with observed conditions in the field.
50.       The total evapotranspiration by irrigated crops in the area,
for typical cropping patterns, is about 700 to 800 mm (Appendix 2-1). Using
the four assumptions in para 48 above, to maintain recharge equivalent to
discharge, it would require 4.7 to 6.7 ha of recharge area for each 1.0 ha
irrigated from wells. The potential recharge area to groundwater should be
considered as that area delineated on the SGC taluk survey maps as the area
"suitable for groundwater development".  This area is typically 20 to 40% of
the gross area of a taluk. Using these criteria, rounded off to a requirement
for 5 ha local recharge area for each 1 ha Irrigated from a well, and assuming
a typical well irrigates 1.75 ha, the recharge area needed per well would be



ANNEX 2
Page 12
5 x 1.75 or 8.75 ha and the spacing between wells should be about 300 m (or
an irrigation density of 20 ha irrigated from wells per km2).
51.       With some allowance for the increase in infiltration to be
expected in areas of concentrated development, and for a slight reduction
in nonbeneficial evapotranspiration, it is recommended that the following
conditions be met for all loans for wells under the Project, unless local
conditions justify otherwise:
(a) No new well should be approved if it is less than 250 to
300 m from an existing irrigation or village water supply
well; and
(b) No new well should be approved if the adjacent area irri-
gated from wells exceeds 20 ha per km2 (20% of the sur-
rounding area).
52.       Appendix 2-3, which tabulates the number of existing wells in the
Project area, shows also the required recharge area (in km2), using the ratio
of 5 ha recharge per hectare irrigated area. The table also indicates what
percentage of the gross area of the taluk is required to provide the recharge
area for only the existing wells. Assuming that the potential recharge area
in a taluk is only 40% of the gross area (para 50), it would appear that
overdevelopment may already be occurring locally within at least five of the
taluks.
Certification Procedure
53.       As a part of tl-e application procedure for a well loan, the
lending institution should obtain from the applicant, supplemented as
necessary at the time of appraisal, information showing the location of
the proposed well, the location and distance of the proposed well from all
existing wells within a radius of 300 mi, and the location (and approximate
area irrigated) of all existing irrigation wells within a radius of 500 m.
54.       This location information should then be forwarded to the SGC
Division Geologist withlin wh0ose jurisdiction the proposed well comes.
The Division Geologist sliould tthen examine the available records, making
a brief supplemental field examination as necessary, and promptly issue
a certificate to the lending institution indicating:
(a)  whether the proposed well is within the area recommended
for development in the SGC taluk groundwater survey;
(b) whether the proposed well meets the recommended minimum
spacing and density criteria; and
(c) wlhether the clhemical quality of water to be obtained is
expected to be of suitable quality for irrigation.



ANNEX 2
Page 13
In the case of loan applications for dug-cum-borewells, the SGC should
also make a brief test to determine recuperation rate (in m3/day) of the
existing dugwell and a statement as to whether the proposed improvements
appear to offer a reasonable chance for significant improvement in the
water supply.
55.       No final approval of loans should be made until these procedures
have been complied with and no loan should be approved for which an
unfavorable report is received from the SGC.
Implementation and Coordination
56.       It is anticipated that the new borewells will be constructed
largely by private contractors, development agencies (such as the
assistance programs of the Governments of Switzerland and Denmark), by
NIAIC, or by State agencies (SGC, PWD, and Agricultural Engineering). Work
on the dug-cum-borewells will be done largely by private contractors,
taluk development boards, and the SGC.
57.       In order to achieve maximum utilization of equipment, which
is essential if Project goals are to be met, it may be necessary to
assign certain general areas of operation to the principal agencies con-
cerned. Coordination and scheduling of approved loans will be necessary
to eliminate excessive standby time on equipment and unnecessary travel
between wells. The district branch offices of the LDB have agreed to
undertake this coordination and scheduling responsibility, assisted by
the SGC Division Geologist and such other persons as are directly concerned.
Technical Assistance
58.       There is a need for outside technical assistance, recognized by
both the SGC and CGWB, for setting up and carrying on detailed geologic
and hydrologic analyses of typical environments in Mysore.  It is
recommended that the Project include a component for groundwater technical
assistance, including the necessary hydrologic or related equipment, to
carry on such studies with the assistance of SGC personnel and to train
SGC counterpart personnel in the techniques and procedures.
59.       Two specialists (hydrogeologist and hydrologist) would work in
Mysore for a two-year period with particular emphasis on such items as:
(a) selection of representative small areas (hydrologic
units) for intensive analysis;
(b) establishing field measurement programs on the selected
areas to eva]uate quantitatively the elements of water
balance: rainfall (distribution, intensity, and amount),
runoff (including base flow), infiltration, evapotranspira-
tion, changes in groundwater storage, and groundwater flow;
and



ANNEX 2
Page 14
(c)  assist in setting up such other state-wide programs as may
be necessary to permit correlation of the results of the
detailed studies to other areas: well inventory, water-
table fluctuations, stream gaging, water quality, climatolo-
gical observations, etc.
60.       The technical assistance program, in addition to the two
specialists, would include provision for the necessary equipment (recording
rain gages, water--level recorders, current meters, etc.) as well as an
allcwance for some test drilling in the detailed study areas. Estimated
foreign exchange cost of the program is:
Item                      Cost (Rs Million)
Personnel (four man-years)            1.50
Equipment                              .38
Test Drilling                          .30
Total                            2.18 (say 2.2 million)
Because of the ongoing and planned activities of the CGWB, the need to
avoid duplication of efforts in other States, and the need for coordination
with comparable assistance programs throughout India, it is recommended
that the groundwater technical assistance provided in this Project be
implemented through the CGWB. The personnel, equipment, and work program
should all be within the State of Hlysore, however, and supplemental to any
other currently contemplated program of CGWa. Details of the work program
should be decided jointly by the SGC and CGWB, the objective being the
early determination of the feasibility of future comparable groundwater
development projects.
Equipment and Supplies
Drilling Rigs
61.       The present number and type of drilling rig units in Mysore,
together with the estimated number that would be available for use on the
Project, are shown in Appendix 2-6. If the proposed number of wells are to
be completed within the three-year period, additional rapid drilling units
(down-the-hole, air hammer type) will be needed. It is recommended that
purchase of ten such complete units be included in the Project, at an estimated
total cost of Rs 5 million (Appendix 2-7). The units would be operated by
the drilling section of the SGC to construct new Project borewells.
62.       It is recommended that the units be of the rotary-air type, with
down-the-hole hammer drill and compressor, capable of drilling 150 to 200 mm
diameter holes to a depth of 150 m.  The rigs and accessories would be



ANNEX 2
Page 15
purclhased under international competitive bidding; there are indigenous
manufacturers of equipment of suitable quality and they would be allowed
to bid.
Drilling Bits
63.       Drilling contractors and agencies are presently experiencing
considerable delay in delivery on orders for indigenous bits for the air
hammer drills. It appears that indigenous supplies would not be adequate
to meet the sharp increase in demand for such bits for Project wells. In
order to meet the Project needs, it is recommended that the necessary bits
be imported, purchased under international competitive bidding at an
estimated total cost of Rs 3.5 million (Appendix 2-7).
Pumps
64.       It appears that local manufacturers will be able to supply
sufficient pumps, motors, and controls of suitable quality to meet the
Project needs. Estimated costs of pumping equipment are shown in Appendix 2-5.
B. Lift Irrigation
History
65.       An intensive program of lift irrigation schemes began in 1965
when 31 schemes in tysore were sanctioned by the Government of India at
an estimated cost of Rs 4.1 million. Of this initial program, 25 schemes
have been completed to irrigate 2,560 ha at a cost of Rs 3.12 million.
Subsequently, the Mlysore State Government, under the flinor Irrigation
program of the Public Works Department (PWD), approved construction of
140 additional schemes estimated to cost Rs 41.5 million to irrigate a
total area of 34,000 ha. Of this approved program, 27 schemes have
been completed and 51 are under contruction. At the present time an
additional program of 18 schemes has been proposed to ARC for financing at
an estimated cost of Rs 15.1 million. Ten of these are currently under
construction by PWD. The status of the overall PND lift irrigation program
at the end of December 1970 was:
Status         No. Schemes    Irrigated Area (ha)   Cost (Rs tillion)
Completed            52                7,500                  7.2
In Progress          55               18,500                 17.4
Total          107               26,000                 24.6
In September 1969 the Mysore Government moved the lift irrigation schemes
to the cooperative sector, providing for the promotion of Lift Irrigation
Cooperative Societies.



ANNEX 2
Page 16
Existing Projects
66.       The existing 1-ID lift irrigation schemes range in size from 20
to over 700 ha with the majority being 100 to 200 ha. The total construc-
tion cost averages Rs 1,000 to 1,250 per ha. Annual water charges to the
farmer are of the order of Rs 250 per ha total (Rs 125 per cropped ha).
These annual charges include interest on the original investment, deprecia-
tion of electrical and mechanical equipment (pumps), allowance for minor
repairs of civil works and plant maintenance, and cost of electrical
energy. Water charges are scheduled for collection at the end of the
irrigating season after crops have been harvested. Water supplies for the
schemes come from perennial streams or reservoirs. The water requirement
is based upon a diversion of 1.11 liters/sec/ha (1 cusec to 64 acres)
with water available for a minimum of ten months each year. The total
pumping lift ranges from about 10 to 40 m with an average of about 31 m.
Individual schemes usually comprise: intake works; pumps, motors, and controls:
penstocks (rising mains); storage pond or cistern; and channels and distri-
butaries. Schemes are designed by the Minor Irrigation Division of PWD,
commencing with an evaluation of the available water supply and the
selection of the optimum cost per ha for different irrigable areas at
various total lifts. Pumping equipment (centrifugal or vertial turbines)
are selected, according to physical conditions at the intake, and at
least two equal-size units provided to ensure continuing water delivery
in the event of the failure of one pump. The number and diameter of
discharge penstocks are selected to achieve an optimum annual cost,
considering both initial investment and the added operating cost due to
friction losses. A storage facility is provided at the penstocks outlet
to ensure continuous water delivery during any brief interruption in
pumping. Originally, these were constructed to contain the equivalent
of three to five minutes pump operation, assuming 16 hours pumping per
day. Because some schemes have experienced low voltage problems at the
pump site, and have had to restrict pumping to off-peak hours for a
shorter time each day, many of the reservoirs now being constructed are
larger. Most of the more recent schemes include the purchase and installa-
tion of electrical transformers which permits the purchasing of energy
at high voltage rates (lower rate per kwh under existing MSEB tariffs).
67.       When designs are completed and approved, bid documents are
prepared and submitted to local contractors. Contracts are awarded to
the lowest responsible bidders, with separate contracts for civil works
and for mechanical equipment (including installation). Actual Project
construction costs have been close to the original estimated costs. It
has usually required a minimum of 1-1/2 to two years to complete a project,
after designs are completed, assuming that funds are available as needed.
The principal delay experienced in construction has been in the time
required for delivery of pumps, motorg, motor controls, and transformers.
Proposed Projects
68.       The original Project request listed 54 lift irrigation schemes
to be constructed over a two-year period. Of this total, construction



ANNEX 2
Page 17
has already been started on 13 schemes, leaving 41 schemes (for which
approved designs are completed) to be built. These 41 schemes would
irrigate about 19,000 ha at an estimated construction cost of nearly
Rs 20.5 million (Appendix 2-9).
69.       The proposed Project is for the construction of 30 schemes,
to be selected fromn thlose presently designed, to irrigate about 14,000 hla
at an estimated cost of Rs 16.9 million. It is considered that this is
the maximum that could be completed within the three-year Project
period, considering both the problems of equipment deliveries and the
formation of the necessary Lift Irrigation Cooperative Societies.
70.       Lift schemes under the Project would conform to present design
and construction standards. The loan for construction would be made to
a properly organized Cooperative. The society would operate and maintain
the Project for the benefit of the member farmers and would make an annual
water charge in an amount sufficient to amortize the construction loan
and meet all additional operating costs. For a typical scheme, this
annual water charge is estimated to be Rs 400 per ha (Appendix 2-10).
71.       Conditions for making loans for lift irrigation schemes would
include:
(a) existence of approved, updated designs and estimates
by PMD;
(b) formation of a Lift Irrigation Cooperative Society
with adequate paid-up share capital; and
(c) adequate provision for enforcement of prompt collection
of annual water chiarges from water users.
Lift Irrigation Cooperative Societies
72.       There are a total of 44 Lift Irrigation Cooperative Societies
in Mlysore at the present time, but most of these are for old schemes
that were constructed before the present PWD Minor Irrigation program
was started (Appendix 2-10). Even though the Mysore Government has provided
for cooperatives to operate lift schemes (para 65), it has still permitted
construction and operation solely by PWD.  Farmers are understandably reluc-
tant to form a cooperative society, under which they would have to repay the
construcLion cost as well as assume operation and maintenance responsibility
when, instead, they can let the State Government pay for all construction,
operation, and maintenance.  In practice, farmers have not as yet paid anY
water clharges to the PWD even though the schemes have been operating for a
year or more.
73.       It should be a condition of including lift irrigation schemes
in the Project that the State Government would, in future, cease to
finance such schemes and would insist on the formation of cooperative
societies for this purpose.

MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
LAND LEVELLING AND RECLAMATION
Background
1.        Land levelling has been carried out in Mysore for many years,
usually on very small areas requiring little soil removal and in conjunction
with dugwell or tank schemes.
2.        At the time Mysore State was constituted in 1956, under the States'
Reorganization Act, only 7% (about 700,000 ha) of cultivated land was irri-
gated. When its full irrigation potential is realized, it is estimated
that some 3 million ha could come under irrigation. During the period
1967-1978 about 400,000 ha are scheduled to come under irrigation from river
projects and lift schemes, several of which are already under construction.
In order to make the most efficient use of water from the various irriga-
tion schemes land levelling and reclamation will be essential. Under the
Project about 114,000 ha (100,000 ha under river schemes and 14,000 ha
from lift irrigation) would be levelled and reclaimed.
Present Methods of Reclamation
3.        The majority of slopes in Mysore vary between 1 to 3%.  Most ir-
rigated land has contour bunding to prevent erosion, particularly in the
monsoon season, and to slow run-off, thereby facilitating percolation.
Various methods involving hand labor, bullocks, wheel tractors, and bull-
dozers are currently used.
4.        The basket method using hand labor is the most economical in
terms of direct costs. However, it is relatively inefficient and very
time-consuming; on average, it takes about 700 man/days to level one ha,
providing the carrying distance is short. Labor for this type of work is
difficult to recruit and will only be undertaken if no other work is avail-
able.
5.        Bullock power is used for land levelling when not required for
land preparation and harvesting, but it is slow and the amount of such
power available is limited. Most of the levelling in the past few years has
been done by wheel tractors with levelling blades and bulldozers. While
this method is far better than with hand labor or bullocks, it is relatively
expensive (Rs 3 per m3) and limited in capacity. MAIC, the Agricultural En-
gineering Division of the Department of Agriculture (AED) tractor coopera-
tives, and private contractors have been levelling on average about 12,000
ha annually, using some 100 wheel tractors and 175 bulldozers.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
6.        Land is surveyed and levelling maps made by the Soil Conservation
Service of the Department of Agriculture (SCS). Presently SCS has about 300
trained surveyors and additional trained personnel are available in other
divisions of the Department of Agricilture. While the surveying and map
making work is of an adequate standard, areas are not staked at the time
levelling takes place and in consequence an SCS man must be present all the
time to check and direct soil movement, which is a waste of trained man-
power. In future land should be staked and marked so that equipment oper-
ators can themselves judge their cuts and fills.
7.        Since 1968, USAID, in conjunction with GOI and the State Govern-
ment, has been conducting a pilot project in Bellary District to study
optimum water requirements of crops and water use problems. This has in-
cluded experiments in different techniques and methods of land levelling
and, after consultation and observation of present methods, it was concluded
that the introduction of different types of earth-moving equipment would
enable land reclamation to be undertaken more speedily, efficiently, and
cheaply. This would apply particularly in black cotton soil districts where
more power and flatter final grades are required.
New Methods Proposed Under the Project
8.        In the light of the conclusion reached in paragraph 7, and the
work requiring to be done -- levelling, grading, ripping, bunding, and
ditching -- the Project includes the purchase of 110 self-propelled, ele-
vating scrapers; 37 land planes; and 37 crawler tractors with attachments
(Appendix 3-1).
9.        The self-propelled scrapers of 130-150 hp would be rubber-tired
and self-loading, and capable of moving 8 m3 in one operation. They would
not require an additional power unit and being rubber-tired could move from
job to job without waiting for transporters to move them. At 60% field
efficiency and a 180 m haul, a scraper can move 85 m3 of earth per hour at
an estimated cost of Rs 1.4 per m3 compared with the current Rs 3 per m3
with bulldozers and wheel tractors. They also have the advantage of being
able to work 24 hours a day which is important since the season for land
reclamation lasts only from January to June because of the rainy season
and cropping patterns. The scrapers would be expected to work a minimum of
2,100 hours per year at a field efficiency of 60%.
10.       In order to obtain a higher degree of levelling and, therefore,
greater irrigation efficiency, the use of land planes is recommended.
These implements, pulled by crawler tractors, would be used after the
scrapers and would take only about two hours to cover 1 ha.
11.       To complete the job of reclamation, after levelling, equipment for
ditching, bunding, and ripping would be required. It is proposed that
90/100 hp crawler tractors equipped with tool bar, heavy duty disc ridger,
dozer blade, and three subsoiler shanks be used. These tractors would also
pull the land planes (para 10) and be used for rough preliminary work such
as filling gullies and rock removal.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
12.       The Project proposes the reclamation, over three years, of some
114,000 ha (para 16) and this cannot be accomplished with existing equip-
ment. Farmers are presently paying from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per ha for
relatively rough reclamation work and in all cases additional work would be
required to obtain efficient irrigation. It is estimated that using the
new type of equipment proposed, a finished job including levelling, planing,
ditching, and bunding could be done for Rs 1,250 per ha (Appendix 3-2).
Equipment Users and Procurement
13.       Presently most land reclamation work is done by MAIC, AED (which
will shortly be absorbed by MAIC), and two tractor cooperatives. It is an-
ticipated that each of these groups would utilize some of the equipment.
Private contractors should be encouraged and would be eligible for loans
under the Project for the purchase of equipment. However, the major part
would be operated by MAIC on a custom work basis.
14.       The equipment (Appendix 3-1) would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding. In view of the fact that it would be new to
India, the successful bidder should be required to provide training facili-
ties as well as adequate repair, servicing, and spare parts services.
The Project
15.       If optimum use is to be made of irrigation facilities, the farmer
must be able to level his land, and construct drainage ditches and bunds.
Host farmers will have insufficient power and suitable implements to under-
take this work themselves and will require financial assistance to enable
them to have the work done under contract.
16.       Taking into account the stages of development of the various types
of irrigation schemes, past performance and the staff, equipment, and ad-
ministrative structure available in Mysore, it was concluded that the fol-
lowing land reclamation program in the areas specified could be completed
within three years:

In addition some 14,000 ha will come under irrigation from the lift schemes,
making a total of 114,000 ha to be reclaimed at a cost oi Rs 1,250 per ha.
Technical Considerations
17.       Prior to levelling the land should be surveyed and maps prepared,
showing cut and fill, proposed ditches, drops, drains, and bunds. Land
should be staked approximately every 30 m in each direction and the stakes
marked with the appropriate cut or fill information so that equipment oper-
ators can work without having a surveyor present all the time. Levelling
and planing should be completed before ditching and bunding is done.
18.       Approved loan applications for land reclamation should, as far as
possible, be grouped so that the optimum use may be made of the equipment
available.

THE AGRICULTURAL REFINANCE CORPORATION
Organization and Management
1.        The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) was established on
July 1, 1963, with the objectives of providing medium- and long-term fi-
nance to agricultural credit institutions and, at the same time, directing
and guiding such institutions coward a development oriented approach in
their operations.
2.        ARC's shareholders include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),
central and state-level land development and mortgage banks and coopera-
tive banks and other institutions (scheduled banks, the Life Insurance
Corporation of India, insurance and investment companies, and others ap-
proved by the Government of India). Of the initial 5,000 shares issued,
the law provided that RBI shall subscribe to at least 50%, the central
land mortgage banks and state cooperative banks to no more than 30Z, and
other institutions to no more than 20% and future issues of shares would
be allocated in the same proportion. The initial shares issued were
guaranteed a dividend of 4-1/4% per annum.
3.        ARC's management is vested in a Board of Directors of nine mem-
bers, three of whom are elected and the rest nominated. Three directors
represent RBI (a Deputy-Governor is Chairman of the Board), three the
Government of India (at present the Secretary, Department of Agriculture,
and the Additional Secretary, Department of Cooperation of the Ministry
of Food, Agriculture, Community Development and Cooperation; and a Joint
Secretary, Department of Banking of the Ministry of Finance), and three
directors are elected one each by the central land development banks, by
the state cooperative banks, and by the Life Insurance Corporation of
India, scheduled banks, and other insurance and financing institutions.
4.        The Managing Director is the chief executive officer and is assisted
by a managerial staff of nearly 90 (as of June 1971) of whom 65 are based at
ARC's head office. Until early 1970, ARC did not employ any specialists, in-
stead relying on a panel of consultants for technical advice in appraisal and
supervision work. To supplement consultants' advice, ARC has established a
Technical Division which, as of June 1971 comprised three agricultural spe-
cialists and an agricultural economist and to which ARC proposes to make fur-
ther appointments. With the increasing volume of lending, ARC recognizes the
need to build up its staff at all levels and has prepared a staff development
plan to cover the period to the end of 1973. In addition to this, ARC is con-
sidering the establishment of a new section designed to assist the rehabilita-
tion of those cooperative credit institutions in all states whose administra-
tive and financial operations have declined to a level which renders them un-
suitable for participation in ARC lending schemes.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        ARC's head office is in Bombay.  It has 13 regional offices (Ahmeda-
bad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Jaipur,
Kanpur, Madras, New Delhi, Patna, and Trivandrunm) which assist banks and State
Governments in formulating agricultural development projects for financing,
clarify ARC's policies and procedures when required, undertake pre-appraisal
of projects submitted and supervise general execution of projects under ARC
financing. About 25 managerial staff are employed in the Regional Offices.
6.        In general, ARC's charter provides that it shall be guided by such
directions in matters of policy involving public interest as GOI may, after
consulting RBI, give in writing. ARC can extend financial assistance only to
central or state-level land development banks, state cooperative banks, and
scheduled banks: in exceptional cases, and with RBI approval, it can also
lend directly to a primary cooperative at the farm level. Refinance is pro-
vided through purchases of special debentures floated by central or state-level
land development banks and through loans to state cooperative banks and sched-
uled banks.
7.        UJntil June 1966, it was not normally ARC's policy to refinance con-
struction and energization of wells by individuals unless the outlay involved
was large and development was envisaged through a cooperative society organized
for the purpose. In July 1966, however, ARC not only removed this restric-
tion, but also circulated a model scheme for minor irrigation development by
farmers in compact areas. Thus began ARC's policy of financing individual
farmers on the basis of project models.
8.        At the beginning, ARC's policy was to finance no more than 75% of a
project, leaving the balance to be contributed by State Governments. However,
the generally strained resources position of most State Governments consider-
ably restricted the extent to which land development banks could avail them-
selves of refinance facilities from ARC. Accordingly, to stimulate investments
in minor irrigation especially, ARC increased its support of such investments
to 90%, beginning with all projects sanctioned in 1967/68.
9.        Special debentures purchased by ARC from central land development
banks must be guaranteed by the State Government concerned; in addition, de-
bentures are backed by a charge on all mortgages resulting from loans refi-
nanced under the issue. In the case of debentures, ARC requires that collec-
tions from farmers be lodged in a sinking fund. The sinking fund is invested
in GOI securities and debentures of other land development banks. It may also
be used to repurchase the land development bank's own debentures. Since from
the viewpoint of financial returns, the sinking fund arrangements do not bene-
fit a land development bank as issuer of debentures, ARC has decided that re-
payments of its refinances under IDA supported projects should approximately
match those of ultimate borrowers to lending banks.
10.       ARC will refinance agricultural development schemes which are tech-
nically feasible, financially justified, and are within a reasonably compact
area for facility of loan evaluation and supervision. The scheme can involve
just one farmer, a group of farmers, or an association of farmers. Preference,
however, is given to schemes involving a large number of farmers.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
11.       Technical evaluation of schemes is carried out by consultants
drawn from a panel approved by the Government of India. Services of the
Central Ground Water Board (formerly the Exploratory Tubewells Organization),
the Geological Survey of India and the various commodity boards are also
used and ARC prescribes the tervs of reference in every case. Some important
points examined in the case of schemes for minor irrigation include, an
estimate of the quantum of water proposed to be tapped, annual water re-
charge, annual water draft, taking into account the existing and proposed
wells, and the type of pump sets needed.  With the establishment of its own
Technical Division, increasing back-up support is now available from ARC's
own specialist staff which will provide a foundation of technical expertise
for scheme appraisal and supervision throughout India.
12.       Economic evaluation of schemes is performed by ARC staff.  Some
of the important aspects appraised include cost estimates, the suitability
of the cropping pattern recommended, inputs available for development,
farmer's repayment capacity, efficiency of the project executing agency, ar-
rangements for the provision of short-term credits and marketing arrangements.
Preappratsal is done generally by regional offices, but final evaluation is
made in Bombay.
13.       Periods of refinance are determined after a study of the repayment
capacity of farmers based on farm models. Refinance terms for medium-term
projects are 3 to 5 years and for long-term projects are now generally 12
to 15 years.
14.       With effect from November 1970 ARC's general lending rate was
raised from 6 to 6-1/2% per annum. Scheduled banks are required to charge
their borrowers no more than an additional 2-1/2% per annum and while land
development (and mortgage) banks are not bound by the same restriction,
they nevertheless generally follow the same interest mark-up and none
exceeds it. ARC collects a commitment charge of 1/3 of 1% on the amount
not used in any one year according to a schedule of expected withdrawals
approved for a scheme.
Lending (Refinancing) Operations
15.       The following table shows the progress in ARC's lending (less
subsequent cancellations) during the seven years of its existence:

Total        371               2,595.10        2,148.90
16.       During the initial years, ARC transacted very little business
due to the need for laying the groundwork and bases for its operations
and for building its staff. An important deterrent, however, was ARC's
policy, at the time, of refinancing only projects in which development
was envisaged through a cooperative society organized for the purpose.
In June 1966, this restriction was removed; furthermore, ARC agreed to
refinance up to 90Z of loans for minor irrigation, against 75Z previously.
Thus, during the last three years, projects approved for refinancing were
more than six times the number during the first four years.
17.       As may be expected, most of the schemes sanctioned were for
projects financed by land development or mortage banks:

Source of Funds
19.       Apart from share capital, ARC can raise funds from the following
sources:  (a) borrowings from GOI and from any entity approved by GOI; (b)
issue and sale of debentures and bonds guaranteed by GOI; (c) borrowings
from RBI for periods not exceeding 18 months; and (d) deposits from GOI,
the State Government, and local authorities for periods not less than 12
months.  Total borrowings and deposits received may not exceed 20 times
the sum of ARC's capital and surplus reserves.
20.       ARC's borrowings and receipts of deposits during the seven years
of its existence are summarized as follows:
Year         Borrowings           Deposits Received
Rs M                   Rs M
1963/64           50.000
1964/65             -                    1.130
1965/66                                  1.255
1966/67             -                    1.255
1967/68           30.000                 1.255
1968/69          177.500                 1.254
1969/70          299.377                 1.251
Total      556.877                  7.400
Of ARC borrowings during 1969/70, Rs 109,377,000 was raised by a public
issue of ARC 5-3/4% bonds 1982. The balance of borrowings (Rs 447.5 mil-
lion) have been from GOI as follows:

267.500              5                At end of 9 years
Since August 1968, ARC has been allowed a rebate of 1/4% on timely payments
of interest. The larger loan of Rs 267.5 million was for a shorter term,
since the proceeds were used LO refinance, in the main, minor irrigation
schemes, generally requiring refinance for nine years or less. The special
deposits represent dividends payable on ARC's shares held by RBI which,
under the law, must be held by ARC as special deposits. No interest is
paid on them.
21.       A comparative statement of ARC's operating results since its
establishment until 1969/70 is given in Appendix 4-1 and is suuarized
below (in Rs million):
Net
Income    Statutory  Surplus
Gross    Total      Net   Income   Before    Dividend        or
Year       Income  Expenses  Income    Tax   Dividends  Liability  Deficit
1963/64    3.75      0.30      3.45    1.80      1.65         1.91      -0.26
1964/65    4.00      0.39      3.61    1.76      1.85         2.13      -0.28
1965/66    4.35      0.48      3.87    2.27      1.60         2.13      -0.53
1966/67    4.98      0.61      4.36    2.40      1.97         2.13      -0.16
1967/68    6.00      1.67      4.33    2.38      l.95         2.13      -0.18
1968/69   11.04      6.29      4.75    2.61      2.14         2.13       0.01
1969/70   27.28    20.55       6.75    3.70       3.05        2.13       0.92
22.       In the first three years of ARC's operations, income was derived
mostly from interest on investments. Beginning 1966/67, this pattern
changed when ARC began to expand rapidly its refinancing operations (para
15). In 1969/70, interest received from loans and debentures represented
88% of total income received.
23.       Benefitting from cost-free funds available to it during the
first four years of its existence, ARC's main items of expense at the
time was salaries and employee benefits. Needing more funds for its ex-
panded operation, interest paid on borrowed money has since 1967/68 been
an important item of expenses.  In 1969/70, interest paid on borrowings
and salaries and employee benefits were 83% and 10%, respectively, of
total expenses.
24.       Until 1968/69 net income after taxes had not been sufficient
to meet the statutory dividend liability of 4-1/4% payable annually to
ARC's initial shareholders (para 2) and the annual deficiency had to
be made good by GOI in accordance with its guarantee under the law. ARC
will have to reimburse these amounts out of future profits.  In 1968/69



ANNEX 4
Page 7
however, profits were sufficient to meet the statutory dividend and leave
ARC with a small surplus and this position was significantly improved in
1969/70. The scale of future profits will largely depend on ARC's future
borrowing rates and the extent to which it has to borrow from the market
at higher rates than it has hitherto had to pay GOI. To help offset this,
steps are now being taken to enable ARC to borrow from the National Agri-
cultural Credit (Long-term Operations) Fund of RBI at concessional rates
which, although not yet fixed, might be at about 4-1/4% per annum. This
would broadly enable ARC to maintain its interest margin. For illustra-
tive purposes, a five-year projection of ARC's future operating results
(Appendix 4-2) assumes an overall lending rate of 6-1/2%; it does not take
into account the probability of ARC borrowing at lower rates from RBI
fund.
25.       ARC is in good financial condition (Appendix 4-3).  Its equity
position as of June 30, 1970, is unimpaired by losses and its assets were
in GOI securities and debentures of land development banks, which are
guaranteed by State Governmentu. A five-year projection of ARC's financial
condition is given in Appendix 4-4.
26.       In accordance with its charter, ARC's accounts are audited
annually by accountants duly qualified under the all India Companies Act
of 1956 (the present auditors are Messrs. K. S. Aiyar and Co.). Under the
same charter, GOI can appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
to examine and report on the accounts of ARC. To date, GOI has not found
the need to exercise this power.

INDIA
MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
HYSORE STATE C0OPERATIVE LAND DEVELOPMENT BANK LTD.
AND PRIMARY LAND DEVELOPMENT BANKS
A. The Structure of the Mysore Land Development Bank System
1.        The land development banking structure in Mysore is federal in
character with the Primary Banks (PLDBs) functioning at the taluk level
(subdivision of a district) federated into the State Land Development
Bank (LDB). Although each PLDB is theoretically independent, LDB, in
fact, has a considerable control over their operations since it is the
only permitted source of their borrowings and can withhold funds from any
bank which does not meet its requirements.
2.        For all practical purposes, therefore, LDB and its federated
PLDBs can be considered as a single entity with the operational relation-
ship similar to that of a bank head office to its branches. The PLDBs
(under LDB's direction and guidance) are responsible for making loans
to their members, such lending being wholly refinanced by the LDB. As
of June 30, 1970, the 170 PLDBs had a total membership of about 400,000.
3.        In the following paragraphs the operations of LDB and PLDBs are
considered separately in regard to their organization, management, and
resources. Their lending procedures, being exclusively integrated, are
considered together in further sections.
B. The Mysore State Cooperative Land DeveloPment Bank Ltd.
Organization and Management
4.        The LDB was registered on November 25, 1929.  It has 19 branch of-
fices and is the apex organization for a network of 170 PLDBs. Its head of-
fice is in Bangalore, the State capital. It operates under the Cooperative
Societies Act 1959 and. its bye-laws.
5.        Under the General Body, with powers equivalent to an Annual
General Meeting of shareholders in a joint stock company, LDB's affairs
are directed by a 23-member Board consisting of 19 members elected by
PLDBs, three nominated by the State Government (one of whom shall be
the managing director of the LDB) and the President of the Mysore State
Cooperative Apex Bank (ex-officio). To facilitate administration most
of the Board's powers devolve to an eight-man'Executive Committee.  The
Board has a three-year term.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        The managing director is the chief executive officer.  He is
appointed by the State Government, in consultation with the Board and must
be an officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service (I.A.S.)
Cadre of Mysore State or an officer of the Cooperative Department. The
secretary, who is the managing director's deputy, must be an officer of the
Cooperative Department and is appointed by the Board in consultation with
the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Neither of the present incumbents
of these posts had any banking experience. While this may have been accept-
able when the LDB's operations were concerned with loans based on the
value of collateral only instead of development criteria, and the volume of
lending was comparatively small, it is not acceptable under present conditions.
The managerial staff needs strengthening by the addition of at least two
experienced credit bankers and ARC has indicated that it would be able to
assist in this matter. In the longer run, it would be preferable if appoint-
ments to the top two managerial posts ceased to be from Government sources
and the Board employed its own experienced banking staff. Government staff
are usually on secondment for three years and there is, therefore, a
lack of continuity at the top. The present General Manager has been in
post only about nine months and the Secretary for just over one year. The
LDB operates 19 district branch offices (each at district headquarter).
The LDB also maintains a pool of 129 officers, of whom 83 were working
in the PLDBs. The total staff of LDB presently numbered some 200
(including the PLDB pool), many of whom are graduates with considerable
service with the bank (from 15 to 25 years). Due to the previous
policies of orientating loans to the value of collateral rather than to
developmental aspects, the staff lacks experience in appraisal techniques,
particularly those concerned with the evaluation of incremental returns
from investments. The LDB recognizes that its future lending policies
must be based on development and training courses for all staff should
be introduced immediately. It is proposed to recruit a further five
technical officers (graduates in economics and/or agriculture) who would as-
sist in training loan officers in the PLDB9 the new appraisal and lending
techniques relating to incremental returns.
7.        The 19 district branch offices are each in charge of a manager
who has discretion to approve loans, sent to him from PLDB8 in his
district, up to a limit of Rs 5,000 each. Larger applications are sent
to headquarter for approval which, in most cases, is automatic. Presently
branch managers do not supervise PLDBs, they do not visit loan applicants,
neither do they check or evaluate the information on the loan applications
that are sent to them from PLDBs. They are largely concerned with
examining the value and legal status of the collateral offered as security.
The branch managers will require additional training in appraisal techniques
and this should be Instituted immediately so that they would be able to play
a much more active part in the supervision of PLDBs and in evaluating loan
applications sent to them for approval.
Source of Funds
8.        As an apex organization, the LDB share capital is contributed
by the PLDBs (at a rate of 5% of borrowings from LDB) and the Mysore
State Government. As of June 30, 1970, LDB's authorized share capital



ANNEX 5
Page 3
was Rs 50 million (US$6.6 million), of which Rs 28.7 million (US$3.8
million) had been subscribed for. Of this the State Government's contribu-
tion was Rs 6 million (US$0.8 million) or about 21%. -The following table
shows the growth of LDB's issued share capital divided as to the PLDBs
and State Government subscriptions as of the dates shown:
June 30        June 30         June 30         June 30
1967           1968            1969            1970
PLDBs              10.3  (63%)    15.7  (72%)    18.8  (76%)    22.7  (80%)
State Government   6.0  (37%)      6.0  (28%)      6.0  (24%)      6.0  (20%)
Total Issued       16.3 (100%)    21.7 (100%)    24.8 (100%)    28.7 (100%)
As at June 30, 1970, reserves and undistributed profits totalled Rs 5.9
million (US$785,000), representing about 1.5% of total loan portfolio.
9.        Apart from short-term bridging finance provided by commercial
banks, LDB's borrowings have derived from the issue of debentures. These
are guaranteed by the State Government as to payment of interest and
repayment of principal and are secured by the mortgages financed from the
proceeds of a particular debenture issued. As in the case of other State
Land Banks in India, LDB floats three types of debentures:
(a)  Ordinary debentures which are subscribed to primarily
by the GOI, the State Government, RBI, and sister
institutions. Brokerage and underwriting commission
are fixed by RBI, the issued price being dependent
on the money market. Issues made in September 1970
and March 1971 were at an interest rate of 5-3/4% for
ten-year and 6% for 15-year debentures. The issued
price in both cases and for both types of debentures
was 99-3/4%. As at June 30, 1970, the amount of these
types of debentures outstanding was Rs 357 million
(US$47.6 million);
(b)  Rural debentures which are sold only to individuals
since their purpose is to encourage the mobilization
of local savings. To stimulate their sales, RBI
subscribes in the ratio of eight for every rural
debenture sold and receives interest at 1% less than
the regular rate which is presently 6%. This rate is
unattractive when compared with rates offered by
commercial banks and noninstitutional borrowers. The
amount of rural debentures outstanding at June 30, 1970,
was Rs 13 million (US$1.7 million). It has now been
agreed that rural debentures may be issued, bearing
a high interest rate (possibly 7-1/2%), but these will
not be guaranteed by the State Government. It remains
to be seen whether this type of debentures will be more
attractive to rural savers;



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(c) Special debentures which are issued for financing agricultural
projects approved by ARC. They are subscribed by ARC and
State Government in proportions divided by ARC and are
currently in the ratio of 9:1 for minor irrigation projects
and 3:1 for other projects. Interest paid on these debentures
are also divided by ARC and the present rate is 6-1/2% per
annum. Special debentures outstanding at June 30, 1970,
amount to Rs 42 million (US$5.6 million).
LDB's borrowings may not exceed 20 times paid-up capital and reserves.
C. Primary Land Development Banks (PLDBs)
Organization and Membership
10.       As of June 30, 1970, there were 170 PLDBs operating in Mysore
with a membership of about 400,000. Membership falls into two classes.
First, the regular (or A class) membership open to individuals and other
institutions. Such members must be landowners or, in the case of institu-
tions, carrying on a business directly related to agriculture. Second,
there is B class membership made up of individuals who are co-sharers in
the property of A class members. This latter type of membership exists
to facilitate the execution of mortgages on farms of regular members who
otherwise would have insufficient collateral to borrow. Only A class
members are entitled to borrow, vote, and receive dividends.
Management
11.       Management of each PLDB follows the LDB pattern with overall
control vested in the General Meeting and with a committee exercising the
functions of a Board of Directors. The PLDB manager, appointed by the
committee, is the chief executive. The managers are not experienced in
appraisal techniques applicable to development objectives and require
training.
Source of Funds
12.       PLDB's main sources of funds are members' share capital and loans
from the LDB. Each PLDB has its own share capital and borrowers are
required to hold shares to the value of 5% of a loan. Equally PLDBs must
invest in LDB shares to the extent of 5% of their borrowings. As at
June 30, 1970, the total share capital of all 170 PLDBs amounted to Rs 27.2
million (US$3.6 million) while outstanding borrowings for LDB amounted to
Rs 363 million (US$48 million). PLDB borrowings may not exceed 20 times
the paid-up share capital.

D. Overall Operational Results
13.       The LDB's loan portfolio has increased steadily since Its
establishment in 1929. It increased from Rs 93 million (US$12.4 million)
in 1964165 to Rs 366 million (US$48.8 million) in 1969/70. The arrears
position is, however, most unsatisfactory. Overdues from PLDBs to LDB
were 30% in 1969/70 and have shown no marked improvement over the past
three years (29% in 1967/68 and 322 in 1968/69). Drastic action is
required to reduce these arrears which, the LDB appreciates, are auch
too high and some action is already being taken. Until the default rate
is reduced to at least 25% the LDB would not be a suitable channel for
IDA lending. Presently the LDB borrows from ARC at 6-1/2% per annum and
lends to PLDBs at 7-3/4% per annum. Small profits have been sade (Rs 1.7
million or US$226,000 in 1969/70) and reserves amount to Re 2.2 million
(US$293,000). However, the specific reserve for bad and doubtful debts
amounts to only Re 311,000 (US$41,000) which is quite inadequate in relation
to overdues of Rs 13 million (US$1.7 million). Nevertheless, LDB paid a
dividend of 3-1/2% in 1969/70 amounting to Rs 1 million (US$133,000).
14.       Operating results of PLDBs vary but on the whole are unsatis-
factory. The arrears situation is serious, overall default from borrowers
to PLDBs being some 47% compared with 43% in 1968/69. Overall PLDB
default in respect of their borrowings from LDB is presently 30% compared
with 29% in 1967/68 and 32% in 1968/69. Statistics were not available
as to the age of arrears nor the types of loan in default and so it was
not possible to estimate the amount irrecoverable. Out of 170 PLDBs
only 45 have a default rate of 25% or less and of these only some 25 are
in proposed Project areas (15 in one area alone).
15.       In April 1971 profit and loss accounts for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1970, were not available in respect of more than half the
PLDBs. Of the remainder some 35 (or nearly 50%) were operating at a loss.
LDB has been lax in not ensuring that financial statements were submitted
within a reasonable period.
16.       The accounts of the LDB and PLDBs are audited by independent
auditors from the Cooperative Department, which is the practice throughout
India. However, the lack of statistical data regarding overdues and the
nonavailability of financial statements indicate that the audit is not
entirely satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from the State Government
that the standard and timeliness of auditing procedures would be 1mxroved.
E. Reorganization of the LDB and PLDBs
17.       The present financial and administrative conditions of the LDB
and PLDBs are such that they are unacceptable as channels for IDA finance.
Drastic reorganization is required and this has commenced.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
18.       The LDR managerial staff should be strengthened by the addition
of two experts with banking and agricultural credit experience. Training
courses for managers and staff (particularly field staff) should be
started immediately. LDB district offices should be reorganized so as
to saintain effective supervision of PLDBs within their districts.
Satisfactory appraisal techniques (particularly those relating to incremental
returns resulting from investments) need to be introduced.
19.       In order to determine the amount of arrears irrecoverable, all
PLDB8 should prepare a detailed analysis (by age and type of loan) as at
June 30, 1971. On the basis of such an analysis LDB, in consultation with
ARC and the State Government, would decide the amount to be written off.
Where possible collection efforts would continue and realization of security
would be enforced.  Such a write-off would, in most cases, result in a reduc-
tion of capital since reserves are likely to be insufficient. In order to
maintain the financial stability of both LDB (which may also have to write
off debts irrecoverable from PLDBs) and PLDBs, the State Government would,
where necessary, be called upon to provide a capital injection or long-term
loans. The program of rehabilitation should commence in Project areas and
would be carried out in consultation with ARC who undertook to provide expert
staff to assist. No PLDB should be permitted to participate in the Project
where arrears (adjusted as proposed above) exceed 25Z. The LDB should also
be required to reduce its arrears to 25%. These measures would constitute
the first stage of a continuing program for the LDB and PLDBs. PLDBs would
only remain eligible for lending under the Project while adhering to these
agreed schedules.
20.       Mere financial restructuring of PLDBs would not be sufficient.
PLDBs requiring major financial reorganization and assistance should, under
directions from the Registrar of Cooperatives, come directly under the control
of the LDB and, where appropriate, ARC would make available on a temporary
basis management assistance teams for the rehabilitation of the PLDBs.
21.       Prior to negotiations a rehabilitation program incorporating all
the above mentioned proposals had been prepared by LDB, in consultation with
and assisted by ARC and RBI, and had been approved by IDA. At the time of
negotiations considerable prbgress had been made. The LDB and 64 PLDBs had
overdues of less than 25x. Rehabilitation was proceeding and by credit
effectiveness there will be at least 100 acceptably reorganized PLD8s and
a further 41 will be rehabilitated by the end of September 1972. The State
Government had contributed Rs 7.5 million for capital injection which is
adequate. There will, therefore, be an acceptable banking framework for
Project implementation.
P. Overall Lending Policies and Procedures
Purposes of Loans
22.       PLDBs lend long-term for (and thus LDB refinances) a wide range
of agricultural purposes including:



ANNEX 5
Page 7
(a) land reclamation and development;
(b) plantation schemes (coconuts, areco, and orange);
(c) fruit development schemes (mainly grapes);
(d) wells and pump sets;
(e) the purchase of tractors, power tillers, and sprinkler
irrigation sets; and
(f) redemption of previous debts.
Lending Procedures
23.       Applications for loans are made to the PLDB of which the applicant
is a member. Borrowers must be cultivators of the land to be mortgaged
or, in the case of institutions, must be engaged in agricultural activities
within the area of the PLDB.
24.       Until recently lending procedures were based on the value of the
security offered rather than on the economic benefits deriving from loans
and, in part, this may well account for the high default rate. The change
in the role of land development banks towards development banking will
require a change in lending procedures. While the LDB is aware of this,
very little has been done to train staff in the new techniques. Training
courses and the introduction of proper appraisal methods are required.
Lending Terms and Interest Rates
25.       Borrowers are required to hold shares in the PLDB equivalent to
5% of loans. Loans for tractors and implements were limited to Rs 30,000,
the remainder being regarded as the borrower's down payment. In practice
this has meant that farmers have purchased fewer implements than they
needed to make full use of the tractor. Under the Project borrowers for
tractors will be required to purchase at least three approved implements
(the cost of which will be included in the loan) and make a down payment
of 25% (including shareholding) of the cost of tractor plus implements.
In the case of other types of loans no contribution other than the 5%
shareholding has been required. Under the Project it is proposed that
for land reclamation and minor irrigation investments borrowers should
contribute 20% of investment costs which would include shareholding and
the value of any benefits in kind contributed by the borrower, including
cost of labor. In respect of loans for heavy earth-moving equipment (which
is considered essential for the implementation of the land reclamation
program) it is proposed that the downpayment should be 10% to encourage
MAIC, cooperatives, and contractors to invest in such equipment.
26.       Present repayment periods are: well loans - 12 years; pump sets -
eight years; land reclamation - 10 years; and tractors - 10 years. Under
the Project the following repayment periods are proposed:



ANNEX 5

Investment                Period   Repayment        Total

Tractors and Implements           -         7               7
Land Reclamation                  2         8              10
Land Reclamation Equipment        -         9               9
1/ Repayment would commence in year following completion of
well.
27.       PLDBs presently lend to farmers at 9% per annum (with the exception
of well loans) and are refinanced by LMB at 7-3/4% per annum. LDB currently
borrows from ARC at 6-1/2% per annum, thus both LDB and PLDBs have a lending
margin of 1-1/4%. Well loans bear an interest rate of 9% per annum, but
farmers pay only 6% per annum the balance (3%) being contributed by the State
Government. There is no economic Justification for such a subsidy and it
has now been removed. Under the Project all borrowers from PLDBs would pay
interest at 9% per annum.

ANNEX 7

INDIA
MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MECHANIZATION PROCUREMENT
1.        The project now proposed would be the sixth of a series of
agricultural credit projects in India which IDA is at present considering.
As in the case of Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana
Credit Projects which it follows, this and subsequent projects in the series
would involve substantial tractor imports. Accordingly, in considering the
earlier Projects, careful attention was given to the method of tractor
procurement and the formula outlined below for Mysore substantially follows
the previously agreed arrangements.
2.        Farmers' purchase through existing dealership would not be
feasible as the necessary competition between dealerships would only be
obtained by liberalizing import licensing to enable large scale tractor
imports. In view of India's shortage of foreign exchange this would be
inappropriate. Normal international competitive bidding could only be
-organized through State entities. This would tend towards a Government
tractor distribution monopoly and further weaken existing dealership
channels and it would not take farmers' choice into account.
3.        To meet this situation, a formula has been worked out with the
Government of India (GOI), details of which would be as follows:
(a) GOI would establish a central committee (hereinafter
referred to as the Committee) for the purpose of directing
the procurement of goods under this Project. The Committee
would consist of representatives of GOI (one of whom would
be chairman), the Government of Mysore and the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation (ARC). Under the Committee's directions,
the Mysore Agro-Industries Corporation (MAIC) would organize
the procurement of goods under the Project in accordance with
the following procedures:
(b) MAIC would obtain tractor quotations on unit prices at
varying quantities from suppliers in IDA member countries
currently authorized to manufacture tractors in India.
These are Eicher (Federal Republic of Germany), Interna-
tional Harvester (USA) and Massey Ferguson (UK) with
plants in production and Deutz (Federal Republic of
Germany), Ford (UK) with plants for manufacture approved
by GOI. Further companies may be expected to be added
to the list; GOI is currently considering seven additional
proposals from firms in IDA member countries. Quotations



ANNEX 7
Page  2
would be sought by public invitation and the form and
substance of the bid requests would be subject to IDA
concurrence.
(c)  MAIC would require all suppliers submitting quotations
to give full particulars as to proposed pre-sales and
after sales service arrangements, including provision
for spare parts equal to 15% of the CIF price of tractors
supplied. Any supplier not providing satisfactory
assurance as to service arrangements would, subject to
IDA concurrence, be disqualified by the Committee.
(d) MAIC would advertise through the Mysore State Cooperative
Land Development Bank (LDB) and the participating
commercial banks, the quoted prices and service arrangements
offered by the different suppliers. Farmers would be
required to state to the Primary Bank of LDB or the
participating commercial bank their first and second
choice of tractor which they would be willing to buy
and at the same time make application for a loan.
(e) Farmers' tractor preferences would be sent to MAIC which
would aggregate the orders received according to first
tractor choices. If the aggregate orders for the parti-
cular model came to below the minimum acceptable order for
that manufacturer at the unit price quoted for varying
quantities, the Committee would discard the first choice
for those farmers and proceed on the basis of the second
or other choices as agreed by IDA. After approval by the
Committee, MAIC would send to IDA its analysis of bids and
its recommendations for the placing of orders. IDA would
then promptly inform the Committee whether it had any
objections to the recommended orders with its reasons.
(f) MAIC would subsequently place orders with the selected
suppliers at the unit prices quoted. MAIC would also
enter into contracts with the selected suppliers which
would specify service arrangements and performance
assurances including the supply of spare parts. Agents
representing suppliers would be required to see post-
warranty service.
(g) MAIC would arrange through the suppliers' representatives
in INDIA for the importation, insurance and transportation
to Mysore of tractors. Subsequently, the tractors would
be distributed to agents designated by the suppliers who
would perform pre-sales services and sell the tractors to
farmers whose loan applications had been approved.



ANNEX 7
Page  3
(h) Suppliers would be required to maintain stocks of spare
parts by a designated representative in a central store
to be released through agents for tractors imported under
the Project.
(1) In the event of the Committee placing orders over the
reasonable objections of IDA on the grounds of inconsistency
with the procedures or, if the terms of such orders
materially differed from those on which quotations were
based, IDA would reserve the right to cancel from the
Credit, such amount as it considered represented expen-
ditures under such orders.
4.        It is expected that the above tractor procurement method and
procedures would take account of individual preferences and tend to lower
prices while strengthening the services provided by manufacturers approved
agents which is considered essential to the Project.
Land Reclamation and Well-drilling Equipment
5.        Land reclamation and well-drilling equipment would be procured
by international competitive bidding under arrangements to be made by the
Committee. Bids would only be sought against approved loan applications
which would then be bulked to a value of at least US$100,000 equivalent for
purchase by dealers.

practices so that farmers receive equitable prices for their produce; and
(b) establishing adequate facilities and conditions which will contribute
towards an efficient marketing system. Legislative authority for these
functions are the Mysore Agricultural Produce Marketing Act 1966, Mysore
Warehousing Act 1961 and Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act 1937.
Enforcement of the marketing regulations rests with the State Marketing
Department which is also responsible for implementing schemes for the
improvement of marketing.
Mysore Agricultural Produce Marketing Act 1966
2.        Under this Act, the State Government on the recommendation of the
Marketing Department, has set up Market Committees which would build and
operate regulated marketing facilities as well as administer the provisions
of the Act. A Market Committee would consist of officials of the local
and State Governments and representatives of sellers (farmers), buyers,
commission agents and marketing societies. The functions of the Market
Committee are to:
(i) Implement provision of the Act;
(ii) Provide marketing facilities, including storage;
(iii) Grant, refuse, renew, suspend or cancel licenses of the
market functionaries;
(iv)  Regulate the opening, closing or suspension of trading;
(v) Regulate sales agreements, weight, delivery and payment of
transactions, including the settlement of disputes
between the seller and buyer;
(vi) Collect and disseminate information on prices and volume
of sales;
(vii) Prevent adulteration of goods and to promote grading and
standardization.
3.        All marketing activities in the regulated market take place under
the supervision of the staff of the Market Committee. The seller is charged
a commission fee amounting to 1-1/2% of the sales value by the commission

agent who is required to provide storage and insurance facilities to their
clients without charge. The seller is assured of a competitive price as
the sale takes place where the prospective buyers assemble and offer their
bids. The method of sale is either by tender system or by open auction.
The main source of income of the Market Committee is the market and license
fees. The maximum market fees that can be levied under the Act is Rs 0.3
per Rs 100 value of sales. In addition, the Market Committees have received
grants as well as loans carrying low interest rates from the State Government
for the construction of marketing facilities. So far 98 Market Committees
with a similar number of markets have been established throughout the State.
These markets have also set up 88 submarkets.
Mysore Warehousing Act 1961
4.        For the present, only the Central and State Government through
their respective Central Warehousing Corporation and State Warehousing
Corporation are operating warehouses under the Act in Mysore. To date the
two Corporations have established 44 warehouses at important agricultural
centers in the State. Funds for the State Warehousing Corporation come from
the Central Warehousing Corporation and the State Government.
5.        The main objective of warehousing is to enable the producer to
withhold the sale of his produce soon after the harvest period in order to
avoid creating a glut in the market and having to sell at low prices. The
producer who stores can obtain a loan on the pledge of his warehouse receipt.
This facility would help regulate the flow of agricultural produce to the
markets which in turn would result in higher prices for producers as well
as reduce the seasonal fluctuations in prices.
The Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act 1937
6.        Rules and standards for the grading and marking of agricultural
produce are administered by the Marketing Department. Many of the regulated
markets provide grading services and facilities. In addition, there are
at present 28 Government established centers which grade and mark butter,
ghee, honey, eggs, edible oils, and tobacco. The Government plans to
implement grading schemes for seven more agricultural commodities during the
current Plan period, 1969-74.

ANNEX 13
INDIA
MYSORE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return from the Project enterprises have
been calculated as shown in the attached tables. The following assumptions
have been made:
(a) World market prices as projected by the Trade Policies
and Export Projections Division of IBRD's Economics
Department have been used to estimate benefits.
(b) Current price levels net of taxes have been used for in-
vestments and allowance for cost increases has been excluded.
gc) A salvage value of 20% of initial cost has been assumed
at year 7 for tractors and implements.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return over the
life of the enterprises would range from 12 to 41%.
