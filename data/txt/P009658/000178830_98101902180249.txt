REPORT AND RECOEATICN OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVEIRNMNT OF INDIA
FOR THE MISORE: AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$140 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural credit project in
Mysore State, India.
PART I - INTROIJCTION
2.        Since 1949, the Bank has made 40 loans amounting to US$1 ,111
million and the Association 38 credits amounting to US$1,656 million -
both net of cancellations - to India. In keeping with the importance of
agriculture in the economy of India and with the pressing need to improve
agricultural productivity, a substantial proportion of these loans and
credits have been for projects in the agricultural sector. In all 21
loans and credits totalling some US$371 million have been for agricultural
or agriculture related projects in India. In the last two years, there
has been a particular emphasis on lending for agricultural credit.
Five recent IDA operations (US$146.9 million) were to finance agricul-
tural credit projects in the State of Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh,
Tamil Nadu, and Haryana.   The Credit now proposed in the State of Mysore
would be one more in this series. A similar agricultural credit project
in the State of Maharashtra has been appraised and additional projects
are contemplated for appraisal this year and next year in other States.
3.        The project was prepared jointly with FAO under the Cooperative
Program and appraised in March/April 1971. Negotiations were conducted
in Washington during the week of November 15-19, 1971. The Borrower was
represented by Mr. V. N. Rajagopalan, Deputy Secretary, Department of
Economic Affairs; by Mr. Mukerjee, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agricul-
ture; and by Mr. J. K. Jain, Joint Commissioner, Minor Irrigation,
Ministry of Agriculture. The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
was represented by its Chairman, Mr. P. N. Damry. Mr. Ga. V. K. Rao,
Development Commissioner and Mr. P. R. Dubhashi, Secretary to Government,
Departments of Cooperation, Development and Housing, represented the
State of Mysore. Mr. Viswanathan, Chairman, and Mr. J. K. Anagol,
Managing Director, represented the State Land Development &nk (LDB),
and Mr. Balakrishna, Managing Director, represented the Mysore State
Agro-Industries Corporation Limited, (MAE).
4.        Of the 40 loans and 38 credits to Indtia, 6 loans and 15 credits
of those declared effective are not yet fully disbursed. A summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as at October 31,
1971 is in Annex I.



5.        Comments on delays in disbursements are given in paragraphs
4 to 7 and a sumary of IF  comuitments in paragraph 8 of my Report
and Recamenndation on a Loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Limited, (P-988) circulated to the Ebecutive
Directors on October 13, 1971.
6.        Three of the current agricultural credit projects have only
just reached the date scheduled for first disbursements. They are the
first projects of this nature financed by the Bank Group in India and
the instituticnal and procurement arrangements are complex. Progress
towards starting disbursements has, therefore, been slower than
expected. However, in the case of Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project
(Credit 191-IN), the first disbursementlbr minor irrigation has been
made and further disbursements should be due shortly in respect of the
first tranche of tractors, the order for the supply of which was approved
four months ago. Further delay in disbursement is now anticipated in
the Punjab Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 203-IN), following a
decision by the Goverment of India to re-tender at a stage when bids for
the first tranche were ready to be advertised to farmers. I fully
expect, however, that progress will improve as experience is gained in
these new and rather complex projects.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
7.        An eccaomic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-25a) dated May 11, 1971, was distributed to the Bhecutive
Directors on May 24, 1971, and a memorandum entitled "India: MaIjor
Economic Issues" (R 71-249 dated November 9, 1971) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on November 9, 1971. A basic data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
8.        Over the last four years, the Indian economy has grown at an
annual rate of about 5 percent, due to a great extent to the encouraging
progress being made in agriculture, and reflecting, in part, substantial
investments in irrigation and high yielding varieties of seeds which in
the last cropyear increased foodgrain production alone by 8.5 percent.
But, because agriculture still contributes nearly half of india's GNP,
overall econamic growth and the virtual self-sufficiency in foodgrains
which has recently been achieved, remain precariously dependent on
climatic factors.
9.        The current Five-Year Plan (1969-74) has as its target an
overall annual growth of 5.5 percent with an increase in manufacturing
output (which contributes 19 percent of GNP) of about 8 to 10 percent
a year. The growth of medium and large-scale industrial production
fell to just over 5 percent in 1970 from earlier growth rates of about
7 percent, main3y due to shortages of raw material and low public invest-
ment due to restrictive budget policies. On the other hand, small-scale
industrial output continued to make considerable gains, particularly in
those industries linked to the agricultural sector.



-3-
10.       An important constraint on economic growth, and a major
cause of cancern, has been the low rate of net domestic investment
which has declined from 15 percent of national income in 1966 to 12
percent in 1970. Increases in public savings through higher taxation
have been insufficient to make up for the sharp decline in net
receipts of foreiga aid, inclnding food aid, over this period (from
US$1.1 billion in 1966 to about US$450 million in 1970/71), and public
sector investment has been held back.
11.       Since the economic report was written, an additional and
growing burden has been imposed on the 3Idian economy by the influx of
large numbers of refugees from East Pakistan. Apart from the social and
administrative costs, the financial burden of caring for the refugees may
require reductions in the development budget if substantial humnitarian
assistance is not forthcoming from the international community.
12.       Economic policy in the last few years has been governed to a
considerable extent by the droughts in fiscal years 1966 and 1967. Pre-
viously, the Government had permitted large trade gaps which were to be
covered by foreign aid. By December 1967, however, net reserves had
reached a low of US$200 millJion, and the Government has ever since
pursued more restrained expenditure policies. In the process, the trade
deficit has been reduced from US$1.3 billion equivalent in 1965/66 to
about US$180 milli on equivalent in 1970/71, involving a large reduction in
imports (mainly, but by no means entirely, of food) because growth of
exports remained sluggish until it picked up last year to reach over 8
percent. One result of these policies has been the rebuilding of reserves
to the present level of US$1.0 billion, which permits greater flexibility
and freedom from uncertainties, including those regarding the flow of
external aid. But another result has undoubtedly been a restraint on
growth.
13.       It is clear that TIdials economic development will continue to
require financial support from abroad on a very substantial scale. In
view of the heavy service obligations on existing debt, such assistance
should be made available so far as possible on concessional terms.



PART III - THE PROJECT
14.        A report entitled "Appraisal of Mysore Agricultural Credit
Project" (PA-105a dated November 30, 1971) will be distributed separate-
ly. A Credit and Project Summary is at Annex III.
15.        The proposed project and the five similar, current projects
in other States can best be placed in perspective against the back-
ground of agricultural policy in India by reference to the change in
emphasis away from heavy industrialization, which characterized previous
plans, to agricultural development in the Fourth Five-Year Plan.   This
change, predicated upon and taking optimum advantage of the 'new agri-
cultural technology, has involved allocating priority to water resource
development by increasing irrigation facilities and necessary comple-
mentary inputs. Farr mechanization, improved and high yielding seed
varieties, fertilizers and pesticides, extension work, research and
agricultural credit figure prominently among such inputs. Already,
significant yield and output increases have been achieved and foodgrain
production in 1970 reached a new record of 108 million tons, or 8.5 per-
cent more than in the previous year.
16.        One major obstacle to increasing the number of farmers who
have changed from traditional to modern farming techniques is the short-
age of institutional credit.  The Reserve Bank of India has estimated
that credit institutions will require to finance an average annual agri-
cultural investment of US$400 million during the Fourth Plan period
compared with less than US$100 million so invested in 1966/67. Short-
term credit requirements needed are projected to increase by 11 percent
per year to more than US$2.5 billion in 1973/74.
17.        As has been the case in the five earlier agricultural credit
projects in India, the project is tailored to conform with the overall
agricultural policies and programs of the Borrower. Most of the proceeds
of the credit would be lent to farmers in Mysore for on-farm investments
in minor irrigation, land reclamation and levelling and mechanization
through the Agricultural Refinance Corporation, which would refinance
the Mysore State Land Development Bank and its federated Primary Banks
(PLUB) as well as selected commercial banks lending to farmers under the
project. In addition, the project would include financing for well-
drilling and earthmoving equipment and for consultancy services to assist
in the proper exploitation of groundwater resources through;detailed
geologic and hydrologic studies.
18.        Under the project, wells and lift irrigation will be provided'
and land levelling carried out to irrigate 142,,000 ha, of which 50,000 ha
would also benefit by the use of the 2,000 tractors to be s8-pplied.  In
all, some 36,000 farmers would be able to expand their output .of food



and comercial crops. The    ual increase in production is estimated
at full development at about 192,000 tons of foodgrain, 21,000 tons
of seed cotton, 1441,000 tons of groundnut and 87,000 tons of vegetables.
19.        The total project cost is estimated to be US$70.4 million of
which the proposed Credit would finance about 55 percent (minor irriga-
tion US$25.0 milion, land reclamation US$18.0 million, farm mechanization
US$17.3 million, equipment US$9.7 million and conaultanoy services US$0.4
million).
20.        Farmers' contributions would normally be 20 percent for minor
irrigation and land levelling investments (10 percent for small farmers),
and 25 percent for farm mechanization. The remaining finance needed
would be provided by the LDB, the participating commercial banks and the
ARC. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$20.0 million
equivalent or about 28 percent of project costs. IDA would finance the
total of this component and about 40 percent of local currency costs.
This substantial financing of local costs is necessary if the Bank Group
is to make an effective contribution to agricultural development in India
which, characteristically$ involves a small foreign exchange component.
India has a suitable development program, which requires funds in excess
of savings which can be raised locally and the capital which can be
raised from external sources. The more general case for local sxpendi-
ture financing has been discussed in recent economic reports, including
Chapter X of SA-25a dated May 11, 1971.
21.        The economic rate of return is est mated to range from 12 per-
cent on dugwall investments to 41 percent on lift irrigation. Financial
rates of return to farmers would also be high, being estimated at current
producer prices to range from 19 percent to 57 percent for minor irrigation,
28 percent for farm mechanization and 59 percent for land levelling.
22.        The Government would channel the Credit proceeds in accordance
with its standard lending. tnrma, ARC-repaying about 70 percent,_
after nine years at an interest rate of 4-3/4 percent and the balance
after fifteen years at 5-1/4 percent. ARC, which is already acting as
the supervising and refinancing agency for the other five agricultural
credit projects would continue in this role, refinancing the loan opera-
tions of the banks at 6-1/2 percent per nnum. Loans to individual
borrowers would bear interest at 9 percent per annum and would be repay-
able over periods up to ten years but would extend to fifteen years in
the case of loans for minor irrigation and land reclamation to small
famers.
23.        The procurement of tractors, together with spare parts, would
follow the pattern established in earlier credits, although a slight
modification has been introduced (which it is intended should also be
applied retrospectively to the other projects) in respect of spares, to
allow for an initial importation equal in value to 10 percent of the



- 6 -
c.i.f. cost of tractors (instead of 15 percent), five percent to be
imported in the first two years of the project. The Mysore Agro-
Industries Corporation will act as procurement agency. Farmers will
be allowed their choice of tractors from among those for which quotations
may be offered by Bank member country suppliers which have manufacturing
facilities in India or which have received the Government' s approval to
establish such facilities. Drilling rigs and land reclamation machinery
are to be procured under the usual arrangenents for international com-
petitive bidding with Indian suppliers receiving a margin. of preference
of 15 percent or the existing level of import duties, vhichever is the
less. The prevailing customs duty is 30 percent for drilling rigs and
zero for earthmoving machinery for agricultural purposes.
24.        The five earlier agricultural credit projects were in States
with comparatively strong cooperative lending institutions. Institutions
in Mysore, however, although organizationally well structurw1d, suffer
from a recent history of poor collection records. It was clear that
considerable improvement in collection performance and in financial
strength would be necessary if the project was to proceed. Prior to
negotiations, a detailed plan Was received for the reorganization of the
141 PLDBs in the project area, under which the percentage of recoveries
would be raised from 53 percent to 75 percent and their managements
improved. This followed a Reserve Bank of India appraisal and written
confirmation by the State government that it supported the program, and
that necessary funds would be provided.
25.        The timetable for these reforms presupposed the relS,ilitation
of ten banks by the date of negotiations, (50 were already acceptable)
a further 40 by the Effective Date (April 15, 1972) and th& remaining
41 by September 30, 1972. During negotiations it became apparent that
very satisfactory progress was being made on the implementation of this
program, that accomplishments were well ahead of the timetable and that
the complete financial rehabilitation program might be completed by April
1972.
26.        These arrangements represent a realistic approaciWto the
general problem facing agricultural credit inatitutions in India. Giveak(
the cooperation of State governments, of the Reserve Bank of India, and
of ARC, the treatment of the problem as worked out in this project could
be applied elsewhere and become instrumental in achieving a' much greater
geographical spread 6f agricultural lending by the Association in India
than had been thought possible.
27.        In the absence of legislation to control the uae df$groundwater,
there is need to ensure the, optimum utilization of water without depleting
underground resources. Another feature of the project is, therefore, the
constraints placed on minor irrigation investments in the form-of provisions
in the Project Agreemnt relating to the spacing of wells.   Such restric-
tions cannot be a full substitute for effective legislation (model



- 7 -
legislation has been prepared but it will take some time before being
adopted in individual States),, but they go some considerable way to
preventing waste of water.
28.        For small farmer beneficiaries, terms and conditions of
lending for minor irrigation and land levelling are differentiated as
they were in earlier projects (paragraphs 20 and 22 above).
29.        The effect of mechanization on rural employment, as in other
projects, continues to receive attention. To this end, the Association
and the Goverment of India have commissioned a comprehenaive study on
this subject in the States of Gujarat and Punjab which is already under
way. This study should provide a more thorough analysis and fuller
information regarding the employment effects of mechanization in agri-
culture.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
ARC, LDB and MAIC, the Agreement between the Association and the State
of Mysore, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
31.       The draft Agreements incorporate the relending terms and
procurement provisions explained in paragraphs 22 and 23 above. The
specific obligations of India regarding the importation of tractors and
other equipment for the project are included in Section 3.01 of the
Development Credit Agreement.
32.       In addition to the Condition of Effectiveness referred to in
paragraph 25, the Development Credit Agreement contains four other
Conditions of Effectiveness in Section 8.01 (b), (d), (e) and (g) which
relate specifically to the project.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would coaply with the
Articles.of Agreement of the Aasoc4ation.
PART V - REGQNMENDATION
34.       I recomuend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
