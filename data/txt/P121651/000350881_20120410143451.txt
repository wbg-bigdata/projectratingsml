Main Policy Areas   Energy, Climate Change, Environmental Management
                    Key outcome indicators for the program’s main policy areas follow below.

                    Energy Sector: (i) day-ahead electricity market launched and operates
                    effectively; (ii) cost–reflective tariffs maintained; (iii) improved financial
                    performance of power companies, with loss for TEDAŞ and receivables for
                    TEIAŞ and EÜAŞ reduced; (iv) private investment in the power sector; (v)
                    rate of electricity demand growth contained; and (vi) a new gas import
                    contract signed by BOTAŞ or a private gas importer.

                    Climate Change: (i) An inter-ministerial Climate Change Coordination
                    Board and a Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment
Key Outcome         and Urbanization are working to coordinate and ensure complementarity
Indicators          between sector specific climate actions; and (ii) a framework established for
                    monitoring the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy
                    and Action Plan agreed.

                    Sustainable Environmental Management: (i) An integrated system for
                    environmental “e-permits? is operational; (ii) Increased transparency,
                    accountability and public participation in the environmental consent
                    process; (iii) increased share of population served by sanitary landfills; (iv)
                    Clean Air Center in Marmara fully functioning and staffed to implement
                    the Clean Air Action Plan; and (v) at least 15 of the 25 river basins have
                    developed watershed protection action plans.
Program             The ongoing ESES DPL program is grounded in the development goals
Development         articulated in Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan. The development
Objective(s) and    objective of the Government’s program proposed to be supported by ESES
Contribution to     DPL3 is to help: (a) enhance energy security by promoting private sector
CPS                 clean technology investments and operations; (b) integrate principles of

                                                i
                 environmental sustainability, including climate change considerations, in
                 key sectoral policies and programs; and (c) improve the effectiveness and
                 efficiency of environmental management processes.                  The program
                 supported by this ongoing DPL series has a focus on the energy sector and
                 greenhouse gas emissions. This focus is consistent with the energy, climate
                 and environmental goals of the European Union (EU) and effectively
                 contributes to Turkey's EU accession process.
                 There are four main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) economic risks;
                 (ii) political risks; (iii) implementation and social risks in the energy sector;
                 and (iv) program and implementation risks in the climate change and
                 environmental management areas.

                 Economic Risks. A combination of external and domestic factors pose
                 significant risks going forward, including from the spillovers of the
                 European debt crisis. With low domestic savings, Turkey’s economic
                 growth relies on capital inflows to finance investments and growth. The
                 country’s large current account deficit and the composition of its financing
                 remain concerns. A weak outlook for global activity and more severe
                 international funding strains have the potential to spill over to Turkey.
                 Turkey’s dependence on external financing has left the country prone to
                 boom-bust cycles, and the key challenge going forward in Turkey is to
                 deliver a soft landing, from the very high growth rates in 2010 and 2011.

                 Political risks. Turkey has had a stable government since 2002 under the
                 Justice and Development Party (AKP), facilitating the implementation of
                 major reforms. Social consensus on the reform program and institutional
Risks and Risk   capacity are needed for the implementation of the reform program. One key
Mitigation       risk is that a prolonged focus on Turkey’s constitutional reform agenda
                 could narrow the coverage and scope of the economic reform agenda or
                 lead to delays in its implementation. The EU accession anchor continues to
                 mitigate political risks.

                 Energy sector risks: implementation risks and social risks.

                 Turkey’s Electricity Market and Supply Security Strategy emphasizes
                 private sector participation – both in the new areas of renewable energy
                 and energy efficiency where substantial barriers have to be overcome as
                 well as in the mainstream energy production and distribution areas where
                 the investment needs are very high. The envisioned privatization and
                 implementation schedules could not be realized as global market conditions
                 worsened. Implementation risks are mitigated by the energy regulator
                 EMRA’s and the Privatization Administration’s strong track records and
                 the Government’s continued commitment; however, additional delays may
                 occur if global market conditions do not improve.

                 The 2008-2009 recession increased the financial burden of electricity prices
                 increases on the poorest households. Available data suggest that past

                                             ii
               electricity privatizations have not had a large adverse impact on the poor.
               However, two privatizations to be completed within 2012 are in areas
               where payment rates are low and the imperative to raise collection rates
               may generate more difficulties at the household level than previous
               privatizations. The energy regulator EMRA monitors the performance of
               the privatized companies on a quarterly basis, including collections and
               disconnections. In addition, a joint monitoring program by the Ministry of
               Development, UNDP and the World Bank will be implemented in 2012-
               2014. Effective monitoring will help inform and plan mitigation measures,
               if necessary, for low-income households.

               The successful implementation of Turkey’s climate action agenda
               requires the broadening and deepening of Government ownership and
               public support in Turkey and maintaining momentum of the
               international negotiation process—especially as the issues of emission
               reduction and finance have not yet been resolved in the UNFCCC process.
               Turkey’s climate action agenda is long term and its implementation has
               only recently started. These risks are mitigated by a growing public
               awareness of the implications of climate change for Turkey; by the
               recognition that climate action is in Turkey’s own national interest.

               Turkey’s environment agenda is long term and challenging, and
               implementation capacity risks are high.           While there is strong
               Government ownership of environmental management reforms, Turkey’s
               experience and capacity in public environmental management and
               enforcement remain limited. This risk is mitigated by projects currently
               targeted toward the institutional strengthening of the Ministries of
               Environment and Urbanization and Forestry and Water Affairs, supported
               under the EU pre-accession financial and technical assistance programs.
               The European Union opened the negotiations on the Environment Chapter
               in December 2009. The mid-2011 merger of environment and urban
               ministries into a single ministry has raised a concern that the urban
               construction agenda will prevail over the environment. The Government is
               aware of this concern and is determined to implement its environmental
               strategy and program.

                   THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PROPOSED THIRD PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
      ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (ESES DPL3)

                                         I.       INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Third Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and Energy
Sector Development Policy Loan (ESES DPL3) is the third operation in a series of three
energy/environment DPLs. The DPL series supports the Government’s policies for long-term
sustainable growth across the economy and in the energy sector in particular: (a) The ESES
DPL3 program continues to support the Government’s program for energy security, energy
efficiency and clean energy supported earlier under the 2009 Programmatic Electricity
Development Policy Loan (PEDPL1)1 and the 2010 Second Environmental Sustainability and
Energy Sector Development Policy Loan (ESES DPL2)2; and (b) at the request of the
Government, DPL2 and DPL3 also support policies, strategies and specific measures related to
climate change and environmental management. The Government has concluded that energy
efficiency, energy security and environmental issues are most effectively addressed in an
integrated program. Such an integrated approach is consistent with the energy, climate and
environmental goals of the European Union (EU) and contributes to Turkey's EU accession
process. A parallel Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment DPL (REGE DPL) program
supported Turkey’s transition from crisis management to growth in the recovery. 3

2.      The design of the ESES DPL series and recent operations in the Bank’s Turkey
energy program are aligned with the Strategic Framework of the World Bank Group for
Development and Climate Change.4 There are mutually reinforcing complementarities among
the three pillars of the ESES DPL program. They are summarized in Box 3 in Section V.
Energy sector actions to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy generation have a
positive global, national and local environmental impact. The National Climate Change Strategy
and Action Plan are comprehensive; with initial implementation action focused on the energy
sector. National and local environmental actions have synergies with climate change actions and
support climate change mitigation and adaption.

3.      The Government’s energy program — a core part of the broader program
underpinning the ESES DPL series — has achieved impressive results: (a) A day-ahead
electricity market (a power exchange) has been established and trading currently accounts for
over one quarter of Turkey’s electricity supply; (b) financial recovery has been achieved in the
power sector. Main state-owned utilities have paid their arrears to private sector generators.
Remaining cross-payables and receivables between public sector companies are being cleaned-
up through a special legislation enacted by the Parliament in February 2011; (c) a large volume
of private investment has been attracted, including the development of about 11,200 MW

generation capacity in the 2008-2011 period and about US$5.4 billion so far in the ongoing
electricity distribution privatization program. However, the closing of the latest privatizations
slipped to 2012 and most may require rebidding; and (d) agreements for the purchase of gas for
Turkey’s gas market and transit to Europe have been signed between the Governments of
Azerbaijan and Turkey and their gas companies SOCAR and BOTAŞ. In addition to the DPL
series, the Bank supports Turkey’s electricity and gas utilities TEIAŞ, TEDAŞ and BOTAŞ
under investment loans as summarized in Section IV.

4.      Since 2009, Turkey has stepped up its engagement on climate change and has
requested World Bank development policy and investment lending support for its climate
change program: (a) Turkey ratified the Kyoto Protocol in February 2009 and became a party
to the Protocol in August 2009, declaring that within the framework of its special circumstances,
it shall contribute to the effort of tackling climate change; (b) The Government approved a
National Climate Change Strategy in May 2010 and published a National Climate Change
Action Plan in July 2011; (c) Turkey submitted one of the first Investment Plans to the Clean
Technology Fund (CTF), prepared in coordination with the World Bank Group and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The CTF Trust Fund Committee endorsed
the US$250 million phase I of Turkey’s plan in January 2009; (d) The CTF approved US$100
million in March 2009 and the Bank US$500 million in May 2009 to help finance the Private
Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project. This was the first investment project
approved by the CTF. Implementation progress has exceeded expectations and additional Bank
financing of US$500 million was approved in November 2011; and (e) Turkey has also joined
the Partnership for (carbon) Market Readiness (PMR) launched by the World Bank at COP-16 in
Cancun in December 2010. Turkey was awarded a US$350,000 PMR Preparation Grant in May
2011 by the PMR Partnership Assembly. The Preparation Grant Agreement was signed in
December 2011.

5.      Turkey and the EU have an intensive engagement, including negotiating the
Environment Chapter as part of Turkey’s EU accession process. The impact of the EU
acquis on policy making is currently strong in national and local environmental policy areas: (a)
Turkey has already made a considerable effort in harmonizing its environmental laws with those
of the EU, including environmental prior actions supported under DPL2 and DPL3 as detailed in
Section V.       Harmonization with EU environmental regulations will generate greater
environmental gains especially in the industrial sector by improved management of waste and
effluents and overall emission reduction of large combustion plants; and (b) The new e-
environment permitting system, combining all the licenses and permits required by industrial
installations into a single e-environment permit, is an important step towards implementing the
EU’s Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

6.      Turkey’s political situation is stable. Turkey is governed by the Justice and
Development (AK) Party, which has an overall majority in Parliament since 2002 and was most
recently reelected in June 2011. Turkey is a candidate country for EU membership. Accession
negotiations started in October 2005. Turkey views the accession process as her own,
fundamental “modernization project?. After the June 2011 elections, the Government upgraded
the institution overseeing all EU accession matters into a new Ministry for EU Affairs.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.     After a banking crisis in 2001, when GDP contracted by 5.7 percent, and an
expensive recapitalization of its banks, Turkey embarked on a path of concerted structural
reforms. Reforms were wide-spanning and aimed at improving fiscal and public financial
management, strengthening banking supervision, introducing a comprehensive social security
reform, and revamping the framework for macroeconomic management, within which an
independent central bank is responsible for inflation-targeting.

8.      Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade have
yielded robust economic growth. Real GDP increased by 50 percent between 2001 and 2010
and the average growth rate was nearly 7 percent during 2003-07, up from an average of 4
percent during the 1990s. Growth resumed rapidly after the 2008-2009 global crisis, at 9 percent
in 2010 and 10.2 percent in the first half of 2011. Per capita income now stands at US$10,067.
Primary fiscal surpluses averaged about 4.6 percent of GDP over 2004-10, and gross public debt
as a percentage of GDP fell from 73.4 percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010, in spite of an
increase during the 2008-09 global crisis. Inflation came down from a high of around 70 percent
to under 10 percent. Healthy export growth (13 percent per year over 2004-10) contributed to
limiting external vulnerability.

9.       The credibility built with consumers, investors, and financial markets over several
years allowed the Government to adopt expansionary macroeconomic policies during the
2008-2009 global crisis. Turkey suffered from a short but sharp fall in GDP (4.8 percent) in
2009 reflecting a strong deterioration of investor and consumer confidence and a drop in external
demand and capital inflows. The current account deficit narrowed significantly as imports
reacted strongly to the sharp slow-down in domestic demand while exports were less affected.
The authorities’ response combined monetary easing with foreign exchange liquidity- and
confidence-building measures in the financial sector, a set of employment measures, as well as
fiscal stimuli. Between October 2008 and November 2009, the overnight interest rate was cut by
a cumulative 10.25 percentage points. The fiscal deficit increased sharply from 1.6 percent in
2008 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, due mainly to the operation of automatic stabilizers (such as
the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in budgetary transfer to the Social
Security Institution (SSI)). Facilitated by expansionary policies, unemployment peaked by mid-
2009 – at around 16 percent - and output began to recover by the last quarter of 2009.

                                               3
10.      Turkey recovered from the 2009 recession quickly, with a GDP growth of 9 percent
in 2010 and 9.6 percent during the first three quarters of 2011. The strong growth was
facilitated by rapid credit growth5 and high capital inflows (supported global liquidity and
healthy Turkish balance sheets). Real output is now almost ten percent higher than its pre-crisis
peak. During the past two years, growth has been driven by domestic consumption and
investment demand from the private sector, fueled by historically low interest rates. In 2010,
private consumption and private investment accounted for about 5 percentage points each to the
9 percent overall growth rate, while net exports made a negative contribution; Table 1).

11.     The reforms undertaken after the 2001 crisis allowed the Turkish financial system
to come through the global crisis relatively unscathed. In recent years, the system built
capital buffers which, complemented with strengthened banking regulation and supervision
efforts, has led to the emergence of a more resilient, stable and profitable banking sector. The
system has historically relied mostly on a stable domestic deposit base for funding and remains
liquid. While vulnerabilities have increased, mostly on account of a significant expansion in
bank lending increasingly funded through short-term capital inflows, there are recent signs of a
slowdown in credit growth which, coupled with still strong capital and profitability positions,
should help the system weather a reduction in economic activity.

12.     Unemployment has fallen below pre-crisis levels, notwithstanding an increase in
labor force participation. After peaking at above 16 percent in February 2009, seasonally
adjusted unemployment has decreased steadily falling to 9.1 percent by October 2011, improving
upon pre-crisis levels. Nonetheless, open unemployment in Turkey remains high in absolute
terms, and the Turkish labor market is characterized by low activity rates and high job
informality. The employment rate of working age (15-64) women is the lowest among OECD
and Europe and Central Asia countries. And about 40 percent of those employed are working in
the informal sector, although job informality has been decreasing somewhat.

  Gross public debt as defined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU defined general government debt stock
definition. The difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU defined debt: (i) recording of zero coupon
securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of inflation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of coins in circulation issued
by Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held by different public sector institutions, (iv) exclusion of debt
stocks of SOEs. *actualized

13. High growth has translated into continuing improvements in the headline fiscal
balance. The general government fiscal deficit declined from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to an
estimated 1.2 percent in 2011 and, after a crisis-related increase in 2008, the public debt to GDP
ratio has resumed its downward trend. The decline in the fiscal deficit reflects the strong
cyclical nature of tax revenues, but a comprehensive tax restructuring program and a reduction

                                                                  5
in the interest bill have also contributed. Primary spending remains significantly above the pre-
crisis level, primarily due to higher capital investment, wage and pension spending. There has
been significant structural loosening in recent years, from a structural primary surplus
equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to an estimated deficit of around one percent of GDP
in 2011.

14. High growth of imports (in particular of capital and intermediate goods) has led to a
rapid rise in Turkey’s current account deficit (CAD), from an 8-year low in 2009 to
historic highs during 2011. The CAD widened from US$ 14 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in
2009 to US$ 47.1 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) in 2010 77.8 billion as of November 2011 (9.8
percent of GDP) on a 12-month rolling basis; imports grew by 35 percent while exports
increased by 17.5 percent. Furthermore, the composition of the CAD financing deteriorated
with the share of FDI in total inflows falling from 43 percent in 2007 to 15 percent in 2011
(Figure 1). Although energy accounts for a large share of the trade deficit (nearly 5 percent of
GDP on average in recent years), the non-energy balance contributed significantly to the
deterioration. The private sector accounted for the bulk of the CAD, and private external
indebtedness increased correspondingly, from US$ 188 billion in 2008 to US$ 202.2 billion in
2011.

15. Facing difficult policy trade-offs, the Central Bank has implemented an
“unorthodox? policy, moving to a tightening stance in late 2011. A weak global economy,
and the transition from large capital inflows and upward pressure on the lira in 2010 to
declining inflows and lira depreciation pressures in 2011 have created difficult economic policy
trade-offs. In late 2010, in response to surging capital inflows, the Central Bank adopted an
“unorthodox? monetary policy cutting overnight interest rates in an effort to discourage
portfolio investors from taking short-term “carry trade? positions in lira assets, while at the
same time increasing reserve requirements to curtail domestic credit. The lira weakened
significantly as a result, while credit growth began to slow following the introduction of macro-

                                                                                6
prudential measures by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority only in June 2011.
Prompted by concerns about the global economy and early indications of a domestic slowdown,
the Central Bank reduced the policy rate by 50 bps in early August 2011.

16. Since mid-October 2011, responding to an increase in inflation (primarily reflecting
pass-through of the cumulative 30 percent nominal depreciation since November 2010),
the Central Bank has tightened monetary policy. It has inter alia increased overnight
lending rates and engaged in large-sale foreign exchange selling auctions and direct
interventions. As a result, the interbank overnight rate increased from 6.5 percent in December
2010 to 11.2 percent in December 2011, and the benchmark government bond yield rose from
7.11 to 11.04 percent during the same period.

MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

17.     While Turkey benefits from strong private and public sector balance sheets, an
externally-financed demand boom has recently weakened Turkey’s resilience. Strong
growth over the 2010-11 period has led to a fast widening current account deficit and Turkey’s
main vulnerability is its high current account deficit and the short-term nature of its financing.
The weakening global economic outlook and increasingly severe international funding strains
have the potential to spill over to Turkey. If the crisis in the Euro-zone deepens further, Turkey
will be hit primarily by a decline or stop of capital inflows, as well as through the trade channel.

18.      Rising inflationary pressures and the possibility of further depreciation of the lira
constitute a risk for price stability in the medium-term. Inflation targeting policy has been
hampered by tax hikes and increases in administered prices as well as increases in food prices
due to adverse weather conditions and pass-through from exchange-rate depreciation. As a result,
2011 year end inflation came in at 10.45 percent, overshooting the target of 5.5 percent for the
first time since 2008. As of mid-January 2012, the end-year inflation expectation for is 7.2
percent, compared to the 5.0 percent official target.

19.    Growth is expected to slow down significantly in 2012, before recovering to about five
percent per annum in the medium-term. Slower credit growth (the adjusted annualized weekly
credit growth rate declined to 23 percent in mid-December 2011, less than half its peak of 50
percent in January 2011) and falling domestic and foreign demand is estimated to have slowed
down growth already in the last quarter of 2011, bringing the growth rate for the year to around
eight percent. Real GDP growth is expected to slow down to about three percent in 2012. The
macroeconomic outlook beyond 2012 is more favorable and, in line with Government’s
Medium-Term Program (MTP), projects a GDP growth rate of around five percent per annum,
driven largely by strong private-sector led domestic demand, in combination with slowly
recovering exports. The projected growth is predicated on capital inflows financing a current
account deficit of 5-6 percent over the medium term (Table 2).

20.     This growth path is predicated on continued progress on Turkey’s unfinished
structural reform agenda. Such reforms include the implementation of the new commercial
code and code of obligations, the labor market reform, and measures to bolster long-term fiscal
savings and reduce the dependency on imports of fuel through an expansion of renewable energy
use in electricity generation and improvements in energy efficiency. The current account deficit

                                                 7
is projected to narrow in the outer years (supported by structural reforms and enhanced
competitiveness as well as a recovery in global growth) and supported by higher domestic
savings.

21.    The MTP envisages gradual improvements in fiscal balances. On the public sector
side, Table 2 shows a shift from a 1.1 percent public sector primary deficit in 2009 to a 2.1
percent surplus by 2014, with the general government balance shifting correspondingly from a
5.5 percent deficit in 2009 to a 0.5 percent deficit in 2014. Given current global economic
uncertainties, the Authorities need to remain vigilant and avoid fiscal policy slippages. This will
help limit risks, which can rapidly increase in the current volatile environment, strengthen
investor confidence, and moderate aggregate demand.

The fiscal adjustment over 2012-14 will come mainly from expenditure measures. General
government expenditures as a share of GDP are projected to decline, from the 2009 level of
about 40 percent, to about 36.8 percent by 2014, leading to a declining borrowing requirement.
The decrease in spending over the MTP period is driven by a decline in current expenditures,
mainly cuts in goods and services spending, and a decrease in current transfers to the Social
Security Institutions (because of the improvements in its balance). The composition of taxation
and spending still pose longer-term challenges however. Tax revenues rely heavily on value
added and special consumption taxes, and there remains scope to improve collection of income
tax. More generally, it will be important to leave room in the budget for growth-enhancing public
investment by controlling current spending.


                                                                        8
22.     The energy sector is a net contributor to public finances, most importantly through
taxes on petroleum fuels. In 2011, Turkey raised US$16.6 billion in petroleum special
consumption tax (SCT) and oil-tax revenues account for more than 13 percent of total tax
revenues. Turkey’s gasoline taxes are high internationally and in addition to boosting
government revenue they promote energy savings. Still, despite this contribution, the energy
sector is also a source of fiscal losses. Revenue shortfalls (inadequate tariffs) and collection
problems have led to tax arrears in utilities, in particular BOTAŞ. The receivables of BOTAŞ
from state-owned utilities amount to about US$4 billion and BOTAŞ in turn has accumulated
payables on custom duty. The program supported by the ongoing ESES DPL program addresses
this including through sustained implementation of cost-based pricing. As BOTAŞ’s collections
from generators improve, so will its ability to pay tax. Financial recovery in the power sector
has enabled the payment of current bills and the elimination of arrears to private sector
generators – electricity trading company TETAŞ cleared its arrears during 2009 and electricity
market operator TEİAŞ PMUM cleared its arrears in 2010. Remaining cross-payables and
receivables between public sector companies are to be cleaned-up through a legislation which
was enacted in December 2010.

23.     The environmental investments that Turkey would have to make to implement the
EU Environmental Acquis come at significant cost over the next two decades. Investments
will be required to be in compliance with some 200 laws and regulations covering water and air
pollution, waste and chemicals management, biotechnology, radiation protection and nature
conservation. The EU Integrated Environmental Approximation Strategy estimates the cost to be
about Euro 59 billion. Turkey’s current capital investment spending on the environment is
estimated to be below 0.5 percent of GDP and has not been affected by credit constraints. This
share will increase gradually and may reach 2 percent of GDP in a few peak investment years.

24.     External financing needs will remain high in 2012-16 (Table 3). Turkey should be in
a position to attract further FDI given privatization efforts and the potential for mergers and
acquisitions. The baseline net FDI inflows are projected to rise from US$13 billion in 2012 to
US$18.1 billion in 2016. Similarly, net portfolio flows are assumed to be positive, consistent
with continued Eurobond issuance and the potential of the domestic capital market to raise
financing. However, higher oil prices than assumed here (US$100/barrel), for a sustained period,
would create additional external financing requirements - a risk that needs to be closely
monitored going forward. A US$10/barrel increase in oil prices would increase the CAD by an
estimated 0.4-0.5 percentage points of GDP, and would shave around 0.2-0.3 percentage points
of growth.

25.     The reliance on external financing will likely continue in the near future, with the
associated risks of a significant growth slowdown if financing dries up. With low domestic
savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inflows to finance imports. The country’s
large current account deficit and the composition of its financing remain critical concerns. Under
a deepened crisis scenario in the Euro zone and a corresponding sudden stop of capital inflows to
emerging markets driven by a flight to safety, Turkey could possibly face a renewed recession.

26.     External debt dynamics are vulnerable to a severe unfavorable shock. After
declining considerably from 56 percent in 2002 to 35.3 percent in 2005, external debt stood at
41.3 percent at end-2011 and is forecast to increase to 42.6 percent by end-2012 before easing to

                                                9
41.1 percent by end-2016 in a baseline scenario. However, external debt sustainability analysis
shows that, in the event of a sudden stop of capital flows, the external debt to GDP ratio would
rise from 41.3 percent to almost 48 percent in 2014, while the pace of the increase would slow
down thereafter.

27.    The public debt sustainability analysis suggests that the risks to the sustainability of
Turkey’s debt burden are moderate. As shown in Table 3, gross public debt is forecast to
decline from 45 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 33.2 percent of GDP by 2015 (Figure 3).
However, in an extreme downside scenario the interest rate would go up, the exchange rate
would depreciate, GDP would contract, and fiscal performance would deteriorate.

28.    Overall, Turkey’s macroeconomic framework is adequate for the proposed
operation. Turkey remains vulnerable to a slowdown of capital inflows due to its high reliance
on external financing. Turkey’s key structural strengths, primarily its resilient banking sector,
dynamic private sector and favorable public and external debt dynamics mitigate risks to the
economy and suggest a favorable medium-term outlook for Turkey’s growth performance.
Based on future progress in the structural reform agenda and strong macroeconomic and fiscal
management, Turkey is likely to maintain growth rates around its potential.

                                 III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

29.     The Government of Turkey has set itself ambitious development goals. Turkey
intends to be one of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023, the 100th anniversary of the
founding of the Turkish Republic. The Government’s 2023 vision 6 aims for gross domestic
product to reach US$2 trillion, the foreign trade volume to exceed US$1 trillion; per capita
income to reach US$25,000; and, unemployment to decline to 5 percent. Turkey also aims to
complete full membership negotiations with the EU; further develop Istanbul as a leading
international financial hub, and become the leading manufacturing and service provider both in
the region and beyond. To achieve Turkey’s development goals and realize sustainable
shared growth, the Government is pursuing a wide range of economic policies and
structural reforms, set out in its Ninth Development Plan for 2007-2013),7 2012-2014
Medium-Term Program, and annual programs. Top priorities include: (a) sound
macroeconomic and related structural fiscal policies to maintain stability and reduce short and
medium term vulnerabilities; (b) investment climate, labor market, and skills reforms to increase
competitiveness and create jobs, especially for women and youth; (c) fundamental education
reforms and continuing health and social welfare reform to increase productivity and help share
the gains from growth through equal opportunities; and (d) continuing energy and water sector
reforms and investments to further increase energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy, and
energy security and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate and adapt to climate
change.

30.     The Ninth Development Plan links growth and sustainable development focusing
inter alia on energy, mining, environment, water and natural resources. Two factors play a
major role in shaping Turkey’s sustainable development agenda:

          National “development axes? defined in the Ninth Development Plan are key drivers of
           Turkey’s short and medium term social and economic development priorities; and

          The EU Sustainable Development Strategy articulates the principles of sustainable
           development. Turkey projects these European principles in national development policies
           and investment priorities.

Energy Sector Challenges and Reforms

31.     Building on successful fundamental energy sector reforms over the last decade,
Turkey is moving decisively to develop an increasingly reliable and efficient energy supply,
while also mitigating climate change. Impressive results have been achieved during the 2008-
2011 period of the Government’s program supported under the ESES DPL series. They are
summarized in para. 3 and discussed in Annex 3. In addition to the DPL series, the Bank
supports Turkey’s electricity and gas utilities TEIAŞ, TEDAŞ and BOTAŞ under investment
loans - Bank investment lending and advisory support for Turkey is summarized in Section IV.

Market Liberalization

32.     Turkey continues the liberalization and development of its electricity market.
Electricity market liberalization was launched and has been progressively implemented under the
Electricity Market Law of 2001. Consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 25 MWh are
currently eligible (i.e., they can choose their own supplier) - this represents over 77 percent of
the total Turkish electricity market. A balancing and settlement system called PMUM – the
abbreviation of electricity market financial reconciliation center in Turkish - is being operated by
the transmission system and electricity market operator TEİAŞ. Although originally designed
for system balancing, PMUM evolved into a power exchange (an electricity trading platform).
The 2009 Electricity Strategy set out the main transitory steps and targets for the further
development of Turkey’s electricity market. Accordingly, a Day-ahead Market (DAM) has been
developed by TEİAŞ and was launched in December 2011. Over 25 percent of monthly
electricity consumption in Turkey is transacted through the PMUM power exchange by more
than 500 market participants.

Private Investment

33.     Turkey has chosen private sector participation - through new investment and
privatization of existing facilities - as the best available means to achieve a sustainable long-
term solution to energy security, competitiveness and operational efficiency in the power
sector. Power sector ownership and generation fuel mix are changing from public to private and
towards environmentally friendlier fuels. Turkey opened the power sector for private investment
in 1984 but progress remained limited until the enactment of the build, operate and transfer
(BOT) law in 1994 to provide a legal basis for Government guarantees to attract private
investment to complement public electricity generation investment in meeting rapidly increasing
demand for electricity. In 2001 the Government moved from guarantees to promote market-
based bilateral contracts and sales to Turkey’s electricity market. The market-based approach
has been remarkably successful in attracting private generation investment. The target of adding
10,000 MW generation capacity in the 2008-2011 period has been achieved. The share of
private sector generation in Turkey’s electricity supply now exceeds 50 percent and will continue
to grow with new investment and generation privatization (details are available in Annex 3).

34.    Ownership change in electricity distribution is even more dramatic, from a minor
private sector role before 2008 to about 50% in 2011 and towards 100 percent private
ownership by the end of 2012. One of Turkey’s 21 distribution regions/companies, Kcetaş in
Kayseri has been under private management for over eight decades. The Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources (MENR) transferred the operating rights of two distribution companies in
1998. The Privatization Administration (PA) offered for sale and determined the winning
bidders for the other 18 distribution companies in 2008-2010 (completing four tenders in 2008,
three in 2009 and eleven in 2010). Privatization proceeds from already closed transactions
amount to about US$5.4 billion. However, the closing of seven of the 2010 privatizations is
delayed, as many of the ranked bidders have not fulfilled the obligations of Tender
Specifications for these companies (details are available in para. 84). PA will retender companies
for which the original bid processes have to be canceled.


                                                13
Renewable Energy Development

35.     Renewable Energy Development is a key component in Turkey’s Electricity and
National Climate Change Strategies. The Government has taken several major measures to
promote private sector renewable energy development, including the enactment of a Renewable
Energy Law in 2005, the development of a functioning electricity market and the introduction
and implementation of the 2008 electricity pricing mechanism (Annex 3). Renewable energy
generation, in particular hydro and wind, has taken off, and will make an increasing contribution
into Turkey's power system. Several hydro and wind projects are viable with the current
electricity prices in Turkey's electricity market – feed-in tariffs provided under the Renewable
Energy Law serve as a floor price. The Parliament in December 2010 approved an amendment
of the Renewable Energy Law in order to provide prospective investors enhanced predictability
about Turkey's support framework, including: (a) technology-based feed-in tariffs; and (b) firm
off-take arrangements, which were launched on December 1, 2011 as a complement to the new
Day-Ahead Market (para. 32). Approved feed-in tariffs for biomass and solar power, though
significantly higher than current prices in PMUM, are nevertheless lower than some investors
had expected. The impact of these higher solar and biomass feed-in tariffs on generation
capacity, electricity supply and consumer prices of electricity is going to remain low in the short-
term, as the share of biomass and solar electricity is expected to remain low in the short-term.

Energy Efficiency

36.     Energy efficiency is critical to Turkey’s energy security and a key component in
Turkey’s National Climate Change Strategy. The legal, regulatory/pricing and institutional
set-up to promote energy efficiency, discussed in Annex 3, includes a comprehensive set of
energy efficiency regulations issued in 2008 under the 2007 Energy Efficiency Law. The
Government has also taken measures to support specialized credit lines, including the use of the
Clean Technology Fund (para. 45). In an effort to accelerate the realization of Turkey’s
potential, the Government approved a new Energy Efficiency Strategy in February 2012. A
related new energy efficiency regulation was issued in October 2011. The new Strategy sets an
overall target of reducing Turkey’s energy intensity (energy consumption of energy per unit of
GDP) by 20 percent by the year 2023 from the year 2011 level. This is a realistic target but not
an ambitious objective, as Turkey’s economy is still relatively energy intensive. Turkey required
0.26 ton of oil equivalent (toe) for every US$ 1,000 of GDP, compared with the OECD average
of 0.18 in 2008. Turkey’s nominal GDP/unit of energy consumption is well below OECD
Europe and the United States (Table 4). The Strategy identifies the following main activities to
improve Turkey’s energy efficiency: (a) promote energy efficiency in the industries and services
sectors; (b) reduce energy demand of buildings; (c) promote energy efficient appliances and
products; (d) improve the efficiency of electricity generation, transmission and distribution; and
(e) building capacity, market and financing for energy efficiency products, investments and
services.

Natural Gas

37.     In the medium-term, the adequacy of natural gas supply may become a bottleneck
for energy security and environmental goals. Gas imports have grown rapidly, driven by
Turkey’s growing demand for energy and related environmental considerations. In electricity
supply, the share of gas has increased from about 20 percent in 1995 to 48 percent in 2009.
Complementing this shift to gas in the power sector, EMRA has administered a nation-wide
gasification program. In 2002, only nine Turkish provinces had access to gas; by the end of
2012, 72 provinces are expected to be connected to the gas network. The share of gas in
Turkey’s primary energy mix has reached 32 percent. The reliance on gas now subjects the
country to a gas supply security risk. A review has been carried out and an amendment to the
Gas Market Law is expected to be enacted in 2012.

European/Regional Dimension in Electricity and Gas

38.   The process of harmonizing and integrating Turkey’s electricity and gas sectors and
networks to the European networks is underway ahead of the opening the energy chapter
of EU accession negotiations and the signing of the Energy Community Treaty8. The
Energy Community has three levels of ambition: national, regional and pan-European:

       In the short term, the Energy Community aims at creating open and transparent national
        energy markets based on stable regulatory and market frameworks capable of attracting
        investments in power generation and networks (security of energy supply being essential
        for economic development and social stability). As discussed in the previous paragraphs,
        Turkey has put in place regulatory and market frameworks capable of attracting
        significant private investment in line with the objectives of the Energy Community;

       In the medium term, an integrated regional energy market should be in place which
        allows for cross-border trade in energy, guarantees energy supply and takes into
        consideration climate and social aspects. Turkey’s actions are summarized below; and

       In the long term, the regional market should be fully integrated in the European Union's
        internal energy market. Turkey is currently involved in large gas projects which are
        designed to supply not only Turkey’s but also the European gas market.

39.    In an effort to secure future gas supplies, the Government (assisted by public sector
oil and gas companies) is conducting a high-level dialogue with Turkey’s largest gas
supplier (Russia/Gazprom) as well as Turkey’s current and prospective suppliers of gas in
the Caspian and the Middle East region including Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and
Turkmenistan. In October 2011, Turkey and Azerbaijan and their respective gas companies
BOTAŞ and SOCAR signed agreements for Turkey to purchase six billion cubic meters (bcm) of
gas annually and to transit another 10 bcm to Europe. BOTAŞ is a member of the consortium
that plans to build the Nabucco gas pipeline from Turkey through Bulgaria, Romania and

Hungary to Austria, for which the concerned countries including Turkey signed an Inter-
Governmental Agreement in July 2009. Turkey’s Parliament ratified the agreement in March
2010. Turkey also supports Gazprom’s proposed SouthStream gas pipeline from Russia to South
East Europe.

40.     Turkey’s synchronous 400 kV interconnection with the European electricity grid is
in the final testing phase, with limited commercial operation already allowed. Full
commercial operation is expected by the end of 2012. After the full commercial operation starts,
Turkey will also become a member of the European Network of Transmission System Operators
for Electricity (ENTSO-E) which is supervising the ongoing testing program. An asynchronous
direct current (DC) interconnection between Turkey and Georgia is under construction. TEIAŞ
is studying DC interconnections with its other neighbors including Iran and Syria.

Climate Change

41.     Turkey is stepping up its engagement on climate change internationally and
domestically and has requested Bank development policy and investment lending support
for its new climate change program. This reflects the realization that climate change is a threat
to Turkey – Turkey is one of the three countries in the ECA region most likely to experience the
greatest increases in climate extremes – and the high level of awareness and concern among
Turkey’s population (para. 60). The proposed ESES DPL3 supports policies, strategies and
specific measures related to climate change and environmental management.

42.     The growth in total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions has been rapid. Turkey’s
GDP (in 2005 PPP US$) per unit of energy use (in kg oil equivalent) at 8.9 compares favorably
with all comparators shown in Table 4. Turkey’s nominal GDP per unit of energy use shows that
Turkey’s energy intensity is higher than in OECD Europe and the United States. Turkey’s
energy use at 1,333 kg oil equivalent/capita and emission intensity at 4.0 tCO2/capita are much
lower than in these countries. Emission growth in the 1990-2009 period has been modest in the
United States and emissions have declined slightly in the OECD Europe area and significantly in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia (in part reflecting the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
resulting transition in Russia and across the Eastern Europe). In contrast, Turkey’s emissions
doubled in the 1990-2009 period (emission growth was faster only in China and India) and are
projected to continue to rise. The growth is caused by the rising energy demand (driven by
Turkey’s rapid economic growth, industrialization and steady population growth) and reliance on
fossil fuels and would have been even greater without the shift from coal to natural gas in
electricity generation.

43.     The Government approved a National Climate Change Strategy in May 2010 and a
National Climate Change Action Plan was issued in July 2011. The Strategy and the Action
Plan (Box 1) identified national priorities for mitigating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and
building resilience through managing impacts and encouraging mitigation and adaptation to
climate change. They build upon Turkey’s First National Communication on Climate Change
(FNC) to the UNFCCC and subsequent work including the Electricity Strategy, studies by the
MoEF, MoD, UNDP, and Turkey’s Investment Plan submitted to the CTF. The Strategy
establishes Turkey’s national vision as a country which has “integrated its climate change
policies into the development policies, has let the energy efficiency become widespread, has
increased the use of clean and renewable energy resources, actively participates in the efforts
for tackling climate change within the framework of its “special circumstances?, and can
provide all of its citizens with a high quality of life and welfare with low-carbon strategies.?

44.     The use of a phased approach to major reforms—from strategy to action plan to the
implementation of measures—has proven effective across a range of reform areas in
Turkey, from the investment climate reforms to public finance to the energy sector. The
National Climate Change Action Plan covers key sectors in line with national development
priorities: energy, transport, industry, waste, land use, and agriculture and forestry. The National
Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan are grounded in baseline conditions and incorporate
existing plans to develop medium and long-term targets in these sectors. The broad National
Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan gain further in significance, when considered in
                                                     17
combination with the concrete implementation actions in the energy sector, which have strong
climate change co-benefits (paras. 78/Box 3 and 128).

45.     The focus of Turkey’s Investment Plan for the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) is on
renewable energy development and energy efficiency, to accelerate the implementation of
Turkey’s strategy and related laws and supporting regulation. The CTF Trust Fund Committee
endorsed Turkey’s US$250 million Investment Plan in January 2009.9 CTF approved a US$100
million allocation from Turkey’s US$250 million Investment Plan in March 2009 to help finance
the Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project. The Bank supported the
project with a US$500 million loan approved in May 2009. Implementation progress has
exceeded expectations and additional Bank financing of US$500 million was approved in
November 2011.

        Box 1: National Climate Change Action Plan


The National Climate Change Strategy of 2010 established the following broad strategies for the
implementation of Turkey’s national vision for climate change:
(a) Negotiations. Actively participate in the negotiations carried out to establish a comprehensive and
functional international cooperation mechanism in combating and adapting to global climate change;
(b) Action Plan. Develop a National Climate Change Action Plan with a dynamic approach in line with
the National Climate Change Strategy and the Ninth Development Program;
(c) Organization. Climate Change Coordination Board for inter-ministerial coordination and a Climate
Change Department within the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization; and
(d) Information Management. Adapt information management and exchange approach and
methodology and to establish a national portal.

The National Climate Change Action Plan established an overall implementation plan and sectoral
plans for key sectors in accordance with the priority areas set out in the Strategy:
(a) Mitigation. Greenhouse gas emission control covering all main sectors - energy, buildings, industry,
transport, waste, agriculture, and land use and forestry – and cross-cutting issues; and
(b) Adaptation. Measures to increase the adaptive capacity and adaptive measures covering main areas
– management of water resources; agriculture and food security; ecosystem services, biodiversity and
forestry; natural disaster risk management; and public health – and cross-cutting issues.

The Action Plan targets to reduce Turkey’s energy intensity by 10 percent by 2015 compared to 2008, and
the new Energy Efficiency Strategy targets a reduction by 20 percent by 2023 compared to 2011.

The Action Plan is available on: http://iklim.cob.gov.tr/iklim/Files/IDEP/%C4%B0DEPENG.pdf.

46.     A formal organizational structure has been established for climate change as called
for in the Climate Change Strategy, including for the coordination of the preparation and
implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan. The former Ministry of
Environment and Forestry was responsible for the preparation of the Strategy and the Action
Plan. Its successor, the new Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU), issued the
Action Plan in July 2011 and will be responsible for their implementation and updating. A
Climate Change Department was established in 2009 to coordinate the expanding work program.
The Coordination Board on Climate Change (CBCC), chaired by the Minister of Environment
and Urbanization, is responsible for inter-ministerial coordination. Following the January 2012
reconstitution, this board is composed of high level representatives (Undersecretary and
President) from the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, Ministry of Forestry and Water
Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and
Communications, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Science,
Industry and Technology, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Development (formerly the Undersecretariat of the State
Planning Organization), Ministry of Economics, Undersecretariat of the Treasury, the Union of
Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey, and Turkey’s Industrialists’ and
Businessmen’s Association. Several technical Working Groups are working under this Board.

47.    Turkey has joined the Partnership for (carbon) Market Readiness launched by the
World Bank at COP-16 in Cancun in December 2010. Participation provides Turkey an
opportunity to exchange views and learn from the experience of 14 other middle-income
countries 10. The PMR is aimed at providing support to countries that are planning to use market
based instruments to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The establishment of a carbon
market is one of the main pillars of the Istanbul Financial Center Strategy and Action Plan,
which aims to transform Istanbul into a regional financial center in the Middle East, North Africa
and Eurasia regions. A working group of the MoEU, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey,
Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), Istanbul Gold Exchange, Turkish Derivatives Exchange, and ISE
Clearing and Settlement Bank has been established to work on the technical issues and submit
recommendations to the Government in order to establish the market.

48.     Turkey has indicated its PMR activities would focus on implementation of a robust
monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for GHG emissions in the key
sectors, and they may also include designing a pilot phase for the market mechanism, and
other related institutional and legal capacity building. Turkey was awarded a US$350,000
PMR Preparation Grant in May 2011 by the PMR Partnership Assembly. The Preparation Grant
Agreement was prepared and finalized in December 2011. It was the first to be signed under the
PMR.      The Preparation Grants are primarily intended for preparing a proposal for PMR
Implementation Grants, which are expected to range from US$3-10 million. In addition to
preparing the PMR Implementation Grant proposal, the MoEU will utilize the initial Preparation
Grant to organize consultation meetings, training events and outreach to stakeholders, undertake
background studies needed to prepare the Implementation Grant proposal, and to establish
effective project management capacity.


10
   The 15 Implementing Countries of the PMR are Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Colombia, India, Indonesia,
Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam.

Sustainable Environmental Management

49.      Turkey has embarked on a comprehensive long-term reform process in
environmental management using the EU Environmental Acquis (Box 2) as an important
anchor. Turkey’s strategy outlines for key sectors (water, air, industrial pollution control, and
chemicals): (i) the environmental challenges currently faced by the country; (ii) the timetable for
legislative harmonization; (iii) the sectoral goals, objectives, and strategies; (iv) plans for
strengthening institutional capacity, both at the national and local levels; and (v) investment
needs. The cost for Turkey to comply with the Environmental Acquis will be substantial. The
EU Integrated Environmental Approximation Strategy estimates the cost at about Euro 59 billion
for 2007-2023 with average annual investments of about Euro 4 billion. Turkey’s current
spending on environment is estimated to be below 0.5 percent of GDP. This share will increase
gradually and may reach 2 percent of GDP in a few peak investment years.

        Box 2. The European Union Environmental Acquis and the ESES DPL support for
                             Turkey’s Environmental Reforms


The EU Environmental Acquis and Turkey’s Progress on the Environmental Chapter
The environmental Acquis Communautaire (acquis) aims to promote sustainable development and protect
the environment for present and future generations. It is based on preventive action, the polluter pays
principle, fighting environmental damage at the source, shared responsibility and the integration of
environmental protection into other EU policies. The environment acquis comprises over 200 major legal
acts covering horizontal legislation (e.g., environmental impact assessment (EIA), access to information),
water and air quality, waste management, nature protection, industrial pollution control and risk
management, chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), noise and forestry.

According to the latest progress report of the European Commission (dated October 2011), the area where
Turkey is mostly in line with EU environmental legislation are environmental impact assessment (EIA)
and waste management. The revision of the waste legislation, largely in line with the provisions of the
new EU Waste Framework Directive, has begun with the adoption of legislation on solid waste, waste
water tariffs, waste incineration, packaging waste and the inspection of end-of-life vehicles. Progress has
been also achieved on air quality and industrial pollution control. Turkey completed the transposition of
Directive 2001/80/EC on Large Combustion Plants. A regulation on reducing the emission levels of light
trucks and passenger vehicles has been adopted. Turkey also enacted a regulation on the control of major
industrial accidents (involving dangerous substances) in August 2010. MoFW has adopted a basin level
approach for the preparation of river basin protection plans and river basin management plans.

ESES DPL Support to Turkey for Harmonization with the EU Environmental Acquis
The ongoing ESES DPL program supports actions that are among the most critical for Turkey’s
transposition of its environmental legislation with the EU environment acquis, based on the
Government’s EU Integrated Environmental Approximately Strategy (2007-2023). The ESES DPL2
supported the transposition into law of the EIA Directive. The ESES DPL3 supports the Government in
moving toward harmonization with EU air and water quality legislation (the Large Combustion Plant
Directive), industrial pollution control (Point Sourced Soil Pollution Control Regulation), and a
system of “e-permit? for environmental permitting, monitoring and inspection (Regulation on
Environmental Permits and Licenses, which is an important step towards implementing the EU’s
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive).
                                                    20
50.     Turkey has put in place a number of legislative and institutional reforms to protect
the environment. Environmental policies11 encourage the use of economic instruments and
incentives such emissions and pollution charges and market-based mechanisms including carbon
trading, to stem the rising tide of carbon emissions and other air pollutants. Turkey has
recognized the need to integrate environmental concerns into economic policies and the
significance of environmental policies. The MoEU and the Ministry of Forestry and Water
Affairs (MoFW) lead the work to reform and implement the national environmental legislation.
Turkey has increased its efforts to promote technology transformation and the adoption of
environmental management systems supporting transition to sustainable production and
consumption in the industry. In the medium-term, the institutional roles for environmental
management will be delineated to closely reflect EU practice including greater delegation of
implementation and enforcement to local institutions.

51.     In the EU and OECD countries integrated environmental permits are key command
and control instruments. Turkey introduced administrative simplification of the system of
environmental permits and licenses by Regulation on Permits and Licenses to be taken in
Accordance with the Environmental Law (published in the Official Gazette on April 29, 2009
and became effective on April 1, 2010), and amended on February 24, 2010, April 25, 2010 and
on August 16, 2011, which inter alia combine all environmental licenses and permits required
for an industrial installation into a single “e-permit?12. Under the new system13, the
environmental permit and license procedures are processed electronically by a specialized
department - an important step towards implementing the EU’s Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control (IPPC) Directive14. Next, Turkey plans to continue the principles of integrated
pollution prevention and control through strategy work, enterprise-based pilot projects on best
available technologies (BATs), and an inventory of IPPC installations. Currently, MoEU is
implementing its third IPPC project financed under Turkey’s EU program Instrument for Pre-
Accession Assistance (IPA). It is expected that the draft IPPC regulation would be ready by end
of 2013 and the implementation would start in 2015.

52.    Implementing the provisions of the EU legislation on Industrial Emissions Directive
will be a long-term endeavor as it requires substantial investments for industrial facilities
to further reduce the pollutant concentration of their emissions. All new industrial plants,
including thermal power plants (TTPs), must be equipped with state-of-the-art technology so
they achieve the limit values set forth in the Law on Air Quality Assessment and Management.
Investments by TPPs in abatement technology are also needed for compliance with the Large
Combustion Plant Directive as part of the EU harmonization. In addition to the gradual reduction

11
   As most formally stated in the 2006 amendment of the Law on Environment.
12
   For SMEs and other enterprises not covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive,
EU and OECD countries have introduced integration and administrative simplification of the process, notably
through General Binding Rules and standard permit conditions for distinct categories of installations.
13
   The legal basis for this system is established by the Regulation on Permits and Licenses Required to be Obtained
Pursuant to the Environment Law, April 2009, with amendments in February and April 2010 and finally in August
2011 to reach its final scope.
14
   The IPPC Directive brings a new approach to the permitting process, where the industry has to carry out a self-
assessment and needs to look into areas that are traditionally not regulated in most countries—such as energy
efficiency, or having an environmental management system. In addition, the Directive itself has flexible elements
leaving room for interpretation and taking into account the economic situation and special local conditions in which
the industrial activity is taking place.

                                                        21
of annual emission (NOx, SO2, and dust) ceilings, this Directive also set requirements for
monitoring and reporting for all plants. These actions are consistent with the National Climate
Change Strategy, which aim to introduce incentive mechanisms for the “promotion of the use of
clean production technologies and climate-friendly and innovative technologies?.

53.     Turkey has advanced its integrated pollution prevention and control agenda
through recent policy analysis on competitiveness and challenges to comply with the EU
environmental Acquis for specific industrial sectors. The analysis on cement manufacturing
industry as well as recent work on the household appliances sector to comply with the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive contribute to meeting national
sustainable development goals and expand the Government’s knowledge on implementation of
key environmental Directives. Furthermore, Turkey completed the transposition of Directive
2001/80/EC on Large Combustion Plants for licensing of new installations in June 2010. Other
directives relevant to the broader context of EU air legislation and regulations is the Fuel Quality
Directive relating to the sulfur content of certain liquid fuels (fuel oils) as well as the Incineration
Directive that regulates emissions from waste incineration plants. Currently, the legislation
relating to the sulfur content of certain liquid fuels has been fully aligned with the acquis and the
current decrease in sulfur content of fuel oil is expected to reach 1 percent in 2012 (versus 1.5
percent from 2009 baseline data).

54.    Implementation of waste management directives is challenging and expensive.
Turkey adopted its national waste management plan for 2009-2013 and became a party to the
Stockholm Convention15 on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Consequently, Turkey had
prepared a draft National Implementation Plan (NIP) under the Stockholm Convention on POPs
which currently is in the process to be updated. The number of solid waste disposal facilities put
into operation has reached 59 and the population served by sanitary landfills has increased from
20 million to 41 million. 40 more landfill sites are being developed and project preparation is
underway for 35 disposal sites. The EU Waste Catalogue which classifies 839 different types of
waste has been transposed and an online database has been established by the MoEU for
Hazardous Waste and Packing Waste.

55.      As a part of the harmonization process, the Government has transposed into law
EU’s Environmental Impact Directive 85/337/EEC as amended with 97/11/EC and
2003/35/EC. The legislation further strengthens the country’s public participation processes,
transparency and accountability in environmental consent process and has become closely
harmonized with the EU’s EIA Directive. However, Turkey is not yet a party to the Aarhus
Convention which requires further strengthening of access to environmental information. In
addition, Turkey has launched several capacity improvement projects for transposition of the
Directive on Strategic Environmental Assessment, including a project to “Strengthen
Institutional Capacity for Implementation of Strategic Environmental Assessment. A Regulation
on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is expected to be finalized and become effective
in 2014. The MoEU has launched an IPA project with the goal of creating institutional capacity
and raising awareness of the implementation, with assistance for preparation of four pilot SEAs.
The MoEU is also working on the SEA competency certificate, which will include criteria for
licensing firms to prepare SEAs, similar to the accreditation required for EIA companies.

15
     Turkey signed the Stockholm Convention in May 2001 and ratified it in January 2010

                                                         22
56.     The Ministry of Environment and Urbanization’s Clean Air Action Plan calls for
the establishment of Regional Air Quality Centers for implementing the Law on Air
Quality Assessment and Management and conducting air quality assessments. A significant
part of Turkey’s air quality legislation16 has been harmonized with the acquis. A National Air
Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN) with eight regional air quality monitoring centers has
been established and disseminated to 81 provinces by MoEU with the participation of private
organizations. The locations of 39 fixed air quality monitoring stations17 have been identified in
line with the Clean Air Action Plan. The Marmara Clean Air Center has been established and is
now fully operational. The Center will maintain a database including main air quality indicators
defined as per Air Quality Directives, and information will be shared publicly at national level.
All legal permits for the locations of the other proposed 38 air quality stations have been
obtained and the tender document for the establishment of these stations has been finalized.

57.     The Government has advanced the work on the transposition of the Water
Framework (WF) Directive. The institutional framework for water management is in the
process to be organized at river basin level. The Directive’s provisions regarding the sensitive
and less sensitive water areas concerning water quality and water resources management have
been transposed in the national legislation. Five sensitive areas have been determined and for 25
river basins and River Basin Protection Action Plans are under preparation. Currently, there are
15 river basin protection action plans in place in line with the principles of WF Directive.
Preparation work on the development of final 10 plans is on-going with the goal to be finalized
by the end of 2012 with the goal to be ultimately converted into river basin management plans.
Ongoing preparatory work for the National Basis Management Strategy (NBMS) stresses the
need for an integrated approach to economic planning at a river basin level to help ensure service
delivery while assuring the sustainability of the natural resource base and the services it
provides. Implementation of the NBMS—including sustainable hydro development, irrigation,
and flood management—will be a major challenge in Turkey, yet will be critical for successful
climate change adaptation.

Participatory Processes

58.     Turkey has its own participatory processes underpinning policy formulation. The
energy actions originate from the Government’s 2004 and 2009 electricity strategies. The
preparation of the Electricity Reform and Privatization Strategy of 2004 and the updating of the
2004 strategy, resulting in the Electricity Market and Security of Supply Strategy of 2009, were
informed by conferences, seminars and workshops. The final draft of the 2009 strategy was
prepared in the fall of 2008 and then became the subject of an in-depth and lengthy inter-
ministerial review before its approval in May 2009. The launch of the electricity privatization
program in 2008 was preceded by over two decades of review and debate since the 1980s when
the power sector was opened for private investment. The Privatization Administration (PA) has
consulted extensively and will continue to consult with prospective investors and the electricity
sector employees and their labor union on electricity privatizations. The PA announces
16
   The regulation on Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management (BAQAM) sets the air quality standards. It
also sets the implementation time line for 13 different pollutants, as well as the timeline for strengthening
monitoring, enforcement and capacity for air quality and pollution control.
17
   The number of monitoring stations will gradually increase as well as the measurable parameters, including from
traffic, industrial pollution and district heating.

                                                       23
forthcoming privatizations on its web-site and press releases. Final bidding rounds are
conducted in public auctions and broadcast on television. EMRA consults stakeholders as part
of its regulatory processes for the formulation of regulations and their major amendments.
MENR has posted a draft electricity law (replacement of the current Electricity Market Law) on
its web-site for public comments.

59.     The preparation the National Climate Change Action Plan was led by the Ministry
of Environment and Urbanization through a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder
approach, with the participation of public and private sector institutions, nongovernmental
organizations and universities. Stakeholder meetings were conducted focusing on seven main
sectors (energy, waste, buildings, forestry, industry, agriculture, and transportation). Several
roundtable meetings were conducted with all relevant parties for each sector. The draft Action
Plan was shared with all relevant institutions (government, NGOs, private sector associations,
etc.) for their review and comments. The final draft was published on the web-site of the
Climate Change Department for over three months to receive comments from public. Turkey’s
delegations presented a complete draft of the Strategy at the Copenhagen COP-15 meeting and
Turkey’s approach to its implementation including the Action Plan at the Cancun COP-16
meeting. The Government has transposed into law EU’s Environmental Impact Directive
85/337/EEC as amended with 97/11/EC and 2003/35/EC. The legislation further strengthens the
country’s public participation processes which have become closely harmonized with the EU’s
EIA Directive.

60.    Awareness and concern about climate change are relatively high in Turkey. In a
global attitude survey of 48 countries, about 59 percent of those interviewed considered climate
change to be a serious problem. In Turkey, the figure was 70 percent - the highest among the
seven ECA countries covered in the survey. Awareness and concern do not necessarily lead to
action or behavioral change but they are nevertheless clear signals and encouraging signs of
support for the Government faced with the climate change mitigation and adaptation challenge.

            IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

61.     A Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the FY12-15 period is scheduled to be
considered by the World Bank’s Executive Board on March 27, 2012. The proposed CPS
has three main strategic objectives and pillars: Strategic Objective 1 - enhanced competitiveness
and employment; Strategic Objective 2 - improved equity and public services; and Strategic
Objective 3 - deepened sustainable development. Highlights of planned activities under
Deepened Sustainable Development are: (a) policy advice and financing to address energy,
environmental and climate change challenges in an integrated manner, (b) support for the
completion of a water basin management strategy, and (c) supporting the Sustainable Cities
Program by using the Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2023
through AAA and investment financing including IFC. The proposed operation is the third
installment of a series of three DPLs launched under the CPS FY2008-11. DPL1 was approved
in June 2009. In the CPS Progress Report, endorsed by the Executive Board on January 7, 2010,
Turkey and the Bank adjusted the Partnership Strategy and inter alia agreed to broaden the
energy DPL program to include climate change and key environmental sustainability reforms in
the re-named new ESES DPL program. This design provided an integrated approach to the
energy security - energy efficiency - environment nexus and is consistent with the EU’s energy,
climate and environmental goals. ESES DPL2 was approved in June 2010 as a part of the FY10
financing program. The proposed operation is expected to be the first policy-based operation in
the financing program of the new CPS FY12-15 period.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

62.    The Bank and the IMF are coordinating and working together closely on Turkey.
The IMF’s most recent Stand-By Arrangement for Turkey was completed successfully in May
2008. Topics on which Bank and Fund staff have collaborated include assessment of
developments in the health and social security systems, energy pricing, and local administration
finance. Bank staff provided the fund team with inputs in the form of the analysis of social and
employment impacts of the crisis, social security actuarial analysis, health policy analysis, and
poverty simulations. IMF staff regularly share macroeconomic files and the detailed fiscal
assessments of Fund staff have informed the Bank’s own views of the new MTP. The IMF’s
Public Information Notice issued on December 7, 2011 following the 2011 Article IV
consultation with Turkey, is attached as Annex 4.

63.     The European Commission and the World Bank launched in December 2010 a new
initiative seeking to increase opportunities for synergies in working with the Turkish
authorities. Possible areas for collaboration include food safety, energy sector reforms, and
public administrative reform. In October 2011, the Government submitted a proposal to the
Commission to include under EU’s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) program for
Turkey a large multi-year EU/IPA-financed World Bank-managed technical assistance program
for the energy sector. The proposal is under review and a Euro 11.8 million allocation has been
included to start the program under Turkey’s 2012 IPA program, for which the Financing
Agreement is expected to be finalized in the summer/fall of 2012.


                                               25
64.     Collaboration with Other Development Partners. Bank staff also holds regular
consultations with staff from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which have active portfolios in Turkey including
areas of common interest such as energy. The Bank and UNDP work together on climate issues.
UNDP in general and its Turkey office in particular coordinate the support from the United
Nations to the Government in this area. UNDP has received funding for this work inter alia
from the Government of Turkey, the Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom, and the
Global Environment Facility (GEF). The Bank is working with the French Development Bank,
AFD (France: Agence Francaise de Dévelopment), German Development Bank, KfW (Germany:
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau Bankengruppe) and UNDP in providing assistance to industry
and financial intermediaries for energy efficiency investments. AFD and EIB recently approved
loans of euro 150 million each for a project to support the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs
in its forest management, fire fighting and afforestation efforts. While supporting the national
forestry policy, the project also contributes to climate change mitigation in Turkey. WB, IFC
and EBRD work together in supporting Turkey’s CTF Investment Plan. The Undersecretariat of
Treasury plays an active role in donor coordination.

65.     Within the World Bank Group, the Bank and the IFC maintain a close dialogue and
collaboration including in the energy sector, transport and municipal sectors. IFC’s
infrastructure strategy in Turkey aims to create attractive private sector investment opportunities
in the sector by achieving three main developmental objectives: (a) supporting the Government’s
ambitious privatization program across various infrastructure sectors, including electricity and
transport; (b) maximizing its demonstration effect by supporting early high-profile transactions,
particularly those which will set a benchmark for future privatizations and public private
partnerships or with an energy efficiency component; (c) mobilizing funds from commercial
banks and IFIs where necessary; (d) supporting long-term strategic players in the sector. IFC’s
support to the privatization process is particularly critical at present given investors’ and lenders’
increased risk-averseness in view of the global financial crisis; and (e) increasing access to
finance for underserved segments including municipalities, with the goal of accelerating the
completion of essential public infrastructure projects. Highlights of IFC’s recent electricity
projects and ongoing energy work are given in para. 69.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

66.      The proposed operation is the third installment in a series of three DPLs to support
the implementation of the Government's program for the energy sector and the second
DPL to explicitly support climate change and sustainable environmental management. The
first loan in this series was approved in June 2009, the second in June 2010. A parallel DPL
series supported Turkey’s transition from crisis management to growth in the recovery. The
first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment (REGE) DPL was approved in March 2010
and the second DPL in May 2011.




                                                 26
67.   The ESES DPL complements related energy investment lending. Projects supported
by World Bank financing include:

          Renewable Energy Project (2004), which provided a line of credit for private sector
           investments in renewable energy. The implementation of the project was completed, with
           highly satisfactory results, in 2009;
          ECSEE APL2 (2005), which financed investments in the SCADA system and transmission,
           and provided investment and technical assistance support for the development of the
           wholesale electricity market and ECSEE APL3 (2006), which financed investments in
           transmission strengthening. The implementation of these projects was completed, with
           satisfactory results, in 2010;
          Gas Sector Development Project (2006), which finances a gas storage facility. After long
           procurement delays, main contracts were awarded and implementation started in 2011;
          Electricity Generation Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project (2006), which aimed at
           improving the reliability and efficiency of one of the largest generating plants in Turkey.
           Bank loan for this project was cancelled in November 2009 due to intractable procurement
           issues. The plant has since been included in the Privatization Administration’s strategy for
           privatization;
          Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project (2008), which finances investments in
           strengthening of the distribution network. Implementation of some of the components has
           fallen behind schedule;
          The Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project (2009) including
           financing from the Clean Technology Fund (para. 45). Project implementation has exceeded
           expectations and an Additional Loan for the Project has been approved (2011); and
          ECSEE APL6 (2010), which finances investments in transmission system strengthening and a
           program of technical assistance for institutional development. Implementation started in a
           generally satisfactory manner but some components have fallen behind schedule. This
           project and the already completed ECSEE APL2 and APL3 projects are financed under the
           Bank’s regional US$1 billion adaptable program lending (APL) facility supporting the
           development of the Energy Community (para. 38).

68.     Turkey’s CTF Investment Plan envisioned a future TEIAŞ transmission project
with support from the Clean Technology Fund. Turkey’s CTF Investment Plan also
envisioned another credit line for energy efficiency for small and medium sized industries
(SMEs) and the public sector, which is dependent inter alia on additional CTF availability. Both
projects are subject to the ongoing CPS process and the IBRD financing envelope for Turkey.

69.    The IFC has in recent years mobilized financing for several high priority private
sector electricity and energy efficiency projects in Turkey and is working on several others:

      In 2011, IFC mobilized an additional US$1.0 billion for Enerjisa (IFC A Loan: US$90
       million), in a follow on transaction which involved development of a portfolio of
       generation projects of 1,027 MW including 2 small hydros, one wind and one combined
       cycle gas plant in addition to 1,881 MW including 9 small hydros, one wind and one
       combined cycle gas plant that was financed in 2008. Enerjisa was Turkey’s first major


                                                 27
       power generation financing on a merchant basis and the success of the first transaction
       resulted in significant demand from international banks for this follow on transaction;

      In 2010, IFC mobilized US$325 million for SEDAS (IFC A Loan: US$75 million), one
       of the first two privatized electricity distribution companies together with Baskent which
       was acquired by Enerjisa. SEDAS, operating in the distribution and sales of electricity,
       provides services within the provinces of Sakarya, Bolu, Düzce and Kocaeli in northwest
       Turkey, which is home to about 4.1 per cent of Turkey’s population. IFC’s share of the
       syndication was US$75 million. SEDAS was the first internationally financed
       distribution privatization in Turkey.

      In 2009, IFC mobilized US$200 million for Rotor Elektrik (IFC A Loan: US$75 million),
       a 135 MW wind generation park. Also in 2009 IFC mobilized US$120 million for the
       Izgaz transaction, a landmark local-currency transaction in the Turkish gas distribution
       sector;

      Presently, IFC is selectively looking at investing in additional new generation capacity
       with several private groups and closely following the developments on the privatization
       front to provide long term financing where IFC can play a strong role; and

      IFC is also working on providing loans by utilizing the CTF (US$21.7 million,
       complemented by about US$80 million by IFC in the first phase of IFC’s CTF program)
       to Turkish financial intermediaries to support renewable energy and energy efficiency
       investments in the Turkish market that could also encourage local manufacturing capacity
       for renewable energy generation equipment (including solar and geothermal
       technologies). In 2010, IFC provided US$50 million loan to Finans Leasing including
       US$10 million of CTF funds and US$25 million loan to Yapi Kredi Leasing including
       US$5 million of CTF funds as part of this program.



LESSONS LEARNED

70.     Major policy and legislative reforms can take time to implement; therefore
flexibility and patience are critical for ensuring good results. To increase success, the full
integration of combined analytical work and policy financing into national development plans
and medium-term programs is critical. The programmatic structuring of work, in the form of
modular interventions which build on each other sequentially, has been particularly effective.
These lessons learned have been reflected in the design of the ESES program, which has been
designed on the basis of a substantial amount of analytical and advisory work undertaken over
the years for the energy sector in Turkey. The ESES program, analytical work and policy
dialogue focus specifically on the policy aspects underpinning the sector’s reform program,
whereas the parallel investment loans focus on key investment needs in support of the overall
policy agenda. This approach enables the Bank to support Turkey’s energy sector strategy with
sufficient flexibility and provide development policy and investment financing on a timely basis,
in support for the Government’s own strategies and action plans, presented in Section III.


                                               28
71.     The new engagement on environment and climate change started during the CPS
FY2008-11 period illustrates the importance and value of carefully identifying strategic
entry points and seizing opportunities as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the World
Bank Group had originally agreed not to use the environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11,
reflecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 2004-2007 and a decision to
consider a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, during the 2008-2011 CPS period.
Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter of the
EU acquis in 2009 provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on
this topic. This opportunity grew out of the Turkey-World Bank Group partnership on energy.
The electricity DPL series was broadened into the Environmental Sustainability and Energy
Security (ESES) DPL series, with three components: energy, climate change, and environmental
sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012 UN Sustainable
Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program to
secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

72.    The Bank has been providing analytical support through its advisory support
program.    Completed and ongoing work in energy, climate change and sustainable
environmental management dimensions includes:

      regular high-level advice by an independent expert panel of leading international specialists on
       critical sector issues including supply security, market implementation, regulation and
       privatization;
      provision of expert advisory services on sustainable wind energy development;
      report on the security of electricity supply;
      studies related to a gas sector strategy and to greenfield gas distribution;
      preparation of a study on incentives that would be provided to private investors through a

74.     The preparation of the ESES DPL has also benefitted from a number of energy,
environment and poverty-related analytical studies and policy notes by other parties. Some
of the key analytical work includes:

      Integrating Poverty in Utilities Governance (UNDP, 2009). This review carried out by the
       Ministry of Development, UNDP and Ankara-based universities used both quantitative data
       and qualitative field techniques to analyze the impacts of tariff changes in the electricity,
       natural gas and water sectors and inter alia its field survey results informed the poverty and
       social analysis of the project;
      Turkey OECD Environmental Performance Review (OECD, 2008). This review examines
       the extent to which Turkey has met its national objectives and international commitments
       regarding environmental management. In addition, it offers specific recommendations to
       strengthen the country’s efforts in managing air, water and nature assets and in building
       environmental infrastructure (e.g., for waste and wastewater treatment), in an effort to
       reduce pollution and energy and resource intensities and address environmentally-related
       health problems; and
      Sustainable Development Analysis Report (UNDP, 2008). This report assesses the
       integration of sustainable development principles in Turkey’s sectoral policies, and
       provides recommendations, in particular, for strengthening environmental mainstreaming
       on energy, fisheries, science and technology, and urbanization.

        V.   THE PROPOSED THIRD PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL
      SUSTAINABILITY AND ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

75.     The ongoing ESES DPL series is grounded in the development goals articulated in
Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan (Section III) while strengthening the framework for long-term
sustainable growth across the economy and in the energy sector in particular. The development
objective of the Government’s program proposed to be supported by ESES DPL3 is to
help: (a) enhance energy security by promoting private sector clean technology investments
and operations; (b) integrate principles of environmental sustainability, including climate
change considerations, in key sectoral policies and programs; and (c) improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of environmental management processes. The program
supported by this ongoing DPL series has a focus on the energy sector because of both the
tightening electricity and gas supply/demand balances and the sizeable contribution of the energy
sector to Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions. At the request of the Government for the Bank to
provide broader support to the Government’s sustainability agenda, the ESES DPL2 and the
proposed ESES DPL3 also support policies, strategies and specific measures related to climate
change and environmental management. The Government has concluded that energy efficiency,
energy security and environmental issues are most effectively addressed in an integrated
program. Furthermore, this energy security - energy efficiency - environment nexus is consistent
with the EU’s energy, climate and environmental goals and effectively contributes to Turkey's
EU accession process.

76.     The ESES DPL program is structured under three pillars18:

           Pillar I - Energy Sector;
           Pillar II - Climate Change; and
           Pillar III - Sustainable Environment Management.

77.     Pillar I continues the energy program originally supported under PEDPL1, covering
energy pricing, electricity markets, renewable energy, energy efficiency, electricity distribution
and generation privatization, and gas supply security and wholesale gas market development.
Pillar II supports Turkey's National Climate Change Strategy following the ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol in February 2009. Pillar III supports sustainable environmental management
and is focused on the transposition of EU Environmental Acquis and sectors/sub-sectors where
environmental degradation could hamper sustainable development.

78.     There are strong mutually reinforcing links and complementarities among the three
pillars of the expanded ESES DPL program. The energy pillar yields significant national and
local environmental co-benefits. The energy and environmental management pillars yield
significant climate change co-benefits as summarized in Box 3. National and local
environmental actions have strong synergies with climate change actions and support climate

18
   The ESES DPL series and recent operations in the Bank’s Turkey energy program are aligned with the Strategic
Framework of the World Bank Group for Development and Climate Change. Details for each of the six action areas
in the Strategic Framework are available in Box 6 (page 36) in the Program Document of ESES DPL2.

change mitigation and adaption. Harmonization with EU environmental regulations will generate
greater environmental gains especially in the industry by improved management of waste and
effluents and overall emission reduction of large combustion plants. The impact of EU acquis on
policy making is currently the strongest in national and local environmental areas where Turkey
has embarked on a comprehensive long-term reform process using the EU Environmental Acquis
as an important anchor.

Government’s strategies and action plans and actions. The proposed prior actions of the
ESES DPL3 are summarized in Box 4. The full range of policy actions in the ESES DPL
program are presented in the policy matrix (Annex 2). The scope has changed since the approval
of ESES DPL2 but as summarized in Box 5 and discussed below, the revised program overall is
stronger and the overall objectives of ESES DPL3 and the ESES DPL program will be achieved.

POLICY AREAS

PILLAR 1: Energy Sector - Supply Security, Climate Change & Enhanced Private Investment

80.    Turkey is implementing an ambitious energy sector program with a view to meeting the
country’s growing energy demand in an efficient and sustainable manner. Turkey’s program is
presented in Section III and Annex 3. The program was supported under PEDPL1 and ESES
DPL2 and further support is proposed under the ESES DPL3 as summarized in the following
paragraphs.




                                                        35
81.    The specific policy measures for the proposed ESES DPL3 in energy security,
climate change and enhanced private investment are as follows:

      Launching of the day-ahead wholesale electricity market by the transmission system and
       electricity market operator TEIAŞ;
      Enactment of an Amendment of the Renewable Energy Law; and
      Government approval of an Energy Efficiency Strategy.

82.     The key energy sector outcome indicators of the ESES DPL Program are: (a) day-
ahead electricity market launched and operating effectively; (b) cost–reflective tariffs
maintained; (c) improved financial performance of power companies, with loss for TEDAŞ and
receivables for TEIAŞ and EÜAŞ reduced; (d) private investment in the power sector; (e) rate of
electricity demand growth contained; and (f) a new gas import contract signed. Results
indicators are presented in Annex 2. Implementation progress is generally satisfactory and
objectives and results are being achieved as discussed below.

83.    The ESES DPL Program is on track to achieve its energy sector objectives and
results:

      A day-ahead electricity market (a power exchange) has been launched and operates
       effectively: trading currently accounts for over one quarter of Turkey’s electricity supply,
       and earlier major collection and payment issues have been resolved;
      Financial recovery has been achieved in the power sector. Up to 2008, prices did not
       cover costs and collection was less than 100 percent, and large arrears were accumulated.
       With the implementation of the cost-based pricing mechanism, electricity tariffs have
       reflected costs since 2008. (Reasonable costs as accepted by EMRA). Collections
       started to improve through 2009. Collections reached 100 percent in 2010 (some
       privatized discoms collected more than 100 percent, i.e. also recovered past arrears).
       Main state-owned utilities achieved profitability – EUAŞ from 2009, TEIAŞ from 2010
       and TEDAŞ from 2011 - and have paid their arrears to private sector generators. Cross-
       payables and receivables between public sector companies are being cleaned-up through
       a special legislation enacted by the Parliament;
      A large volume of private investment has been attracted, including the development of
       about 11,200 MW generation capacity in the 2008-2011 period and about US$5.4 billion
       so far in the ongoing electricity distribution privatization program. The closing of the
       latest privatizations slipped to 2012 and most may require rebidding;
      Agreements for the purchase of gas for Turkey’s gas market and transit to Europe have
       been signed between the Governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey and their gas companies
       SOCAR and BOTAŞ; and
      Turkey’s electricity and gas supply security have improved. The projected electricity
       supply imbalances in 2010 and 2011 were avoided. Rate of electricity demand growth in
       the 2008-2011 period at about 4.9 percent/annum was well below the target 7
       percent/annum. This result was in part facilitated by the economic slowdown in 2009
       caused by the global crisis.


                                               36
84.     The completion of Turkey’s electricity distribution privatization program has
slipped to 2012 and has not been included as a prior action of DPL3. The Privatization
Administration has offered for sale and determined the winning bidders for all 18 discoms
included in the program, completing four tenders in 2008, three in 2009 and eleven in 2010.
Privatization proceeds from already closed transactions amount to about US$5.4 billion.
However, the closing of seven of the 2010 privatizations has slipped to 2012 and some may
require rebidding. Their completion is delayed, as many of the ranked bidders have not fulfilled
the obligations of Tender Specifications for these companies (which comprise the third phase of
PA’s distribution privatization program supported under the ESES DPL series). Winning bids
for these seven companies amounted to about US$11 billion. PA granted the winning bidders
more time but requested that additional letters of guarantee – higher bid bonds - be submitted.
One of the seven submitted (Dicle Electricity Distribution Company) and has been invited to
execute the agreement. For the other six companies, PA invited the second-ranked bidders to
execute the agreements. One of these six second-ranked bidders executed the agreement and the
company (Trakya Electricity Distribution Company) has been transferred. The tender for Gediz
Electricity Distribution Company was cancelled as the second-ranked bidder did not fulfill the
obligations of Tender Specifications. For the other four companies, as the second-ranked bidders
did not fulfill obligations of the Tender Specifications, PA invited the third-ranked bidders to
execute the agreements. As the third-ranked bidders did not fulfill obligations of the Tender
Specifications, tenders for Akdeniz and Boğaziçi Electricity Distribution Companies have been
cancelled and the fourth-ranked bidders have been invited to execute the agreements for two
companies (Istanbul Anadolu and Toroslav Electricity Distribution Companies). PA will
retender companies for which the original bid processes have to be canceled.

85.     A program of measures for increasing the operational capacity and financial
strength of TEIAŞ has been prepared, but is not included as a prior action. An ESMAP-
financed WB-managed study – Assessment of Options for Improving the Operational
Effectiveness of TEIAŞ – identified a number of options for consideration. The highlights
include: (a) restructuring of TEIAŞ into separate transmission system and electricity market
operators; and (b) processing a special law to provide TEIAŞ with sufficient autonomy. The
Bank has suggested private sector participation in the new electricity market operator, the listing
of TEIAŞ at the Istanbul Stock Exchange and progressive reduction of Government ownership as
effective means for addressing TEIAŞ’ constraints. The originally envisioned trigger was not
included as a prior action of DPL3 in view of the interim/process-nature of the action. An
amendment to the Electricity Market Law would be required for the restructuring of TEIAŞ and
establishment of a separate electricity market operator. MENR has posted a draft electricity law
(replacement of the current Electricity Market Law) on its web-site for public comments. An
inter-ministerial working group is examining related issues in TEIAŞ. The Bank has an ongoing
lending relationship with TEIAŞ and the dialogue will continue.

86.     An amendment to the Gas Market Law is included in the Government program, but
its adoption has slipped to 2012 and has not been included as a prior action of DPL3. The
restructuring of BOTAŞ to separate the gas import and trading functions and the gas network and
storage functions of BOTAŞ into two companies is expected. The Bank has suggested that the
listing of the two unbundled companies in the Istanbul Stock Exchange be also considered. Not
including the amendment of the Gas Market Law as a prior action does not to affect the
immediate results of the ESES DPL program: In October 2011, Turkey and Azerbaijan and their

respective gas companies BOTAŞ and SOCAR signed agreements for Turkey to purchase six
billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually and to transit another 10 bcm to Europe. The signing
of such a gas purchase contract is the gas sector results indicator of the energy pillar of the DPL
program. The amendment is expected to be enacted during 2012. The Bank has an ongoing
lending relationship with BOTAŞ and the dialogue will continue.

87.     A new prior action on energy efficiency has been added into the scope of the energy
pillar of DPL3. A new Energy Efficiency Strategy has been finalized by the Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources and was approved by the High Planning Council in February 2012. A
new related Regulation on Energy Efficiency was issued on October 27, 2011. The Strategy is
an important milestone in Turkey’s development and implementation of its energy efficiency
agenda. It cuts across all three pillars (energy security, climate change mitigation and
environmental sustainability) of the program supported by ESES DPL3 and its inclusion further
strengthens the program. The National Climate Change Action Plan targets to reduce Turkey’s
energy intensity by 10 percent by 2015 compared to 2008, and the new Energy Efficiency
Strategy targets a reduction by 20 percent by 2023 compared to 2011.

88.    Final review of the results of the program will be carried out in 2013 as a part of the
Implementation Completion and Results Review (ICR). The ICR will also review the
following 2012 actions:

      The day-ahead electricity market continues to function in a satisfactory manner, in terms
       of liquidity/volume of trading and receivables/payables;
      the power sector is financially viable, including that: (a) EMRA continues to apply the
       cost-based pricing mechanism; (b) main utilities maintain profitability in 2012; and (c)
       cross-payables and receivables between public sector companies have been cleaned-up in
       accordance with the February 2011 legislation;
      Private sector generation investments continue (target for the five-year 2008-2012 period
       is 12,500 MW) and the distribution privatization program has been substantially
       completed (subject to market conditions); and
      A new electricity law (replacing the Electricity Market Law) and an amendment of the
       Gas Market Law have been approved by the Parliament.

PILLAR II: Climate Change

89.  The specific policy measure proposed to be supported under Pillar II – Climate
Change – of ESES DPL3 is:

      Government’s Climate Change Coordination Board approval of a National Climate
       Change Action Plan (including sectoral actions for at least three key sectors).

90.    The key climate change pillar outcome indicators are: (1) An inter-ministerial Climate
Change Coordination Board and a Climate Change Department at the MoEU are working to
coordinate and ensure complementarity between sector specific climate actions; and (2) a
framework established for monitoring the implementation of the National Climate Change


                                                38
Strategy and Action Plan agreed. (Ultimate results are very long-term. Intermediate monitoring
indicators have been developed and included in the National Climate Change Action Plan.)

91.     The ESES DPL Program is on track to achieve its climate change objectives and
results. A National Climate Change Strategy was approved in May 2010 and a National Climate
Change Action Plan was approved in May and issued in July 2011. An inter-ministerial Climate
Change Coordination Board and a Climate Change Department at the MoEU have been
established. They are active/operational and working to coordinate and ensure complementarity
between sector specific climate actions. The progress and the change in Turkey’s approach and
attention to climate issues during the program period has been significant, when compared to the
preceding a long period of limited attention: (a) Turkey ratified and became a party to the Kyoto
Protocol in 2009 and stepped up its participation in international fora, including the Copenhagen,
Cancun and Durban climate summits (Conference of Parties); and (b) as far as collaboration with
the Bank is concerned, Turkey joined the Clean Technology Fund and the Partnership for Market
Readiness and has requested and received investment project financing for energy efficiency,
renewable energy and related transmission system and electricity market development with CTF
financing and three Bank loans approved in the 2009-2011 period. Turkey’s international
engagement and participation, collaboration with the Bank, as well as the National Climate
Change Strategy and Action Plan, are grounded upon studies and analyses carried out by the
MoEU, the Ministry of Development and several line ministries including the Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Going forward this progress
enables inter alia Turkey’s effective participation in the international effort, which aims to
prepare and agree a new climate change regime by 2015.

92.    MoEU has prepared a regulation on the monitoring, reporting and verification
(MRV) of greenhouse gas emissions. MoEU announced the regulation at the PMR meeting in
Istanbul in October 2011. The regulation is modeled on a similar regulation in place under in the
EU and would initially cover over 1,000 installations. The Ministry is working with the Turkish
accreditation and standards institutes to deliver training to auditors (part of which is likely to be
funded by the PMR).

PILLAR 3: Sustainable Environmental Management

93.   The specific policy measures proposed to be supported under Pillar III - Sustainable
Environmental Management – of ESES DPL3 are:

      Issuance by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of a Regulation transposing
       Directive 2001/80/EC on Large Combustion Plants (for licensing of new installations);
      Issuance by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of a Regulation, and
       amendments to the Regulation, on Permits and Licenses in Accordance with the
       Environmental Law;
      Issuance by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of an amendment to the
       Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control by the Ministry of Environment and
       Urbanization; and
      Issuance by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization of a Regulation on the
       Control of Soil Pollution and Contaminated Sites by Point Sources.


                                                 39
94.     The key outcome indicators in the Sustainable Environmental Management are: (a)
An integrated system for environmental “e-permits? is operational; (b) increased transparency,
accountability and public participation in the environmental consent process; (c) increased
percentage of population served by sanitary landfills; (d) Clean Air Center in Marmara fully
functioning and staffed to implement the Clean Air Action Plan; and (e) at least 15 of the 25
river basins have developed river basin protection action plans. Results indicators are presented
in Annex 2. Implementation progress is generally satisfactory and objectives and results are
being achieved as discussed in the next paragraphs.

95.    The ESES DPL Program is on track to achieve its sustainable environmental
management objectives and results: (a) institutional and policy framework in support of
harmonization with EU Environmental Acquis and improved inter-sectoral coordination in
environmental management has been strengthened; (b) increased public participation in
environmental decision-making is facilitated by the new EIA process; (c) the institutional
framework for environmental monitoring and regulation has been improved with the new e-
environment system for permits and licensing; (d) waste management (including the
management of hazardous substances and chemicals and associated risks) has improved through
improved regulatory framework and commitment to international conventions; and (e) the
management of air quality and water resources and water quality has improved.

96.    Two originally envisioned prior actions have been removed from the scope of ESES
DPL3 and three regulations issued by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization have
been included as new prior actions for DPL3. Taken together these changes – discussed in the
next three paragraphs - in the scope of DPL3 will strengthen the Environment Pillar of DPL3
compared to its original design.

97.     A Regulation (and three amendments) on Permits and Licenses to be taken in
Accordance with the Environmental Law has been issued by the MoEU and has been
included as a prior action of DPL3. This regulation combines all the licenses and permits
required by the industrial installations into a single “e-permit?. The objective of the regulation is
to streamline the application process for the applicants and to make the licensing and permitting,
monitoring/inspection and enforcement by the MoEU more effective. Moreover, the former
separate environmental permits used to have different validity periods which made it difficult for
both the companies and the governmental officials to monitor compliance. Within the re-
structured MoEU, the General Directorate of EIA, Permitting and Inspection has become the
responsible authority both for issuing these e-permits and also for their monitoring/inspection
and enforcement. In addition, MoEU is establishing permitting, monitoring and inspection
departments in      provincial directorates, to strengthen the environmental monitoring and
inspection practices. The MoEU has reportedly reduced the number of official documents from
199 to 16, by implementation of this regulation and enacted a related regulation on requirements
for accreditation of “environmental official? or and environmental consultancy company
involved in the process of applying for the e-permits. This is an important improvement towards
environmental compliance of industrial sector since these officials will be also responsible for
environmental compliance of the companies.

98.    An amendment to the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control has been
issued by the MoEU and has been included as a prior action of DPL3. The Government’s

                                                 40
strategy for generation privatization (supported under DPL2) stipulates that the sales agreements
with the successful winning bidders will require them, inter alia, to renovate the plants within a
stipulated timeframe after privatization as needed to meet the applicable environmental
standards. Privatization is regarded as the best if not the only effective means for upgrading all
plants to meet applicable standards, including past liabilities. The new regulatory framework
resulting from this amendment provides winning bidders in generation privatizations a grace
period - adequate time to upgrade those plants that do not currently meet applicable
environmental standards - and requires them to meet applicable standards after the grace period.

99.     Regulation on Control of Soil Pollution and Contaminated Sites by Point Sources
has been issued by the MoEU and has been included as a prior action of DPL3. This
regulation was issued on June 8, 2010 and is to become effective from June 8, 2012. This grace
period for implementation is being used by the MoEU for capacity building and accreditation of
decentralized staff, responsible to conduct the inventory and rehabilitation plans of contaminated
industrial lands. The regulation inter alia covers technical and administrative principles and
methods for prevention of soil contamination and identification, recording; cleaning-up and
monitoring of already contaminated or potentially contaminated sites. This is the first regulation
which supports the preparation of the contaminated land inventory and also describes the
requirements for sustainable disposal of land contaminated by chemicals, and any other
hazardous materials/waste. In addition to the regulation, MoEU has also issued four guidelines
which will support the implementation of this regulation. The guidelines are: (a) a technical
handbook on surveying polluted sites; (b) risk assessment of polluted areas; (c) rehabilitation and
monitoring of polluted sites; and (d) management system for polluted sites.

100. The transposition of EU’s Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive
2001/42/EU is delayed and has not been included as a prior action of ESES DPL3.            The
SEA regulation, transposing the EU’s SEA Directive 2001/42/EC, had been prepared but had not
been formally approved prior to the reorganization of the structure of ministries following the
June 2011 national elections. Following the reorganization of the ministries, within the new
structure, the draft SEA regulation has been reviewed and revised by the EIA, Permitting and
Inspection General Directorate of the MoEU. It is expected to be finalized and published in the
Official Gazette and become effective in 2014. Capacity building and preparations for
implementation of SEA are already underway (para. 55).

101. The process of transposition of Directive 2006/11/EC on Dangerous Substances– an
originally intended trigger for DPL3 – has been incorporated into the preparation of a
more comprehensive water regulation. The organizational restructuring affected the
responsibilities of the departments working on the water management issues in the former
Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Regulations related to water management are being
prepared under the new MoFW’s Water Management General Directorate. MoFW is focusing
on drafting a new Regulation on Management of Surface Water Quality, Classification and
Monitoring. MoFW is planning to transpose the dangerous substances part of Water Framework
Directive and 2008/105/EC Environmental Quality Standards Directive. Within the scope of this
subject, MoFW is executing a national project on dangerous substances in water and has
proposed a research project on protecting substances in water to TUBİTAK (The Scientific and
Technological Research Council of Turkey).

                            VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

102. The social impact of the program expected to be supported by ESES DPL series is
significant and overall positive. Long-term benefits far outweigh potential short-team impacts.
The actions and reforms under the program are expected to help: (a) sustain economic growth,
which in turn will increase employment generation and reduce poverty; (b) improve the
environment, which in turn will improve the quality of life and health; and (c) improve the
quality of electricity supply and service to consumers through privatization, infrastructure
investment and increased competition. The program strengthens the framework for long-term
sustainable growth across the economy and in the energy sector in particular. This will increase
employment generation and reduce poverty. However, while helping to ensure access, some of
the energy reforms (pricing and privatization) are also expected to affect the affordability of
energy services for the poor.

103. The social impact of inaction would exceed the social impact of energy reforms.
Should sizeable electricity shortages develop – the likely scenario without the reforms supported
under the DPL series - they would have an especially severe adverse impact on the poor. In
terms of direct impact, other consumers (industrial, commercial and non-poor domestic
consumers) will be better able to mitigate the impact of inadequate supply either by directly
reducing their energy consumption19 or by resorting to more expensive options that the poor
cannot afford (e.g. diesel generators). Improving energy security will help to ensure that such
adverse impacts are reduced or even avoided and that energy services to households are
maintained at acceptable levels. In terms of indirect impact, electricity shortages would contain
economic growth, investment and employment generation and poverty reduction, and
improvements in the quality of life and health from environmental improvements would not
materialize.

104. Electricity pricing reform coincided with the economic crisis that caused
unemployment and disproportionally affected the poor. After constant tariffs in the 2003-07
period, electricity prices were adjusted significantly in the course of 2008 under the new cost-
based pricing mechanism. These adjustments were necessary but they came at the same time as
the economic crisis reached Turkey and as the country’s economic growth first slowed down and
then turned into negative rates of -6.5, -14.3 and -7.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
the first and second quarter of 2009, respectively (y/y). Unemployment rose sharply, with the
three-month moving-average open unemployment rate peaking at 16.1 percent in January–
March, 2009. The impact through the labor market translated into an increase in the poverty rate
of about 1 percentage point (from 17.1 percent to 18.1 percent).

105. Although poorer households were disproportionally affected by the 2008 electricity
price increases, overall the impact on households, including poor households, was limited.
Figure 4 illustrates the share of electricity expenditure in household disposable income by
income quintile from 2003 to 2009. After tariff increases in 2008, the budget share of electricity

19
   Electricity demand elasticity of the non-poor is higher than that of the poor, mainly because the poor use
electricity for basic consumption needs and have little room to adjust. (See Annex 4 for details).

                                                     42
expenditure increased for all income groups, but was still close to (for the bottom quintile) or
lower (for the other four quintiles) than the 2003 levels. In addition, at 2008 price level, average
electricity consumption of the poorest income group was still well above the electricity poverty
threshold of 1200 kWh per year; and the average budget share of electricity of the bottom
income quintile remained below the 10-percent affordability benchmark (Figure 5). Details are
provided in Annex 4. It is notable that the household budget share of electricity in Turkey in
2008 was also the eighth lowest in the European and Central Asia region.

106. Actions to increase payments for usage may affect the poor more than other groups.
Each year about one third of those in the poorest quintile who participated in the household
budget survey did not report electricity expenditures. A series of test reveals that these
households were statistically poorer and were more likely living in rural areas than other

                                                                                                          43
households in the bottom quintile. If non-reporting was related to non-payment or illegal
connections, if proper payments were fully collected the poorer would face a higher effective
tariff and would consume proportionally less. However, electricity would still be affordable: for
those who did not report expenditures on electricity, the share of electricity in their budget is
estimated to be at around 6.2 percent of disposable income or 5.1 percent of total expenditures in
2008, and 8.1 percent of income or 6.2 percent of total expenditure in 2009. Details are provided
in Annex 4.

107. The share of electricity in household disposable income increased in 2009,
particularly among the poor, although this was more the result of reduced income caused
by the crisis rather than the price increase. In 2009, the share of electricity in disposable
income of the poorest households spiked to 8.5 percent, while the average budget share of
electricity was a much lower 4.0 percent. Analysis suggests that the hardships of the poor were
more likely to be attributable to higher income reduction related to the economic crisis than to
price increases 20. Details are provided in Annex 4. As soon as 2010 data becomes available, the
analyses in Annex 4 will be updated.

108. Work carried out by the Ministry of Development (formerly the State Planning Office),
UNDP and Ankara-based universities involved focus group discussions with poor households in
four sites (UNDP, 2009). Focus group discussions suggested that price increases had caused
some hardship and, in some cases, households were responding to increases in tariffs by
restricting basic consumption. The Government is aware of the impact of price increases and has
emphasized that: (a) the energy price adjustments were necessary to restore the financial viability
of the sector; and (b) the Government prefers mitigation through general social assistance
programs rather than sector-specific measures.

109. Using past and current market data and trends, the welfare impact of projected
future electricity tariff adjustments is currently expected to be modest. Significant changes
in electricity prices are presently not expected, due to a number of reasons: (1) the prices for
natural gas – the dominant generation fuel and the main determinant of electricity prices - are
projected to remain flat throughout this decade; (2) electricity prices under the BOT and BOO
contracts signed in the 1990s were frontloaded and will be declining throughout this decade; and
(3) Prospects for an increasingly competitive electricity market are good, given the large size of
the Turkish power system; the large number and diversity of generating companies, plants and
fuels; and the current and planned interconnections with neighboring countries enabling
electricity sales into Turkey’s market. Future price paths will critically depend on EMRA’s
expected continued ability to withstand expected pressures by private companies for EMRA to
adjust tariff parameters in distribution tariffs to help raise additional revenue and recover their
bid prices faster. Another future cost factor is the internalization of carbon prices. The welfare
cost of any future price increases can be reduced as households adjust their consumption patterns
and take advantage of energy saving opportunities including more efficient lighting and
appliances.

    Poverty decreased from 28.1 percent in 2003 to 17.1 percent in 2008, but increased by 1 percentage point to 18.1
percent in 2009 as a result of the crisis. Poverty is expected to have fallen since then as labor markets, the main
channel through which the crisis affected households, recovered quickly, with seasonally adjusted unemployment at
9.1 percent and the employment rate at 45.4 percent in October 2011, improving on pre-crisis levels.

Electricity Privatization

110. The Government has recognized and has set out to deal with the potential impact of
electricity privatizations. The Government is committed to making the privatization program a
long-term success. The Government has decisively and repeatedly assured current and
prospective investors that the new private owners of privatized electricity companies will have
the full backing of the Government. The strong response of the private sector to the PA’s
privatization offerings demonstrates the credibility of the Government’s commitment and the
strength of the overall legal, regulatory and institutional framework (Annex 3). The key features
related to the social dimensions of privatization are highlighted in the following paragraphs. The
summary Stakeholder Analysis (Box 6) describes short and longer term effects of the
privatization process on different groups.

111. Privatization transactions in the electricity sector have had little negative impact on
employment. The PA’s privatization agreements for electricity distribution requires companies
to commit to preserving employment at the minimum at 95 percent of the number of employees
employed under the Labor Law no. 4857 as of the date of transfer for a period of three years
from the date of takeover. Companies are required to provide an irrevocable and unconditional
US$1 million performance bond and report to the PA every six months on their compliance. The
personnel subject to the Law on Civil Servants no. 657 and personnel under contract are subject
to transfer to other public sector organizations. Laid-off workers, if any, are entitled under the
Labor Law to compensation by the companies. Workers laid off during the first six months can
be employed in other public sector companies though usually under lower pay scales.
Discussions with earlier privatized distribution companies indicate that staff reductions have
been achieved without involuntary lay-offs. Discussions with the PA indicate that the electricity
privatization process has experienced substantially less challenges than some of its other
processes and layoffs are unlikely to become an issue. The PA attributes this success to its
framework agreement with the trade union and more fundamentally to the bright growth
prospects, including employment prospects, in the electricity sector; compared to some
privatizations of companies facing declining markets and even bankruptcy.

112. The energy regulator EMRA supports the Government’s electricity privatization
program and recognizes the challenges facing distribution companies in their efforts to
reduce technical and commercial losses including theft and improve bill collection.
Accordingly, when setting its regulatory performance targets EMRA aims to balance the need for
continued improvement and prevailing conditions in the distribution area of each company,
including the two companies with unusually high loss/theft rates (Vangolu and Dicle). A large
majority of the regulated companies have achieved EMRA’s targets. EMRA emphasized that it
will continue to set realistic targets also in the future, so as to avoid forcing the companies
having to resort to large-scale disconnections.

113. EMRA monitors the performance of the privatized companies on a quarterly basis.
Close quarterly monitoring of already privatized companies will continue and will extend to
cover other private companies as soon as the privatization transactions reach financial closure in
2012 and TEDAŞ transfers the companies to the private operators. This includes monitoring
collection and disconnection rates. EMRA has the option to approach the MENR if in its
judgment public support measures are required for some companies and/or consumers.

114. The Electricity Market Law provides for “cases where consumers in certain regions
and/or in line with certain objectives need to be supported?, in the form of direct cash to
consumers without affecting electricity prices. The amount, procedure and principles of the
support are determined by the Council of Ministers upon the proposal by the MENR. The
Government prefers mitigation through general social assistance programs rather than sector-
specific measures.         However, exceptions have been made, recently most notably in the
electricity sector when the Government introduced a new mechanism for the payment of
electricity bills for street lighting (a prior action of PEDPL1; the mechanism is fully functional).

115. Available information suggests that past electricity privatizations have not affected
the poor significantly. One of Turkey’s 21 distribution regions/companies, Kcetaş in Kayseri
has been under private management for over eight decades. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources transferred the operating rights of two distribution companies in 1998. The
Privatization Administration (PA) privatized three companies in 2009, six in 2010 and one in
2011. According to discussions with the Government, the PA, EMRA and privatized companies,
adverse impacts on the poor from the privatizations and private distribution company operations
have been negligible. The closing of the 2010 privatizations has slipped to 2012.

116. Companies taking over privatized distribution companies are expected to reduce
both technical and commercial losses including theft. Improvements are expected to cover
the full range of activities from metering and meter reading to billing and collection, including
making it easier to make the payments. The Government holds the view that: (a) the main issue
is theft and a habit of not paying (made possible by the absence of credible collection efforts by
the public companies) rather than poverty or affordability; and (b) privatized distribution
companies will have the full backing of the Government in their efforts to reduce electricity theft
and achieve financial viability over time. This is necessary to encourage investment and
improvements in electricity and customer service, which are core objectives of Government’s
electricity privatization program. The strong interest and competition by prospective investors,
even for the two companies with the highest loss/theft rates, suggests that the companies share
the Government’s view and find its commitment to be credible.

117. For public and private distribution companies alike, disconnections are the last
resort for enforcing payment discipline. Companies have used disconnections when other
measures to persuade defaulters to pay have failed. However up until now, companies have been
able to improve collections to highly satisfactory levels without having to resort to large-scale
disconnections. Collections started to improve in some cases even ahead of the private company
taking over – consumers’ awareness about privatization prompted a change in behavior.

118. The Government recognizes that the lack of impacts in the past does not guarantee
lack of problems in the future as the privatization program progresses notwithstanding the
measures and monitoring discussed above. The experience from the 2008-2009 privatizations
shows increased payments by consumers without large-scale disconnections. However, the
combination of a pre-existing environment of low payment rates and some socio-economic
disadvantage may increase the incidence of disconnections in certain ongoing privatizations.
The two companies with unusually high loss/theft rates, Vangolu Elektrik Dagitim and Dicle
Elektrik Dagitim, have been sold but not yet transferred to the winning bidders. Transfers are


                                                47
expected in 2012. These two companies operate in regions towards the bottom of Government’s
Socio-Economic Development Ranking presented in the 2010 Annual Plan (MoD, 2009).

119. Tracking the impact of electricity sector reforms on consumers, drawing on various
data sources, can help inform effective implementation of reforms over time, increase their
benefits and reduce their costs to consumers over time, and contribute to their long-term
sustainability. Such monitoring has begun in Turkey and is expected to continue:

      EMRA monitors the performance of the privatized companies on a quarterly basis;

      In March 2009, the Ministry of Development, UNDP and Ankara-based universities
       published a review that monitored the household level effects of and responses to utility
       reform. The review used both quantitative data and qualitative research techniques to
       analyze the impact on households of tariff changes in the electricity, natural gas and
       water sectors; and

      The Ministry of Development and UNDP have agreed to continue this work in
       collaboration with the Bank as privatization progresses and companies including Vangolu
       and Dicle are transferred to the winning bidders. The activity is included in UNDP's
       Country Program Action Plan for 2012. As the completion of the distribution
       privatization program has slipped, the work plan for the proposed monitoring has been
       adjusted. The current plan is to start with a preparatory phase in 2012. This would
       include an inception workshop, analysis of quantitative data and literature desk review,
       design of methodology, field testing of methodology, possible insertion of tested
       questions in the HBS and preparation of all tender documents for the research team. The
       field research would follow in two rounds, in 2013 and 2014, assuming the privatization
       program has been substantially completed within 2012.

120. Research using qualitative techniques can be helpful to complement quantitative
data and to monitor the effects of electricity pricing and privatization reforms on
consumers in more detail and depth, especially in challenging environments where
collections are currently lower and the possibility of disconnections is higher. The
qualitative research techniques provide useful feedback from electricity consumers on; (a)
household level experiences of electricity distribution after privatization, including
improvements in electricity supply, customer service, and strengthened collection; (b) the extent
to which groups of households may or may not have difficulties in paying their electricity bills;
and (c) households' coping strategies for adjusting to price increases over time and their access to
both formal and informal assistance programs.

121. No major social problems are expected in the generation privatization program.
The key elements of the generation privatization strategy are discussed in Annex 3. No major
social issues are envisioned: (a) The PA expects that the generation privatization agreements
will limit layoffs along the lines of those in the distribution privatization agreements for the first
3-5 years from privatization and the civil service and worker safeguards apply as well (para.
111). (b) The clients of the generation companies include the distribution companies, TETAŞ
and other electricity traders, and large electricity consumers, buying directly from the generators
or indirectly through Turkey’s electricity market PMUM. Households will continue to buy their

                                                 48
electricity from the distribution companies until 2015. From January 2015, households are
scheduled to become eligible, i.e. they will have the freedom to choose their electricity supplier.
International experience shows that most households are likely to stay with their distribution
company. Most fundamentally, (c) significant changes in electricity prices are not expected
based on projected gas prices, contracted BOT/BOO prices, transition arrangements, electricity
market development and EMRA’s expected ability to withstand price pressures (para. 109).

Social Assistance Programs

122. Turkey is stepping up its efforts to support the poor and vulnerable through social
assistance. Social assistance spending has been increasing rapidly in recent times, although it
remains low by international standards (1.2 percent of GDP in 2010). The three largest programs
include the Conditional Cash Transfer program, which provides benefits to poor children
conditional on health and educational investments, the Green Card Program, which provides
health insurance to poor people not covered by social security, and payments to the elderly and
handicapped. Some smaller programs exist, among them those executed at the provincial and
district levels. Social assistance to support the payment of electricity bills of the poor is not
systematically available, although electricity distribution companies reported that some of their
consumers have been able to obtain assistance for the payment of their electricity bills from such
provincial and local level general social programs, in some cases based on their eligibility for the
Green Card Program. The Government is taking important steps to develop an integrated social
assistance system to ‘promote’ welfare recipients out of poverty: (a) all central government
benefits are now under the new Ministry of Family and Social Policies21; (b) a new Integrated
Social Assistance Information System has been developed; and (c) all beneficiaries who are able
to work are now required to register with ISKUR.

Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency

123. Social impact of renewable energy development and energy efficiency improvements
is positive. In addition to energy security and global greenhouse gas reduction benefits,
renewable energy development and energy efficiency improvements have significant
national/local level environment benefits through other emission reductions, leading to improved
air quality and contributing to improved health and better quality of life. Employment benefits
are also significant, particularly in biomass production and utilization, and also in other
renewable projects compared to the alternatives in Turkey. Energy efficiency projects are
typically small and decentralized, and labor-intensive compared to their alternatives in Turkey,
the construction of large coal and gas fired power stations. Finally, Turkish companies will
account for the major part of the construction and installation works and are also expected to be
able to compete for equipment supplies. The exports of renewable energy and energy
conservation equipment and project services have the potential to become a source of
employment and export revenue.

     The social assistance budget under this Ministry will increase by 40 percent in 2012.

Environment

124. The climate change and environment management components of the ESES DPL
program are expected to have significant positive impacts. The adoption of EU-equivalent
environmental policies and standards will result in significant reduction of local pollution which
will have a significant impact on human health in Turkey’s urban centers. Adoption of the EU
principles of sustainable development and protection of the environment for present and future
generation, based on preventive action, the polluter pays principle, and fighting environmental
damage at the source, is major step towards environmental sustainability in Turkey. While it is
difficult to quantify the effects of the particular actions, improvements in environmental
sustainability are expected to benefit the poor, as this segment is most at risk from the impacts of
climate change and environmental degradation. Water and air pollution result in ill health.
Likewise, stronger emphasis on environmental monitoring (e.g air quality) will support
implementation and more effective enforcement of national environmental legislation and bring
about better compliance from industry.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

125. The program supported by the ESES DPL series is likely to have significant positive
effects on the environment and natural resources. There are strong mutually reinforcing links
and complementarities among the three pillars of the expanded ESES DPL program. The energy
pillar yields significant national and local environmental co-benefits. The energy and
environmental management pillars yield significant climate change co-benefits as summarized in
Box 3. National and local environmental actions have strong synergies with climate change
actions and support climate change mitigation and adaption. The implementation of policy and
regulatory action is supported by capacity building programs undertaken with the assistance of
the EU, bilateral donors and the Bank. By supporting the Government’s national climate change
strategy and environmental management and energy sector policies, laws and regulations, the
ESES DPL series supports Turkey’s efforts to strengthen the policy foundations for: (a)
contributing to the global effort and addressing climate change challenges and mainstreaming
climate change considerations in sector policies; (b) mainstreaming sustainable development
principles and reducing environmental degradation and better management of environmental
risks; and (c) enhancing energy security by promoting private sector clean technology
investments and operations. Overall, the program enhances Turkey’s ability to develop and
implement environmental policy more effectively.

126. The ESES DPL program helps mainstream environmental considerations in key
sectors (including water, energy, industry and waste management) and in the country’s
overall approach to development. The design of the DPL series is proactive with respect to
internalizing environmental concerns. This occurs at several levels. At the sectoral level,
reforms in the air quality management (including establishment of clean air centers, issuance of
the amendment on the industrial pollution control regulation), water and waste management
(including basin protection plans, regulation on hazardous substances, regulation on soil
pollution), and industrial sectors support the integration of environmental concerns by helping to
better manage environmental impacts and environmental legacy. These reforms are aligned with
EU Directives and their provisions, and as such, are intended to not only prevent pollution but
also mitigate public health hazards. Other positive environmental impacts are expected to derive

                                                50
from improved institutional framework for environmental management at the national and local
levels (including the issuance of environmental e-permits, which places particular emphasis in
assuring improved accountability and transparency).

Sustainability Actions in the Energy Sector

127. Faced with rising demand for energy in general and electricity in particular, high oil
and gas prices, and increasing emissions, Turkey is implementing a wide range of measures
to moderate the demand growth rate, contain emissions, increase efficiencies in the supply
and consumption of electricity, and diversify the fuel base for the additional generation
capacity to be added. The Government is committed to containing the adverse consequences
for the environment and the Ninth Development Plan calls for minimal environmental damage
while meeting the energy demand. One concrete manifestation of that commitment was the
Government’s request to expand the scope of the PEDPL program into climate change and
sustainable environmental management in DPL2 and DPL3.

128. The following actions taken or being taken by the Government in the energy sector
have significant sustainability and environmental benefits - local, national and global
(climate change mitigation):

      The enactment and the amendment of the Renewable Energy Law, the setting of highly
       ambitious targets for renewable energy development in the new Electricity Strategy, and
       the provision of targeted financial support including the use of CTF resources to
       accelerate development;
      The enactment of the Energy Efficiency Law, the Energy Efficiency Strategy, and
       issuance of related regulations, the implementation of a cost-based energy pricing
       mechanism, and the provision of targeted financial support including the use of CTF
       resources to accelerate development;
      Investments to increase supply-side efficiency in generation, transmission and
       distribution. In the case of generation and distribution, mostly by the private sector with
       limited public participation by EÜAŞ and TEDAŞ; in the case of transmission, by the
       public sector transmission system and electricity market operator TEIAŞ;
      The issuance of EU-equivalent environmental standards for the construction of new
       energy facilities, in particular thermal power stations, and the amendment of the Law on
       Environment to include significantly large administrative fines against noncompliance
       (2007). The ESES DPL program supports the transposition of the EU Directive on
       Environmental Impact Assessment and the transposition into law of Directive 2001/80/EC on
       Large Combustion Plants;

      The upgrading of the environmental performance of existing power stations: (i) Several
       existing coal-fired plants are being retrofitted with flue-gas desulphurization facilities
       (FGDs), electrostatic precipitators, improvements in ash-handling, etc. despite the high
       investment requirements; and (ii) Six existing coal-fired plants do not yet have FGDs;
       one of the six will be retrofitted by the end of 2012. All of these plants will be offered
       for sale in the generation privatization program. The new owners will be required to

                                               51
       carry out specified environmental upgrades (including installation of FGDs) within a
       stipulated timeframe after privatization and then continue to comply with Turkey’s
       environmental standards; and
      Measures to secure future gas imports, in bilateral discussions with producer countries
       and in cooperation with others through joint gas purchasing and infrastructure
       development.

129. Cumulative impact of hydropower development is receiving increased attention.
Owing to a rapid and significant increase in the number of hydro projects in Turkey in recent
years, the possible cumulative impact of multiple hydro plants on river basins is an issue of
growing concern in the country. While current regulations do not include a specific framework
or explicit provisions for undertaking cumulative impact assessments, the General Directorate of
State Hydraulic Works (DSI) is carrying out an assessment of the potential environmental effects
of existing and planned hydro projects in Iyidere (Rize Province) and Solaklidere (Trabzon
Province) river basins. This study is expected to provide guidance on how to address cumulative
effects of hydro projects in these basins. In addition, the MoEU has strengthened its procedures
for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of new hydro projects. Since January 2011, MoEU
has required ecosystem evaluation analysis to be conducted for all newly proposed hydro
projects. Such analysis, while not a replacement for cumulative impact assessment, provides the
basis for a deeper understanding of potential downstream and cumulative effects of proposed
projects. A technical assistance program is also being prepared by the Bank to provide assistance
for the preparation of guidelines on cumulative impact assessment methodology, which will take
into account the outputs from above case studies.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

130. The Undersecretariat of the Treasury will be responsible for coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved in
the implementation of the program being supported by the ESES DPL series including the
Ministry of Development (MoD); the Ministries of Energy and Natural Resources, Environment
and Urbanization, and Forestry and Water Affairs, energy regulator EMRA, the Privatization
Administration, and the energy utilities.

131. The MoD and the Treasury emphasize the importance of the results agenda, and
more specifically to increase the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity in key line
agencies including energy and environment. A significant part of the Bank’s dialogue with the
Government has been geared towards strengthening M&E capacity through three separate
vehicles: the Programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PER), the Joint Portfolio Performance
Review (JPPR), and an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. Under the PER program
and JPPR, a series of M&E workshops were organized in 2009 and 2010. In addition, an IDF
grant provided finance to MoD and pilot agencies to develop result-based monitoring and
evaluation systems to measure the achievement of National Development Plans, Medium-Term
Programs, and Annual Programs, and to design M&E frameworks for strategic plans in three
pilot ministries, including Environment.



                                               52
132. The Bank will also review the progress of the program and identify and discuss
adjustments that may need to be made as it evolves, to take into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the intended
development objectives. The review will focus on the impacts of the various prior actions and
be largely based on the monitoring indicators (Annex 2) and the goals of the program. At the
same time, the overall status of the Government’s program will be monitored to determine
whether country conditions and the specific conditions of the proposed operation have been met.
Bank staff will monitor the progress of privatization and related issues including disconnections.
Visits to privatized companies will continue. The Bank’s monitoring work of the impacts of and
recovery from the global crisis in Turkey will also continue.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

133. Public financial management (PFM) in Turkey has strengthened considerably and
is adequate for the proposed operation. After 2001, modernization of Turkey’s system of
public financial accountability in line with international standards was an urgent PFM priority.
Enactment of the Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law in 2003 marked a
defining moment in this process. The Law defines new principles, rules and structures for
Turkish PFM systems including budget formulation and execution, financial and internal control
systems, and internal and external audit structures. Each year, budgets and indicative proposals
for the following two years are prepared according to the functional, economic and institutional
classifications defined under the PFMC Law. The Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
analytical budget classification and the accrual based accounting systems have been expanded to
all general government institutions, including local administrations. The MOF is thus able to
consolidate the budget realization for all general government institutions. Periodic financial
statements are prepared regularly and on time. General Directorate of Public Accounts (GDPA)
prepares aggregated financial reports for the central government, which are published as a
monthly bulletin. The PFMC Law has transferred the authority to incur expenditures and provide
other approvals for expenditures above predetermined thresholds (internal control over budget
expenditures) to the Strategy Development Units established within each public administration.
The most important positive feature of the PFMC Law is that it combines duties and
responsibilities in a single spending authority that incurs expenditures and is kept accountable.
The PFMC Law has also introduced a modern internal audit framework, an important step given
increased devolution of spending authority to line agencies.

134. Accounting. An automated online accounting system has been implemented. The MOF
developed in-house an automated online public accounting system (Say2000i) has been up and
running since 2002. The system captures receipts and payments from more than 1,500 sites of
the MOF’s GDPA across Turkey as they are made and can produce financial statements and
covers all general budgetary institutions except the Office of the President and the accounting
office for State Debt within the Undersecretariat of Treasury. A uniform chart of accounts that is
harmonized with budget classification has been implemented. The GDPA has issued a new
framework for the accrual-based chart of accounts, harmonized with the economic classification
of the newly adopted GFS budget classification system. Article 49 of the PFMC Law mandates
that accounting be harmonized with international standards, and that standards be issued by a
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which has been operating since June 2006.


                                               53
The GASB is under the MOF, comprised of representatives from the Turkey’s Court of Accounts
(TCA), MoD, MOF, Undersecretariat of Treasury, and other agencies.

135. Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade its public procurement
legislation and practices in line with international standards. The current Public Procurement
Law was enacted in 2002. The Law is based on the United Nations Commission on International
Standards (UNCITRAL) Model and moves Turkey in the direction of compliance with EU
standards. The independent Public Procurement Agency (PPA) established by law to oversee
public procurement and ensure enforcement of the new procurement standards is fully
operational. The Government is working on new procurement legislation for SOEs in the public
utilities sectors consistent with the relevant EU directive in order to improve operational
efficiency of the SOEs. Benchmarking of Turkey’s public procurement system against an
internationally recognized baseline of best practice in procurement was carried out jointly by the
World Bank and the Turkish PPA in February 2006 and updated in October 2007. The
benchmarking included analysis of four main pillars: legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar
I); institutional framework and institutional capacity (Pillar II); procurement operations and
market practices (Pillar III); and the integrity of procurement systems (Pillar IV). It showed that
the country achieved greatest progress in the legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar I), and
in the integrity of the national public procurement system (Pillar IV). Further improvements in
public procurement are important in: (a) eliminating restrictions in the form of thresholds for
participation by international bidders; (b) reducing the frequency of use of exclusions and direct
procurements; and (c) simplifying the dispute resolution system. Finally, selection of consulting
services procedures would benefit from use of quality-and-cost based selection system,
particularly for the assignments that require high competence and relevant experience.

136. Auditing. Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization of
Turkey’s public audit system. The objectives are twofold: (a) clarify institutional responsibilities,
promote improvements in audit quality in line with international standards and support the shift
from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to improve operational
performance; and (b) expand the scope of TCA audits to cover the entire general government
including local administrations, autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining
extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with the overall objective of transforming the TCA
into an effective state audit institution. These objectives were facilitated by the enactment of the
PFMC Law and will be further pursued through the TCA Law that was enacted in December
2010. The new law requires regularity and performance audits and significantly broadens the
audit space of the TCA to include all institutions using public funds irrespective of the public
share in their capital. The TCA is committed to undertake internal reforms to align its
institutional structure with international standards for state audit institutions, to upgrade its audit
capabilities, and to reach consensus with other government audit bodies on the implementation
of the new law.

137. Foreign Exchange Control Environment. The latest safeguards assessment of the
Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) was conducted by the IMF in June 2005. The safeguards
assessment uncovered no material weaknesses in the CBRT`s safeguard framework. The audit
reports by independent auditors on the financial statements of the CBRT for 2008-2010 provided
clean audit opinions. Past audits and generally positive assessment by the IMF indicate that there
are no strong reasons for asking additional safeguards such as audit of deposit account.

                                                  54
DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

138. Disbursement and Implementation Arrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank’s disbursement procedures for DPLs. The untied finances will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the program and not tied to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the
Bank of Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal application. At the
request of the Undersecretary of Treasury, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan in the
Treasury’s account at the CBRT which will form part of the official Foreign Exchange reserves
of the country. The Government will utilize the proceeds of the loan in foreign currency for
either foreign debt servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the treasury single
account for financing budgeted expenses. Prior to that, the Borrower will pay a front-end fee
amounting to 0.25 percent of the loan amount from its own resources. If, after deposit in this
CBRT account, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes (for example, for
financing items imported from non-member countries or goods or services on the IBRD standard
negative list), the IBRD will require the Borrower to refund the amount directly to the IBRD, and
the IBRD will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan.

139. Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The administration of this loan will be the
responsibility of the Undersecretariat of Treasury. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision of the Loan Agreement. Given the IMF`s positive assessment of the
CBRT, an audit of the deposit account for the proceeds of the loan is not considered necessary.
The Undersecretariat of Treasury will provide the Bank within 30 days a confirmation letter
stating that the DPL funds have been received and deposited in the Treasury’s account assigned
by the Borrower that forms part of the Borrower`s budget management system. The closing date
of the loan will be June 30, 2013. This allows the Implementation Completion and Result
Review to examine the results for the full year 2012.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

140. There are four main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) economic risks; (ii) political
risks; (iii) implementation and social risks in the energy sector; and (iv) program and
implementation risks in the climate change and environmental management areas.

141. Economic Risks. A combination of external and domestic factors pose significant risks
going forward, including from the spillovers of the European debt crisis. With low domestic
savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inflows to finance investments and growth.
The country’s large current account deficit and the composition of its financing remain concerns.
A weak outlook for global activity and more severe international funding strains have the
potential to spill over to Turkey. Turkey’s dependence on external financing has left the country
prone to boom-bust cycles, and the key challenge going forward in Turkey is to deliver a soft
landing, from the very high growth rates in 2010 and 2011.

142. Political risks. Turkey has had a stable government since 2002 under the Justice and
Development Party (AKP), facilitating the implementation of major reforms. Social consensus
on the reform program and institutional capacity are needed for the implementation of the reform

                                                 55
program. One key risk is that a prolonged focus on Turkey’s constitutional reform agenda could
narrow the coverage and scope of the economic reform agenda or lead to delays in its
implementation. The EU accession anchor continues to mitigate political risks.

143. Energy sector risks. Turkey’s strategy to achieve and maintain energy security faces
significant implementation risks. The strategy emphasizes private sector participation – both in
the new areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency where substantial barriers have to be
overcome as well as in the mainstream energy production and distribution areas where the
investment needs are very high. The envisioned privatization and implementation schedules
could not be realized as global market conditions worsened. Implementation risks are mitigated
by the energy regulator EMRA’s and the Privatization Administration’s strong track records and
the Government’s continued commitment; however, additional delays may occur if global
market conditions do not improve. The 2008-2009 recession increased the financial burden of
electricity prices increases on the poorest households. Available data suggest that past electricity
privatizations have not had a large adverse impact on the poor. However, two privatizations to
be completed within 2012 are in areas where payment rates are low and the imperative to raise
collection rates may generate more difficulties at the household level than previous
privatizations. The energy regulator EMRA monitors the performance of the privatized
companies on a quarterly basis, including collections and disconnections. In addition, a joint
monitoring program by the Ministry of Development, UNDP and the World Bank will be
implemented in 2012-2014. Effective monitoring will help inform and plan mitigation measures,
if necessary, for low-income households.

144. The successful implementation of Turkey’s climate action agenda requires the
broadening and deepening of Government ownership and public support in Turkey and
maintaining momentum of the international negotiation process—especially as the issues of
emission reduction obligations and finance have not yet been resolved in the UNFCCC process.
Turkey’s climate action agenda is long term and its implementation has only recently started.
These risks are mitigated by a growing public awareness of the implications of climate change
for Turkey; by the recognition that climate action is in Turkey’s own national interest.

145. Turkey’s environment agenda is long term and challenging, and implementation
capacity risks are high. While there is strong Government ownership of environmental
management reforms, Turkey’s experience and capacity in public environmental management
and enforcement remain limited. This risk is mitigated by projects currently targeted toward the
institutional strengthening of the MoEU and the MoFW, supported under the EU pre-accession
financial and technical assistance programs. The European Union opened the negotiations on the
Environment Chapter in December 2009. The mid-2011 merger of environment and urban
ministries into a single ministry has raised a concern that the urban construction agenda will
prevail over the environment. The Government is aware of this concern and is determined to
implement its environmental strategy and program.

             ANNEX 3: ENERGY SECTOR CHALLENGES AND REFORMS


       Overview of Turkey’s Energy Supply and Consumption

1.      Turkey’s energy import dependence is high at over 70 percent. At the same time,
Turkey has an important strategic role, as it is located on an increasingly important oil and gas
transit route from the Caspian Sea and the Middle East to Europe. Turkey lacks significant
domestic energy resources and depends on imports (primarily natural gas, oil, and some coal) for
over 70 percent of its energy needs. The major domestic resources are coal (largely lignite),
hydropower (which currently supplies almost 23 percent of total electricity consumption,
percentage varies annually with hydrological conditions) and oil deposits (which supply about 5
percent of total oil consumption). In 2010, natural gas accounts for the largest single share,
about 32 percent in Turkey’s primary energy mix, followed by oil at about 27 percent, coal at
about 15 percent and lignite at about 14 percent. Renewable sources accounted for about 10
percent.

2.      Natural gas accounts for almost a half of electricity generated. As of February 2012,
total installed generation capacity was about 53,235. The share of gas is expected to decline as
Turkey projects an increase in generation from renewable sources to grow from about 26 percent
in 2010 to at least 30 percent by 2023 and the introduction of nuclear power. The share of
private sector has increased steadily since the 1990s, reached 50 percent of electricity generation
in 2007 (para. 18) and is expected to reach 75-80 percent in the next 5-7 years with generation
privatization (para. 21).

3.      Industries account for almost one half of total electricity consumption, households
about one quarter, and the commercial sector about 15 percent. Transmission and distribution
losses are about 17 percent - transmission losses at below 3 percent are in line with best
international practice, distribution loss at an average of about 14 percent are about twice as a
high as best international practice. The role of the private sector in electricity distribution was
minor until the first major privatizations in 2008 but is currently increasing rapidly, towards 100
percent by the end of 2012 (paras. 19-20).

      Macro/Fiscal and Energy Sector Linkages

4.      Energy imports (mostly oil and gas) account for over 20 percent of Turkey’s
imports and about 50 percent of the current account deficit. The Government’s program,
supported under the ESES DPL program, will alleviate this burden through two broad means as
discussed below: (a) the development of Turkey’s renewable energy sources (paras. 25-26), in
particularly hydro and wind in the near term and also biomass and solar in the longer term, will
help reduce reliance on gas and coal imports; and (b) improvements in the efficiency of energy
use (paras. 29-37), in production processes (electricity generation in particular), transmission,
and in the consumption of energy across the economy, will also help contain the imports of
energy. Turkey is also expected to earn higher transit fees in the coming years as proposed
major pipeline projects are built and commissioned (para. 28). However, energy imports will
remain a major component of Turkey’s imports in the foreseeable future; higher oil and gas
therefore prices pose an external financing risk.

                                                                                           Annex 3


5.      The energy sector is a net contributor to the public finances, through various taxes,
most importantly through taxes on petroleum fuels. In 2011, Turkey raised US$16.6 billion
in petroleum special consumption tax (SCT) and oil-tax revenues account for more than 13
percent of total tax revenues. Turkey’s gasoline taxes are high by international comparison and,
along with boosting government revenue; they effectively promote energy savings (through the
choice of vehicles and commuting and driving practices). Energy privatization revenue has
become an important source of budget revenue. The Privatization Administration (PA) has so
far raised about US$5.4 billion from its electricity distribution privatizations. Energy
privatizations will expand into generation over the next 5-7 years under the program announced
in March 2010. The proceeds from these sales are expected to be even greater than from
distribution, though mostly beyond the current MTP period. It should be emphasized that
Turkey’s energy security and environmental management goals are also among major drivers of
the Government’s energy privatization program, along with raising government revenue.
Electricity privatizations are discussed in paras. 19-22.

6.       Despite its net contribution to Government revenue, the energy sector has also been
a source of major fiscal shortfalls. Earlier tariff shortfalls (corrected in 2008) and bill
collection problems (substantially corrected by 2010) led to delays and arrears in tax payments in
the utilities, in particular BOTAŞ. The receivables of BOTAŞ from state-owned enterprises,
mostly electricity generator EUAŞ, amounted to over US$4 billion (TL 8.1 billion) in 2010.
BOTAŞ in response accumulated payables on custom duty, over US$2 billion (TL 4.0 billion) in
2010. The Government’s program, supported under the ESES DPL program, is addressing this
issue through two broad means: (a) the introduction (in 2008) and sustained implementation of a
cost-based pricing mechanism (para. 16); and (b) the privatization of electricity distribution
(paras. 19-20), which is expected to significantly improve bill collection from final consumers
and thereby increase payments to suppliers, including private generators, TETAŞ and EUAŞ,
which in turn can then pay BOTAŞ. As BOTAŞ’ collections from electricity generators improve
its ability to pay its tax bills to the Government will accordingly improve. Financial recovery in
the power sector has enabled the payment of current bills and the elimination of arrears to private
sector generators – electricity trading company TETAŞ cleared its arrears during 2009 and
electricity market operator TEİAŞ PMUM cleared its arrears in 2010 (para. 17). Remaining
cross-payables and receivables between public sector companies are being cleaned-up through a
legislation which was enacted by the Parliament in December 2010. Accumulated losses will not
be recovered even with 100 percent collection and while matching write-offs of payables and
receivables within the public sector can help clean up balance sheets, an injection of funds would
help to complete the process (some privatization proceeds may be used for this purpose).

      Institutional and Legal Framework

7.      Institutions and Public Sector Energy Companies. The Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources (MENR) is responsible for sector strategy and policy formulation. Sectoral
policies are implemented by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority EMRA as well as the
various state owned energy companies including the transmission system and electricity market
operator TEIAŞ, the electricity trading and contracting company TETAŞ, the electricity
generator EUAŞ, the electricity distributor TEDAŞ, the gas purchaser and pipeline company
BOTAŞ, the hydrocarbon exploration company TPAO and the lignite mining company TKI.
They work with the Treasury, the Ministry of Development (former State Planning
Organization), the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU, which is also the lead
agency for climate policy) and the Privatization Administration (PA, the executive body for the
Government’s privatization programs).

8.      Legal and Regulatory Framework. Turkey has taken a proactive stance to address
issues of energy security, alignment with EU directives and environmental management through
a number of strategies, laws and regulations that have been issued since 2001:

     The Electricity Market Law was enacted in 2001. It liberalized the electricity market,
      restructured (unbundled) the national power utility and established an electricity market
      regulatory authority EMRA (paras. 9-10);

     The Gas Market Law was also enacted in 2001. It liberalized the domestic gas market
      and extended EMRA’s scope to the gas sector, thus amending the electricity law. The Gas
      Market Law enabled EMRA to administer a nation-wide gasification program;

     An Electricity Reform and Privatization Strategy was approved in 2004. It set out the
      approach for the privatization of electricity generation and distribution following market
      reforms and restructuring of state-owned electricity enterprises under the Electricity
      Market Law. Legal and institutional framework for privatization was already in place,
      under Turkey’s Privatization Law enacted in 1994 (para. 12);

     The Renewable Energy Law was enacted in 2005 and amended in 2010 to help reduce
      risk perceptions of potential investors in generation and enhance the attractiveness of the
      Turkish electricity market for renewable energy generators;

     The Energy Efficiency Law was enacted in 2007 to promote efficient energy use, loss
      prevention, lessening the burden of energy costs on the economy, increased yield in the
      use of energy resources and environmental protection;

     The Electricity Market Law was substantially amended in 2008 and an updated
      Electricity Market and Supply Security Strategy was approved in 2009, primarily to
      promote the security of supply; and

     A new Energy Efficiency Strategy was approved in 2012 (para. 34).



                                              75
                                                                                          Annex 3


9.      The Energy Market Regulatory Authority EMRA was established in 2001 as an
independent, administratively and financially autonomous public institution. EMRA’s
scope was extended from electricity and gas to petroleum in 2003 and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) in 2005 through new legislation and amendment of the Electricity Market Law. EMRA
performs its duties and exercises its rights arising from the law through the Energy Market
Regulatory Board. The Board is the representative and decision making body of the Authority. It
consists of nine members including a President and two Vice Presidents. They are appointed to
six-year terms by the Council of Ministers and to provide for EMRA’s operational autonomy
they can be dismissed before the expiry of their terms of office only as provided for in the Law.
EMRA has a total of about 370 staff. The Law also provides for EMRA’s financial autonomy
from the Government by empowering it to fund its activities through fees charged to the energy
industry.

10.     EMRA has issued a comprehensive set of electricity, gas, petroleum and LPG
regulations and has built up a solid track record as an effective regulator through their
implementation.       One of EMRA’s major accomplishments has been the successful
administration of a nation-wide gasification program: in 2002, only nine Turkish provinces had
access to gas; by 2010 63 provinces were connected to the gas network with over 50 private gas
distributors licensed by EMRA now in operation, and the program is expected to cover 72
provinces by 2012. This experience in private gas distribution put EMRA in a good position to
cooperate with the Privatization Administration for the electricity distribution privatization and
in the subsequent regulation of the privatized companies.

11.     In the electricity power sector, EMRA is responsible for electricity market
regulation and monitoring; licensing; transmission, distribution and retail electricity tariff
regulation; and performance monitoring.            To facilitate distribution and generation
privatization, amendments to the Electricity Market Law established and empowered EMRA to
implement: (a) an equalization mechanism to maintain national uniform tariffs while recognizing
cost differences among the distribution companies; (b) cross-subsidies in the national uniform
tariffs between consumer categories; and (c) distribution tariffs for each distribution company
proposed by TEDAŞ and reviewed and approved by EMRA. Power purchase cost regulations
issued by EMRA take into consideration purchase costs in the electricity market and from
renewable energy generators. A new cost-based pricing mechanism was approved by the
Council of Ministers in March 2008 and operationalized by EMRA from July 2008 (para. 16).
EMRA’s tariff regulations provide incentives for investment and loss reduction and support the
successful distribution privatization program.

12.      The principles, procedures, authorised agencies and various other issues regarding
privatization are set out in the Privatization Law enacted in 1994. The law provided the
framework, funds and mechanisms to speed up the privatization and restructuring processes in
Turkey. It established the Privatization High Council and the Privatization Administration to
facilitate the decision making process and execution of the Government’s privatization programs
in various sectors. Energy sector was added to the scope of privatizations through the 2004
Electricity Reform and Privatization Strategy. TEDAŞ was taken into the privatization program
in April 2004.

      Electricity Supply, Market and Pricing

13.     Electricity supply shortages threaten to constrain Turkey’s growth. Turkey is
implementing an ambitious electricity sector program with a view to meeting the country’s
growing electricity demand in an efficient and sustainable manner. The 2009 national electricity
strategy - Electricity Market and Security of Supply Strategy of May 2009 (PEDPL1 prior
action) - focuses on accelerating measures to address the electricity supply-demand imbalance in
a market-driven manner including (a) reducing demand growth rates; (b) increasing efficiency in
the supply and use of electricity, and (c) attracting enhanced private sector investments, so as to
minimize the need for sovereign-guarantees and public investments. The Electricity Strategy
also supports Turkey’s climate change and environmental goals and informed the preparation of
the National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan.

14.     The decline in electricity demand in late 2008 and most of 2009 provided Turkey
extra time, a window of opportunity to attract investment in generation capacity and
electricity efficiency. Electricity demand growth resumed in October 2009 and continued into
2010 and beyond. MENR’s “base case? assessment projected almost 1,000 MW in 2008 and
about 2,800 MW capacity additions for 2009, another 2,000 MW for 2010, then slowing to an
average of about 1,500 MW/annum for the following three years, for a total of about 7,300 MW
capacity additions in the 2008-2011 period. Turkey has substantially exceeded this “base case?
and even the 10,000 MW ESES DPL program target, as the latest estimate for total capacity
additions in the 2008-2011 period is about 11,400 MW. However, Turkey will have to continue
to attract investment and improve electricity efficiency to continue to mitigate the risk of
electricity supply-demand imbalances as economic growth and electricity demand growth
continue.

15.     Turkey continues the liberalization and development of its electricity market.
Electricity market liberalization was launched and progressively implemented under the
Electricity Market Law of 2001. Consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 25 MWh are
currently eligible (i.e., they can choose their own supplier) - this represents over 77 percent of
the total Turkish electricity market. A balancing and settlement system called PMUM – the
abbreviation of electricity market financial reconciliation center in Turkish - is being operated by
the transmission system and electricity market operator TEİAŞ. Although originally designed
for system balancing, PMUM evolved into an electricity trading platform. Over 25 percent of
monthly electricity consumption in Turkey is transacted through the PMUM market by more
than 500 market participants. The 2009 Electricity Strategy confirms the main transitory steps
and targets for Turkey’s ongoing program to develop its electricity market. Accordingly, a Day-
ahead Market (DAM) has been developed by TEİAŞ and was launched in December 2011.

16.      Electricity Pricing Reforms. Constant retail electricity prices during 2003-07, despite a
significant increase in imported gas prices and in generation costs, and limited improvements in
reducing network losses and increasing collection levels, caused a severe deterioration in the
financial viability of the sector - limiting available funding for maintenance of the existing
infrastructure and for new investments as well as sending incorrect price signals for energy
consumers about the use and conservation of energy. Fully cost-reflective electricity pricing is
critical for promoting efficient investments and securing a reliable electricity supply. A new
cost-based pricing mechanism was approved by the Council of Ministers in March 2008 and

                                                77
                                                                                                            Annex 3


established effective from July 2008 (PEDPL1 prior action). It provides for quarterly
adjustments of electricity prices to cover the (justified) increases in costs incurred by the Turkish
Lignite Company, TETAŞ, EÜAŞ, TEDAŞ and BOTAŞ22, including the costs of electricity
obtained on the wholesale market, through mandatory filings and necessary (justified) tariff
adjustments by EMRA. The pricing mechanism has been applied since July 2008. Sustained
implementation (ESES DPL2 prior action) is a prerequisite to the financial viability of the
electricity power sector and the implementation of the Government’s program to privatize
electricity distribution. Impressive results have been achieved: (a) Tariffs were brought to cost-
recovery level in 2008; (b) Collections started to improve through 2009 and reached 100 percent
in 2010; (c) with cost reflective tariffs and improved bill collection, financial recovery has been
achieved in the power sector; (d) Financial recovery enabled the payment of current bills and the
elimination of arrears to private sector generators by 2010. Remaining cross-payables and
receivables between public sector companies are being cleaned-up through a special legislation
enacted by the Parliament in February 2011; and (e) Turkey’s ambitious distribution
privatization program could finally be launched in 2008 once the Electricity Tariff Mechanism
had been put into effective implementation).

17.     Electricity Bill Collection and TEDAŞ Payments. With the sustained implementation
of the cost-based pricing mechanism, electricity tariffs overall now reflect costs. (Justified costs
as accepted by EMRA – system losses currently exceed EMRA’s target). Up to 2008, prices did
not cover costs and collection was less than 100 percent - large arrears were accumulated. From
2008, prices cover costs but collection at 91 percent was much below 100 percent and payment
arrears continued to accumulate in TEDAŞ (the main distributor) but at a much reduced rate.
TEDAŞ' payables had resulted in receivables to electricity and fuel suppliers and TEIAŞ (both as
the TSO and as PMUM the market operator) and initially undermined the full impact of the
continued implementation of the quarterly pricing mechanism. In 2009 TEDAŞ intensified bill
collection (with Government support) and additional complementary measures were also taken,
including the operationalization of the mechanism (approval of which was a PEDPL1 prior
action) for the Treasury to pay for street lighting directly to the utilities on behalf of the
municipalities. As a result TEDAŞ collections reached about 94 percent (including payments
under the new mechanism for street lighting supported under PEDPL1) in 2009. Collections
reached 100 percent in 2010 (some privatized discoms collected more than 100 percent, i.e. also
recovered past arrears).




22
    The Government (not EMRA) regulates the prices that BOTAŞ is allowed to charge for gas to its customers.
Since 2010 these prices have not been adjusted in a timely manner to reflect increases in import prices including the
impact of the depreciation of the Turkish Lira. As a result the financial position of BOTAŞ has been deteriorating.

       Private Sector Participation and Privatization –
       Means for Investment, Energy Security and Efficiency

18.     Turkey opened the power sector for private investment in 1984 but progress
remained limited until the enactment of the build, operate and transfer (BOT) law in 1994
to provide the legal basis to attract private investment to complement public electricity
generation investment in meeting rapidly increasing demand for electricity. The
Government attracted independent power producers (IPPs) under the 1994 BOT law and the
subsequent 1997 build, own and operate (BOO) law with contracts signed by the Turkish
Electricity Generation and Transmission Company TEAŞ and guaranteed by the Government.
TEAŞ contracted over 8,500 MW; mostly gas-fired capacity, but also coal, lignite and almost
1,000 MW hydro generation. Initially, TEAŞ negotiated BOT contracts with the IPPs and later
moved to competitively bid BOO contracts. These contracts led to (temporary) electricity
surpluses and revealed the high costs of negotiated BOT contracts and other BOO/BOT risks to
public purchasers (TEAŞ and effectively the Government which backstops the contracts). The
Government stopped providing guaranteed BOO/BOT contracts and through the 2001 Electricity
Market Law moved to promote market-based bilateral contracts and sales to Turkey’s electricity
market. Contracts signed by TEAŞ were transferred to one of its successor entities upon its
unbundling, the Turkish Electricity Trading and Contracting Company TETAŞ. The market-
based approach has been remarkably successful in attracting investment, with market-based
private generation capacity reaching 5,000 MW in 2008 and growing. Generation capacity of
auto-producers (industrial power generators) amount to another 3,500 MW of private generation
capacity. The share of private sector generation (BOO/BOT, market-based and auto-generation)
in Turkey’s electricity supply has increased steadily and reached 50 percent in 2008. The share
will continue to grow in the coming years with new private investment and the planned major
generation privatization program (para. 21) and is expected to reach 75-80 percent in the next 5-7
years.

Distribution Privatization

19.     Distribution privatization – launched in 2008 and expected to be completed in 2012 -
was adopted as the best available means to achieve a sustainable long-term solution to
satisfactory bill collection and distribution network efficiency.               The Privatization
Administration has offered for sale and determined the winning bidders for all 18 discoms
included in the program, completing four tenders in 2008, three in 2009 and eleven in 2010.
Privatization proceeds from already closed transactions amount to about US$5.4 billion.
However, the closing of seven of the 2010 privatizations has slipped to 2012 and some may
require rebidding. Their completion is delayed, as many of the ranked bidders have not fulfilled
the obligations of Tender Specifications for these companies (which comprise the third phase of
PA’s distribution privatization program supported under the ESES DPLseries). Winning bids for
these seven companies amounted to about US$11 billion. PA granted the winning bidders more
time but requested that additional letters of guarantee – higher bid bonds - be submitted. One of
the seven submitted (Dicle Electricity Distribution Company) and has been invited to execute the
agreement. For the other six companies, PA invited the second-ranked bidders to execute the
agreements. One of these six second-ranked bidders executed the agreement and the company
(Trakya Electricity Distribution Company) has been transferred. The tender for Gediz Electricity
Distribution Company was cancelled as the second-ranked bidder did not fulfill the obligations

                                               79
                                                                                            Annex 3


of Tender Specifications. For the other four companies, as the second-ranked bidders did not
fulfill obligations of the Tender Specifications, PA invited the third-ranked bidders to execute the
agreements. As the third-ranked bidders did not fulfill obligations of the Tender Specifications,
tenders for Akdeniz and Boğaziçi Electricity Distribution Companies have been cancelled and
the fourth-ranked bidders have been invited to execute the agreements for two companies
(Istanbul Anadolu and Toroslav Electricity Distribution Companies). PA will retender
companies for which the original bid processes have to be canceled..

20.      A combination of several factors and cooperation of several agencies underpins the
remarkable success of Turkey’s distribution privatization program in a period of crisis and
turmoil in the local and international financial markets. The Government is committed to
making the privatization program a long-term success. The Government has decisively and
repeatedly assured current and prospective investors that the new private owners of privatized
electricity companies will have the full backing of the Government. The strong response of the
private sector to the PA’s privatization offerings demonstrates the credibility of the
Government’s commitment and the overall legal and regulatory framework. Turkey’s legal and
regulatory framework facilitates privatization and the administrators - the Ministry of Energy and
Resources and the energy regulator EMRA on the energy side and the Ministry of Finance and
the PA and its privatization advisors on the transaction side - support privatization and
effectively work together to implement the privatization program. The cost-based tariff
mechanism provides for sustainable operations as long as the companies meet or exceed
EMRA’s performance targets. Finally, Turkey’s overall favorable long-term growth prospects
attract and encourage both local and foreign investors.

Generation Privatization

21.     A generation privatization program, matching the level of ambition of the soon
complete distribution privatization program, has been launched. The Privatization
Administration (PA) started generation privatizations with the sale of a large number of small
hydro plants (with the total capacity of about 282 MW) of the state generation company EÜAŞ
raising almost US$1 billion. Next the privatization program moves to the major EÜAŞ plants.
An ambitious strategy for their privatization was published by the PA and announced by the
Minister of Finance in March 2010. The state owned power generator EÜAŞ owns and operates
about 20,147 MW, of which about 11,456 MW in thermal and about 8,691 MW in hydro plants.
The privatization program covers all of EÜAŞ thermal and about one half of its hydro capacity.
The generation privatization strategy envisions that 17 thermal generation plants and 27 hydro
plants – amounting to about 16,000 MW - would be offered for sale, most of them in nine
portfolio groups and 3,074 MW in four priority plants independently. The nine portfolio groups
include three thermal-only groups, four hydro-only groups and two mixed thermal-hydro
portfolios. They range in size from 356 MW to 2,795 MW. The groups were formed to balance
different interests and attract a wide variety of prospective investors. Hydro plants in each
portfolio group are along the same river to exploit operational synergies and avoid conflicts
between investors.

22.    The strategy stipulates that the sales agreements with the successful winning bidders
will require them, inter alia, to renovate the plants within a stipulated timeframe after
privatization as needed to meet the applicable environmental standards - which will be in

                                                80
                                                                                         Annex 3


line with applicable EU environmental standards as the harmonization of Turkey’s
environmental policies, laws and regulations with the EU Environmental Acquis progresses. The
implementation was initially planned to start immediately in 2010 but PA deferred the launch to
mid-2011 as further preparatory work was required. Among that work was the preparation of an
amendment of the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control. The amendment was issued in
the Official Gazette and became effective on October 10, 2011. The new regulatory framework
resulting from the October 2011 amendment provides winning bidders in generation
privatizations a grace period - adequate time to upgrade those plants that do not currently meet
applicable environmental standards - and requires them to meet applicable standards after the
grace period. It was earlier concluded that the success of the first generation privatization
offerings will critically depend on the implementation of the cost-based tariff mechanism and
satisfactory bill collection, progress of distribution privatization, and PMUM’s continued
development. Progress in all four areas has been impressive and the generation program is
expected to attract strong investor interest.

      Transmission Services

23.     The national transmission system and electricity market operator TEIAŞ is the
backbone of the power system and is under severe and increasing stress to respond to the
demands of private generators and load changes. Increasing private investment is
projected in both the generation side and the distribution side, leaving TEIAŞ in an
increasingly challenging position in the middle. Government's State-owned enterprise (SOE)
investment review process had contributed to delays in TEIAŞ investments in the past. This
issue was addressed in the 2009 electricity strategy and action was taken accordingly: Ministry
of Development (formerly SPO) approved for TEIAŞ a three-year program of TL 550 million for
2010, TL 600 million for 2011 and TL 650 million for 2012. This put TEIAŞ in a much better
position to prepare its investments for implementation. These provisions, taking into account an
approved multi-year transmission investment plan, were approved as part of the Government’s
annual budgets.

24.      TEIAŞ operational capacity and financial strength need attention - the
implementation and borrowing capacity of TEIAŞ have emerged as the main constraints
after that the investment ceiling issue was addressed as discussed above. TEIAS investment
budget realization was about 67% in 2010 and about 61% in 2011. The biggest challenge facing
TEIAŞ is the projected rapid build-up of wind generation – wind generation is decentralized and
has a short construction period, in sharp contrast centralized (large-scale) thermal plants with
longer construction periods providing TEIAŞ much more time to respond. The current
institutional set-up of TEIAŞ may not be sustainable in the medium-to-long term. There is a
broad agreement about the diagnosis of TEIAŞ constraints (in recruiting and retaining staff,
finance, procurement, timely decision-making, etc.) and emerging interest to consider options for
increasing TEIAŞ operational capacity and financial strength.         An ESMAP-financed WB-
managed study – Assessment of Options for Improving the Operational Effectiveness of TEIAŞ
– identified a number of options for consideration. The highlights include: (a) restructuring of
TEIAŞ into separate transmission system and electricity market operators; and (b) processing a
special law to provide TEIAŞ with sufficient autonomy. The Bank has suggested private sector
participation in the new electricity market operator, the listing of TEIAŞ at the Istanbul Stock
Exchange and progressive reduction of Government ownership as effective means for addressing

                                               81
                                                                                              Annex 3


TEIAŞ’ constraints. An amendment to the Electricity Market Law would be required for the
restructuring of TEIAŞ and establishment of a separate electricity market operator. MENR has
posted a draft electricity law (replacement of the current Electricity Market Law) on its web-site
for public comments. An inter-ministerial working group is examining related issues in TEIAŞ.
The Bank has an ongoing lending relationship with TEIAŞ. The dialogue on these program will
continue with the Government, TEIAŞ, and other concerned agencies.

Renewable Energy Development

25.     Renewable Energy Development is a key component in Turkey’s Electricity and
National Climate Change Strategies. The Government has taken several major measures to
promote private sector renewable energy development, including the enactment of a Renewable
Energy Law, the development of a functioning electricity market and the introduction and
implementation of the quarterly cost-based pricing mechanism. The Renewable energy Law
triggered great interest in hydro and wind development in particular. DSI and EMRA developed
a successful framework for licensing private hydropower generators. However, prior to the
Renewable Energy Project supported by the Bank in 2004 there was very little financing of
renewable energy generation by banks. That project successfully established the template for
such investments while the Renewable Energy Law reduced the risks and currently most of the
major Turkish commercial and development banks invest in renewable energy projects. A road
map for receiving and evaluating applications for wind power plants and issuing the related
licenses has been issued by EMRA, and a wind energy grid code has been finalized.

26.     Renewable energy generation, in particular hydro and wind, has taken off, and the
major contribution of renewable energy into Turkey's power system is expected to come
from hydro and wind in the foreseeable future. Several hydro and wind projects are viable
with the current electricity prices in Turkey's electricity market. Support prices provided under
the Renewable Energy Law serve as a floor/back-up. The Government has prepared and the
Parliament in December 2010 approved an amendment of the Renewable Energy Law in order to
provide prospective investors enhanced predictability about Turkey's support framework,
including technology-based support prices and firm off-take arrangements. Approved support
prices for biomass and especially solar power, though significantly higher than current prices in
PMUM, are nevertheless lower than some investors had expected. The impact of these higher
solar and biomass prices on generation capacity, electricity supply and consumer prices of
electricity is going to remain low in the short-term, as the share of biomass and solar electricity is
expected to remain low in the short-term – the amendment is a measure for the medium-to-long-
term.



       Natural Gas

27.     In the medium-term, the adequacy of natural gas supply may become a bottleneck
for energy security and environmental goals. The Gas Market Law of 2001 and EMRA
provide the legal and regulatory framework for the gas sector. Gas imports have grown rapidly,
driven by Turkey’s growing demand for energy and related environmental considerations. In the
electricity supply, the share of gas has increased from about 20 percent in 1995 to 48 percent in

                                                 82
                                                                                           Annex 3


2009. Complementing this shift to gas in the power sector, EMRA has administered a nation-
wide gasification program. In 2002, only nine Turkish provinces had access to gas; by the end of
2012, 72 provinces are expected to be connected to the gas network. The share of gas in
Turkey’s primary energy mix has reached 32 percent. The Government has recognized that
while the increased use of gas has brought major benefits, the reliance of gas now subjects the
country to a gas supply security risk. A review has been carried out and an amendment to the
Gas Market Law is included in the Government program. The restructuring of BOTAŞ to
separate the gas import and trading functions and the gas network and storage functions of
BOTAŞ into two companies is expected. The Bank has suggested that the listing of the two
unbundled companies in the Istanbul Stock Exchange be also considered. The amendment is
expected to be enacted during 2012. Bank has an ongoing lending relationship with BOTAŞ. The
dialogue on the amendment will continue with the Government, BOTAŞ, and other concerned
agencies.

28.    In October 2011, Turkey and Azerbaijan and their respective gas companies
BOTAŞ and SOCAR signed agreements for Turkey to purchase six billion cubic meters
(bcm) of gas annually and to transit another 10 bcm to Europe. BOTAŞ is a member of the
consortium that plans to build the Nabucco gas pipeline from Turkey through Bulgaria, Romania
and Hungary to Austria, for which the concerned countries including Turkey signed an Inter-
Governmental Agreement in July 2009. Turkey’s Parliament ratified the agreement in March
2010. Turkey also supports Gazprom’s proposed SouthStream gas pipeline from Russia to South
East Europe.

      Energy Efficiency

29.     Energy efficiency is critical to Turkey’s energy security and a key component in
Turkey’s National Climate Change Strategy. Significant efficiency improvements and
emission cuts are feasible, subject to strong financial and implementation support. This is a
long-term vision and the large-scale utilization and full impact of these measures would be
realized progressively over time. The legal, regulatory/pricing and institutional set-up is now in
place as discussed below, including a comprehensive set of energy efficiency regulations issued
in 2008 (a PEDPL1 prior action) under the 2007 Energy Efficiency Law. The Government has
also taken measures to support specialized targeted credit lines, with the support of the Bank,
other IFIs and donors, and the Clean Technology Fund.

30.      The Energy Efficiency Law targets industrial facilities, building and services sectors, as
well as the power sector (generation, transmission and distribution networks). The Law has four
pillars: establish an administrative structure and tasks for delivering energy efficiency services
across sectors; promote training and awareness; implement penalties for misconduct; and provide
incentives to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use.

31.   Energy efficiency regulations were issued in 2008. The issuance of the regulations was
a PEDPL1 prior action. They cover:

            Supply side management including measures to improve efficiency in electricity
             generation, transmission and distribution;
            Increased energy efficiency in the public and transport sectors;

                                                83
                                                                                         Annex 3


            Support to businesses to augment ongoing energy efficiency efforts including
             implementation of voluntary measures;
            Training, research and development; and
            Energy performance in buildings.

32.    Household appliances, commercial and other end-use equipment are covered by the
European Union labeling and product information requirements; national regulations were
updated by the Ministry of Industry and Trade with effect from January 2008. Producers and
importers are required to include energy efficiency information in a separate section of related
operating manuals.

33.     An Energy Conservation Coordination Board has been established for the
coordination of energy efficiency policy and strategy. The General Directorate of Electrical
Power Resources Survey and Development Administration (EIE) has been integrated into the
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources as a new General Directorate. It will continue
working to establish a more systematic and coordinated system of energy efficiency data
collection and evaluation across sectors. It is also continue EIE’s program of providing capacity
building of energy efficiency professionals (managers and auditors) through training and
certification.

34.     In an effort to accelerate the realization of Turkey’s potential, the Government
approved a new Energy Efficiency Strategy in February 2012. A related new energy
efficiency regulation was issued in October 2011. The new Strategy sets an overall target as 20
percent for the reduction of Turkey’s energy intensity (energy consumption of energy per unit of
GDP) by the year 2023 from the year 2011 level. This is a realistic target but not an ambitious
objective, as Turkey’s economy is still relatively energy intensive. Turkey required 0.26 ton of
oil equivalent (toe) for every US$ 1,000 of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 0.18 in
2008. Turkey’s nominal GDP/unit of energy consumption is well below OECD Europe and the
United States (Table 4). The Strategy identifies the following main activities to improve
Turkey’s energy efficiency: (a) promote energy efficiency in the industries and services sectors;
(b) reduce energy demand of buildings; (c) promote energy efficient appliances and products; (d)
improve the efficiency of electricity generation, transmission and distribution; and (e) building
capacity, market and financing for energy efficiency products, investments and services.

35.     The law and the regulations, the 2009 electricity strategy and the new Energy
Efficiency Strategy, complemented by the pricing and bill collection measures discussed
above, provide a strong basis and incentives for improving the efficiency in the
consumption of energy. Market/commercial incentives for industries to invest in energy
efficiency and to improve their energy utilization have strengthened: (a) energy price
adjustments, resulting from international oil and gas price developments and the quarterly cost-
reflecting pricing mechanism introduced in 2008, provide strong price signals; and (b) slowdown
of the economy has shifted attention from capacity expansion to competitiveness and cost-
effectiveness, including in the use of energy.

36.      Energy Efficiency is a Long-term Challenge. Turkey’s energy efficiency agenda is
long term and its implementation has only recently started. The legal, regulatory/pricing and
institutional set-up is now in place as summarized above. Much remains to be implemented in

                                               84
                                                                                          Annex 3


the energy sector as well as elsewhere. If greater financial and related implementation support is
available, further emission cuts are feasible. Turkey would eventually need to accomplish more
to stop the growth of emissions and start reducing emissions back towards current levels. This is
a long-term vision and the large-scale utilization and full impact of these measures would be
realized only beyond 2020.

37.     Financial Support for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. Turkey is a
functioning market economy. Since 2002, domestic and external factors have allowed Turkey to
maintain fast, stable economic growth averaging nearly 7 percent in the period 2003-07. Given
the difficult global economic conditions in 2008-09, Turkey experienced a temporary slowdown
but returned to growth in the last quarter of 2009. In the Government’s fundamentally market-
oriented management of the economy, its renewable energy and energy efficiency objectives are
to be achieved primarily through market-based mechanisms, relying on market liberalization,
functioning electricity market, and cost-reflective pricing mechanism in regulated areas. As
discussed above, a comprehensive series of energy efficiency regulations has nevertheless been
issued to accelerate efficiency improvements across the economy. The Government has also
taken measures to support specialized targeted credit lines, first for renewable energy in 2004
and then extending its support to energy efficiency financing, including the support of the Clean
Technology Fund (CTF). Implementation progress has exceeded expectations and additional
Bank financing of US$500 million was approved in November 2011. Significant efficiency
improvements and emission cuts are feasible, subject to strong financial and implementation
support. This is a long-term vision and the large-scale utilization and full impact of these
measures would be realized progressively over time.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Turkey

On November 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.

Background


The Turkish economy continued to grow strongly through the first half of 2011, reaping the
benefits of institutional reforms and revamped policy frameworks implemented in the
previous decade. However, growth became increasingly fueled by domestic demand and
imports. This was supported by strong credit growth, reflecting an appreciated currency
combined with low interest rates and a surge in short-term capital inflows. The current
account deficit widened sharply to near 10 percent of GDP. Inflation is rising quickly,
reflecting pass-through from a large nominal depreciation since late 2010, numerous tax
and regulated-price increases, and underpinned by tight domestic supply conditions, and is
forecast to reach 9½ percent at end 2011, well above the point target of 5½ percent.

The externally-financed demand boom has weakened Turkey’s resilience in some areas.
Capital inflows are dominated by potentially-volatile financing, and short-term external
debt has climbed sharply. With banks absorbing much of these inflows, an external funding
shortfall will slow down credit. Nonfinancial corporates’ net FX liabilities increased
substantially, exposing them to currency depreciation. While the headline fiscal balance
continues to improve and the public debt-to-GDP ratio is declining, fiscal performance has
been supported by benign economic conditions at home and abroad.

Policy responses were insufficient to prevent the development of a large current account
deficit and high inflation. Monetary policy shifted to an unconventional mix of reserve
requirements, the interest rate corridor, and the policy rate, which has not demonstrated it
can deliver price- or financial–stability. Numerous prudential measures aimed at slowing
credit growth and building buffers were introduced but, from a macroprudential
perspective, were sometimes delayed. The primary balance of the nonfinancial public
sector continued to improve, largely reflecting buoyant—but transient—tax revenue from
the boom in output and imports and proceeds from a tax restructuring scheme, which
masked a relaxed fiscal stance.

Growth is expected to slow sharply to 2 percent in 2012 due to weaker capital inflows,
reflecting in part concerns about Turkey’s large current account deficit. More limited
foreign financing would constrain the current account deficit to about 8 percent of GDP and
compresses imports. In line with Turkey’s previous capital flow-driven corrections, with
fewer imports of key raw materials and intermediates, GDP growth is forecast to be sharply

                                            86
                                                                                           Annex 4


scaled down. Inflation is projected to decline to a still-elevated 6½ percent, eroding
external competitiveness.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Turkish authorities for their agile economic
management during the global crisis, which, together with structural reforms undertaken
earlier, had contributed to a rapid recovery. Going forward, Directors urged the authorities
to rebalance the policy mix to ensure a soft landing, in view of volatile capital flows, a
widening current account deficit, and an externally financed credit boom. Tightening the
structural fiscal position and gearing macroprudential policies to preventing systemic risk
would allow monetary policy to focus on price stability, helping to preserve the credibility
of the inflation-targeting framework and strengthen Turkey’s resilience to changes in global
liquidity conditions. It will also be important to accelerate structural reforms to reverse
eroding competitiveness and improve the business climate, facilitating current account
adjustment.

Directors welcomed the decline in public debt and the fiscal deficit. They encouraged the
authorities to tighten fiscal policy, with a view to stemming domestic demand, supporting
disinflation, while also providing a fiscal buffer in the event capital flows reverse. Directors
recommended front loading the adjustment as much as feasible, and establishing fiscal
targets in structural terms. They emphasized in particular the need to restrain current
spending, expand the tax base to ensure sustainable revenues, and strengthen the oversight
of public-private partnerships.

Directors acknowledged the difficult environment under which monetary policy operates.
With a tighter fiscal stance and appropriate macroprudential policies in place, they saw
scope for cautiously raising the single policy interest rate, taking into consideration the
possible impact on economic growth and capital flows. Directors recommended moving
toward a more transparent and consistent monetary policy framework to re-anchor inflation
expectations and avoid excessively rapid disintermediation. Narrowing the inflation
tolerance band and gradually lowering the inflation target will help moderate the impact of
future capital flow cycles.

Directors noted the strong performance of the banking sector, but encouraged further
efforts to address weaknesses in the financial sector, in particular its vulnerability to an
external funding shock and possible deleveraging by banks in the region. They urged
caution in implementing near-term measures to bolster banks’ resilience so as to avoid a
sharp drop in credit. Timely detection and response to future emerging systemic risk is
crucial, along with further strengthening of financial sector oversight and regulation, as
recommended in the Financial Sector Stability Assessment. Directors saw an important role
for the recently established Financial Stability Committee in this regard. They underscored
the importance of Turkey bringing its Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism legislation into line with international standards.

Directors endorsed labor and product market reforms to enhance competitiveness and social
equity. They recommended measures to enhance labor market flexibility, tailor training to

                                              87

employers’ skill needs, and better align employment costs—including the minimum
wage—with regional peers. Timely adjustment of regulated energy prices to movements in
the domestic cost of imports would help lower Turkey’s energy trade deficit.

                          ANNEX 5: POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS

     I.      Overview

1.     Turkey has applied a national system of residential electricity tariffs, with a small
discount for priority provinces. Despite increasing fuel costs, electricity tariffs remained constant
during 2002-07, with an average residential retail tariff around 0.120 TL/kWh. In 2008, a cost-
based pricing mechanism was approved to ensure automatic price adjustment to cover future
increases in the costs incurred by the electricity sector on a quarterly basis. As a result, three
substantial tariff increases were implemented in January, July and October 2008, raising the
average retail tariff by about 15, 24 and 9 percent, respectively. Electricity tariff was further
increased by another 10 percent in nominal terms in October 2009.

2.       The pricing reform is one of the key measures of the electricity market reform and
restructuring launched in Turkey in 2001. A cost-based pricing mechanism is considered
essential for encouraging more efficient consumption, improving private investment, and
strengthening the financial position of the state owned electric utilities. However, significant
tariff increases, especially when they coincided with the economic crisis, clearly carries the risk
of increasing economic stress, particularly for poor households.

3.      The purpose of this annex is to present a partial equilibrium analysis of the poverty and
welfare impact of raising electricity tariffs during 2008-09 on households in Turkey.23
Expenditures on electricity have been a moderate component of the total budget of the Turkish
households; they represented 2.9 percent of the household’s disposable income in 2007 and
increased to 3.5 and 4.0 percent after the significant price increase in 2008 and 2009. Although
the impact of tariff increase on electricity affordability for households and consumer welfare
overall has been limited, low-income households have experienced a more significant welfare
loss than higher-income households. The hardships of the poor were particularly acute in 2009,
but were mainly attributable to income reduction than rising electricity charges.

4.      Continued monitoring efforts on electricity consumers will help track the impact of
electricity pricing and privatization reforms and make informed decisions on whether additional
efforts to protect the poor and vulnerable population are needed. Thus ensuring the effective
implementation of reforms over time and ensuring their long-term sustainability.

5.     The remainder of this annex is structured as follows. Section II introduces data and
methodology. Section III reviews expenditure patterns and consumption levels and discusses the
poverty impact of raising tariffs, particularly on the poor. Section IV estimates a residential
demand function for electricity and considers the welfare effects of the pricing reform. Section
V addresses the coverage of and targeting performance of existing social assistance programs in
Turkey.

   The impact of electricity tariff increases on the prices of other commodities is not considered. It should also be
noted that although electricity reform may result in price increases, it also provides opportunities that would not
otherwise exist to improve quality and reliability, and to re-direct public resources more transparently to the poor.
Analyzing the broader impact of electricity pricing reform is beyond the scope of the note.

II. Data and Methodology

6.     To estimate the potential welfare impact of electricity tariff increases on the poor, both
descriptive and inferential analyses are presented based on the Turkish Household Budget
Survey (HBS) data from 2003 through 2009. An explanation of HBS survey methodology is
included at the end of the Annex.

7.       For descriptive analysis, the share of electricity expenditure in household budgets is used
to measure the economic burden of electricity expenditure on households. The budget share of
electricity is described as both the percent of household disposable income and as the percent of
total household expenditure. To measure the impact of rising tariffs, 2008 and 2009 electricity
budget shares are benchmarked against the shares in years preceding the tariff increase and
against those in other European and Central Asia countries. It is also compared with the
benchmark electricity affordability levels and electricity consumption poverty lines suggested in
the literature (Silva et al. [2008], Bagdadioglu et al. [2009]). In addition, a Lorenz curve analysis
is conducted to analyze the gap of electricity consumption between the poor and the non-poor.
Finally, household electricity consumption patterns are compared across regions and between
rural and urban areas.

8.      For inferential analyses, a short-run household electricity demand function is estimated
based on two different samples, the HBS data in 2008 and the combined HBS sample in 2008
and 2009, which yield conforming results. Furthermore, the 2008 model performed satisfactorily
when applied to out-of-sample forecast of 2009 electricity consumption. In the demand model,
electricity consumption depends on the tariff, household disposable income, the household’s
access to alternative energy sources (natural gas, central heating), the season, the utilized area of
the dwelling, the household’s stock of electronic appliances (air conditioner, refrigerator,
computer, mobile phones, and so on), household size and other household characteristics. The
model assumes different price elasticities for different income quintiles to capture the difference
in households’ capability to adjust consumption in response to price change. The estimated price
and income elasticities are then used to estimate the welfare effect of raising tariffs for different
income groups. The consumer surplus change is used to approximate the change in welfare.

III. Electricity Expenditure Pattern and the Poverty Implications of Tariff Increase

9.    The budget share of electricity is inversely related to income. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate
household electricity expenditure as a share of household disposable income and total
expenditure across per-capita income quintiles from 2003 to 2009.

10.     Prior to the tariff increases, Turkish households on average spent 3.5 percent of
disposable income, or 3.7 percent of total expenditure on electricity during 2003-07. These
shares declined over the period, with the share of electricity in household disposable income
falling from 4.4 to 2.9 percent and the share of electricity in total expenditures falling from 4.7 to
3.1 percent. Shares of electricity expenditures in disposable income and total expenditures were
greater for households in the lowest quintile, on average 6.7 percent and 5.2 percent,
respectively.

increased for all income groups, but was still close to (the bottom quintile) or lower (the other

four quintiles) than 2003 levels (Figures 1 and 2). For the poorest quintile, however, the share of
electricity in household disposable income and total expenditure increased from 5.4 percent to
6.3 percent and from 4.5 to 4.7 percent respectively between 2007 and 2008. The share of
electricity expenditures in household total expenditures (excluding expenditures on health,
durables and rents) in Turkey in 2008 was the eighth lowest among the European and Central
Asian (ECA) countries (Figure 3).

12.     The share of electricity expenditures in disposable income is significantly higher
after the most significant price increase in August 2008 than before August. This difference
is significant at the 1% level for the bottom 4 income groups (0-80%) (Table 1). The difference
between the two groups of the top quintile is not statistically significant. The change in the share
of electricity in total expenditures is less conspicuous and is significant only for the bottom
income quintile. In addition, the difference in electricity shares of the two groups decreases as
income increases. Similar tests were conducted on HBS data from 2003 to 2007 to investigate
the possibility of seasonal factors driving these patterns. No difference was observed between
before August and after August consumption in other years.

13.      The above observation indicates that the poor may have experienced higher increase in
financial burdens due to electricity price increase and income decrease caused by the financial
crisis. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the impact, even for the bottom quintile, seem to be limited
- the share of electricity expenditures in household income and expenditure of the poorest group
increased by 1.8, and 0.6 percentage points, respectively, after August 2008.

14.     In the backdrop of economic crisis in 2009, household budget share of electricity
expenses continued climbing from 2008, with the poorest experienced the highest jump. On
average, electricity expenditure shares were still below 2003 levels. However, for the bottom
quintile, the share of electricity in household disposable income increased to 8.5 percent in 2009,
compared with 7.8 percent in 2003. On the other side, the share of electricity in total expenditure
of the poorest group was still below 2003 level - 6.0 percent in 2009 vs. 6.2 percent in 2003.

15.     Negative income shocks during the economic crisis (particularly in 2009) may
potentially compound the impact of rising tariffs. A crisis impact survey fielded in five urban
areas by the World Bank, UNICEF and the Turkish think-tank TEPAV suggested the economic
crisis was transmitted to households through reduced labor incomes, which disproportionately
affected the poor; the poorest 20 percent suffer an average per capita income loss of about 22.8
percent between May 2009 and December 2009, compared with 21.6 percent for the entire
population. The HBS data also suggest that the poorest population had suffered the largest
income decline in 2009 from a year earlier (Table 3).

16.     More detailed examination reveals that the spike in electricity budget share in 2009
was more likely attributable to income shocks than to price increases. Table 2 compares the
budget share of electricity expenditure of households surveyed before and after October 2009,
during which month the only major tariff increase of the year was implemented. The share of
electricity increased by merely 0.17 percentage points in total household expenditure for the
bottom quintile, and by 0.2 percentage points in income for the general population from before
October. No statistically significant difference was observed in other comparisons. These results

suggest that substantial budget share increases was not coincided with tariff increases and may
have occurred through income reduction during the early period of the year.

17.     Arrears or disconnections might not have increased after major tariff increases in
2008 and 2009 when compared within the same year. Although the electricity tariff was
further increased by 24 and 9 percent after August in 2008, and by 10 percent after October in
2009, the ratio of households who did not report electricity consumption is similar across the two
groups for within year comparison, suggesting that arrears might not have increased after price
increases.24 However, across-year comparison shows that the ratio of missing data on electricity
expenditure increased from 19 percent in 2008 to 24 percent in 2009, again, plausibly reflecting
the fixed-year impact of the economic crisis.

18.     The average household electricity expenditure was well below the benchmark
affordability level of 10 percent of the household income or total expenditure in 2008 and
2009 (Silva et al. [2008], Reynaud [2007], Lee, [2007]). However, these numbers were on an
increasing trend for the poorest households over the two years, with electricity share in
disposable income surpassed the 10-percent threshold for the first time in December 2009. In
addition, the proportion of households who reported spending more than 10-percent of budget
share on electricity rose to 6.1 percent in 2009 from 4.4 percent in 2008. Figure 4 compares the

24
  An UNDP study (Bagdadlioglu etc. 2009) suggests that missing data were likely due to (i) arrears or illegal
connections, or (ii) households’ limited usage of electricity during the survey month. Detailed discussion on
missing data is provided in paragraph 17.

19.     Average electricity consumption in Turkey is well above the basic minimum needs
(Table 3). In 2008, 3.6 percent of the population fell below the electricity poverty line of 1,200
kWh of annual consumption, compared with 3.2 percent in 2007. However, electricity poverty
rate jumped to 7.1 percent in 2009, almost doubled from 2008. Average electricity consumption
of the top four income groups in 2009 slightly declined compare with 2008. On the other hand,
no statistically significant reduction in mean households electricity consumption was observed
for the bottom quintile, suggesting inelastic price and income demand of the poorest households
(Table 3).

Observations
Sources: Calculation based on HBS 2008 and 2009
Note: Standard deviations are in brackets. Income data are not comparable across year without
inflation adjustment. *** indicates the difference in electricity consumption between 2008 and
2009 of the income group is statistically significant at 1% level. ** indicates the difference in
electricity consumption between 2008 and 2009 of the income group is statistically significant at
5% level.

20.    The electricity consumption gap between rich and poor households was less than the
income gap, but had been slightly widened since 2007. The Lorenz curve plots the cumulative
share of electricity consumption against the cumulative share of households (ranked by income).
The further the Lorenz curve lies below the 45 degree line, the line of perfect equality, the more
unequal is the distribution of consumption and income. Figure 4 indicates that the electricity
consumption and income were skewed towards the non-poor, however, electricity consumption
gap only slightly increased from 2007 to 2008 and 2009, while the electricity consumption gap
between the poor and non-poor was lower than the income gap in all years.

21.     Poorer households were more likely not to report electricity expenditures. The above
results are conditional on the households reporting positive expenditures on electricity. However,
in 2007, around 20 percent of the households who participated in the HBS did not report any
expenditure on electricity in the past month. The percentage of households who did not report
electricity expenditure increases as per capita income decreases, with 38 percent of the
households in the lowest quintile and 8 percent of the households in the top quintile having non-
positive expenditures. Similar missing-data patterns were also observed in 2003 (Bagdadiogl etc.
2009), 2008 (Table 1) and 2009 (Table 2). A series of test reveals that households who did not
report electricity expenditure were systematically different from other households in the bottom
quintile: they had lower per capita income and lower per capita total expenditure. Figure 5
depicts the distribution of per capita disposal income and total expenditure for households who
did not report electricity expenditures vs. those who reported. As illustrated by the Graph and in
more details in Table 4, households who had positive electricity expenditures had higher income
and total expenditure at all points of the distribution.

22.    Independent of income level, heads of households who did not report electricity
expenditures are significantly less educated. Controlling for income and education, households
with non-positive electricity expenditure are significantly more likely to live in rural areas; the
heads of households are significantly more likely to be out of job during the survey month,
without health insurance, with more children, and to be female. Table 5 shows the correlation
between the non-reporting behavior and characteristics measuring vulnerability of the poorest
households.

Note: *** indicates significant at 1% level. ** indicates significant at 5% level. The value of households
characteristics are Rural Location: 1 = rural, 2= urban. Having a job (during the survey month): 1 = Yes 2
= No; Having Health Insurance: 0 = No, 1= Yes. Education: lowest value corresponding to illiteracy and
highest value corresponding to with a master and doctorate degree. Gender 1 = Male 2 = Female.

23.     A UNDP field study on four provinces (Istanbul in both sides of the Bosporus, Cankiri,
Kars and Urfa) (Bagdadiogl etc. 2009) suggests the following reasons for households’ not
reporting electricity expenditure: (i) households did not pay electricity bills during the survey
month due to arrears or illegal connections, and (ii) households had only minimal consumption
of electricity. If explanation (i) is generalizable, it means that the poorer and more vulnerable
would face a higher effective tariff and would consume proportionally less than they did if
proper payments were fully collected. If explanation (ii) is more generalizable, it means that
the proportion of households not meeting the basic consumption needs (paragraph 18) was
underestimated.

24.     However, electricity expenditures might still be affordable for those households who
did not report electricity consumption. Assuming consumption level is the same across the
groups with positive and non-positive expenditures within the same income quintile, the share of
electricity expenditure would be around 6.2 percent of income or 5.1 percent of total expenditure
of the poorest households with missing expenditure data in 2008, and 8.1 percent of income or
6.2 percent of total expenditure in 2009.

25.    The economic burden of electricity consumption varies among regions. For regional
comparison, a combined dataset containing HBS 2007, 2008 and 2009 was obtained from the
Turkish Statistic Institute.25 Two regional identifiers are included in the dataset to categorize the


25
  Regional identification is only available at the 3-year combined dataset level. In the combined dataset,
expenditure values in 2007 and 2008 were inflated to 2009 prices on a monthly basis.

location of sample households into two regional levels – 12 level-1 regions and 26 level-2 sub-
regions. Details of the classification of level 1 and 2 regional units are at the end of the Annex.

26.     Table 6 summarizes the household disposable income and electricity consumption pattern
on level-1 region level. In Istanbul (TR1) where households had the nation’s highest disposable
income, the budget share of electricity was also the lowest, on average 2.6 percent of total
household expenditure during 2007-09. Doğu Karadeniz (TR9) region had the highest electricity
to total household expenditure ratio – 5.3 percent on average. Following the same pattern,
electricity poverty rate ranges between 5.7 percent in Doğu Karadeniz to 0.9 percent in Istanbul.

27.      Regional difference is even more striking when comparing the percentage of
households who did not report electricity expenses. Almost half of the population in
Güneydoğu Anadolu (including Gaziantep, Adıyaman, Kilis, Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Mardin,
Batman, Şırnak, Siirt) did not report any electricity spending, compared with 0.9 percent in
Istanbul. If missing electricity consumption data is indeed related to arrear or illegal connection
as discussed in paragraph 23, cost recovery in the form of improving collections and increasing
tariffs will significantly affect some regions more than the others.

28.     Within the same region, electricity budget share differs between rural and urban
households. The left panel of Figure 6 shows the distribution of electricity budget share across
12 level-1 regions. The cap of each spike indicates average electricity budget share of rural
(upper cap) and urban (lower cap) households in each region. Therefore, the height of a spike
corresponds to the difference in the ratio of electricity spending in household budget between
rural and urban areas. In all regions, rural households had spent a larger share of total
expenditure on electricity than urban households. The urban-rural gap was the widest in Batı
Anadolu (TR5) and Ortadoğu Anadolu (TRB), where the budget share of rural households was
almost twice that of urban households over 2007-09.

29.     There is large poor and non-poor gap in electricity budget share within each sub-
region. The right panel of Figure 5 shows the value of electricity budget share of households in
the bottom (upper cap) and top (lower cap) income quintile in 26 sub-regions. 26 In general,
households at the bottom of the income distribution spent larger share of income on electricity
than the top income quintile. For example, the poorest households in Malatya, Elazığ, Bingöl,
Tunceli(TRB1) and Samsun, Tokat, Çorum, Amasya (TR83), spent between 7.0 to 7.5 percent of
total expenditure on electricity, compared with 2.2 percent of the most well-off households in the
same sub-region. Overall, poor households in rural areas spend the largest share of income
on electricity and are most venerable to rising tariffs.




26
  The only exception is seen in Mardin, Batman, Şırnak, and Siirt, where poor households spent 4.8 percent of total
expenditure on electricity, compared with 6.2 percent of the rich households. However, this sub-region also had the
highest percentage of households who did not respond to inquiries about electricity expenditure.

IV. Residential Electricity Demand and Welfare Implications of Pricing Reform

30.     The poor were less flexible in adjusting electricity consumption in response to price
increases than the non-poor. The 2008 HBS data, and the 2008 and 2009 pooled data were
used, respectively, to estimate household electricity demand functions using multivariate
regression techniques.27 (Refer to Zhang [2011] for details of estimating the conditional demand
model). The model revealed strong differences in the price elasticity of demand across income
groups,28 with the poor having lower price elasticity of demand for electricity than the non-poor.
27
   There is insufficient variation in electricity prices in 2009 to explore price demand elasticities based solely on
2009 HBS data.
28
   Alternative specification considering heterogeneous income elasticities by income quintiles did not reveal
significant difference in income elasticieis of different income groups.

                                                                                                                                          103
                                                                                                       Annex 5


A possible explanation is that the poor are more likely to be close to their minimum electricity
consumption level and have fewer options for switching to other types of fuel.

31.     Analysis of alternative sample data produces stable estimates of demand function.
Table 6 summarizes and compares the various estimators of demand determinants obtained by
estimating the model using 2008 data and 2008 and 2009 combined data (coefficients of the log
of electricity tariff are in the first two columns of Table 8). The comparison suggests that the
demand estimators as a group enjoy strong conformity.

32.     Out-of-sample forecast suggests that the estimates are also reliable. The demand
model from 2008 data is applied to out-of-sample forecasts of electricity consumption in 2009.
To evaluate the prediction performance, the root mean square error (RMSEs)29 is calculated for
the resulting prediction. For comparison, the regression RMSE on 2008 data is 0.515. The RMSE
of the 2009 forecast is 0.548, indicating a fairly good fit of 2008 model to 2009 data.

33.     Regression residual analysis further confirms disparate price elasticities of the poor
and rich households. Figure 7 is the month-to-month changes of electricity consumption (%) of
the bottom and top income quintiles in 2008. They are residual values from estimating demand
functions excluding the electricity tariff level and the month. As shown in Figure 7, the
percentage change in electricity consumption of the top income quintile was in general much
larger than that of the bottom income group, especially during the months of August, October
and November.

34.      As discussed in paragraph 21 poorer households were more likely to have non-positive
electricity expenditures, suggesting that the sample selected in the above analysis is not random.
The Heckman selection model is used to test for the selection bias. The Heckman selection
model yield nearly identical results as those presented in Table 7. Furthermore, both Wald and
likelihood ratio tests suggest that the unobserved variables influencing the reporting decision are
statistically independent of unobserved factors of the electricity demand. Therefore, sample
selection can be ignored conditional on observable household characteristics (See Zhang[2011]
for details).

35.     Based on the above regression results, all else equal, a 10 percent increase in income will
cause electricity consumption to increase by 1.04–1.07 percent. A 10 percent increase in
electricity tariff will cause an average household in the bottom income quintile to reduce
electricity consumption by 1.83–1.69 percent, and an average household in the top income
quintile to reduce electricity consumption by 5.38-3.87 percent. These estimates of income and
price elasticities are in the range of elasticities suggested in the literature (World Bank, 2004).
However, it should be noted that because of the missing data issue discussed in paragraph 16, the
estimated income elasticity and price elasticities of the poorer households are likely to be biased.
Specifically, the price elasticities are likely to be underestimated.

36.     Low-income households experienced a greater welfare loss than higher-income
households. Based on price elasticities estimated from 2008 sample, the welfare loss from the
price increases in 2008, approximated by consumer surplus change, is estimated to be 164 TL for
an average bottom income quintile household, or 2.16 percent of household disposable income,
compared with 330 TL, or 0.75 percent of disposable income for the top quintile. Based on
results using the pooled sample, in 2009, the welfare loss of households given an accumulative
10 percent price increase is 42 TL for an average bottom quintile households, or 0.55 percent of
household disposable income, and 82 TL for an average top quintile household, or 0.17 percent
of the household disposable income. Table 8 summarizes the estimated welfare loss across
income groups. It is to be noted that consumer surplus change is greater than financial loss,
because it also captures the welfare loss from reduced consumption.

37.     The expected welfare impact of future electricity tariff adjustments is low.
Significant changes in electricity prices are not expected, due to a number of reasons: (1) the
prices for natural gas – the dominant generation fuel and the main determinant of electricity
prices - are projected to remain flat throughout this decade (WB projection, Figure 8); (2)
electricity prices under the BOT and BOO contracts signed in the 1990s were frontloaded and
will be declining throughout this decade; (3) generation privatizations may include multi-year
electricity sale agreements under which the bulk of the electricity generated will initially be
purchased by TETAŞ and the distribution companies. Move to fully market-based pricing and
sales to the electricity market PMUM will take place progressively over time as the volume
under the electricity sales agreements declines. This approach is designed to facilitate a smooth

transition from EUAŞ to market. In addition, the welfare cost of future price increases would be
further reduced in the long term as households are more flexible in adjusting their consumption
patterns and taking advantage of energy saving opportunities including more efficient lighting
and appliances.

V.   Social Assistance Programs in Turkey

38.     To mitigate the potential welfare impact of pricing reform, the Government is relying on
general social assistance programs, rather than sector-specific measures. This section evaluates
the coverage and targeting performance of existing social assistance programs, especially their
effects on the poor, and those that are most vulnerable to future tariff increases and improved
collection.

39.     There are four major social assistance programs in Turkey: old-age/disability benefits,
conditional cash transfer, family and children’s benefits, and the Green Card program. The Green
Card program, which covers medical expenses of the poor who are not registered with social
security institutions, is the largest social assistance program, accounting for about 85 percent of
the social assistance budget. (Aran and Hentschel, 2008).

40.    The Green Card Program is effective at reaching the vulnerable. Figure 5 shows the
share of households in different income segment that benefit from the Green Card Program.
Figure 5 also compares the coverage among households who reported electricity expenditure vs.
those who did not. About 75 percent households in the bottom 40 percent income distribution
receive Green Card during 2008-09. Furthermore, households who did not have positive

                                                                                                                   Annex 5


electricity expenditures are consistently better covered across all income quintiles. As discussed
in paragraphs 21-23, non-reporting households are likely to be more vulnerable to the tariff
reform.

41.     Social assistance transfers benefit the poor and vulnerable more than the non-poor.
Figure 10 illustrates the percentage of households receiving income transfer under other social
assistance programs. The size of the bubble is proportional to the share of social assistance
transfer in household disposable income. Calculation suggests that the social transfers are being
allocated progressively – the poorer received higher social benefits in absolute terms and with
higher coverage. Additionally, the more vulnerable group, plotted on the left side of Figure 10,
have higher percentage of beneficiaries and higher level of benefits than their peers in the same
income group who reported electricity expenditure.

Data Description

The 2008 HBS was conducted on a total of monthly 720 and annually 8640 sample households
for a year period between 1 January – 31 December 2008. The survey followed different sample
households alternately each month. That is, information about consumption expenditures and
income of the first 720 households were collected in January. In February, the survey was carried
out on a different set of 720 households. This rotation continued until the end of December and
totally 8640 households were interviewed. The 2009 HBS followed the same methodology but
the size of the survey was expanded to contain monthly 1050 and annually 12600 sample
households.
