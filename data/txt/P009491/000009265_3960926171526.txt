MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A RURAL ROADS AhD MARKETS IMfROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 45.0 million (US$62.3
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help finance the
Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project (RRMIMP). The
proposed credit would have two parts: (a) US$43.3 million equivalent to
finance rural infrastructures and (b) US$18.5 million equivalent to finance
flood rehabilitation works. Grant cofinancing for the rural infrastructure
would be provided by (a) Swiss Development Cooperation for all technical
*       assisLance and training (13.9 million Swiss Francs, US$8.65 million equiv-
alent) and (b) the Federal Republic of Germany through the Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau (DM 25.5 million, US$14.2 million equivalent).
2.      Background.  Agriculture accounts for over one half of Bangladesh's
GDP, employment and exports. Rural development, encompassing agricultural
and non-agricultural activities, remains a key development priority. Lack of
transport access is a mrajor development constraint in many parts of the
country. Studies have shown that with better access, otherwise similar
villages tend to have higher agricultural productivity, greater crop variety,
higher incomes, more non-farm employment, and even greater adoption of family
planning. Most rural roads are earth roads, are impassable during the wet
seasons, and even in the dry seasons involve higher transport charges than
paved roads. Access problems are exacerbated by floods.
3.      The 1987 floods caused unusually heavy damage to crops, property,
livestock and infrastructure. Significant causes of damage to roads were
inadequate drainage, poor design of bridges and culverts, poor execution of
works (including inadequate compaction of embarkments, low quality
materials), and lack of maintenance. In response to the Government's appeal
to the international donor community for assistance, IDA is providing assis-
tance through: (a) reallocation of the proceeds of credits for ongoing
projects for rehabilitation in the primary education, population and health,
and power sectors; (b) rehabilitation of priority works in five subsectors
(flood control, drainage and irrigation; main roads; local roads; primary
education; and inland water transport) started during the 1987/88 construc-
tion season under the Second Flood Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1876-BD,
*       approved by the Board on February 9, 1988); and (c) inclusion in other
IDA-supported projects, including the proposed Rural Roads and Markets
Improvement and Maintenance Project, of rehabilitation of additional works to
*       be undertaken in the 1988/89 and 1989/90 construction seasons.  IDA is
assisting with repair of flood-damaged roads west of the Jamuna River, while
the Asian Development Bank is financing repairs east of the Jamuna.
4.      In the longer term, the Government aims to stimulate rural growth
through its Strategy for Rural Dokelopment, which comprises area-based
projects containing one or more of: (a) rural infrastructures, (b) m;nor
irrigation, drainage and flood control, and (c) production and employment
components. The rural infrastructures consist of upgrading feeder and rural
roads and improving facilities in the 1,400 growth center markets where
farmers sell their produce, purchase inputs, and gain access to private and
Government services. The Government's strategy for rural development is



-2-
reinforced by the decentralization policy, under which the Government .n 1982
transferred to the sub-districts extensive responsibilities for a wide range
of functions, including most rural roads and rural markets as well as aspects
of agriculture, primary education, and health and family planning. Implemen-
tation of decentralization of responsibilities for rural roads has been
partial, with upgrading of some feeder roads assigned to the Roads and High-
ways Department (RHD), rather than the districts, or the subdistricts. Insuf-
ficient resources have been allocated to meet all planned road construction
targets, let alone maintenance needs. There is a tendency to substitute
aid-financed rehabilitation investments for regular maintenance. The Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Credit 1827-BD, FY87) will
rehabilitate about 660 km of roads in 16 districts of northwest Bangladesh to
the point at which they can again be aconomically maintained, and will
develop and implement a maintenance mwsterplan for RHD roads. IDA has sup-
ported improvements to rural roads and markets as minor components under two
rural development projects (Cr. 631-BD, PY76 and 1384-SD, FY83); these
operations have not, however, addressed the issues of construction standards,
finances, and maintenance of local roads.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project would support the Govern-
ment's and IDA's overall strategy to increase agricultural production and
rural incomes through improving access to remote rural areas. It would also
support non-agricultural manufacturing and service activities by formulating
plans and providing infrastructures in the growth centers. The project would
strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government to plan, finance,
execute and maintain rural roads with lower life cycle costs and better
surfaces, and to raise design standards which would reduce risks of future
flood damage. IDA's involvement would be a continuation of its past and
ongoing support to the roads subsecter.
6.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project would aim to:  (a) proLote
rural development through the improvement of rural roads and growth center
markets; (b) implement cost effective approaches to construction and main-
tenance of rural roads and markets; (c) improve resource mobilization in
support of maintenance; (d) strengthen the institutions concerned with rural
infrastructures; and (e) rehabilitate roads and associated structures damaged
by the 1987 floods.
7.      Project Description.  The project would include: (a) improvements,
upgrading and maintenance of 500 km of feeder roads in eight districts of
northwest Bangladesh; (b) construction of bridges and culverts on about 650
km of rural roads; (c) planning of, and improvement of infrastructures
(including roads and walkways, drainage, potable water supply, sales plat-
forms and sheds) in, 65 growth center markets; (d) a new Dhaka headquarters
building for the Local Government Engineering Bureau; (e) rehabilitation of
about 650 km of flood-damaged roads and about 27 km of related bridges,
drainage works, and retaining walls; and (f) project support, including (i)
consultancy services for design and supervision, monitoring, a rural tran-
sport study, formulating a financial plan to enable districts and sub-
districts to fulfill their maintenance responsibilities, and for a study to
prepare an action plan to reduce the extent of damage from future floods;
(ii) construction equipment and vehicles; (iii) offices, laboratories and



-3-
equipment sheds in eight district headquarters; (iv) incremental administra-
tive expenditures (salaries, operating expenses of project offices and equip-
ment) for project execution; and (v) training of Government and contractor
staff. Items (a) to (d) would be managed by a Project Implementation Office
(PIO) in the Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and would be executed by districts
and subdistricts, supported by the design and supervision consultants. The
flood repairs would be executed by the LCD and the RHD. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$98.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$23.9 million (24%). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbur-
sements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (Number 7101-BD) dated June ;, 1988 is
being distributed separe ly.
8.      Agreed Actions: w.onditions for effectiveness of the credit would be:
(a) fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
financing agreements with KfW and SDC; (b) approval of the Project Proforma
(local project document) by the Executive Committee of the National Economic
Council; (c) appointment of a senior economist in the PIO, and (d) employment
of design and supervision consultants. Other important agreements include:
(e) all subcomponents would be selected and designed according to criteria
agreed with the Association and the consultants would review all designs
before tenders were called; (f) implementation of market improvements and
structures on rural roads would be contingent on subdistr:cts contributing 7Z
of their costs; (g) rental charges on project contruction ..4uipment would
recover costs of acquisition and maintenance; (h) subdistricts would increase
user fees in improved markets; (i) the project would be executed in accord-
ance with an implementation schedule which would be updated annually by the
Government in agreement with the Association; (j) withdrawal applications
would be accompanied by certification from the supervision consultants that
the works were in conformity with specifications; and (k) there would be a
full mid-term review by June 30, 1991, by which time it is expected that a
first tranche of US$11 million would have been disbursed on rural infrastruc-
ture works. Disbursements of the remaining US$27 million on these items
would be contingent upon the Association's satisfaction that the Government
had adopted: (i) a feeder road maintenance system; (ii) a plan for financing
feeder road maintenance; (iii) a system for monitoring local Government road
and market activities; (iv) technical design standards and specifications for
feeder roads and structures on rural roads; and (v) a plan of action for the
period from July 1, 1991.
9.      Benefits.  The project would promote rural development through
improving access by farmers to markets for their production, and to inputs
and support services, as well as to non-farm employment in the rural areas.
The rate of return on the feeder roads component (with associated equipment
and overheads, azcounting for about 59% of project cost) is 25%.
10.     Risks.  The risk that the diverse project components would complicate
project execution has been addressed through separating management of the
rural infrastructure and flood rehabilitation components, and within the
latter, separating management of the LGD and RHD components. The risk that



-4-
institutional inertia would impede adoption of improved standards oZ con-
struction and maintenance would be addressed through making use of
appropriately experienced foreign es well as local design and supervision
consultants. The remaining uncertainties regarding optimal technical solu-
tions, institutional arrangements, and financial capacities of local govern-
ments would be managed through intensive monitoring and supervision, includ-
ing a formal mid-term review by June 30, 1991. The tranching of disburse-
ments would provide incentives for rapid implementation of institutional
arrangements, and an opportunity for timely discussions on restructuring,
should that be required.
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles Of Agreement of the Association and recommend its approval
by the Executive Directors.
