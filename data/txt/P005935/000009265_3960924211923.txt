PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for Argentina's Second
Railway Project for which Loan 1677-AR in the amount of US$96.0 million was
approved on March 26, 1979.. Upon cancellation of the undisbursed balance
of US$29.65 million, the loan was fully disbursed on December 31, 1985.
This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department IV, of the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report;
the Loan and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Baik memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached

ARGENTINA
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1677-AR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
The objective of the project -'as the strengthening of Argentine
Railways (FA) as an institution by making it reasonably independent of
Government financial support through the rationalization, redimensioning
and rehabilitation of the railway system. This objective was to be met
through the elimination of uneconomic lines, improvement of locomotive and
rolling stock availability, selective rehabilitation of track, signalling
and telecommunication works, provision of technical assistance, and related
studies to facilitate export of agricultural products which form a
substantial part of ,he railway's freight basiness (para 2.04).
Implementation Experience
In the momentum generated by the preparation (para 2.03) and
implementation of the project, FA closed 10,405 kms of uneconomic lines,
eliminated the losing suburban train services in cities other than Buenos
Aires, reduced staff by over 50,000 (154,000 in 1976 to 99,900 iu 1986),
strengthened and improved to some extent its maintenance practices, and
carried out several of the important studies aimed at defining the future
role of the railway. In particular, the Planning Study (para 3.0i) was
responsible for the training of FA staff in project evaluation and in
reviewing FA's investment needs. The studies for the Motive Power Rolling
Stock, Signalling and Telecommunication System helped formulate the policy
and essential investment needs in these areas (para 3.03). Also, one of
the consequences of the enforcement of the principles of International
Bidding utilized in Bank financed procurement was the introduction of the
discipline of international prices in the local industry in Argentina (para
3.08). Implementation of the Bank project resulted in renegotiation of
several contracts FA had entered into with suppliers of railway equipment,
either because the prices were excessive or the quantities on order and the
delivery schedules were inappropriate in the light of the requirements of
the project.
On the other hand, frequent changes in top management (five
presidents between 1979 and 1985), uncertain political conditions (five
changes of Government and the South Atlantic War) and Government
indecisiveness in respect of important matters like marketing, tariff
increases, uneconomic lines, etc. prevented the achievement of the traffic
and operational targets agreed upon during appraisal, and led to a
progressive deterioration in the financial condition of FA. The project
wa8 partially completed in 1984 instead of 1982 (Table 2), and project



- vii -
delays occurred due to the absence of a consistent managemint of FA, the
lack of adequate local funds and inordinate delays in sanctions and budget
approvals (para 3.06). Procurement action was excessively slow and time
consuming, and required an inordinate amount of time to supervise on the
part of the Bank missions (para 3.07i. Quite often, the Government's
attitude was biased to support local industries in procurement matters
(para 3.07), which complicated decisions even further. As the traffic
targets foreseen at appraisal were not achieved (paras    4.01 to 4.03),
most of the operating targets were not reached (Table 6), although the year
1983 saw the best staff productivity figures achieved by FA in several
years (Table 7).
Results
Financial performance deteriorated substantially from an operating1
ratio of 216 in 1979 to 296 in 1983.  In none of the project years reviewed
did FA meet appraisal targets (para 5.01). The principal reasons for the
failure to achieve the targets were: (a) freight traffic did not increase
as forecast (para 4.01); and (b) tariffs in real terms decreased at an
annual rate of 7% for freight and 12-15% for passenger as compared to a
forecast ircrease in real terms of about 3-5% per annum during appraisal.
Working expenses decreased, in real terms, at an annual rate of 12% per
annum via a vis the appraisal forecast of an annual decrease of 4.3%, but
this was not sufficient to offset the fa'lure to achieve the traffic
forecast or the increase in tariffs (para 5.02).
The reestimated economic rate of return upon completion of the
project is 18% as compared to 22% estimated at appraisal (para 7.04 and
Table 13).
Sustainability
The sustainability of the project's net benefits must be judged
uncertain, given the many problems and uncertainties FA is facing.
Findings
The principal conclusion to be drawn from this project is that
although the project under review had only a limited and partial success
due to a combination of reasons, the problems of Argentine Railways are
serious enough to claim the urgent attention of the Argentine Government
and the Bank in a sustained effort designed to cut the losses of Argentine
Railways, and to reorganize FA into a size and form better suited to the
economic needs of the country. The two overarching issues are: FA's
relationship with the Government and FA's internal management objectives.
An essential element of any recovery program therefore is the establishment
of a serious working relationship between FA and the Government in which
financial and operational targets would be set by the Government for FA on
the one hand, and on the other, the Government would support FA in its
program of trimming its size, the reorganization of its management,
increase of tariffs and the execution of the bare investment needs
essential for the revitalization of PA (para 9.02).



ARGENTINA
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1677-AR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
A. General
1.01     The transport sector plays a crucial role in the economic
development of Argentina because of the important and complex function it
has to fulfill, and also because of the sizable volume of the country's
resources used for that purpose. Transport demand is influenced by the
fact that in a large country like Argentina (2,767,000 sq km stretching
about 3,700 km N-S and 1.600 km E-W), the bulk of the population (about
30 million people) is concentrated in a few large cities, with the rest
dispeised in a number of small urban centers. About 70% of the country's
population is located within a 600 km radius of Buenos Aires, the capital
city of the country, and 852 of the GDP is generated within this radius.
The combination of concentration and dispersion imply long-distance hauls,
between supply and demand centers, of agricultural production, raw
materials, and manufactured products. Furthermore, many exports and
imports also require long transport to ports. As a result, the transport
system is large, with long average hauling distances, low traffic volume on
several links of the network, but big concentrations at major nodes such as
Buenos Aires, and to a lesser extent, Rosario and Cordoba. In addition,
the absence of natural deepwater harbors imposes further constraints on the
system.
1.02     The bulk of the freight generated by the economy consists of
agricultural products and other raw materials moving from the interior to
the lower Parana River and the Atlantic coast around Buenos Aires, and of
machinery and other production inputs, vehicles and manufactured consumer
goods moving in the opposite direction. Metropolitan Buenos Aires is the
focal point for transport in Argentina. In 1976, the year in which the
idea of this project was first conceived, the Government estimated that
rail transport held only 112 of the total ton-km with road transport (42!),
water (35Z) and pipelines (12X) responsible for the balance. Despite this
relatively minor position in the transport sector, railways have played an
important role in Argentina's economic development since the first railways
were built in the late 1800s. In 1946 the subsector was composed of some
12 private rail companies, 6 owned by the Government and 1 by the Province
of Buenos Aires.   In 1946 the Government purchased the 12 private lines,
combined them with the other 7 and established the Government-owned entity,
Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA). The resulting 44,000 km network was
organized into 6 systems, 4 broad gauge, 1 standard gauge and 1 narrow
gauge, with the largest component being the broad gauge system.
1.03     Because of poor planning, inadequate management, lack of
accountability, failure to recognize changing economic patterns and growth



-2-
of competing traffic modes, the new entity soon experienced increasingly
severe declines in traffic and financial position with attendant low
productivity and poor service.
1.04     In 1970, the Government, recognizing these shortcomings, adopted a
plan to redimension the railway and to concentrate on traffic which the
railway could carry more economically than other modes. The Bank assisted
in the financing of this plan with Loan 733-AR which became effective in
July 1971. FA and the Government, however, failed to take constructive
action in several of the critical areas; uneconomic line closures, workshop
consolidation, reduction of staff, and general failure to increase
operational efficiency. As a result, US$27.5 million of the US$84.0
million loan was cancelled in July 1974.
1.05     The situation continued to deteriorate through early 1976 despite
the Government's recognition of the need for subst:-ntial and early
corrective action. In mid-1976 the Minister of Economy, in the course of a
visit to the Bank, requested Bank assistance in a new effort to redimension
Ferrocarriles Argentinos. By this time important reductions had been made
in the size of the railway by closing uneconomic lines, curtailment of
intercity passenger services, and even substantial staff reductions, for
the first time in the history of the Argentine Railways. In view of these
encouraging signs on the part of the Government and FA, the Bank leaned
touards supporting a new lending operation for the railway, at the same
time recognizing that FA had started its improvement from a particularly
bad position and that a great deal remained to be done.
1.06     This Project Completion Report is based on information obtained
from files in the LAC Information Center, President's Report No. P-2489-AR,
Staff Appraisal Report No. 2155b-AR, Staff Supervision Reports and Working
Papers, and data sent by Argentine Railways together with a Final Report on
the Completion of the Project.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01     An Identification Mission visited Argentina in Auaxst 1976 in
response to a request made to the Bank by the Minister of Economy for
financial and technical support for the Government's plan to rationalize
and modernize Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA). Although the mission found
that some of the conditions which were to lead to the cancellation of the
First Railway Project (Loan 733-AR) still existed - frequent changes in top
management, increase in staff numbers, and shortage of government
supporting funds, there appeared to be sufficient favorable aspects to
warrant Bank support for a new railway project within the framework of a
set of Bank conditions to be agreed with FA.
2.02     Basic conditions for consideration of the dispatch of a further
mission were: (a) reasonable progress in providing spare parts for
locomotives; (b) reducing services on or closing uneconomic branch lines;
and (c) elimination of several high cost/low occupancy interurban passenger
trains. A Project Preparation Mission visited Argentina in December 1976
to assess the position, and found that favorable action was being taken on
these items, and although other critical areas still required attention,



-3-
the mission viewed favorably the prospects of Bank participation in the
revitalization of the railway. The mission recommended that the Bank act
as the executing agency for UNDP assistance in financing an outside team of
experts to review FA's development plan, and, subject to the approval of
this basic recommendation, proposed an action plan leading to appraisal in
November 1977 and Board presentation in July 1978. Consultants were
invited to submit pioposals to the Bank as Executing Agency, and after
review by a a BanklFA team, an Italian consultant was selected to review
FA's Development Plan and to make recommendations that would serve as the
basis for FA's investment and action plan. Contract negotiations were
concluded in May 1977 and the consultant began work on July 4, 1977.
2.03     Meanwhile, in May 1977 a further Bank preparation mission met with
FA officials to review progress on critical program elements. These
included the soare parts procurement program; rolling stock and motive
power scrapping proposals; reduction of intercity passenger trains;
uneconomic line studies; locomotives rehabilitation; staff reduction; and
improvements in FA's financial position. Based on this review and related
detailed discussions the first Project Brief was prepared on July 19, 1977.
Given the poor performance under the first railway project, and the
eagerness of the Argentina Government and FA for Bank financing of the
Second Railway Project, a significant element of the mission's strategy was
to get as much done (by way of staff reductions, line closures, etc.) as
possible during appraisall and before Board approval of the loan.
2.04     The Project Brief proposed as the objective of the proposed
project the strengthening of FA as an institution by making it reasonably
independent of Government financial support through the rationalization,
redimensioning and rehabilitation of the railway system. This objective
was to be met through the elimination of uneconomic lines, improvement of
locomotive and rolling stock availability, selective rehabilitation of
track, signalling and telecommunication works, provision of technical
assistance, and related studies to facilitate export of agricultural
products which form a substantial part of the railway's freight business.
A further Bank preparation mission visited Argentina in August 1977
primarily to review with the consultant and FA the progress being made on
the review of FA's development plan. The mission found that the consultant
team was making good progress in its work with the cooperation of FA. The
mission also determined that some progress was being made on improving FA's
overall status, but that differences of opinion continued to exist between
FA and the Sub-Secretariat of Transport on the proper approach to dealing
with some critical policy matters.
2.05     The Bank's comments on the consultant's draft report were
forwarded in mid-October, and in late October 1977 Bank representatives met
in Rome with the consultant and FA officials to review the report and the
comments of the Bank and the Government. Based on the discussions and
comments, the consultant prepared its final report which was submitted to
the Bank on December 1977. Thereafter the Bank appraisal mission was
1/ As a matter of fact, with exceptional effort on behalf of the then Sub-
Secretary for Transport, FA closed almost 9,000 km of uneconomic lines
and reduced staff strength by almost 35,000 during the period of
preparation of the project.



-4-
scheduled for January/February 1978. The appraisal mission found that,
although FA had made some progress in developing corrective measures in
problem areas, several problems remained and this made it incumbent on the
mission to recommend withholding of further appraisal processing pending
corrective action by the Government on the investment plan for the
railways, which provided inadequate funds for track rehabilitation and only
a bare minimum of wagon replacement. A dominant cause of this situation
was the Government's inefficient (and costly) procurement practices - in
particular the "Compre Argentino" Law - and indiscriminate recourse to
supplier's credits and bilateral credits as instruments of purchase, all of
which led to the payment of higher than international prices for important
items of railway equipment like rails, locomotives, wagons, etc. Another
cause for the appraisal mission's concern was the Government's emphasis on
and commitment to low priority investments for the railway. These concerns
were passed formally to the Government with suggestions for remedial actJlo.,
which might lead to a more balanced development plan which the Bank could
support.
2.06     As a result of the initial appraisal mission and the subsequent
correspondence with Government, FA's program was revised and in May 1978 a
second (or post) appraisal mission visited Argentina. Based on the revised
investment plan for the years 1979-1983 this mission recommended a loan of
US$85.0 million for a project comprising:
(a) items of the Investment Plan on which execution would begin in
1980;
(b) a Plan of Action with quantitative targets to improve the
operations and finances of FA; and
(c) a program of (i) technical assistance to FA for specific tasks
within the Plan of Action; and (ii) feasibility studies for
certain specific projects.
2.07      The Issues Paper of May 30, 1978, although giving general support
to the proposed loan, noted the need for further modifications in some of
the project items, and posed the following main issues:
(a) renegotiation of existing contracts for equipment which were
considered either excessively priced, poorly scheduled or for
inappropriate quantities;
(b) confirmation of the Government's commitment to the Investment
Plan, and the proposed annual investment limit of about
US$300 million in real terms, to ensure that shortfalls/over-
investments would not occur in the maintenarnce and rehabilitation
program; and
(c) clarification of Government's policy for indexing railway tariffs.
The paper recommended that all of the above be the subject of loan
covenants. The Decision meeting on June 7, 1978, supported the
recommendations of the Issues Paper. The Government was advised of the



-5-
Bank's position by lettar of July 10, 1978, which indicated that loan
negotiations would be subjact to f.he Goverrment providing information,
satisfactory to the Bank, on thes. matters.
2.08     The Yellow Cover AppraisaL Report was circulated on July 28, 1978
recommending an increase in the proposei loan from US$85 million to
US$96 million. Except for continued reservations by the Bank on the
questions of the electrification of the Roca Railway, the Government's
response to the issues raised earlier was considered satisfactory, and
particularly the Argentine Government's response to the reduction of
existing orders at excessive prices was very effective. The loan package
was submitted to the Loan Committee on October 27, 1978.  Loan negotiations
took place in Washington frow November 16 to 22, 19,8.  Several adjustments
in the loan documents *,ere agreed and a side ietter confirming the
Government's agreement to the Bank's positior. on tnie Roca railw4xy was
approved. Another Bank mission visited Argentina in February 1979 to
obtain clarification from the Government. The project was approved by the
Board on March 26, 1979. The Loan Agreement was signed in November 8, 1979
because of the delay in the Government's formal agreement over the
invesument plan and other conditions of the loan.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.01     Implementation of the project had a slow start, and supervision
missions in 1980 and 1981 noted that in addition to the delays in signing
of the loan agreement and in the loan becoming effei. ve, proc4rement
actions and disbursement from the loan were badly delayed. Up to the end
of 1981, about 18 months after loan effectiveness, there had been no
disbursements. By the end of FY82, US$21.8 million were disbursed and
thereafter US$24.8 million in FY83, US$5.5 million in FY84, and
US$5.1 million in FY85. At closure of the loan in June 1985, the Bank
agreed to continue disbursements for those items alreudy contracted. Final
disbursements were made in February 1986 and the remainder of the loan



-7-
US$29.65 million was cancelled. A comparison of the actual disbursements
with the disbursement schedule agreed at appraisal is given in Table 1.
Although the rete of disbursements bears no comparison with the appraisal
forecast, strangely enough it compares more favorably with *'-e standard
profile for Argentina which suggests, in retrospect, that the project
timing was rather over-optimistic, notwithstanding the various political
and economic problems that arose during the period of implementation of the
project.
3.02     The situation in regard to the completion of the various project
items however is somewhat. more positive, and is detailed, item by item, in
Table 2, which gives the actual completion dates as compared with the
appraisal forecast dates. Although some of the project items were reduced
in scope due to financial stringency, major items such as the procurement
of locomotives and shunters were accomplished in full and within the
stipulated time. The track renovation and improvements were completed to a
considerable extent, although with delays. The rail accesses to the silos
and the Mercado Central were completed in full. The wagon purchases and
modifications to wagons were partially done because traffic did not
increase as foreseen. Project completion date was extended up to
December 31, 1984 and the percentage of completion of each task by the
appraisal forecast date and up to this date is indicated in Table 2.
3.03     An important part of the project was the Technical Assistance and
the Studies. Part of this work was to be done by FA and pertains to the
development of the planning capability of FA and to a definition of the
investment needs. The other part which was related to the task of defining
the role of the railway was entrusted to the Government (Subsecretaria de
Transporte) and included studies for a master plan for the suburban
railway, review of the intercity passenger services and the uneconomic
lines. Most of the studies to be carried out by FA were done. Canadian
Pacific Consultants (CPC) won the contract for the Planning Study. The
team sent out to Argentina trained FA staff in project evaluation, did a
review, with FA staff, of many of the items on the investment program, and
also prepared for reference of FA staff a manual for project evaluation and
analysis of investments. The signal and telecommunications study was done
by Italconsult, and the Motive Power and Rolling Stock study by SOFRERAIL.
Reports of these studies were reviewed by Bank missions, and the final
reports contained useful analyses of FA's needs and provided important
guidelines for defining the future investments. However, they were
inadequately utilized for future use dae to several changes in the
management of FA, arising from frequent changes in the Government of
Argentina.
3.04     The Manpower Study was to define the requirements of staff by
department, and to review the training needs and salary structure of FA
staff, and was, after a series of discussions with Bank missions, entrusted
to FA instead of to outside consultants. This was agreed because of the
sensitive nature of the work and the Government's concern regarding the
explosive potential and the political overtones of the task of staff
reduction. The Bank has not received any report from FA on the completion
of this study. It is, however, known from the figures received from FA
that at least in as much as staff reductions are concerned, the strength of
the railway staff, after having been brought down from 156,000 in 1976 to



-8-
95,000 in 1981, gradually inched up to 107,800 in 1984, coming down to
99,000 in 1986. Currently FA has 95,000 employees which, although more
than 391 lower than the figure in 1976, is still substantially higher than
its real needs for a cost effective and efficient operation.
3.05     The performance in regard to the three studies2  to be conducted
by the Government (Subsecretaria de Transporte) is rather a mixed bag. A
limited study was done for suburban services, and the budget for the
suburban services was separated, at least for some time, as agreed in one
of the letters exchanged with the Government after the negotiations. No
Master Plan for the suburban services ever emerged and much of the
rationalization sought by the Bank never really materialized. The
Intercity Services were studied partly and services curtailed substantially
(para. 4.02). However, the study dealing with Unecononmic Lines was never
done by the Subsecretaria de Transporte, in spite of repeated reminders by
the Bank, and this was in fact one of the reasons for the cancellation of a
part of the Loan in 1985. Although no reasons were given by the Government
for this important act of omission, it is not difficult to imagine that the
closure of uneconomic lines (beyond the 10,405 kms already closed) was a
task that the Argentine Government did not relish, particularly in view of
the unsettled political conditions during the project period. The task of
redimensioning of the railway therefore remains substantially incomplete,
although major reductions in staff and services were done, as detailed
elsewhere in this report.
Proiect Costs
3.06     Analysis of project costs for Argentina is a difficult task not
only because of the high inflation rates, but also because the parity
between the Dollar and the Peso is rather unevenly maintained, with marked
fluctuations in certain years. As the original cost estimates at appraisal
were prepared in mid 1977 US dollars, an attempt has been made to reduce
all costs to constant 1977 US dollars so that the resultant figures would
be comparable to the appraisal estimates, even though the work done in some
of the project items was not the same as foreseen at appraisal (para.
3.02). A comparison between appraisal estimate and the actual costs is
given in Table 3. Due to hyperinflation in Argentina during the project
implementation period, and the consequent distortions introduced when
converting Argentine Pesos/Australes into US dollars, the actual costs
given in Table 3 can only be treated as indicative. However, an analysis
of Tables 2 and 3 illustrates that the main features of the project
implementation were as follows:
(a) The project was partially completed in 1984, instead of 1982. The
degree of completion of each item is indicated in Table 2.
(b) Project delays occurred due to the absence of a consistent
management on FA, the lack of adequate local funds, and
inordinate delays in sanctions and budget approvals.
2/ Master Plan for Suburban Services; Intercity Passenger Services; and
Uneconomic Lines.



(c) The cost of the project at US$869.95 was 16% higher that the
appraisal estimate of US$748.90 million including contingencies.
Cost overruns for the local expenditures was 16.9% and for foreign
exchange 15.6%.
td) A major cost overrun occurred in track works (w?ay and works) in
which it reached 29%, comprising 33% increase in local costs and
18% in foreign costs. The main reason for the ccst increases was
delays in execution of work.s caused by public expenditura .uts and
delays in government clearances for the budget, and also some
changes in the work content arising from these delays.
(e) The signal and telecom works although relatively small in size had
a cost over-run of 85%, 56% in local costs and 115% in foreign
costs. This was caused by an amplification of the works over the
extended period of the project.
(f) The Motive Power and Rolling Stock package was executed at 85% of
the original costs largely due to an advance in the deliveries of
locomotives and reductions in wagon purchases.
Procurement
3.07     Procurement action was very slow.  Although the loan became
effective in May 1980, and tenders were floated in the snme year,
disbursements did not start till 1982. Initially, the pceparation of the
tender documents in accordance with Bank Guidelines took some time, which
is not unusual. However, the main delays occurred in tender evaluations
which took anything between six months to a year. FA has stated in its
Completion Report that one of the reasons for the delays were the
"impugnaciones' or protests during tender evaluations. From the Bank's
perspective, an undesirable feature of the tender evaluations was the
propensity of FA to somehow reject the lowest offers from international
bidders in favor of higher bids from the local industry. Quite often it
appeared the Government in its preoccupation to protect the local
industries, supported analyses that laboriously found reasons for rejection
of the lowest bids from the international market. The tender documents, in
accordance with standard Bank guidelines, allowed a preference of 15% for
local bids, and no more. As a result, protracted corresponder.ce cesulted
in connection with Bank's approval of the awards, and although the Bank's
view generally prevailed, much time and effort was 1 3t in establishing the
rights of the lowest evaluated bidders.
3.08     However, an important consequence of the enforcement of the
principles of international bidding was the introduction of the discipline
of international prices in the local industry in Argentina. When the Bank
started appraising this project, F.A. was committed to long-tetm orders to
the local industxy for rails, wagons, bogies and other railway equipment.
These orders had been negotiated at inordinately high prices, sometimes as
much as 100% over international prices. During appraisal, the Bank
missions insisted that some of the ongoing contracts with the local



- 10 -
industry covering items included in the project be renegotiated3 , either
because the prices were considered excessive, or the quantities on order
and the delivery schedules were inappropriate in the light of the
requirements of the project. The results of these negotiations were very
satisfactory, and the situation in regard to the long-term orders was
substantially corrected. It was n3t, however, until the results of the
international bids started coming in, that the discipline of international
prices was introduced into the Argentine industry. As a matter of fact,
during the later stages of the project, the local manufacturers of rails,
freight cars, and other railway equipment started quoting prices
consistent with international prices, and actualLy won some orders as the
lowest bids.
IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01     The project was based on forecasts of traffic, with substantial
increases in freight traffic (see table below) which did not materialize.
This was due to a combination of reasons arising mainly from the unsettled
political conditions, reduced economic activity and the South Atlantic War
which diverted the country's resources and transport capacity. The fact
that FA was not properly managed during the period was also a major
contributory factor. The forecasts of freight traffic increases had been
based on gradually increasing exports of grains and steady increases in
nongrain traffic such as minerals, limestone, sugar, wine, etc.  Tables 4
and 5 show the traffic forecast and actually carried by FA in the years
1979 to 1986.  The increases in grain traffic just did not come about and
although sugar, limestone and petroleum traffic registered increases in
line with appraisal forecasts, wine, minerals and fuel did not.  As a
result, FA's freight traffic having peaked to 22.5 million tons in 1983,
steadily declined to 15 million tons by 1986.  The ups and downs in FA's
freight traffic over the period are summarized below.

4.02     As far as Intercity Passenger Traffic is concerned, the intention
was to cause a progressive reduction in the services and then to maintain
these services at the level aimed for 1980. In effect the reduction in
intercity passenger services was greater than planned (which was fortuitous
as the intercity services lose heavily) and even though there was some
tecovery in the number of passengers carried, rising from a low of
7.7 million in 1982 to 12.8 million in 1986, intercity traffic has
continued to be relatively low, perhaps signifying the need for at least
some of these services to be taken over by intercity buses which are served
by excellent roads.

Here again the progressive increases in traffic forecast did not
materialize due to the depressed economic and industrial activity, although
an additional factor was the dislocation (particularly in the years
1982-85) arising from the electrification of the Roca Railway, which eased
somewhat as the electrification progressed. FA has also reported a
progressive increase in the amount of ticketless travelling in the Buenos
Aires area which was attributed to the reductions of staff imposed in the
earlier years of the project. However, the problem of ticketless
travelling is linked also to the need for construction of security
facilities in the rather large numbers of suburban stations, and the
solution of this problem really lies in judicious investments in ticketing
and control equipment, some civil works at stations, and of course,
effective personnel.
4.04     Table 6 shows the degree of FA's compliance, year by year, with
the various Action Plan targets agreed at sppraisal. Due to shortfall in
traffic, most of the operating targets were not achieved, except the staff
reductions (for some years) and the average loads of freight cars which
exceeded the forecasts. Selected operating statistics of FA for the years
1979 to 1986 are given in Table 7. The operating statistics for the period
reflect a peak in FA's activities in 1983 when it carried the maximum
freight (22.5 million tons), the maximum gross ton-kms (13.4 billion) and
had the best ratio of freight ton kms to track Ims (374).  During this year
the productivity of the staff was also relatively good reaching a high of
241,900 units of traffic per employee. As the table shows, clearly the
momentum for closure of uneconomic lines generated during the preparation
and early stages of implementation of the project was not maintained, and                 I
after the closure of 10,405 km of lines, the Government (Subsecretaria de
Transporte) did not, inspite of repeated urging by the Bank, carry out the
studies included in Part C of the project (item 4) for the uneconomic lines
(see also para. 3.05). The closure of 10,405 km of uneconomic llnes is,
however, no mean achievement by any standards, although most of it was
brought about, at least in part, by the pressure exerted by the Bank.
4.35     A significant contribution of the project was the elimination of
suburban passenger services in cities other than Buenos Aires.  Rosario,
Santa Fe, Cordoba, and Tucuman each had its own suburban services which
lost heavily, but nurtured ambitious plans for development. These services
were progressively reduced and were eliminated in 1980.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Overall Financial Performance ofLFA
5.01     Table 8 shows FA's actual financial results compared with
appraisal projections for the period 1979-82 and the actual results for the
year 1983. Financial performance deteriorated substantially from an
operating ratio of 216 in 1979 to 296 in 1983. In none of the project
years reviewed did FA meet appraisal targets. Working and operating ratios
are summarized below:



-13-
Workinz Ratio              Operating Ratio
Year   Appraisal Forecast   Actual   Appraisal Forecast   Actual
1979           151             190            182            216
1980           141             208            170            271
1981           127             206            156            298
1982           121             208            149            392
1983             -             180              -            296
5.02     The principal reasons for the failure to achieve the targets set
forth during appraisal were: (a) freight traffic did not increase as
forecast (para. 4.01); and (b) tariffs in real terms decreased at an annual
rate of 7Z for freight and 12-15% for passenger as compared to a forecast
increase in real terms of about 3-52 per annum during appraisal. Working
expenses decreased, in real terms, at an annual rate of 122 per annum vis a
vis the appraisal forecast of an annual decrease of 4.3%, but this was not
sufficient to offset the failure to achieve the traffic forecast or the
increase in tariffs.
5.03     The appraisal report included a general review of the financial
performance of FA, and the forecast was made on the financial information
then available. An analysis of the operating results by railway service
was forecast for 1980. A similar analysis was carried out with actual data
for 1984. To provide a bettez understanding of FA's financial performance
during the period under consideration, the results of the SAR forecast in
1980 and the actual values in 1984 are given below by service.  More
detailed information is provided in Table 9.

5.04     The above figures show that on all gauges, long-run variable costs
for freight services as a percentage of revenue, were lower in 1984 than
forecast for 1980 in the Staff Appraisal Report. However, similar values
for all services were higher than forecast for the broad and standard
gauges (332 and 18Z, respectively) and slightly lower (4%) for the narrow
gauge. Suburban and intercity passenger services have been the greatest
financial burden of FA du' to the Government's reluctance to increase fares
to a level to cover cost of services, mainly because of sociopolitical
reasons.
FA's Operating Revenues
5.05     Table 8 shows that appraisal projections indicated that FA's
operating revenues would increase from US$411.1 million in 1979 to US$513.2
million in 1982. The same table indicates that actually, operating revenue
in 1979 was US$277.1 million and in 1982 it decreased to US$161.7 million.
The main reasons for failing to reach the revenue forecast were: (a) FA's
traffic decreased somehow during the period, instead of increasing at the
pace forecast during appraisal; and (b) FA failed to increase its tariffs
in real terms at the anticipated rates as the Go:ernment did not honor its
commitment to increase tariffs. The Government had agreed thiat it would
not object to FA's changing freight tariffs (para. 5.13-viii), except in
those cases where it felt that VA was exercising monopolistic pawer. In
regard to passenger tariffs these were to remain subject to Government
regulation. Appraisal estimates assumed that between 1979 and 1982,
freight rates would increase in real terms at a rate of 3.62 per anuium,
suburban passengers fares 5% and intercity passenger fares 3%. However,
between 1979 and 1984, freight rates in fact decreased at a rate of 72 per
annum, suburban passenger fares decreased 15.5% per annum and intercity
passenger fares decreased 12.6% per annum.
Fi's Operating Expenses
5.06     As shown in Table 8, the appraisal forecast indicated that working
costs would remain constant between 1979 and 1982 at about US$622 million.
Actual working costs decreased from US$526.5 million in 1979 to
US$336.8 million in 1982, which represented 54% of the appraisal forecast.
The main reason for the decrease in cost was the reduction, in real terms,
in personnel costs, which dropped from US$418.9 million in 1979 to
US$221.4 million in 1982. This was due to a reduction in personnel costs
per employee of 432 (from US$4,047 to US$2,304) between 1979 and 1982, and
a further reduction in the staff strength which was forecast to be 105,000
in 1982, at appraisal, and actually reached a value of 96,100.
Consequently, the ratio of ealaries to working cost decreased from 79 in
1979 to 65 in 1982.
5.07     The fuel cost forecasts which represented about 8% of FA's working
costs were based on engine-kilometers and reflected the rhasing out of
steam traction. The forecast assumed that engine-kms would grow 8.82, from
72.0 million engine-kms in 1979 to 78.41 million engine-kms in 1982.
Actually, there was a decrease of about 1% from 76.1 million engine-kms ia
1979 to 75.2 million engine-kms in 1982. Fuel costs forecast per million



- 15 -
engir.e-kms uas estimated at US$0.69 in 1979 decreasing to US$0.62 in 1982.
Actually fuel costs per million engine-kms were US$0.44 in 1979 and
US$0.375 in 1982.
5.08     The appraisal forecast shows that FA's working cost would remain
constant, in real terms, during the period 1979-82 whereas freight traffic
ir. ton/km fo: that same period was forecast to increase by a yearly average
of 8.7%. The basic assumption made during appraisal was that oecause of
the 'mprovement in FA's operating perforaance, unit costs would be reduced
by a yearly average of about 7.6%, which would appLoximately offset the
extra cost due to the increas3e in trA-tffie. In fact, FA's working coets per
traffic unit in 1982 were 35% lower than forecast, while operating costs
were practically the same. In review, however, the appraisal forecast for
working and operating costs proved to be fairly realistic. The main
responsibility for the deterioration of FA's financial condition therefore
rests fairly and squarely on lower revenues &risir.g from the non-
achievement of the traffic forecasts, and the failure of FA and the
Government to increase tariffs.
5.09     In accordance with Sention 5.06 of the Loan Agreement, FA revalued
its main assets and rolling stock and motive power. Although the
revaluation was not based on technical assessment, FA charged an adequate
depreciation to its accounts. In 1982 depreciation charged in FA's
accounts was over two times larger, in real terms, than in the appraisal
forecast, which had a significant impL-t in the calculation of the
operating ratio.
Balance Sheet
5.10     Table 10 shows FA's balance sheets for the period 1979-83.  The
debt equitv ratio kept between 2/98 in 1980 (its lowest) and 8/92 (its
worst) in 1981. Thaee ratios were better than the appraisal forecast due
to the delay in the implementation of the project which resulted in lower
than expected long-term loans during the period under consideration.
Financial Plan for the Proiect and FA
5.11     Table 11 shows FA's actual capital requirements and sources of
funds for the period 1980--83. It also provides a comparison between actual
results and appraisal forecasts for the period 1980-82. The project was
considerably delayed in its implementation due to paucity of Government
funds and delays in Government sanctions. Therefore the project investment
program and the original investment program cannot be readily compared due
to a different timeframe in the implementation and also because passage of
time altered the needs and priorities to some extent. Although Government
contributions to the investment plan during the period 1980-82 were 23%
lower than anticipated in the appraisal forecast, the overall Govetnment
contribution was 2232 larger than anticipated, mainly because in this
period, FA tariffs did not increase in real terms as forecast, and traffic
failed to reach the estimated volumes.
5.12     The appraisal projected that Government contributions during the
period 1980-82 would fully cover FA's deficit and debt repayments as well
as about 32% of FA's investment requirements. The balance was to be



- 16 _
financed by loans/supplier credits which were to be obtained to cover about
341 of FA's investment plan, and by FA's own internally generated funds
through depreciation and other charges to cover 341 of its investment
requirements.  Actual government contributions covered 89Z of FA's
deficits, 100X of FA's debt repayments and only 1Z of FA's investment
requirements.  FA's internally generated funds were used to cover the
balance of the deficits and 561 of FA's investment requirements;
loans/supplier credits covered 431 of FA's investment requirements. In
summary, actual Government contributions for the period 1980-82 amounted to
US$3,741 million as compared to US$1,679 million envisaged in the appraisal
forecast which were to cover 661 of FA's cash needs. Actual contributions
covered 691 of FA's cash requirements.
Financial Covenants
5.13     The loan included traditional financial covenants and targets for
the period 1979-82, covering recordkeeping, annual audits, revaluation of
fixed assets, tariffs, financial ratio targets, capital expenditure
limitations and debt limitations. In retrospect, the financial covenants
included in the Loan Agreement were very general and now appear to have
been inadequately suited to the project as it actually evolved. It may
have been better to have prepared some covenants focusing on specific
financial aspects of the project, and not on the railways as a whole, such
as specific operating indices and targets for the freight operation and for
suburban and intercity passenger services, in order to monitor FA's actions
and measure achievements more precisely. On the other hand it is doubtful
if a different structuring of the targets would have helped very much given
the lack of interest of the authorities in enforcing the Action Yrogram
during the critical years of the project. A sumary of the bors jr's and
guarantor's compliance with main financial covenants follows:
(a) Loan Agreement
(i)    Record Keeping and Accounts (Section 5.01).  FA has worked
consistently to improve the quality and timeliness of its
financial reporting and achieved reasonable results.
(ii)   Independent and Actual Audits (Section 5.02).  FA's
accounts are audited by independent Government auditors.
During the appraisal of this project, it was agreed with PA
that the auditor's reports would be furnished to the Bank
as soon as available, but not later than four months after
the end of each fiscal year. During the period 1979-84,
the auditor's reports were consistently late. The report
for the year 1983 was submitted to the Bank on June 2,
1986, about two years and two months after the due date.
(iii)  Payment of Amounts Owed by Guarantor and Other Public
Corporations (Section 5.04). The Borrower took actions to
collect all amounts owing it by the Guarantor, and other
public corporations, and although it improved the period
the amount owed were outstanding to about 75 days, it never
reached the no more than two months agreed to in the Loan
Agreement.



- 17 -
(iv)   30 Day.i  race Period for Settlement of Account (Section
5.05).  The Borrower complied with this covenant and
imposed a penalty for payment by users of its services for
payments ln more than 30 days.
(v)    Revaluation of Fixed Assets (Section 5.06).  The Borrower
complied partially with this covenant. Beginning in 1979
it revalued its *aain assets and rolling stock and motive
power annually.  However, the revaluation is not based on
technical assessment. Technical re, zluation of the fixed
assets was begun in 1983 but at the closing of the Loan, it
hat' not been completed. Nevertheless, depreciation charges
ba!ed on the revalued assets are deemed reasonable.
(vi)   Recording of Valuea of Materials and Spare Parts (Section
5.07). The Borrower made substantial efforta to improve
the recording of materials and spare parts values to comply
with this covenant, but the efforts were not sufficient to
totally comply with this cover?'nt.
(vii)  Debt Limitations (Section 5.09).  The Borrower complied
with the provisions of this covenant.
(viii) Tariffs (Section 5.10). The Borrower took action necessary
to comply with this covenant, but the Government restricted
FA from making the necessary increases in freight and
passenger tariffs.
(b) Guarantee Agreement
(i)    Provision of Funds (Section 2.01).  The Government
partially complied with this covenant making available to
the Borrower the funds necessary for the punctual payment
of the principal of, and interest and other charges on, the
loan.
(ii)   Provision of Funds for the Project (Section 2.02).  The
Government consistently fell short of its obligations to
allocate funds for FA to carry out its investments plan
which includes the Bank project. The shortage of funds was
one of the principal reasons for the two-year delay in the
execution of the Bank project and the execution of FA's
total investment program.
(iii)  Tariff Increases (Section 4.03).  The Government, for
sociopolitical reasons, restricted FA from making the
necessary increases in the tariffs.
(iv)   Discontinuation of Suburban Services (Section 4.04).  The
Guarantor complied with this covenant. Suburban service in
the cities other than Buenos Aires were discontinued in
1979, one year ahead of schedule.



- 18 -
(v)    Specific Subsidies for Uneconomic Lines (Section 4.05).
The Guarantor has complied with this covenant inasmuch as
the losses incurred on FA (including uneconomic lines) were
reimbursed to FA.
(vi)   Freedom to Adiust Freight Rates (Section 4.06).  The
Government has regulated the level of freight rates, thus
not giving FA the freedom to modify its freight rates
called for in this covenant.
(vii) Accounts Payable to Borrower (Section 4.07). The Borrower
was able to improve the collection of amounts owed it by
the Government and other public corporations, but has not
been able to reach the maximum of two months stipulated in
this covenant. Therefore, the Guarantor is in partial
compliance with this covenant.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     In a large public sector enterprise like FA, institutional
development covers broadly two areas; the first is the role of the
Government in managing the enterprise, and the second, and perhaps more
important, is the organization and management of the enterprise itself.
The appraisal report reviewed in a general way both the role of the
Government and the management of FA, keeping in view the objective of
strengthening FA to improve its finLncial position and competitive
advantage, and highlighted the following areas of actions
(a) Government
- Grant of autonomy to FA to increase its tariffs.
- Redimensioning of FA by the clo- i of uneconomic lines and
services.
(b) Ferrocarriles Argentincs
-  Improvement of the organizational structure of FA.
- Development of a Planning Office to analyze proposals for
investments.
- Reduction of staff strength.
-  Selective Program of Investments.
6.02     First, in regard to the tariff increases the Government neither
gave FA the autonomy to increase its tariffs, nor indeed ever substantially
acceded to FA's proposals for tariff increases.  This was a major cause of
the poor performance of FA (para. 5.02), and in a sense was a confirmation
of the indication in the appraisal report that financial results were
particularly sensitive to tariff increases. Second, the Government's role
in the redimensioning of FA was initially quite aggressive; 10,405 km of



- 19 -
lines were closed by 1981, intercity passenger services were reduced
substantially, and suburban services in cities other than Buenos Aires were
discontinued. However, the crucial studies in connection with further line
closures were never done, and the momentum generated in the years 1979-81
just petered out in the following years of turmoil.
6.03     As far as FA is concerned, a certain strengthening of the
"Organismo Central", the central office of FA, did take place in as much as
this office controlled the investments and improved its control over
operations of the different railways. However, much remains to be done in
this area to coordinate train operations and to avoid duplication of
services over the different railways which sometimes cover contiguous
areas.4 The planning capability of FA was considerably strengthened
through the technical assistance received from consultants (CPC, Canada)
who not only anal,zed most of the proposed investments, but also trained FA
staff to do the project analysis. The consultants also prepared a manual
to be used as a guide in project evaluation. The Manpower Study, although
not completely followed through, enabled FA to focus on the problem of the
strength of its staff, on the training aspect of personnel management, and
on the question of salaries, wages and incentives.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01     The general and subproject specific methodologies followed for the
economic reevaluation of the project are, basically, the same as the ones
used at appraisal. For example, for the evaluation of individual
subprojects, it was assumed as it was done before, that the without project
case represented only the exclusion of the subproject in question, ar.d that
the other subprojects were implemented according to the program. Also, the
benefits taken into account for the reevaluation of each type of
subprojects were essentially the same as the ones included in the SAR,
namely: (a) savings in accident costs, savings in track maintenance costs
and reductions in some train operating costs for the subprojects involving
permanent way rehabilitation outside the suburban system; (b) reductions in
maintenance and train operating costs, savings in accident costs, and
provision of additional capacity for traffic that would otherwise travel by
road, for the subprojects comprising pevmanent way rehabilitation within
the Buenos Aires suburban system; (c) savings in railway vehicle operating
costs for the subprojects to purchase new wagons and shunting locomotives
to replace old equipment; (d) avoidance of higher transport cost by truck
as compared with railways for subprojects creating more or new railway
capacity.
7.02     Practically all items evaluated at appraisal were reevaluated,
with the only exceptions of the access to silos (included in Loan 1521-AR)..
The components not evaluated at appraisal were not reevaluated either;
these items constitute about 20X of the total economic cost of the project.
The economic costs included physical contingencies and excluded taxes.
4/ Eventually, it will be necessary to reduce the number of railways under
the jurisdiction of FA from the present six to three, representing the
three different gauges.



- 20 -
7.03     The present economic reevaluation follows as far as possible, the
methodology and format of the appraisal report, within the limitations
imposed by availability of data and information. The Bank Project in the
Appraisal Report consisted of 24 subprojects of which 3 projects were for
accesses to facilities; 15 projects for rehabilitation of permanent way; 3
projects for motive power and rolling stock; and 3 other small projects for
light maintenance equipment and for enclosing subway stations and ticketing
machines. Table 12 includes basic data for the economic reevaluation of
the 15 projects for rehabilitation of permanent way. In particular, actual
traffic data included in that table is consistent, within a reasonable
degree of variation, with the values estimated at SAR.
7.04     The economic cost of most of the 24 components of the Bank
project, as well as the respective internal rates of return (IRR) are shown
in Table 13. The reevaluated IRRs are, in general, acceptable, with only 4
projects (representing about 20 of the total economic costs) with marginal
IRRs of about 10%. Three of these projects were also marginal at the time
of the SAR economic evaluation. In general, the reevaluated IRRs compare
well, with a few exceptions, with the values estimated at SAR. The
weighted average of the reevaluated IRRs is about 18%, an acceptable value,
which is consistent with the comparable value estimated at SAR of 22%.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01     This Project Completion Report is being written almost 10 years
after appraisal of the project, and although this has meant that retrieval
of project-related data was quite difficult because of the succession of
changes in the government of Argentina and the management of FA (and to a
lesser extent in the Bankl), this does endow the Bank and the Borrower with
the advantage of considerable 'hindsight", particularly because of the
preparation in recent years of a comprehensive study of the Transport
Sector Public Enterprises of Argentina (currently being finalized by the
Bank), which permitted a look at what happened in the project in the
context of the economy of Argentina in general and the major transport
sector enterprises in particular.
8.02     In the first place, as FA's Completion Report brings out, the
Bank's contribution to FA's development was a positive one. The Bank
mission's diagnosis of the railway situation was appropriate and the
measures proposed not only necessary but also possible, given the
indications received from the Argentine Government during appraisal and
loan negotiations. However, in the light of information now available, it
would seem that the time span for the execution of the project was over-
optimistic (para. 3.01). The Bank's contribution to the supervision effort
was certainly adequate, although an inordinately large proportion of this
effort was spent on procurement (para. 3.07). The main cause of delays in
project execution and noncompliance of some of the important parts of the
Action Program was the failure of the Government and FA to follow through
with the actions agreed upon during appraisal. This inaction is
attributable to the frequent changes in Government and the inability of any
of the several governments to settle down to anything like a sustained
program of effective actions. Indeed, by the time the Alfonsin Government
came to power, the project had already run through four years of its



- 21 -
roller-coaster ride, with two extensions already exhausted, and the Bank
was ready to define a final closure date to stitch up the project in
whatever state it could be done. Further expenditure of resources in
supervision appeared futile and therefore the project was closed on
December 31, 1984 and disbursements continued till the equipment under
contracts already signed were delivered.
8.03     Altbough clearly much remained to be don-;, the appraisal of the
Second Railway Project and its implementation, however incomplete, brought
home to the Argentine Government and the Railways what needs to be done in
terms of establishing a working relationship between the Government and the
management objectives of FA. This awareness gave rise to three major
Government initiatives, which although disparate in nature, provide enough
gaidance to indicate in what direction FA and the Government should Ro
together. These three documents were: (a) the Government's Policy Paper of
June 1987 on 'Politicas de Transporte para el Corto y Mediano Plazo"; (b)
the 'Madanes Plan" for reorganizing FA which was developed by a commission
reporting to the Directorate of Public Enterprises (DEP); and (c) a Plan of
Reorganization developed within FA which has been called the "Salmeron
Plan". These initiatives fall into an almost descending order of sagacity,
with the Government Policy Paper saying all the right things, the "Salmeron
Plan' voicing the rather blind survival instincts of FA with minimal
changes in the organization, and the "Madanes Plan' straddling somewhere in
between the two extremes. Whereas all the three plans have rather
different traffic scenarios, there seems at least to be a certain amount of
unanimity on the overall objective of operating FA as a business
enterprise. The Transport Sector Public Enterprises Study steers through
the murky waters of past failures and the abundance of future plans, and
focuses on what needs to be done inter alia, to redimension, reorganize and
revitalize the railway, possibly with Bank help and guidance.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     It is abundantly clear from a review of the information and data
furnished by FA as well as the supervision reports and the Bank files on
the subject, that the principal cause of the delays and inadequlacies in
compliance with the project and its program of action were institutional,
and were aggravated by the political and economic problems which overtook
the country during the most critical years of project implementation viz
1980-84. The management of FA, at its best not well-organized to tackle
the difficult tasks of the project, was changed five times during the
project period. On its part, the Bank endeavored to get the essential
parts of the project implemented, but when serious delays in procurement
tender evaluations and awards continued to take place and there did not
appear to be any response to Bank pressure on the Government over taking
action on tariff increases, line closures, etc., it was decided to close
the project in December 1984.
9.02     The writing of a project completion report, however, enables
events of the past to be reviewed with a certain detachment. In this case,
the proposed course of action for disciplining and reorganizing FA somehow
appears to emerge more and more clearly, as one reviews the accumulated
experience of the second railways project, the several initiatives



- 22 -
(par&. 8.03) for reorganizing the railways, and the Transport Sector Public
Enterprises Report. The cumulative experience of the railways projects in
the Bank indicates that the problems (and enormous deficits) of railways in
the developing countries cannot just be washed away, and need to be
addressed in a systematic and sustained manner over a number of years. It
is also clear that in this task the Government has to play an important
role, and a consensus has been emerging In recent years that a plausible
approach is a carefully worked out contract plan between the Government and
the railway, which would spell out the responsibilities of both parties.
Some of the European and African railways were the first to try it, and a
similar approach was adopted in Mexico on the Nacionales de Mexico, after
the conclusion of four Bank-financed railway projects and the Fifth Railway
Sector Project appraised in 1984. The problems of Argentine Railways are
serious and deep-seated enough to claim urgent attention of the Governmcnt
and the Bank. In the past, although the success of the railway projects
was limited, the success of the Bank in developing an awareness of the
sense of direction has been considerable and valuable, and deserves to be
sustained till the problems of the railways are effectively resolved.
Needless to say, an essential concomitant of this task, which may take
several years, is political stability for which current prospects at any
rate appear to be better than 10 years ago.
9.03     FA's data base-is strong and its costing system comprehensive and
generally based on a logical approach. The Centro de Documentacion in
Buenos Aires publishes voluminous statistics monthly, quarterly, and
annually, and in addition, analytical tables entitled "Syntesis Estadistica
de los Ferrocarrilles en Operaciones". Argentine Railways is therefore a
paradise for analysts, and over the past years various consultant and Bank
missions have produced numerous "well-documented' reports which have done
not much more than rest on the shelves of the offices of FA and the
Government. Wlhat is needed now is not additional research, but a pithy
program of action that would commit both FA and the Government to cut the
losses of the railways, and to reorganize them into a size and form better
suited to the economic needs of the country. Some of the work done with
railway projects in the Bank ir. recent years encourages the hope that such
a task is possible.

Translation of incoming telex

Res    PCR. Loan 1677-AR
I acknowledge receipt of the PCR on the Second Railway Project
(Loan 1677-AR), and am pleased to inform you that we have no comments on
the concepts and data contained thereiu. However, we would like to comment
on some general matters which arose during project execution, which we hope
will help to improve relations between Ferrocarriles Argentinos and the
Bank, leading to a better and more dynamic execution of future agreements.
Some of these improvements have been successfully applied to Loan 1521-AR.
One of the most important areas relates to the structure of the investment
program and desired objectives. Since the likely annual level of
investment for Ferrocarriles Argentinos does not reach the minimum
threshold necessary to reverse the accumulated deterioration, multi-
disciplinary projects do not lead us to a clear identification of the
definite improvements their execution would bring. Consequently, we
consider that it would be more advantageous to focus the package of
subprojects on a specific activity, which would permit 8. better
identification of related investment needs and required changes.



- 39 -
In addition, as mentioned in the report, the determination of
total project costs involves a large degree of uncertainty, to the point
that it hardly seems justified to mention deviations from the original
base. The data would have been more reliable and accurate if continuous
conversion to foreign currency had been carried out in a systematic way.
The above served as experience, and was taken into account for the
monitoring of Loan 1521-AR.
Another very important aspect, and one that calls for careful
analysis by both parties, is identification of those management indicators
that most closely reflect achievement of the objectives set. This
situation arose in the final stages of execution of Loan 1521-AR, with
reference to the "cost-income ratiou clause and the methodology for
obtaining results more in accord with the project's development and impact,
and not influenced by temporary conditions in the country.
Lastly, execution of project Loan 1677-AR revealed the need to
coordinate and centralize monitoring of the agreements in a single unit
within the company's organization, establishing a link between
Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the Bank and the official agencies concerned,
making it possible to:
l

make optimum use of the financial resources allocated;
speed up the bidding and start-up processes;
ensure proper compliance with the contractual conditions;
keep in mind what has been done, capitalizing on experience and
allowing for continued pursuit of the project goals, even in the
event of a change in FA administration.
To meet these needs, steps have been taken--partially since 1983
and officially since September 1988--to set up a special unit within
Ferrocarriles Argentinos, whose tasks and functions include the above-
mentioned aspects.
