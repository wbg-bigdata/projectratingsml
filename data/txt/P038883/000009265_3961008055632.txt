MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR AN ENTERPRISE EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$38.5 million. The
loan would be a currency pool loan at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and fees.
This loan would be repayable in 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    Country and Sector Background. Since 1986, Argentina has moved from one
of the most closed trade regimes to one of the most open and transparent. Trade
liberalization (aided by two Bank adjustment loans) has taken place in conjunction with
policy reforms, including reform of the tax structure, removal of subsidies, privatization
and deregulation. The impact of the reforms is visible in the expansion and increased
diversification of trade. The initial effect of liberalization was an import boom fed by
the strong consumer response to stabilization. Imports more than doubled between 1991
and 1993, while exports grew by less than 10 percent. In 1994, exports picked up
steadily with growth rates increasing from 6 % in the first quarter to over 25 % in the
fourth quarter, compared to the same periods the previous year. Imports, on the other
hand, decelerated from growth rates of over 50% in the first quarter to only 13% in the
fourth quarter compared to the previous year. On a yearly basis, however, exports grew
by 20% and imports by 28%, increasing Argentina's trade deficit from US$3.7 billion in
1993 to US$5.8 billion in 1994. In 1995, exports took off, growing by 47% in the first
quarter, while imports increased by only 3% compared with the same period in 1994.
As a result, since March 1995, Argentina's trade has registered surpluses. The forces
behind this change in trade flows are the slowdown of sales to the local market, as the
consumption boom came to an end (by May 1995 local sales were one- third below the
level six months before) and the increase in sales of agroindustrial products,
automobiles, automotive parts and fuel to Brazil, in response to the consumption boom
that followed Brazil's Plano Real.
3.    Argentina's export growth still depends on a relatively narrow range of traditional
exports: commodities and agroindustries account for over 60% of Argentina's exports.
Exports of industrial manufactures have grown rapidly since 1993; however, they started
from a relatively low level, and a significant share of them are exports of automotive
parts made under a special agreement with Brazil. Also, exports are concentrated in
only a few enterprises. In 1994, only about 9,000 enterprises out of over 60,000
producing tradeables exported goods at a value of US$15.7 billion; moreover, only 10%
of these enterprises generated 92% of the export value. Despite the strong export
growth in 1994, these figures show no change from 1993; hence, the increase in exports
in 1994 came from basically the same group of firms that were exporting in 1993.



4.    Importantly, the exchange regime and trade policies do not explain the slow
response of non-traditional exports. Although the real exchange rate has appreciated
against the US dollar significantly since the adoption of the Convertibility Plan in 1991,
part of this appreciation has been offset by tax measures and deregulation (including
increases in indirect tax reimbursement for exports, elimination of the gross asset tax
from agriculture and industry, and abolition of prepayments against VAT of the
agricultural sector) as well as by the reduction in value of the US dollar with respect to
other currencies. Similarly, although trade policies can still be improved and simplified,
the anti-export bias arising from remaining import restrictions is likely to be low.
5.    Instead, factors inside and external to firms are now the chief constraints to faster
export response. Within the firm there is often an absence of export skills and
motivation, since traditionally exports were vehicles for capital flight or merely
compensated for shortfalls in local demand. According to interviews with enterprises in
Argentina, and the results of a firm-level survey of over 400 exporters and potential
exporters, firms that have never exported find it difficult to access export markets
because of lack of information or entrepreneurial skills and experience in areas such as
(i) product demand and import regulations in overseas markets; (ii) their own
competitive position with respect to other producers; (iii) product design and quality
standards; (iv) safety, packaging, quality and labeling requirements; and (v) distribution
and promotion strategy options. Entrepreneurs, who in the past have survived because
of their financial skills, suffer from a lack of awareness and knowledge of what is
required to engage in the modernization and technological upgrading of their plants, let
alone to search for export opportunities. Furthermore, there is a strong resistance to
investing in export start-up expenditures because of the uncertainties of financial returns.
Nevertheless, the forces of competition are inducing a structural transformation of some
industries which, in due course, will contribute to a rise in non-traditional exports. An
indication of this transformation is the growth of capital goods imports destined for the
industrial sector. Capital goods are the fastest growing imports, now accounting for
about a fourth of total imports; about 40% of imported capital goods go to the industrial
sector.
6.    The behavior of Argentine firms is not atypical. International experience
suggests that trade liberalization policies alone are not sufficient to elicit rapid export
responses in countries with deep-seated attitudes that work against exports, and in which
outdated production technology, low product quality and poor customer service are
prevalent. Rather, it has been considered increasingly necessary to complement policies
with pragmatic support packages to overcome knowledge deficits and risk perceptions.
7.    The main external constraints concern the time and cost involved in meeting
export procedures. Other critical constraints include the lack of credit, not only export
credit but credit for fixed investments. There are also deficiencies in the supply of local
consulting services in the area of exports and of quality control services and certification.
The proposed project would help reduce institutional obstacles to export.



- 3 -
8.    The Government is aware of past problems created by attempting to promote
exports through tax incentives and government agencies to provide information and
technical services. The Government thus has asked the Bank to help reorient support to
exporters targeted on three areas: assistance to potential exporters to obtain export-
related services from private sector providers instead of from government agencies;
simplification of export procedures; and rationalization of public sector agencies and
programs dealing with export promotion.
9.    Project Objectives. The primary objectives of the proposed project are to help
increase the international competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in Argentina
and to improve the performance of export-related public agencies, thus facilitating export
growth. The project would help firms to become more internationally competitive
through three avenues. First, the project would help increase awareness among
entrepreneurs about export opportunities through the provision of basic information about
foreign markets and profitable export strategies. Second, it would prompt a limited
number of enterprises to invest their own resources in productivity improvements and
export development expenditures through the incentive of a one-time grant to share these
costs. Third, the project would help to improve the performance of agencies providing
quality control and certification services. The project would also facilitate export growth
by supporting the simplification and reduction of export procedures.
10.   Project Description. The project would have two main components: (A) an
Enterprise Assistance Program to develop export competencies of the private sector in
manufacturing and service industries; and (B) Institutional Strengthening to enhance the
performance of export-related public agencies.
11.   The Enterprise Assistance Program would be in the form of: (i) cost-sharing
grants to cover up to 50% of the cost of consultant's services required to improve the
international competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (ii) the
services of a worldwide Directory of Consultants and Market Information Suppliers
to ensure easy access by Argentine exporters to information about the availability of
export-related services worldwide.
12.   The Cost-sharing Grant Scheme would offer its services solely in response to
private sector demand on a non-discriminatory basis, and firms would be assisted on a
first-come, first-serve basis. The program would be targeted to firms that have little or
no previous export experience or that wish to explore new markets. Support would be
provided once an export program has been developed by the firm and the enterprise
commits its own funds to implement it. The Cost-sharing Grants would finance
consultant services, acquisition of information (including software and reference
material), trips by entrepreneurs or their staff to explore export opportunities, mailing of
samples, promotion material, and other miscellaneous expenses, provided they are
identified in an export plan. The grants would finance consulting services for: (i)



- 4 -
exploration of export opportunities; (ii) product adaptation or development of new
products for export, including technology upgrading and quality certification; (iii)
improvement of productivity/efficiency to compete in an export market; and (iv) strategy
and actions to penetrate the foreign market directly or indirectly through associative
organizations. Initially, the grant percentage rate would be 50%, but in could be reduced
as the use of consulting services becomes more commonplace. The assistance would be,
in principle, on a one-time per firm basis, but firms could apply for another grant if it is
to export to a different market or a different product. The maximum grant size would
be US$75,000 for a specific export plan and with a maximum of $125,000 for any
individual firm. Eligibility criteria to participate in the Program would be delineated in
a Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP) agreed with the Bank at negotiations. All
services would be provided by the private sector.
13.  It is estimated that about 3,000 firms, out of a group of almost 12,000 enterprises
identified as potential exporters, could be eligible to participate in the cost-sharing grant
scheme over a period of four years. However, since there is little international
experience in the use of cost-sharing grants, and most of the schemes are too recent to
be able to fully assess their success, the proposed project would finance the first phase of
the program, with the objective of assisting about 900 firms over a 30-month period.
The Bank would consider initiating the preparation of a follow-up operation following
the mid-term review of the Cost-sharing Grant Scheme scheduled to take place 12
months after effectiveness or when half of the funds of the Scheme have been disbursed,
whichever comes first. Negotiations for a follow-up operation would be contingent on a
positive evaluation of the cost-sharing grant scheme 18 months after effectiveness or
after two-thirds of the funds have been disbursed, whichever comes first. This
evaluation would be based on the effectiveness of the management arrangements and
evidence of changes at the firm level as a result of the consulting services received.
14.   The Institutional Strengthening component would support the Government's
efforts to simplify procedures and improve the performance of agencies involved in the
export process. The Government has undertaken a systematic analysis of the institutional
capabilities of the key agencies involved in export procedures (public and private),
utilizing a methodology proposed by the Bank. The results of this analysis are the basis
for the specific institutional strengthening programs in the following three areas:
Simplification of Procedures. This would involve streamlining procedural
requirements and reducing the time involved in processing an export order, an
import order (temporary admission regime), and in obtaining tax reimbursements.
Agencies involved would include the Customs Adniinistration (ANA), the
General Tax Directorate (DGI), certification agencies' and the National
1.    The certification agencies are: INTI, the Argentine Institute for Agricultural
Health (IASCAV), the National Service of Animal Health (SENASA), and the
National Food Institute (INAL).



- 5 -
Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI). The targets at the end of the second
year would be: (i) reduction in processing an export operation from 8 to 2 days
on average; reduction in the devolution of taxes from 30 to 3 days on average;
reduction in the time required to issue certificates from 4 days to 1 day on
average; and elimination of the number of certifications required.
Strengthening the Quality Control System. This would involve the
improvement of public and private laboratories that provide quality control
certification for exports. It would finance training and laboratory accreditation
(for the IS09000 certification). The agencies involved would be INTI, IRAM
(the Argentine Institute of Materials Rationalization) and selected private
laboratories. The target at the end of the first year would be the accreditation of
four of INTI's laboratories. Additional laboratories would be accredited during
the second year of implementation.
Strengthening Policy Formulation in Export Promotion. This subcomponent
would provide technical assistance to the Coordinating Unit for Export Promotion
Policies (UCPFE). The UCPFE, formed by Secretariats from the Ministry of
Economy and External Relations, was created in November 1994 with the
mandate to coordinate and rationalize public sector agencies and programs dealing
with export promotion. During project implementation, the UCPFE will
rationalize and streamline existing export promotion entities, and gradually phase
out those entities that are duplicating roles or providing services that could be
supplied more efficiently by the private sector.
Strengthening Commercial Services provided by Fundaci6n ExportAr.
Fundaci6n ExportAr, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, provides basic trade
information and promotes participation in international trade fairs. The project
would provide technical assistance to improve the quality of the support it gives
to exporters through exhibits (booths or stands) for Argentine exporters and
products at international trade fairs. The target for the first year of operations
would be assistance to Fundaci6n ExportAr in two international fairs (USA and
South Africa).
Strengthening the Administrative Capability of the Program Administration
Unit (UAP). Technical assistance would be provided to the UAP to improve its
capability to carry out its coordinating, controlling and evaluating functions.
15.   The Bank also would also consider support to the National Trade Commission
(CNCE) from its research budget. The CNCE was created in May 1994, and is
fashioned after the US International Trade Commission. It has the function of
considering cases of exceptional protection in the form of safeguards and countervailing-
duty actions, and to make inquiries concerning anti-dumping actions. The CNCE has the



- 6 -
important role of keeping commercial practices open while balancing the interests of
producers and consumers.
16.   Project Implementation. Overall responsibility for project implementation
would be vested in the Program Administration Unit (UAP) in the Secretariat of
Commerce and Investment of the Ministry of Economy. The UAP would act as a
promoter and would be responsible for implementing the project in accordance with the
Project Implementation Plan and with policies, criteria and methodologies specified in
the Manual of Policies and Procedures. The Cost-sharing Grant Scheme would be
managed by a private management service contractor (MSC) under a management
service agreement (MSA). The task of compiling and updating the information for the
Directory of Consultants and Market Information Suppliers and of putting it on a
Windows-type program, checking the references and running it would also be carried out
by a private firm under an MSA. The UAP would oversee the work of both private
firms. The Subsecretariat for Economic Organization and Regulation (SDOE), the
agency in charge of deregulation and simplification of government procedures, would be
responsible for the coordination of the technical assistance programs under the
Simplification of Procedures Component. The UAP would directly coordinate the
technical assistance programs under the other subcomponents involving INTI, UCPFE
and Fundaci6n ExportAr. The UAP would sign Implementation Agreements with the
agencies involved and would agree with the Bank on an annual operational programming
(AOP) system prepared in coordination with these agencies. The first-year AOP and the
terms of reference for the consulting work involved were discussed during negotiations.
The second year AOP would be discussed and agreed with the Bank during the Mid-
Term Review. The UAP would also be responsible for preparing and presenting to the
Bank Semi-Annual Project Implementation reports describing progress achieved against
targets established in the AOP.
17.   The project would be subject to a Mid-Term Review after 12 months of
effectiveness or after half of the cost-sharing grant funds have been disbursed, whichever
comes first. Another review would be carried out 18 months following effectiveness, or
after two-thirds of the funds have been disbursed, whichever comes first. The evaluation
of the scheme at these stages would focus on the effectiveness of the management
arrangements and evidence of behavioral changes in the firm that have received the
assistance compared to a control group of similar firms. A full impact assessment would
be carried out three years after effectiveness. The main indicators of the success of the
Cost-sharing Grant Scheme after three years would be the expected greater
competitiveness measured in terms of higher productivity levels, product quality
improvements and increased exports by the assisted firms, compared to the control
group. Another measure would be the achievement of an average annual export
performance equivalent to a multiple of the cost of the grants paid to the exporters.
The impact assessment would be carried out by independent consultants based on survey
work. The effectiveness of the Institutional Strengthening component would be
measured in terms of reduction of the days and processing stages involved in an export



- 7 -
operation and the reduction in the time involved in providing quality and other
certifications to exporters.
18.   Project Sustainability. The cost-sharing grant scheme is intended to be a one-
time boost to elicit greater export responses. Therefore, the program in itself is not
sustainable once the resources have been used. However, the sustainability of the
project should be viewed in terms of its consequences, i.e., the achievement of greater
international competitiveness and the generation of knowledge of how to export, that
could be used repeatedly by the firms. The improvement in the Government's export
agencies' infrastructure supported by the project's Institutional Strengthening component
would have lasting effects by reducing the role of Government in assisting exporters and
promoting private sector involvement in its place. Successful project implementation
will depend on continued borrower ownership. Strong borrower ownership is anticipated
given the heavy involvement of the authorities in project design and the widely shared
view of the priority of increasing exports.
19.   Lessons from Past Export Development Projects. Experience in Latin America
and in other developing countries demonstrates that traditional export promotion rarely
has been effective in expanding exports. Promotion schemes have failed where the
macroeconomic conditions and the overall policy environment have not been conducive
to exports. Also, past project designs appear to have been flawed. First, promotion
services have been provided through a single public service supplier that tended to suffer
from rapid turnover in leadership and inexperienced staff. Second, the services provided
have been supply, rather than demand, driven. Third, external assistance has rarely
been organized to focus directly at the enterprise level. Some countries have been
successful in stimulating exports by providing support and assistance to enterprises in
export marketing and related tasks and by helping finance export-related services
provided by private sector firms. This innovative approach has been used in Great
Britain and Ireland, and with Bank support in India, Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines
and Mauritius. Similar programs have been designed (but are not yet operational) in
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Senegal, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Uganda. A
small cost-sharing grant program is being implemented in Argentina, financed by the
Bank, to stimulate the export of non-traditional agricultural products. A review
conducted by the OECD on the British scheme found that about half of the firms from a
sample of 420 firms that received cost-sharing grants over a 3-year period, were later
able to use consultants at market prices, and 82% had begun implementing the
consultant's recommendations. Information from a sample of 36 grant-supported
activities in Indonesia shows that the first year of implementation achieved additional
exports of US$36 for every US$1 of grant received. The cost-sharing grant scheme for
agricultural exports in Argentina recently has begun to disburse; thus, it is premature to
evaluate its impact on the firms' exports. Nevertheless, some lessons can already be
discerned, including the importance of good publicity campaigns to reach potential
exporters, and the need to have a continuously open window to receive proposals. The
proposed project incorporates the lessons from these experiences. A key lesson is that



- 8 -
the success of the scheme depends on the delivery system. For that reason, the project
proposes that the administration of the scheme be given to a private sector firm under a
management service agreement.
20.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. By helping accelerate and broaden the export
development process in Argentina, the proposed project fully supports the Bank's
country assistance strategy for Argentina, discussed at the Board of Executive Directors
on May 4, 1995 with the Provincial Bank Privatization Project (Loan 3878-AR). The
Bank has been and remains a strong supporter of the ambitious reform program begun in
1990. Major challenges are to sustain the liberal trade regime and maintain
macroeconomic stability. To this effect, it is necessary to increase productivity and
urgently accelerate the export response of Argentine firms. The Bank is particularly
well placed to provide the authorities with lessons learned worldwide with export support
schemes. Also, the Bank has the implementation capacity to proceed rapidly in project
design based on experience in the preparation of similar projects in several countries.
21.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations agreement was reached on: (a) the project
objectives, description, cost, and financing plan; and (b) the reporting, auditing,
procurement, and disbursement arrangements. Agreement was also reached on the
following conditions of loan effectiveness: (a) the formal establishment of the UAP and
the agreement with the Bank on the staffing and budget of the UAP; and (b) the signing
of a contract with an MSC for the administration of the Cost-sharing Grant Scheme,
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. It was agreed that the Program
Administration Unit (UAP) in the Ministry of Economy would continue to be adequately
staffed (as agreed with the Bank) and otherwise supported in the implementation of its
responsibility under the project. It was agreed that events of suspension of loan
disbursements would be: (a) that the Manual of Policies and Procedures, or any
provision thereof, shall have been amended, suspended, abrogated, repealed or waived
without prior agreement of the Bank; and (b) that the MSC for the administration of the
Cost-sharing Grant Scheme, shall have failed to perform any of its obligations or
undertakings under the respective MSA, and such failure shall not have been remedied
by said MSC, by the Borrower, or by any agency of or other party designed by the
Borrower. It was also agreed that the project would be subject to periodic evaluations
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and that continuation of disbursements
after the Mid-Term Review would be subject to specific measures of project
performance.
22.   Poverty Category. The project is not expected to confer direct poverty-reduction
benefits, although an accelerated export response should have indirect benefits on
poverty by increasing employment.
23.   Environmental Aspects. The project has a "C" environmental category rating,
since there are no major environmental issues associated with it.



- 9 -
24.   Program Objective Categories. The project's main Program Objective Category
is Private Sector Development (PV).
25.   Participatory Approach. The project has been prepared with participation from
the potential exporters themselves. During project preparation, a number of interviews
with focus groups were conducted to identify the problems faced by potential exporters.
These interviews provided the basis for the design of the enterprise survey covering
about 400 exporters and potential exporters conducted by the Argentine preparation
team. The Argentine authorities have been heavily involved in project preparation. A
strong project preparation team operates under the Deputy Minister of Economy.
Members of this team have visited the Bank and travelled to several countries, including
Ireland, Great Britain, Korea, and Japan to review exporter support schemes. The
Argentine team has been involved in all aspects of project design, and has produced a
comprehensive background report that has been integrated into the appraisal effort.
26.   Project Benefits. The main benefit of the project would be greater international
competitiveness of Argentine firms that would lead to an accelerated and broadened
export response. Important benefits of the cost-sharing grant scheme would be product
quality improvements through the adoption of internationally recognized quality
standards, and productivity improvements through the adoption of international best
practices in production, management, and marketing know-how. Another benefit would
be the development of a more structured approach to exports by Argentine firms, which
would allow them to move up in the value chain. In the longer term, however, the
project would be evaluated in terms of the incremental benefits it would generate in the
form of increased competitiveness and additional exports. Although the program would
assist a limited number of firms, it would have a spillover effect on other firms through
indirect exporter links and demonstration effects. The institutional strengthening
component would help create a better business climate for exporters by reducing the
remaining institutional constraints to exports and improving the efficiency of govermnent
agencies involved in the export process.
27.   A scheme of direct and indirect support to exporters can be seen as insurance for
policy reformers that they would be able to continue in the same direction. A robust
export response would reduce the demands for policy reversals and special protection--
particularly as local demand begins to slow down--and thus help support the reform
agenda. Also, in the face of rising international interest rates, a strong export
performance would signal a greater efficiency of Argentina's economy and help reduce
the country risk premium.
28.   Risks. The main risk for this operation is that the administrative arrangements
could fail and that subsidies would be granted to anyone who asks, independently of
whether they support feasible export plans. This risk is being addressed by giving the
management of the Cost-sharing Grant Scheme to a private sector contractor with



- 10 -
knowledge of the export business and by basing part of the contractor's remuneration on
performance indicators that measure results other than the number of grants awarded.
This risk is being addressed also by supporting only the first stage of the govermnent's
program under this project and linking Bank support for subsequent stages to a positive
review of the administrative arrangements for the Cost-sharing Grant Scheme. Other
risks are that firms may not be willing to pay for export-related consulting services and
that the grants could fund activities that firms might have undertaken anyway. The first
risk could come about if there is a resurgence of local consumption and firms that are
not export-oriented become less interested in finding export opportunities. Although this
risk is outside the control of the project, it is reduced by the size of the first stage of the
scheme, which would cover only a fraction of the expected demand. The second risk
would be mitigated by requiring firms to provide significant cost-sharing, by making
payments on a reimbursement basis, and by adopting strict evaluation and monitoring
procedures.
29.   A risk to the success of the institutional strengthening component would be
resistance of the agencies involved to the proposed reforms that involve changes in
attitudes, procedures, and staffing. This risk is reduced by giving the management of
the most sensitive reforms to the SDOE, which has a very good track record in
implementing comprehensive deregulations at different levels of the government.
Finally, there is a risk that policy reversals could produce a more protected trade
regime, in which case there would be little justification for an exporter support project.
As part of the Mid-Term Review, the Bank would assess the Government's performance
in maintaining an open trade regime. A substantial departure from this objective would
reduce the justification for a follow-up operation.
30.   Recommnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
