JUAM REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECr
Loan sad Project Summary
Borrower:      Republic of Korea
Beneficiaries:   Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO), Kwangju City and another eight
neighboring municipalities.
Amount:        US$34 million equivalent.
Terms:         15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bankls standard variable interest rate.
Proiect
Description:    The Juam Regional Water Supply System would ultimately supply the Kwangju
Metropolitan Area (KMA) with 640 million liters per day (MLD) of water from Juamn
Dam. The proposed project is the first stage of that system and includes: (a) a
pumping station with a peak capacity of about 520 MLD; (b) a raw water
transmission main, including about 14 km of tunnels designed for the final capacity
(about 2.6 m to 2.8 m in diaineter) and about 22 km of pipelines (1.8 m to 2.4 m
in diameter); (c) a treatment plant with a capacity of 60 MLD; (d) transmission
pipelines for Naju and seven other municipalities (about 25.5 kin); and (e)
engineering services for project design and supervision. Kwangju and the other
municipalities would be responsible for constructing and financing complementary
works comprising the storage reservoirs ar.d dWitbution networks required to use
the bulk water provided. Kwangju would also build and finance a treatment plant
for 230 MLD of water. The project would also set targets to increase the efficiency
of distribution and reduce water leakage in Kwangju, as well as financial targets for
Kwangju Water Bureau and KOWACO, the project operating agencies, and support
improvements in their planning and management information systems.
Benefits
and Risks:     The project would achieve benefits from existing investments in Juam Dam, and
provide water to the KMA, which is one of the lowest income regions in Korea. There
are no unusual project risks. The major risk is that the planned industrial and social
development of the area would not evolve as projected, reducing water demand and
resulting in unused capacity. This risk is mitigated by the existence of other cities
with very critical water shortage problems, which could use the water by extending
the transmission system. Another risk would be delayed completion by Kwangju and
the other municipalities of the treatment or distribution works required to use the
water provided by the project. However, the Government has given high priority to
water supply, and the concerned Ministries to the KMA. Failure to reduce NRW
would increase the cost of water and in the long term reduce the number of persons
benefited. However, KWB has already reduced NRW considerably, and the NWIP
includes actions for reducing NRW through rehabilitation of the distribution systems,
particularly in cities like Kwangju, which have higher than average NRW.

supplementary facilities in two phases. The
first phase, to be completed in 1993, wiU
include construction of: (i) 1.5 km of pipeline
with diameter of 1.8 m to convey raw water
from the Kwangju City boundary to a new
treatment plant site at Toknam; (iu) Toknam
treatment plant with capacity of 230 NLD;
