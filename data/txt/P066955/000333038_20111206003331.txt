Loan and component amounts are estimated based on Project Appraisal Documents because there is no official code for documenting
the support of cultural heritage in the World Bank’s record-keeping system.
The amount of the loan estimated to be in support of urban cultural heritage conservation includes funding for infrastructure

Under the Chongqing Urban Environment Project
(FY2000), the Huguang Huiguan, a large complex
of ancient buildings, was conserved and adaptively
reused for activities to benefit local communities
and develop tourism. As part of planning for the
project’s long-term sustainability, the government
invested in basic infrastructure upgrading for the
historic complex and its surrounding low-income
neighborhoods. City officials also have stressed
the importance of providing for local residents’
other needs by addressing employment generation,
commercial and residential land use, and tourism
development.

Institutions and Specialists
A high quality of conservation practice is necessary
to preserve cultural heritage with all of its values
and significance.

The number of skilled professionals directly charged
with heritage protection in China’s cultural heritage
bureaus is small. Furthermore, they often lack suf-
ficient funding and political support to adequately
defend historic cities and sites against development
pressures. Unlike in other countries, cultural heritage
bureaus in China are not clearly attached to either

Making Use of Social
and Environmental Policies
Attention to the protection of cultural heritage is
embedded in social and environmental policy instru-
ments used by China and international organizations.
Rather than merely performing a policing function,
these policies can create an effective link between cul-
tural heritage planning and development. For exam-
ple, instruments used by the World Bank include the
Operational Policies and Bank Procedures (OP/BP), whose
key points are briefly summarized below:

surrounding environment and communities. Local
understanding and commitment to cultural heritage
sites can be expanded by increasing the content of
site interpretation to include (1) the past and pres-
ent socioeconomic and environmental context of the
sites, and (2) the local populations’ histories and cur-
rent relationships with the sites. (See section 5.2 for
more on the interpretation of cultural heritage sites.)

To provide a rich and informative experience that
links local communities to their history and maxi-
mizes tourist interest, funding under the Gansu
Cultural and Natural Heritage Protection and Development
Project (FY2008) supports research and development
of interpretation including exhibits, signage, dem-
onstrations, performances, guided tours, maps, and
brochures. Interpretation will be based on consulta-
tion with a wide range of experts and representa-
tives from local communities. This collaboration is
intended to broaden the presentation of the historic
and cultural significance of the site and include the
relationships of surrounding communities with the
site over time. Community themes may include
(1) traditional stories and folktales about the site, as
well as local family histories, and (2) the history of
local arts and ceremonies related to the site.


4.3 Enhancing the Sustainability
of Conservation Activities

for new activities that lead to increased economic
activity. Adaptive reuse also is a direct and signifi-

6.1 Promote Economic
Development through Heritage
Conservation
Today, historic urban areas that once were the core
of China’s cities have become only portions of
much larger urban settlements. These historic areas
often host poor communities and contain built heri-
tage that is under-utilized and under-maintained.

Asset-Based Approach to Local
Economic Development
Rather than turning to demolition and new con-
struction, investing in the conservation of these areas
is an asset-based approach to local economic devel-
opment. It involves leveraging historic urban areas
as (1) livable service hubs for the city’s internal users,
such as communities living in the urban core and in
the modern neighborhoods surrounding them; and
(2) sustainable destinations for external users, such
as outside investors, tourists, and all those from else-
where who depend on the city for their livelihoods.

Heritage Assets Are
in Compact Urban Areas
Historic buildings are located primarily in densely
built urban areas. Compact urban development
means reduced heating and cooling costs because
units are smaller or are in multi-unit buildings, and
reduced need for public or private motorized trans-
portation. District energy systems can be used to
generate power, as China has been doing for de-
cades, thus also creating substantial carbon savings.
Municipal infrastructure requirements for roads,
sewers, communication, power, and water also are
reduced by high-density developments. These top-
ics increasingly are being studied by researchers
and scholars in China. Although the work remain-
ing to be done is vast, seriously considering smart
growth approaches to conservation and internaliz-
ing them in urban development policies at the mu-
nicipal and central levels will be highly important
in China.                                               Cultural Tourism Depends                                  n  Examples of

Zhejiang Multicities Development Project
Approval FY: 1993
  Total Project Cost: US$231.0 mil
  Loan/Credit Amount: US$110.0 mil (IDA)
  Cultural Heritage Component Total Cost: US$2.3 mil
  Cultural Heritage Component Loan Amt: US$0.15 mil

The Zhejiang Multicities Development Project was designed to strengthen
the planning and delivery of urban services in Shaoxing, Hangzhou, Wenzhou,
and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. In Ningbo, the project widened major roads and
improved urban services along their alignment (sewage, storm drains, underground power
and telecommunication lines, and street lighting).

Cultural heritage conservation activities also were supported in Ningbo, which began evolving sometime
before 770 B.C. and contains many culturally significant residential, religious, and institutional buildings.
Support for cultural heritage included the conservation of important cultural heritage properties and the
historic urban fabric along the path of project-supported roads. Project resources and local funds were
combined for direct physical works to conserve and repair historic bridges, temples, gates, facades, and em-
bankments in the project area, including the historic area of Moon Lake and Liuting Island. Preliminary
road alignments were changed to save cultural property. When this was not possible, some significant historic
buildings were moved to other locations. Although the component loan amount for cultural heritage was
small, it was important because it was the first World Bank project in China to show that conservation of
cultural heritage could be integrated effectively with urban regeneration.

The Liaoning Environment Project aimed to (1) protect the main water
resources in Liaoning Province to enable their sustained economic and safe use for
46   Conserving the Past as a Foundation For the Future




               drinking, industrial, and agricultural purposes; (2) strengthen pricing policies and institutional arrangements
               for environmental protection, water pollution control, and waste water and municipal solid waste manage-
               ment, and (3) institute measures for air pollution control.

               The project also supported the recording, protection, conservation, and presentation of cultural heritage
               assets. These activities were chosen from a broad array of possibilities. The final selection was designed to
               cover representative conservation and management challenges in museums, archaeological sites, and his-
               toric structures. The component consisted of four major elements, each with associated training. These are
               (1) investment in electrical and mechanical systems to improve humidity and temperature control, lighting,
               and security for the world-class collection of the Liaoning Provincial Museum, (2) protection of excavated
               areas at the Niuheliang Neolithic burial ground (Hongshan culture), (3) stabilization of the Jiumenkou area
               of the Great Wall, and (4) archaeological site-investigation works at Jieshi Palace. The component signifi-
               cantly raised conservation management skills and general awareness of the importance of cultural heritage
               conservation during a time of rapid development in Liaoning. More than three times the loan amount was
               leveraged from local resources for cultural heritage protection.

               In response to an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale, an existing
               Bank credit was amended to provide reconstruction support for Inner Mongolia
               and Yunnan Province. In Yunnan, funding was provided for water supply and treatment,
               sanitation, irrigation, roads, hydropower stations, and institutional development; as well as for the rehabilita-
               tion of schools, hospitals, and industrial enterprises.

               At the local government’s request, the program also included the repair and rehabilitation of cultural
               heritage assets that had sustained severe earthquake damage. A major focus of this work was Lijiang, a
               UNESCO World Heritage City, which is known for its vibrant ethnic minority cultures and a uniformly tra-
               ditional cityscape. In ancient Lijiang, the project made repairs to traditional streets, sidewalks, bridges, canal
               embankments, sanitation facilities, and the water supply and distribution system. The project supported a
               grant program for materials for housing repair, which emphasized earthquake-resistant construction and
               benefited approximately 15,300 families. For the grant program, construction and improvement guidelines
               for traditional housing were developed and a local technical assistance team formed. In addition, the Mu
               Fu, a 20,000 m2 historic compound, was reconstructed to be used for educational activities and tourism.
               The project work and technical assistance contributed to rebuilding Lijiang while increasing local awareness
               and skills in conserving the city’s unique urban landscape and ensuring continued economic opportunities

The primary objective of the Sichuan Urban Environment Project was to
finance municipal service improvements in five urban areas of Sichuan Province
that would address environmental degradation and water pollution. The project supported
improved wastewater and water supply systems and solid waste management.

The project worked with the Sichuan Cultural Heritage Bureau to develop a cultural heritage database
and a provincial conservation strategy. The strategy identified one of the better known cultural assets in the
province as a priority for conservation: the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Leshan Grand Buddha.
Located at the confluence of 3 rivers, the 1,200-year-old statue is an impressive 71 meters high. It was
carved into the riverside cliffs between 713 A.D. and 803 A.D. This buddha attracts large numbers of tour-
ists who can visit it from top to bottom via narrow and treacherous flights of stairs dug into the cliff face.
The component supported stabilization of the rapidly deteriorating buddha and plans to improve visitor
safety. Work included (1) extending the buddha’s platform and the embankment at the North Gate and (2)
strengthening the foundations of the Linbo Pagoda and Zaijiu Pavilion. Technical assistance funded by
the project provided substantial exposure of local cultural heritage experts to international best practice in
conservation planning and design.

               The Chongqing Urban Environment Project focused primarily on the development of urban infrastructure
               to improve wastewater and solid waste management, increase water supplies, and upgrade water quality
               monitoring.

               In addition, the project supported the development of a strategic master plan for cultural heritage in con-
               junction with the Chongqing Cultural Heritage Bureau. This plan identified a complex, known as Huguang
               Huiguan, as a priority for conservation. The project supported technical assistance for the master plan and
               the planning and conservation work for the complex. Covering approximately 10,000 square meters, the
               complex comprises several guild halls, which were constructed and modified over the course of the Qing
               dynasty (1644–1911). Although the buildings were seriously deteriorated, the traditional roofs, structural ele-
               ments, and delicate carvings remained. This fact combined with the level of the site’s documentation meant
               that the complex could be appropriately conserved.

               Buildings in Huguang Huiguan were conserved and adapted for new uses including a theater, exhibit hall,
               and cultural center. Huguang Huiguan is situated among low-income neighborhoods, and the necessary
               infrastructure investments for the complex were extended to these surrounding neighborhoods. The adapta-
               tion of the complex has created a focal point for the municipality’s civic events and a popular tourism site.
               It has stimulated small business start-ups in the surrounding neighborhoods and raised residents’ awareness
               of their history.

               Status: Phase I Closed

               The Shanghai Urban Environment Project was designed to enhance environ-
               mentally sustainable economic growth by supporting (1) facilities for the collection,
               treatment, and disposal of municipal wastewater, and solid waste disposal; (2) protection of
               water resources; and (3) strengthening institutions with responsibility for environmental management. The
               project also supported planning for urban development and pilot infrastructure upgrading in a historic area
               adjacent to the central core, which is facing strong pressure for redevelopment.

               The conservation area of Hongkou District was identified for investments due to its extremely high density,
               and deteriorating housing and infrastructure. The project funded the upgrading of structural elements and
               basic services of historic low-rise apartment blocks. The traditional, lane-style (li long) apartment build-
               ings built in the 1920s and 1930s comprised housing in extremely poor condition, with living space of,
               generally, less than 15 m2 per household and basic services shared among multiple households. Housing

Status: Closed

The Zhejiang Urban Environment Project is intended to (1) strengthen the
collection and treatment of wastewater and the disposal of solid waste; and
(2) improve urban infrastructure services, including the rehabilitation of inner waterways, lakes, and roads in
the cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing.

The project also supported cultural heritage conservation in Shaoxing, which is more than 2,500 years old.
The city has played a key role as a political, economic, and cultural center throughout the centuries; and
has been home to highly respected literary, artistic, and revolutionary figures. Specific investments in the
Shaoxing’s historic core include (1) urban upgrading and conservation of cultural heritage in five historic
neighborhoods to improve public utilities, residential environments, and land use; and (2) investments in
the area known as the Capital of the Yue Kingdom to plan and construct a museum and improve land-
scaping, public spaces, housing, and sewerage. Technical assistance on urban planning, conservation prin-
ciples and guidelines, M&E of conservation work, and an extensive study on tourism development also was
funded.

Although the project is still open at the time of this writing, much of the work has been completed.
Activities that have been completed are the investments to build a municipal museum, improve 20 km of
canals and embankments, install sewer connections to individual houses, and upgrade housing for 8,000
households. The overarching goal of the city is to improve health and safety and to conserve the tradi-
tional neighborhoods with their existing communities and water-side lifestyles, which give the city its unique
character.

               The project aims to assist Xi’an Municipality to address the challenges of
               increasing urbanization and rapid motorization by improving transport acces-
               sibility and mobility, while protecting the city’s cultural heritage. Xi’an is the eastern
               endpoint of the “Silk Road? and is home to many significant cultural heritage assets. Annually, millions of
               tourists are attracted to the world-renowned Qin Terracotta Warriors, the Ming Walled City, and the pal-
               ace remains at the archaeological site of Chang’an, the capital of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.–8
               A.D.).

               The project has two cultural heritage subcomponents. The first aims to develop a network of bicycle routes
               within Xi’an’s Walled City. This network will comprise over 30 km of roads and alleyways in which pedestri-
               ans and cyclists will have full priority over motorized traffic. The routes are to link all the main tourist sites,
               city gates, and forthcoming metro stations, thus providing an effective means of bicycle travel for residents
               and tourists. This shift to bicycle use will substantially reduce vehicle traffic congestion and pollution. The
               road and bicycle route design will conserve the existing historic urban spaces and street profiles, thus protect-
               ing the historic urban fabric.

               The second subcomponent aims to reconstruct the Han Dynasty road system around the Weiyang Palace,
               which is the primary archaeological site within the City of Chang’an. Approximately 8.5 km of roads are
               to be reconstructed along the original alignment according to archaeological evidence. The road will be
               constructed over and above a protective earth layer so that the original road surface is protected and the re-
               construction is fully reversible. Additional investments will be directed to preliminary archaeological excava-
               tions, 47,000 m2 of landscaping, a parking lot, water supply and sewage systems, street lighting, and signage.
               This work forms part of the first phase of the General Plan for the Preservation of the Han Chang’an City
               Ruins.

The Gansu project aims to generate benefits for local communities from the de-
velopment of sustainable cultural tourism based on a balanced program of cultural and
natural heritage conservation, infrastructure investment, and tourism development and training in Gansu
Province.

Gansu Province contains significant portions of the ancient Silk Road and the western-most sites of the Great
Wall. Today, it is one of the poorest provinces in China and is targeted by the government for development
with a strategy that includes sustainable tourism. The project is financing investments in six municipalities at
nine high-priority cultural and natural heritage sites. These sites include the Great Wall, Buddhist grottoes,
archaeological and tomb sites, historic trading and administrative towns, and national parks and scenic areas.

The project supports (1) research, conservation, interpretation, and presentation of cultural and natural as-
sets; (2) investment in physical infrastructure that raises local standards of living and has a high potential to
promote local economic development through tourism; (3) institutional strengthening and capacity building,
including training of site managers, staff, and local residents in cultural heritage conservation, site manage-
ment, and tourism development; and (4) implementation of several key tourism and cultural heritage conser-
vation studies designed to assist the provincial and local governments to protect cultural assets and develop a
sustainable tourism industry in Gansu.
