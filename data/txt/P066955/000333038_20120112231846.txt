1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal, Chinese cities had been undergoing breathtaking growth and
transformation, both economically and physically, for two decades. As rapid urban economic
growth was expected to continue well into the future, the pressure for further expansion of
infrastructure was set to continue. In addition to the singular focus on expansion, greater attention
was given to broader and more qualitative issues of sustainability, efficiency, and equity.

Rapid industrialization and urban growth were also increasing the concern over environmental
sustainability. The government had begun taking a more forceful position regarding
environmental protection starting in the late 1980s. This helped direct extensive resources to
environmental protection and industrial renovation, and as a result, the growth of industrial
pollution slowed and, in many large cities, was reversed. The State Council’s “Circular on
Strengthening Urban Water Supply, Water Saving and Water Pollution Prevention and Control
(2000)? set the policy agenda for 2000–2010, for: (a) improving water supply planning and
promoting water conservation; (b) enforcing the “Law on Water Pollution Prevention and Control?
by aiming for at least a 60% urban wastewater treatment rate by 2010; (c) promoting market-
oriented tariff reforms to help attract private capital; and (d) improving sector governance and
regulation.

Zhejiang embarked on a priority program to upgrade wastewater services in the important
industrial port city of Ningbo, and solid waste services in the provincial capital of Hangzhou. In
addition, provincial government plans included improvements to the urban environments of the
historical inner cities in Shaoxing and Cicheng, for which it developed a clear strategy for their
conservation as well as for the development of tourism to promote long-term sustainability and
economic growth.

The provincial government also recognized that technical, institutional, and financial capacities
needed to be strengthened to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the new investments,
and to that end, it promoted corporatization, full-cost recovery, and limited private participation
in infrastructure. These elements – wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste collection,
cultural heritage investments and institutional and financial reforms, were incorporated into the
province’s request for the Zhejiang Urban Development Project in 2002.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective was to assist Zhejiang to: improve waste management and the
urban environment in Ningbo and Hangzhou; and revitalize the historic inner cities in Cicheng
and Shaoxing to facilitate sustainable development and establish a model for conservation of
cultural heritage.

Key performance indicators included quantified targets for reduced water pollution from the
urban areas into rivers, reduced water pollution from the industrial sector, expanded safe solid
waste disposal, improved living conditions in inner cities, reduced level of subsidies for
investments in urban environmental infrastructure, enhanced cultural heritage conservation,
enhanced tourism development, and improved awareness, management and control in urban
planning and environmental protection.


                                                 1
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, four new key indicators were introduced with the addition of
two new components in August 2008 and in December 2009:

    (a) Percentage of visitors satisfied with the accessibility of Shaoxing Yue Kingdom area;
    (b) Percentage of visitors satisfied with environmental cleanliness of Shaoxing Yue Kingdom
    area;
    (c) Ningbo: Jiangnan district wastewater treatment capacity (m3/d); and
    (d) Ningbo: Jiangnan district additional sewers (km)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

At appraisal in 2003, the beneficiaries of ZUEP were the 3.22 million urban residents in
Hangzhou, Ningbo (including Cicheng and Dongqian Lake), and Shaoxing, who would benefit
from improved wastewater and solid waste services, better environment conditions through
improved water quality in rivers, lakes and city canals, and improved housing in the inner-cities.

The project restructurings carried out in 2008 and 2009 directly benefited an additional 550,000
urban residents in Ningbo and Shaoxing. In addition, people living in the Hangzhou Bay area,
including the Zhoushan Archipelago and tourists visiting these areas, also benefited from the new
investments. The final number of beneficiaries is estimated at 4.39 million.

1.5 Original Components

The project comprised seven components as described below.

1. Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in South Jiangdong District of Ningbo Municipality
(Total Cost: US$44.17 million; IBRD: US$26.28 million). This component financed construction
of sewerage trunk infrastructure in South Jiangdong District (43 km pipes and four lift pumping
stations) of Ningbo municipality, including a WWTP (secondary treatment) with a capacity of
160,000 m3/d and discharging into the nearby Yongjiang River. The wastewater flows from
Cicheng town and Dongqian Lake area sewerage systems will be connected to the treatment plant
in South Jiangdong through pumping stations and pressure mains with a length of 12.7 km and
12.5 km, respectively.

2. Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in Zhenhai District of Ningbo Municipality (Total Cost:
US$25.08 million, IBRD US$13.70 million). This component financed construction of sewerage
trunk infrastructure in Zhenhai District (44km of pipes and six lift pumping stations) of Ningbo
municipality, including a WWTP (secondary treatment) with an initial capacity of 30,000m3/d,
discharging to the sea.

3. Infrastructure Upgrading in Cicheng Town in Jiangbei District of Ningbo Municipality
(Total Cost: US$31.64 million, IBRD US$8.53 million). This component financed rehabilitation
and expansion of the traditional road infrastructure (total 12.5 km) with associated underground
infrastructure, sewage collection, pumping main and treatment facilities (10,000 m3/d), a modest
ring road (5km) and bridges along the historic moat around the town, dredging of the moat
(110,000 m3), embankment repairs and flood control structures.



                                                 2
4. Road and Sewerage Infrastructure in Dongqian Lake in Ningbo Municipality (Total Cost:
US$40.48 million, IBRD US$18.89 million). The component financed clean-up of the lake
through interception of wastewater and conveyance to the Jiangdongnan WWTP (about 50 km of
pipes, eight pumping stations, including 12.5 km of pumping main), and improvement of access
to the lake through expansion and rehabilitation of 33 km of the shoreline road system.

5. Housing Renovation, Heritage Conservation & Infrastructure Upgrading in Shaoxing
Historic City Center (Total Cost: US$121.91 million, IBRD US$47.88 million). The component
financed housing renovation and heritage conservation in five historic precincts of the Old Town;
underground infrastructure; canal rehabilitation and flood control; and repairs and widening of
roads, bridges and parks.

6. Expansion of Tianziling Landfill in Hangzhou City (Total cost: US$33.29 million; IBRD
US$7.87 million). The component financed a new landfill and associated facilities, adjacent to
(and partially overlying) the existing Tianziling landfill site. The existing landfill was to be
expanded by 22 million m3 to enable the city to dispose of its garbage safely during the next 25
years, including a leachate treatment plant (1,500 m3/d), and provision of additional equipment
and vehicles to operate the landfill. Facilities for landfill gas recovery and electricity production
were to be provided under a public-private partnership that was engaged for the existing landfill.

7. Institutional Development (Total Cost: US$36.42 million, IBRD US$8.52 million). The
component financed five technical assistance packages as follows: (a) institutional strengthening,
financial reform and management and geographical information systems; (b) design review
advisory and construction management; (c) development of an industrial pollution control action
plan; (d) tourism development and community participation; and (e) heritage conservation and
urban upgrading.

1.6 Revised Components

Two new components were added in 2008 and 2009, through project restructuring, to utilize loan
savings of about US$56 million, accrued mainly due to: (a) advance contracting done to
accelerate completion of improvements in Shaoxing in time for the Seventh National Arts
Festival in 2004; (b) bid prices being lower than appraisal estimates; and (c) reduced contracts
scope and unused contingency provisions. These are:

(a) Rehabilitation of the Yue Kingdom Area in Shaoxing (Added in 2008, total cost US$ 70.39
million; IBRD US$ 26.30 million). The component financed cultural heritage sites in the Yue
Kingdom area including: (a) Fushan Hill landscaping and improvement of public spaces; (b) the
Yue Kingdom Museum, an underground parking garage, and basic underground infrastructure;
and (c) leisure space, and the restoration of historic housing and a temple.

(b) Improvement of Wastewater Services in Jiangnan District of Ningbo (Added in 2009,
total cost US$ 40.2 million; IBRD US$ 31 million). The component financed construction of
sewerage trunk infrastructure in Sanjiang and Beilun areas (45 km pipes and ten lift pumping
stations), and a WWTP (secondary treatment) with a capacity of 160,000 m3/d, with treated
effluent discharging to the Yongjiang River.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Increase in Total Project Cost. Despite the loan savings, and cost reduction due to a change in
the WWTP sludge drying process, the total project cost rose to 159% of the appraisal cost

                                                 3
estimate, from US$ 334.32 million to US$ 529.57 million (see Annex1). The increase was due to:
(a) increased cost of sewer networks for the South Jiangdong WWTP in Ningbo; (b) increased
costs for the Hangzhou landfill due to addition of old landfill closure, procurement of two sets of
landfill gas power generators and upgrading landfill leachate treatment works; and (c)
appreciation of the Yuan against US$. The Dollar: Yuan exchange rate, which was 1:8.28 in
December 2003, dipped to 1:6.40 in June 2011, requiring the project implementation units to
mobilize additional counterpart funds to complete the works.

Amendments to the Legal Agreements. At the request of Borrower, legal agreements were
amended twice, on August 4, 2008 and December 17, 2009, to incorporate the following changes:
(a) adjustment of the content of Category 7 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement to increase the
financing percentage for Civil Works from 50% to 80% for payments made after March 8, 2007,
and before December 1, 2007, and 100% for payments made on and after December 1, 2007, for
works carried out in Shaoxing Municipality and reimbursed after January 1st, 2008; (b) increase
of the disbursement percentage for all remaining civil works in Ningbo to 62%; (c) addition of
five new performance indicators; (d) deletion of the financial covenant for the Dongqian Lake
project sub-component (see Section 2.2); and (e) extension of the loan closing date by 12 months
to June 30, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis. The feasibility study analyzed sector constraints,
investment needs and priorities of the Province and key cities to sustain growth of project cities,
environmental and tourism development objectives, capacity constrains and reforms necessary.
The analysis also considered the linkage to the Zhejiang Multi-cities Development Project
(ZMCDP), completed satisfactorily in 2001, which was the first phase of a comprehensive, two-
stage investment program to: (a) improve water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, and
solid waste management in the four cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing and Wenzhou; and (b)
set up a coherent urban planning and programming framework. The follow-on project (ZUEP)
focused on improving environmental services in Hangzhou, Ningbo and on Shaoxing’s urban
areas, including historic city regeneration.

Key lessons learned from other Bank operations in China and the region, considered during
project formulation, included: (a) economies of scale in wastewater investments; (b) avoidance of
excess capacity creation in wastewater facilities; (c) institutional reforms, improved utility
management, and sustainability; (d) historic city regeneration, tourism development, and income
generation; (e) training for tourism service industry; and (f) participatory planning in historical
city redevelopment.

The project was fully consistent with the 10th Five Year Development Plan of Zhejiang Province,
and supported two main Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) themes of “facilitating rural-urban
transition and sustainable development? and three specific goals of: strengthening environmental
protection, improving resource management, and improving urban management and public
service provision. The project was also consistent with priorities outlined in the cities’ urban and
environmental master plans. International consultants, selected through competitive bidding,
prepared high quality feasibility study reports.

Project Design. The project design was guided and appraised by an experienced task team, and at
key stages, the project was carefully reviewed by peer reviewers with sector, economic and

                                                 4
financial expertise. The project was not overly complex as each project city tackled only one
sector. The project design incorporated a comprehensive capacity building and institutional
strengthening technical assistance (TA) package. These components were fully consistent with
the PDO, even if the PDO became somewhat lengthy. Safeguard requirements were satisfactorily
addressed in conformity with Bank safeguards policies OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP
4.11 (Cultural Property) and OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). Provision was also made to
monitor compliance with EA, EMP, and RAP implementation, by independent monitors funded
under the project. Public consultations were held to discuss environmental management plans and
the resettlement action plans, which were clearly documented in the PAD. Affordability analyses
were carried out to ensure that proposed tariffs were affordable by the poor segments of the
community. However, the monitoring and evaluation system for the project contained certain
performance indicators were not clearly defined (See section 2.3 below).

The Quality of Assurance Group (QAG) did not review quality-at-entry.

Risk Assessment. The project’s risks were appropriately assessed as “modest? at appraisal with
five risks rated “modest? and three rated “substantial?. The first substantial risk was that pollution
sources outside the scope of the project could jeopardize the water quality improvement expected
from the project. This risk was mitigated by implementing plans for control of agri-business in
the Dongqian Lake area, control of industrial pollution upstream of Ningbo city, and
complementary sewerage in Ningbo and Shaoxing cities. The second substantial risk was that
delays in land acquisition and resettlement could affect project implementation. This risk was
adequately mitigated by carrying out community consultations and ensuring timely compensation,
early planning and effective implementation of resettlement. The third substantial risk was that
annual or bi-annual tariff increases for Hangzhou solid waste and Ningbo wastewater companies
would not be approved. The mitigation measure was to carry out annual financial projections for
the companies and introduce financial performance covenants in the legal agreements. Although
sometimes later than expected, tariff increases by Loan closing exceeded appraisal expectations.

2.2 Implementation

Ningbo Wastewater (including Cicheng and Dongqian Lake Sub-Projects). Three out of the
four original Ningbo components: (a) Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in South Jiangdong
District; (b) Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in Zhenhai District; and (c) Road and Sewerage
Infrastructure in Dongqian Lake were satisfactorily completed as planned.

Cicheng Infrastructure Upgrading. Implementation of this component was delayed due to
difficulties encountered in land acquisition and high resettlement cost. They were resolved by
changing the original sewage collection routes to minimize land acquisition and resettlement, and
about 50% of the wastewater collected from the Cicheng old town was transported and treated at
the Beiqu WWTP. The small cultural heritage component in Chicheng was somewhat
downscaled relative to the original plan due to the above-mentioned resettlement difficulties.

Deletion of the Financial Covenant for the Dongqian Lake Sub-Project. The covenant on
Dongqian Lake Investment and Development Company (DLIDC) was deleted as DLIDC changed
its business scope and became a project management company with no independent revenue base.
Dongqian District Government assumed responsibility for loan repayment.

Second Project Restructuring. In April 2008, Ningbo PMO proposed to use accumulated loan
savings of US$23 million and a portion of Shaoxing’s loan savings (US$7.5 million) to construct
the Jiangnan WWTP. The savings arose as a result of: (a) contract savings from implementation

                                                 5
of Cicheng and Dongqian Lake components; (b) reduced contract scope and deleted contracts due
to changes in the cities’ urban plans and technical designs of major contracts; and (c)
implementation of contracts using only local funds. The Jiangnan wastewater component was
appraised in November 2008, and the second restructuring for Ningbo was approved on
December 17, 2009, including a 12-month extension of the Loan closing date.

Hangzhou Tianziling Landfill Expansion. During the period of December 2008 to July 2009,
HSWC developed the “Tianziling method of landfill operations? which used a high density
polyethylene (HDPE) membrane cover instead of soil cover, introduced a portable steel working
platform, and segregated clean and polluted run-off, which enabled better control of polluted run-
off. The Tianziling method has been incorporated in the National Standards for Municipal Solid
Waste Sanitary Landfill Operation and Maintenance, as an example of best practice.

Sustainability of the Hangzhou Solid Waste Company. HSWC was not able to meet its financial
covenants during the first few years of implementation due to the very low tipping fee of
RMB15.00/ton, which did not cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The tipping fee
was first increased to RMB45.10/ton in 2007, and then to RMB60/ton effective in January 2009,
enabling it to substantially meet the covenant.

In 2009, HMG decided not to pursue a new investment for solid waste incineration, but rather to
increase the solid waste disposed at the landfill to improve its financial performance and enable it
to meet the covenants for both Cost Recovery Ratio (CRR) and Debt Service Coverage Ratio
(DSCR) that year. According to 2009 data, Hangzhou generated an average of 5,500 t/d of solid
waste, of which half was disposed at the landfill. Based on this increased rate of landfilling, the
estimated lifespan of the landfill will be reduced from 25 years to about ten years unless other
actions are taken to reduce waste generation, and optimize landfill operations. In 2009, the Bank
suggested that HSWC starts a pilot “3-Rs? (Recycle, Reuse and Reduction) campaign to reduce
the amount of solid waste to be disposed of. This suggestion was implemented by HSWC, and the
success of the 3-Rs program will be evaluated in 2012. Upon the closure of the old Tianziling
landfill, HSWC developed part of it into an ecological and educational park, and HSWC has
started free guided tours for the public. Visitors have an excellent view of the old landfill site as
well as the new operating landfill. In 2008, about 5,600 visitors toured the old landfill park, which
also produces electrical power for about 8,000 households from the recovered landfill gas. (See
Annex 9, section 3, picture one.)

Shaoxing Historical City-Center Development and Conservation, Shift in financing and
First Restructuring. Shaoxing City was selected to host the Seventh National Arts Festival,
which committed the city to improve its appearance and facilities before September 2004. To
meet this deadline, Shaoxing City decided to accelerate implementation of 10 out of 13 contracts
in the component using only domestic funds, thereby bypassing the time required for contract
reviews and approvals by the Bank. Consequently, about US$33 million of the US$44 million
Bank loan allocated to Shaoxing became available for other investments. At the Mid-term Review,
in June 2007, the Shaoxing PMO proposed to use US$25.5 million of its loan savings for the
rehabilitation of the Yue Kingdom area. The new component was successfully appraised, and the
project restructuring was approved on August 4, 2008.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The original M&E design contained several monitoring indicators with unclear
definitions and inconsistencies. New monitoring indicators, with clearer definitions, focused more
on outcomes, were formally integrated into M&E design during the two restructurings. For the

                                                 6
new investment components, additional monitoring indicators were developed (See section 1.3
above). However, an indicator to monitor progress in implementing the industrial pollution
control was not included, even though NMG implemented most of the recommendations of the
IPCAP.

Implementation. Monitoring was carried out primarily through monitoring of the agreed
outcomes and output performance indicators, keeping track of progress of physical, financial, and
EMP aspects, which were reported in the semi-annual progress reports. External resettlement
monitoring reports were prepared and submitted by independent consultants annually. A reliable
flow of M&E information during implementation enabled the Bank team to assess the
performance of project components and their potential sustainability. Monitoring data was
assembled by the respective agencies, namely, NSCL, HWSC, DLIDC, and the Environmental
Protection Bureaus. Visitor satisfaction with environmental cleanliness and accessibility of the
Yue Kingdom area was monitored by SHPCMO through ticket sales and sample surveys

Utilization. The data and information generated were utilized by the local governments for
planning future environmental infrastructure investments; enhancing the sustainability of HSWC
and NSCL; planning urban development and industry location policy; planning interventions to
improve water quality in the rivers flowing to Hangzhou Bay; developing strategies for increasing
tourism and income enhancements for local communities; and formulating policies and
regulations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social Safeguards. All resettlement activities were carried out satisfactorily. External
resettlement monitoring was carried out by Hohai University/Eastern China Hydro power Design
Institute regularly in accordance with the PA. Implementation progress reports prepared by
provincial and local PMOs were submitted annually. Resettlement assessment reports showed
that implementation was completed successfully and that the standards of living of the PAPs
improved. The total population affected by the project was 7,025 people (including 2,397 people
affected by the land use and 4,628 people affected by house demolition). 141.92 hectares of land
were permanently acquired and 161,064 m2 of buildings were demolished. The final RAP cost
was RMB1.12 billion, about 23% higher than the original RAP cost estimate of RMB910.34
million, mainly due to: (a) additional land acquisition under the Jiangnan wastewater component;
(b) additional residential houses demolished under the Tianziling Landfill; and (c) increased
compensation rates.

Environmental Safeguards. This project was appropriately designated as a Category A project.
An Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were
prepared, and disclosed in accordance with Bank and Chinese national policies and regulations.
During implementation, the project was managed well in terms of observing OP4.01, as
supported by the findings of Bank supervision missions and the regular progress reports on EMP
implementation. The project management offices (PMO) had dedicated staff for environmental
management, and all proposed mitigation measures were appropriately incorporated into the
contracts for implementation. Environmental monitoring was carried out by respectively
environmental monitoring station of Ningbo, Shaoxing and Hangzhou periodically in accordance
with the EMP. The PMOs responded promptly to all suggestions and comments from the Bank
regarding EMP implementation. Additional EAs were prepared for the components added during
the restructurings, and they were also complied with satisfactorily.



                                               7
Cultural Property Safeguards. The project triggered the cultural property safeguard (OPN
11.03). The project design met the requirements of OPN 11.03 and the spirit of what became the
Cultural Property Safeguard, OP 4.11. The project had positive impacts on cultural heritage
conservation through provision of investments, technical assistance and careful preparation by
qualified institutes to ensure that the project would meet safeguard requirements and Chinese
laws and regulations.

Procurement. Procurement was carried out in accordance with the Bank’s Procurement
Guidelines in a generally satisfactory manner.

Financial Management. Appropriate financial management arrangements were put in place to
ensure proper use and accounting of project funds. Project audit reports were provided for the
entire implementation period. Financial management was carried out satisfactorily throughout
project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

All PIUs of the project are responsible for the post completion operations of their investments.
The PIUs will continue to use the monitoring indicators established under the project to monitor,
evaluate and adjust activities to maximize the sustainability of the quality of the urban
environment, heritage conservation, and social and economic development.

The full transfer of assets of the old solid waste company, including non-operating assets (the old
landfill site), to HSWC was not achieved, even though it was covenanted in the Project
Agreement. However, partly to improve HSWC’s financial performance and for taxation reasons,
an agreement between HMG and HSWC was executed in 2009 to swap assets leaving only
operating assets on HSWC’s balance sheet, and HSWC will continue as the solid waste company
in Hangzhou after the closure of the landfill in the next ten to15 years. The possibility of listing
the company is also being considered.
With the reduction in the life of the Tianziling landfill due to its increased utilization, and the
difficulties of locating suitable landfill sites close to the city, HSWC will seriously examine other
options for waste management such as incineration, waste reduction, recycling, and reuse. The
results of a pilot “3-Rs? (Recycle, Reuse and Reduction) program commenced under the project
will be reviewed in 2012. Early closure of the landfill will have an impact on HSWC’s financial
planning, as the maturity of the Bank’s loan and the last payment may lie beyond the date of
closure for the landfill.

The preparation of annual financial projections, commenced under the project, will continue in
NSCL and HSWC, and will be used for decisions and actions to improve their sustainability. The
municipal governments will implement tariff increases, according to established procedures, to
ensure that tariff increments are adequate to meet, at least, operation and maintenance costs of the
assets of NSCL and HSWC. The next tariff increase is expected in about 2013.

In terms of cultural heritage conservation and sustainable inner city development, the
exposure to international best practice through project-supported training, TA and study tours, as
well as hands-on project experience have broadened the skills and perspectives of leaders and
professionals in Shaoxing and Cicheng. In Shaoxing, the PIU became the Shaoxing Historic City
Management Office after closing. PIU staff that benefited from the capacity building under the
project will be able to apply their knowledge and expertise to the long-term management of the
renovated historic neighborhoods. Sustainability of urban revitalization will be further supported


                                                 8
by the expansion of this office’s focus to include the development of tourism and related
economic opportunities for Shaoxing residents.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

The project development objective (PDO) was highly relevant at appraisal, and remained relevant
through to completion. The PDO was directly linked to the two main Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) themes which were key development priorities, notably: (a) strengthening environmental
protection and natural resource management; and (b) improving urban management and public
service provision. Design of the physical components and their associated TAs and training
proved effective in achieving the PDOs. They are also consistent with the Bank’s prevailing
social and environmental safeguards policies and fiduciary requirements.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

The project satisfactorily achieved the project development objectives, as elaborated below.

Enhancement of efficiency and equity of waste management in Ningbo (wastewater) and
Hangzhou (solid waste) municipalities.

(a)Municipal wastewater treatment capacity in Ningbo increased from 290,000 m3/d in 2003 to
540,000 m3/d (350,000 m3/d created under ZUEP) in 2010, and the coverage of urban
wastewater collection increased from 27% in 2003 to 83% in 2010. Water quality in Dongqian
Lake improved from Class V to Class III following interception and conveyance of wastewater to
existing treatment plants.

 (b) Industrial pollution control in Ningbo was strengthened with the NMG implementing the
recommendations of the industrial wastewater pollution control action plan developed under the
project. Government required that: (i) key industries should meet national integrated wastewater
discharge standards prior to entry to sewers, and 80% of sources monitored by flight inspection
should meet discharge standard; (ii) enterprises that account for more than 90% of total pollution
load should install online monitoring equipment connected to the EPB; (iii) a pollutant discharge
permit system should be established , and enterprises should not discharge without permits or
exceed the allowed emission amount; (iv) polluting industries located upstream of drinking water
sources should relocate or close down; and (v) enterprises should implement water conservation
measures.

All the above targets were enforced and achieved. By the end of 2010, a 50% reduction in water
consumption per unit of industrial value-added was achieved; water consumption was
18.6m3/RMB 10,000 in 2010, which is half the consumption of the 2005 baseline.

(c) Urban solid waste collection and disposal in Hangzhou improved with expansion of the
sanitary landfill by 22 million m/3 and construction of a leachate treatment system of 1,500 m3/d.
These works allowed the coverage of solid waste collection and disposal to increase from 77% in


                                                9
2003 to 100% in 2005 in Hangzhou’s core urban area, Xiaoshan and Yuhang Districts. A further
benefit was the introduction of power generation (7,200 MWh) from recovered landfill gas. As
described in section 2.2, a notable innovation was the “Tianziling method of landfill operations?
to reduce odor and leachate production. This method was adopted in the National Standards of
Municipal Solid Waste Sanitary Landfill Operation and Maintenance.

(d) Efficiency and sustainability of NSCL and HSWC improved with the significant advances
made towards becoming autonomous companies; they own and operate all the assets, and
achieved a high level of financial and management autonomy by the end of the project. By
project completion, reform of NSCL was successfully achieved. NSCL complied with the cost
recovery ratio and debt service coverage ratio covenants, as required in the legal agreements.
HSWC has been in compliance with the financial covenants since 2009.

Redevelopment of the historic inner cities of Shaoxing and Cicheng and establishing a
model for conservation of cultural heritage in other Chinese cities. The highly successful
redevelopment of the historic inner cities of Shaoxing and Cicheng established a model for
conservation of cultural heritage in other Chinese cities. The integrated approach to housing
renovation, heritage conservation and infrastructure upgrading, incorporated the goals of urban
heritage conservation, social and economic development by conserving and upgrading the urban
landscape in historic areas. The renovation preserved the vibrant community, their water-based
lifestyle and the unique character of the historic inner city, which has become a tourist attraction
with resulting economic benefits to the communities who are now able to provide a range of
tourism-related services. Renovation of the traditional Ming and Qing Dynasty housing using
designs, specifications and materials sensitive to the historic environment, urban infrastructure,
traditional roads, canals (and the improved water quality from Class V to Class IV), and
landscaping, improved the environment and living conditions of the residents, and created an
environment attractive to tourists. About 2,290 households (about 20,000 people) benefited
directly from the residential upgrading, and about 80% have made additional investments to
upgrade their houses.

The renovation of the historic neighborhood in the Yue Kingdom area included development of a
major museum for artifacts, pathways improvements and landscaping around the Fushan Hill,
which attracts about 10,000 people per day on average. Visitor satisfaction with the accessibility
and environmental cleanliness of the Yue Kingdom area increased from 40% and 44%
(respectively) in 2008 to 65% for both in 2010.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory

Economic. As many of the benefits, particularly those relating to environmental and public health
improvement, could not be quantified, no cost benefit analysis or economic rate of return (ERR)
for the project components was carried out at appraisal. The choice of priority interventions for
the project was guided by cost effectiveness analysis and use of the least cost methodology.
Alternative project designs were identified and evaluated to select the least cost solution for
inclusion in the project. The analysis of alternatives in project design included consideration of
alternatives for: sites for the landfill; wastewater treatment processes; dimensioning of pipe
diameters; and centralized versus decentralized treatment. Additionally, average incremental
costs (AIC), in both economic and financial terms, were calculated and compared to average
tariffs, in constant terms, to evaluate the subsidy element of the project components. Incremental


                                                10
costs and outputs were calculated for the “with project? and “without project? scenarios. The
economic costs for the components were determined by making adjustments to the components’
financial costs.

Even factoring the increased costs, each component achieved the expected benefits, and more, at
project completion. Beneficiaries of the Ningbo wastewater component increased from 0.6
million at appraisal to 1.02 million at completion, representing a 70% increase. Beneficiaries of
the Hangzhou Tianziling Landfill expansion were 3.2 million people, which was 12% more than
the appraisal target of 2.6 million people, and about 8,000 households now receive electricity
produced from gas recovered from the old landfill. The number of beneficiaries of the Shaoxing
inner city regeneration rose from 20,000 people at appraisal, to 0.17 million by project
completion. As a result of the overall improvements in the neighborhoods in Shaoxing, property
values also went up from RMB4,000/m2 to about RMB6,000/m2 in 2010 on average. These
satisfactory results can also be added to the project’s numerous non-quantifiable social and
environment benefits.
Financial. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Hangzhou Solid Waste component,
calculated to 1.3% at appraisal, was below the cost of capital. It was not possible to verify the
FIRR at the end of the project as the actual project costs are higher than the estimated project
costs at appraisal. Using the projected costs at appraisal, the calculated FIRR can only be
achieved by using more than the twenty years projected life of the landfill, which is longer than
the landfill’s current expected shortened life of ten years. For the wastewater component in
Ningbo, the FIRR was not calculated at appraisal because the concept of incremental revenue was
not found fully applicable. Part of the wastewater revenues are derived from tariffs levied on
water users who do not contribute wastewater to the system.

Financial projections were prepared at appraisal for both HSWC and NSCL to analyze their
financial viability. In 2010, financial performance of HSWC was meeting the projected financial
performance at appraisal, including levels of EBITDA (actual RMB13 million against projected
RMB18 million), EBIT (actual RMB9 million against projected RMB5 million) and EBT (actual
RMB8 million against projected RMB3 million). The level of tipping fee for 2010 reached
almost the projected level (actual RMB60/t against projected RMB63/t). In 2010, the financial
performance of the company further complied with the covenanted ratios of Cost Recovery
(actual 1.1 against covenanted value of 1.0) and Debt Service Ratio (actual 2.5 against
covenanted value of 1.3).

The income of NSCL is generally affected by the NMG’s strategy of collecting wastewater tariffs.
To implement an optimized taxation strategy, part of the tariffs collected is allocated to the
company as loan capital, which at a later stage, will be converted to equity. The main part,
corresponding to the amount of treated wastewater, is allocated to the company as revenue. The
allocation strategy has resulted in a weaker income statement than projected and the Company
has, in its own financial projections, adjusted its income statement for the allocation strategy.
While the official income statement for 2010 shows losses and a weaker performance against the
financial projections at appraisal, the adjusted income statement shows that the Company met the
projected financial performance, including levels of EBITDA (actual RMB149 million against
projected RMB85 million), EBIT (actual RMB86 million against projected RMB12million) and
EBT (actual RMB91 million against projected RMB3 million). The level of wastewater tariffs
for 2010 reached the projected level (actual RMB1.2/m3 against projected RMB0.8/m3). The
adjusted income overall was in full compliance with the covenanted ratios of Cost Recovery
(2010 actual 1.6 against covenanted value of 1.0) and Debt Service Ratio (2010 actual 8.7 against
covenanted value of 1.3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is assessed as satisfactory because the PDOs remained
relevant throughout implementation, they were satisfactorily achieved; the economic benefits
were realized; and financial sustainability was substantially achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The project did not have an
explicit poverty reduction theme, gender aspects, or social development theme. However, it did
improve the living environment for the broader population in the three cities, including women
and the poor who benefited from better sanitation services, and improved opportunities for
income enhancement from the extensive construction activities, and the increased number of
tourists visiting Ningbo, Hangzhou and Shaoxing.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project served as a catalyst for institutional reform by establishing financially autonomous
utility companies that were able to manage and operate efficiently and effectively the assets
placed under their ownership. Two key reforms introduced through the project, considered
pioneering at time, were: (i) the separation of government functions (policy, regulation,
oversight) from municipal utility and service delivery functions; and (ii) the establishment of
financial and managerial autonomy for NSCL and HSWC. The project also helped NMG to adopt
the total pollution control concept to pollution management through integrating industrial
pollution control with municipal wastewater management, and implementing the
recommendations of the industrial pollution control action plan (IPCAP) through the
Environmental Protection Bureau.

The historic city revitalization provided local officials and planners with exposure and access to
international experts and extensive research, analysis, strategies, guidelines and action plans for
heritage conservation, cultural tourism development and revitalization of historic urban areas.
The analysis and planning for tourism development helped city leaders to recognize the linkage
between sound urban development (access and mobility, telecommunications, green space, etc.)
and returns from tourism development, in addition to developing specific tourist sites. As a result,
planners restructured their approach to tourism and broadened their attention to development of
the city as a whole, rather than focusing on individual tourism sites.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Two notable and positive unintended outcomes were: (i) Hangzhou experimented with solid
waste reduction, recycling and reuse, to explore alternatives to landfilling; and (ii) at least 80% of
households in the historic inner cities made additional investments to upgrade their housing,
further improving the appearance of their neighborhoods.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Modest

HSWC’s investment program could be at risk if HMG does not inject more capital into HSWC’s
investment program, and support HSWC’s efforts to attain sustainability. HMG’s commitment to
improve solid waste management, the 2009 increase in the tipping fee, and the continued
exploration of solid waste reduction strategies would make this risk low.

There is a risk of illegal wastewater discharges from industries in the catchment area of the
project that could adversely affect water quality in the rivers and lakes. This risk is moderate
because of NMG’s commitment to control water pollution; implementation of recommendations
of the IPCAP including the pollution source database and the catchment management plan; and
the recognition of the linkage between surface water quality, economic development and potential
returns from tourism development.

Visitor dissatisfaction with facilities, access, and environmental cleanliness in Yue Kingdom area
could decline with the number of visitors that are expected. Adequate safeguards of staff and
budget will continue to be allocated to maintain acceptable environmental conditions, to reduce
this risk, which is considered low.

With the utilization of the M&E framework formulated under the project, project cities will have
adequate instruments to manage any unforeseen risks. Zhejiang is a strong province with a
reputation for sound environmental management, and a strong financial base and capacity.
Further proof of dedication of local governments to reduce, recycle and reuse solid waste, being
experimented with in Hangzhou, is the proposed Ningbo Solid Waste Recycling Project, currently
under preparation for World Bank financing.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank took extra care and time (nearly two years) to ensure that the project design addressed
priority interventions to sustain growth of key cities in the Municipality. Project design addressed
pollution control in a comprehensive manner, through inclusion of an industrial pollution control
action plan (IPCAP) that was to be implemented by NMG, in parallel with the Bank-financed
project. However, the design of the IPCAP lacked firm milestones and targets, even though NMG
implemented most of the key recommendations.

The project’s reform agenda aimed to improve financial management and institutional autonomy,
and demonstrate the imperatives of market pricing and cost recovery for environmental services.
At the same time, the project’s affordability analysis ensured that lower income groups could
afford the new wastewater and solid waste tariffs. The Bank also ensured that fiduciary
arrangements were adequate and safeguards issues were fully addressed.

The Bank ensured that design preparation was supported by international consultants, and
incorporated best practices in technology, financial viability and least cost solutions, to achieve

                                                13
development objectives, and produce a project design that was technically, financially and
economically sound. The Bank engaged a world class cultural heritage expert to guide the team to
design of the cultural heritage conservation component.

Two minor weaknesses in Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry were: (a) difference
between the Loan Agreement and the PAD in the language used to describe the project
development objective, although both are substantively identical; and (b) certain M&E
monitoring indicators contained unclear definitions and inconsistencies, and lack of an indicator
to track government performance in implementing the industrial pollution action plan.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Despite having three Bank task team leaders in seven years of project implementation, excellent
working relationships were maintained with all parties concerned (Provincial PMO, local PMOs
and PIUs, design institutes, tendering agents). The Bank took timely action to restructure the
project to utilize loan savings to enhance project development objectives. The Bank was prompt
and firm in decision-making to maintain the projects’ focus, and address the difficult issues of
land acquisition and resettlement, process change orders, and project restructuring. Design
weaknesses in the M&E framework were recognized early, and action was taken to correct them.

When it became apparent that the projected landfill life would be curtailed to about ten years and
alternative landfill sites were difficult to find, the Bank advised HMG to explore other measures
to reduce the volume of waste that would need to be disposed. This led to HMG launching the “3-
Rs? (Recycle, Reuse and Reduction) program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory based on satisfactory quality at entry,
supervision and satisfactory achievement of outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

A strong impetus to both preparation and implementation was provided by the commitment of
central and local governments at all levels, which not only provided both loan and counterpart
funding in a timely manner, but actively coordinated project preparation and implementation.
There was notable involvement of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and National Development
Reform Commission (NDRC) as full project partners at the central level. Provincial and local
governments ensured that the Provincial PMO and the local level PMOs were adequately
financed, fully staffed and effective. The strong support and swift actions of MoF, NDRC, and
the provincial and municipal governments regarding the two restructurings to use the entire loan
savings deserve praise.



                                               14
Agreement to include a large and comprehensive technical assistance package in the project was a
testament to the commitment and progressive thinking of the Province, including the IPCAP that
was implemented by the Ningbo EPB. In turn, local governments embraced the project’s
institutional reforms, and provided the necessary funding to sustain operations, including non-
Bank financed activities, e.g., the Dongqian Lake Catchment Management Plan, Industrial
Pollution Control Action Plan, and complementary secondary sewerage in Ningbo City,
Dongqian Lake and Shaoxing City.

HMG approved an adequate tipping fee late in the project in 2009, to enable HSWC to meet the
financial performance covenant. Local governments made available the significant additional
counterpart funding to meet the increased costs and complete the original components on time.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of implementing agencies in completing detailed designs, design reviews,
procurement administration, construction quality control, implementation of safeguards measures,
etc., was satisfactory. Most of the original components were completed before the original loan
closing date. The quality of monitoring and reporting on the project’s outcome and output
indicators was good.

NSCL, a newly established autonomous company, completed the original wastewater component
in 2008, and the third Jiangnan WWTP (160,000 m3/d ) and collection network, added in 2009,
with a one year extension of the loan closing date. NSCL complied with the project financial
performance covenants.

The newly established HSWC completed construction, and started operating the new landfill in
2006. HSWC also developed the “Tainziling Method of Landfill Operations? which was
incorporated into the “National Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Operation and
Maintenance?. HSWC complied with the financial performance covenant starting in 2009, when
HMG approved the tipping fee of Y 60/ton. HSWC started a pilot waste recycling program as
part of its strategy to reduce waste requiring disposal in landfills or incinerators.

The Shaoxing Historical Precinct Conservation Management Office (HPCMO) demonstrated its
competency to deliver the Shaoxing conservation component at great speed in time for the 2004
Arts Festival. Outputs were of high quality, in compliance with all project covenants, and
fiduciary requirements, and were delivered in a satisfactory manner. The rehabilitation of the Yue
Kingdom conservation area was satisfactorily completing within two years.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Tianziling Method of Landfill Operation is very effective in reducing leachate generation,
preventing odor and increasing the lifespan of the investment. The “Tianziling method of
landfill operations?, developed by HSWC, controls surface water runoff entry and ground water

                                               15
entering the landfill by introducing a HDPE membrane cover instead of the generally used soil
cover. This method reduces leachate generation and cost of landfilling, prevents odor, and
increases the life of the landfill.

Strategy for Comprehensive Pollution Control. Inclusion of industrial pollution action plan
(IPCAP) in ZUEP addressed pollution control in a comprehensive manner, and included: a
licensing and permit system for industry pollution control; database of pollution types and
sources; industrial pollution monitoring program; water conservation; and catchment pollution
control plan.

Conservation in urban areas should involve community consultation and incorporate
community needs. ZUEP created many positive synergies and outcomes through its integrated
approach to heritage conservation, infrastructure and housing improvements and urban planning.
However, in order to develop fully articulated models for the Chinese context, four areas for
further improvement are: (a) participatory planning should more proactively involve citizens; (b)
adaptive reuse of historic buildings should create venues for serving community needs and/or
creating economic activity; (c) the interpretation of cultural heritage sites should be enhanced to
increase appreciation and understanding of local residents and visitors1; and (d) sustainable post-
conservation management and maintenance for historic properties and urban areas should be
included in planning and budgets.

Cultural heritage conservation should be linked to local economic development. Project
experience in China has found that local communities, especially the poor, often have little
appreciation for what tourists want or need. Services and souvenirs are generally of low quality
and provide only small incomes. Related training provided by government entities/Associations
often lags the most current approaches. In order to generate sustainable economic opportunities
based on cultural heritage conservation and tourism, project planning and design should include
specific attention to useful training, sound planning and realistic investments.

The Bank has a unique comparative advantage in historic city revitalization in its ability to
assemble multi-disciplinary teams to promote an integrated approach necessary for
successful conservation Sustainable historic city revitalization requires a holistic approach, and
the Bank has the unique ability to assemble multi-disciplinary task teams to design and supervise
projects using this approach. The Bank is also distinct from most conservation and tourism
organizations in its ability to set projects within a development and poverty reduction context.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

ZUEP was a big success through borrower’s sincere cooperation with the World Bank team in
solid waste disposal, wastewater collection and treatment and historical city redevelopment.
PPMO and local PMOs propose introduction of Bank loan into Zhejiang infrastructure
improvement could be more effective from focusing on finance to focusing on providing more
wide view, more international lessons and experiences, through which the borrower could have

development in terms of environmental, social and economic aspects

Good Cooperation between All Levels of Government and the Bank. Good cooperation
between all levels of governments and the Bank contributed to successful project preparation and
implementation. It also led to earlier realization of problems and difficulties which might
jeopardize project development objectives or delay project implementation and completion.

                 plan;

Notes:
(i) In 2009, HMG decided not to pursue a new investment for garbage incineration, but rather to
increase the quantity of solid waste disposed at the landfill. By avoiding this investment cost,
HSWC was able to improve its financial performance and it met its covenants for both Cost
Recovery Ratio and Debt Service Coverage Ratio.

(ii) As the transfer of non-operating assets (land and some facilities) would trigger a significant
tax liability, Hangzhou SWC decided to only transfer the operating assets of Tianziling Landfill
#1. The assets swap happened in 2009.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

                        CHINA: Zhejiang Urban Environment Project

Economic Analysis. As many of the benefits, particularly those relating to environmental and
public health improvement could not be quantified, no cost benefit analysis and economic rate of
return (ERR) for project components were carried out at appraisal. The selection of priority
interventions for the project was guided by cost effectiveness analysis and using least cost
methodology. Alternative project designs were identified and evaluated in order to select the least
cost solution for incorporation into the project. The analysis of alternative project design
included: analysis of alternative sites for the landfill, selection of treatment processes,
dimensioning of pipe diameter and choice of centralized versus decentralized treatment, etc.
Additionally, average incremental costs (AIC) in both economic and financial terms were
calculated, and compared to average tariffs, in constant terms, to evaluate the subsidy element of
the project components. Incremental costs and outputs were calculated from the difference
between a “with project? scenario and the “without project? scenario. The economic costs for the
components were determined by making adjustments to the component’s financial costs. In
general, the levels of tariffs projected were based on implemented tariffs for both the solid waste
and the wastewater components.

At project completion, the expected benefit targets of each subproject were achieved, and
sometimes exceeded. Increases in the number of beneficiaries were: (a) Ningbo wastewater
component: 1.02 million people compared to the appraisal target of 0.6 million people; (b)
Hangzhou solid waste component: 3.20 million people compared to the appraisal target of 2.60
million people; and (c) Shaoxing Historical City-Center Development and Conservation:
increased from 0.02 million people at appraisal to 0.17 million people at project completion. In
addition, due to the overall improvements in the neighborhoods in Shaoxing, property values
increased from RMB4,000/m2 to RMB6,000/m2in 2010.These satisfactory results can also be
added to the numerous non-quantifiable social and environment benefits.

Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the FIRR for the Hangzhou solid waste component was calculated at 1.3%, which
was below the cost of capital. It has not been possible to compare the FIRR for Hangzhou solid
waste component at the end of the project, as project costs were higher than costs estimated at
appraisal. However, using the projected costs alone, the FIRR can be achieved by including more
than 20 years projected life in the calculations, which is longer than the landfill’s current expected
life of ten years before closure. For the Ningbo wastewater component, the FIRR was not
calculated at appraisal because the concept of incremental revenue was not fully applicable.
Ningbo wastewater revenue is relying partly on wastewater tariff levied from water not treated,
i.e., water consumers who do not discharge wastewater to the city system.

End of project entity level financial analyses were conducted for the wastewater component in
Ningbo and the solid waste component in. The financial performance of the companies was
covenanted in the legal agreements and comprised two financial covenants for both of the
companies: Cost Recovery Ratio (CRR); and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).

Financial Sustainability of Solid Waste Operations in Hangzhou. An essential goal for the
project in Hangzhou was to develop and implement a comprehensive reform program within solid
waste operation in Hangzhou, including financial autonomy for HSWC. As such, it was expected
to be responsible for its own revenue stream through application of utility company tariffs.

                                                 23
HSWC’s revenue came from two main sources: (a) tipping fee charged for tipping solid waste at
landfill #2; and (b) allocation of funds from Hangzhou Municipal Finance Bureau to cover other
costs including the costs related to the operation of landfill #1.

The tipping fee was levied on all trucks disposing of solid waste at the landfill site. The district
governments, in turn, were responsible for charging fees on residents. The tipping fee collection
rate is currently 100%. Collection and transport to the landfill were not covered by the tipping fee,
but by other chargeable tariffs. The tipping fee at project start was RMB15.00/ton, which was
insufficient to cover the costs of operation and maintenance. The fee was first increased to
RMB45.10/ton, and then RMB60/ton effective January 2009.

As a result of the late revision of the tipping fees, the overall financial development of the
company was not fully satisfactory in the first years of operation. However, since 2009 the
company has reached a satisfactory level due to adjusted tariffs and increased volumes of solid
waste disposed at the landfill. The decision to stop further expansion of the incineration capacity
in Hangzhou facilitated the development towards improved financial performance, as it increased
the amount of solid waste disposed at the landfill site.

The issue of transfer of assets from the old company to the new HSWC was discussed at length
with the Bank, as a full transfer of all assets (including non-operating assets at the old landfill)
was covenanted in the Project Agreement. However, partly to improve HSWCs financial
performance and for taxations reasons, an agreement between HMG and HSWC was reached in
2008 to swap assets, leaving only operating assets on HSWC’s balance sheet. The swap needs to

                                                 25
be viewed in the context that HSCW will continue to operate as the solid waste company in
Hangzhou after the closure of the landfill, which will occur in the next ten years. Moreover,
consideration of a possible listing of the company in the stock market, will require streamlining of
income, balance sheet and cash-flow. The early closure of the landfill will have an impact on
HSWC’s financial planning, as the maturity of the Bank’s loan and the last payment lies beyond
the date of closure for the landfill.

Financial Sustainability of Wastewater Services in Ningbo. NSCL is financially autonomous,
and is expected to be responsible for its own revenue stream through application of utility
company tariffs. The revenue of NSCL is derived from two main sources: (a) wastewater tariffs
collected by Ningbo Water Supply Company and distributed to the various wastewater companies
operating in Ningbo; and (b) allocation of funds from Ningbo Municipality covering the costs of
operation of the storm water system and the investments made, e.g., sewers.

The original wastewater tariff, introduced along with the first wastewater treatment plant in 1999,
was Y 0.08/m3, which remained throughout project preparation. The tariff was first increased to a
level of (weighted average) RMB 0.38/m3 in 2004, and several times after that to reach its current
level of Y 1.20/m3 in 2010.

The tariffs projected were all presented in the PAD.

As presented above the company has been able to revise the tariffs to reach a level higher than
projected at appraisal. The increased tariff level is partly to cover additional investment activities.

Income in the audited financial statements of the Company has been impacted by the collected
wastewater tariff allocation strategy, which is controlled by NMG. To implement an optimized
taxation strategy, part of the tariffs collected was allocated to the company as loan capital, while
only a part corresponding to the amount of treated water was allocated as revenue. The loan
portion will be converted to equity at a later stage. The reallocation has resulted in a weaker
income statement, while fully meeting the financial covenants of Cost Recovery Ratio and Debt
Service Coverage Ratio. Adjusted for the allocation strategy, the income of the company during
its lifetime was adequate to remain fully in compliance with the financial covenants. The adjusted
income results in an improved financial performance, which is partly due to the fact that the
company receives wastewater tariffs collected from all residents of the districts, and not only
from those covered by wastewater treatment. Compliance with the covenanted financial ratios is
presented below.

*Adjusted ratios taking into account that the part of wastewater tariffs levied from water not treated is
allocated NSCL as loan capital later to be converted to equity.

The DSCR was high during the loan grace period years up to 2010, when repayment was initiated.
This concerns especially the adjusted financial performance, where additional funds from tariff
collection are allocated to the company to cater for improvements to the wastewater system in
Ningbo.

As a result of the increases in wastewater tariffs, the overall financial situation of the company
has developed positively during the life of the project. This position has been achieved despite the
heavy additional investments being made during the project period.

                            CHINA: Zhejiang Urban Environment Project

ZUEP supported eight sub-projects which had resettlement activities. These eight sub-projects
were (a) Ningbo South Jiangdong sewerage and wastewater treatment; (b) Ningbo Zhenhai
sewerage and wastewater treatment; (c) Ningbo Cicheng infrastructure development; (d) Ningbo
Dongqian Lake infrastructure development; (e) Shaoxing historic city-center development and
conservation; (f) Hangzhou Tianziling landfill expansion; (g) Shaoxing Yue Kingdom
conservation area rehabilitation; and (h) Ningbo Jiangnan sewerage and wastewater treatment.
Resettlement activities were implemented according to the eight resettlement action plans
(RAPs); six were completed between March and May 2003, and the remaining two in June 2006
and December 2008.

Resettlement activities comprised 141.92 hectares of permanent land acquisition, 21.22 hectares
of temporary land use, and 161,064 m2 housing demolition. Population affected by the project
was 7,025 people. Details are shown in the table below.

All project affected persons (PAPs) were resettled according to the RAPs. Compensation
standards for land use and house demolition were at least on par with those stipulated in the RAPs.
All compensation was paid on time, and all PAPs were consulted fully during the entire
resettlement process. Overall, the resettlement objective was realized and resettlement results
were satisfactory.

 *Notes:
 (a) The high land acquisition and resettlement cost of the Jiangnan wastewater component at
 completion was due to land acquisition and resettlement being applied to all households which
 were within 500 meters of the boundaries of the WWTP instead of 300 meters, as planned at
 appraisal.
 (b) The reduced land acquisition and resettlement cost in Cicheng was due to the reductions in
 project scope.
 (c) Land acquisition and resettlement cost savings for the Zhenhai wastewater component and the
 Dongqian Lake component were due to design changes regarding originally proposed routes of
 roads and sewers to minimize the number of people affected by the sub-projects.
 (d) The higher land acquisition and resettlement cost of the Shaoxing component was due to
 much higher compensation costs claimed by PAPs during implementation.

This Annex provides information on the performance of the wastewater treatment plants
including their respective pollutant reductions in Ningbo, and the achievement of surface water
quality standards in Dongqian Lake and in the canals in Shaoxing. For ease of reference, the
presentation includes: (a) Discharge Standards for Municipal Wastewater (GB18918-2002); and
(b) Environmental Quality Standards (Main Parameters) for Surface Water (GB3838-2002).

Other tables provide data on: (a) Influent and Effluent quality of Jiangdongnan and Zhenhai
WWTPs; (b) Pollution Reduction of Jiangdongnan and Zhenhai WWTPs; and (c) Surface Water
Quality in Dongqian Lake and canals in Shaoxing.

(A) Discharge Standards for Municipal Wastewater and Surface Water Standards in China

The objective of the wastewater collection and treatment investments in Ningbo was to achieve a
treated effluent quality that would meet at least Class I B level of the Discharge Standards for
Municipal Wastewater (GB18918-2002), and the objective of the infrastructure upgrading
investments in Dongqian lake and Shaoxing was to improve surface water quality that would
meet Class IV level of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002).
For reference, the tables below show the parameters of the Chinese Standards.

The treated effluent from Jiangdongnan WWTP which discharges into the Fenghua River met
stipulated effluent discharge standards of Class 1B in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The Jiangdongnan
WWTP removed 13,800 tons of COD in 2008, 12,000 tons in 2009 and 11,300 tons in 2010,
which would have otherwise flowed into the river system.

The treated effluent from Zhenhai WWTP which discharges into the Yongjiang River met the
stipulated effluent discharge standards of Class 1B between 2008 and 2010. The Zhenhai WWTP
removed 3,900 tons of COD in 2008, 3,300 tons in 2009, and 2,900 tons in 2010.

While the improvement cannot be fully attributed to project investments, water quality in the
monitoring sections of Yongjiang River and Fenghua River improved from Class V in 2008 to
Class IV in 2010 (Ningbo Environmental Status Bulletin (2010).

 In 2010, Ningbo successfully fulfilled its commitments to the central government on pollutant
(COD, SO2) reduction target stipulated in 11th Five Year Plan. The COD discharge in 2010 was
41,000tons, down 21.5% from the 2005 level, and exceeding the 11th Five Year Plan COD
reduction target of 12.45%.

(D) Surface Water Quality in Dongqian Lake and Shaoxing Canal

According to the Zhejiang Environmental Status Bulletin (2010)
(http://wenku.baidu.com/view/ccfa1900de80d4d8d15a4fa9.html), water quality in Dongqian
Lake met the Class III level of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-
2002), which exceeded the project set target of meeting Class IV Standards. This improvement
can be directly attributed to project investments, because almost all wastewater and surface runoff
was intercepted and transferred to the Ningbo treatment plants.

According to the Shaoxing Environmental Status Bulletin (2010)
(http://www.sxepb.gov.cn/content/20100607000002/20110615000087_0.html), in three out of the
nine stipulated monitoring sections in the city canal system, water quality achieved Class IV level
of Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002). Water quality in the
other six sections was still at Class V Standard. The main pollutants that failed to meet the set
standards were NH3-N, P, and BOD.

                                                35
The shortfall was due to the fact that the project works only included canal rehabilitation and
provision of improved facilities for better and more regular flushing of the canals with water from
the moat that surrounds the old city. The water quality improvement in the canals largely depends
on improved water quality in the small rivers interconnecting with the moat, and the water quality
in these small rivers was not subject to infrastructure improvements under the project.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                        CHINA: Zhejiang Urban Environment Project

Project Context. The project supported Zhejiang Province in implementing a long-term urban
environmental services improvement program to recover from environmental degradation of its
water and land resources; and ensured sustainability of service delivery through institutional and
financial reforms of the service utilities. The Zhejiang Urban Environment Project (ZUEP) was
the follow-on project of the Bank-funded water supply and urban development (ZMCDP),
focusing on improving environmental services in Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing of Zhejiang
Province. The US$ 133 million World Bank loan for ZUEP was approved on January 29, 2004.

Project Development Objective. The project development objective was to assist Zhejiang to:
improve waste management and the urban environment in Ningbo and Hangzhou; and revitalize
the historic inner cities in Cicheng and Shaoxing to facilitate sustainable development and
establish a model for conservation of cultural heritage.

Main Beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries, including those benefiting from the new
components, is estimated to be about 4.4 million.

Project Components at Appraisal.
(a) Ningbo component: (i) Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in South Jiangdong District of
Ningbo; (ii) Sewerage and Sewage Treatment in Zhenhai district of Ningbo Municipality; (iii)
Infrastructure Upgrading in Cicheng Town in Jiangbei District of Ningbo Municipality; (iv) Road
and Sewerage Infrastructure Dongqian Lake in Ningbo Municipality.

(b) Shaoxing component: Housing Renovation, Heritage Conservation & Infrastructure
Upgrading in Shaoxing Historic City Center.

(c) Hangzhou component: (i) Expansion of Tianziling Landfill in Hangzhou City

(d) Technical Assistance: (i) Institutional Strengthening, Financial Reform & MIS/GIS Systems;
(ii) Design Review Advisory and Construction Management; (iii) Industrial Pollution Control in
Ningbo; (iv) Tourism Development and Community Participation; (v) Heritage Conservation and
Urban Upgrading.

Project Restructurings There were significant loan savings of total US$ 56 million in Ningbo
and Shaoxing (US$ 33 million for Shaoxing and US$ 23 million for Ningbo). The loan savings
were principally the result of: (i) contract savings due to lower than estimated contract costs and
unused contingencies; (ii) reduced contract scope and deleted contracts due to changes in the
urban plans and technical designs; and (iii) implementation of contracts using only local funds.

Two phases of restructuring were implemented in 2008 and 2009 respectively. At the first phase
of restructuring, Shaoxing used its loan savings to finance the rehabilitation of the Yue Kingdom
Conservation area. The project had three specific sub-components: (i) Fushan Hill landscaping
and improvement of public spaces; (ii) construction of a Yue Kingdom Museum, an underground
car park, and basic underground infrastructure; and (iii) construction of a leisure square, and the
restoration of historic housing and a temple.



                                                 37
At the second phase of restructuring, Ningbo used its loan savings and also part of the Shaoxing
loan savings to finance the construction of 160,000 m3/d Jiangnan WWTP and 45 km of
associated trunk sewer networks.

The original closing date of the loan was June 30, 2010. At the MoF request, the loan closing
date was extended by one year to June 30, 2011 for implementation of restructuring components.
All additional works using loan savings were completed by the extended closing date.

Quality at Entry. The project addressed the priorities of the 10th Five Year Plan of Hangzhou
and Ningbo Municipalities to improve environmental management, historic city regeneration and
sustainability of the wastewater and solid waste sectors. The project addressed: wastewater
pollution reduction in Ningbo including the Dongqian Lake; solid waste pollution in Hangzhou;
historicity conservation regeneration in Shaoxing historic city; and institution and financial
reforms in the waste management sectors.

The feasibility study reports of all sub-projects were prepared by qualified DIs and appraised by
China International Engineering Consulting Corporation. PPMO assigned DRA consultants to
prepare consolidated feasibility study report, environmental impact assessment report, EMP, and
resettlement action plan. The World Bank proposed technical, institutional and financial reforms,
which were accepted in feasibility study and implementation stage.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes. The factors that affected
implementation and outcomes were: (i) accelerated implementation of the Shaoxing historic city
renovation to complete improvements in time for the Arts Festival in 2004; (ii) addtion of
wastewater collection and treatment in the Jiangnan District of Ningbo Municipality; and (iii)
addition of renovation of the Yue Kingdom area in Shaoxing to utilize loan savings. Additional
factors that affected outcomes were:

   Too Long Preparation Period. The long project preparation period (2000 -2003), and some
    urgent contracts, e.g. majority of the Shaoxing contracts needed to be completed before the
    Seventh National Art Festival in September 2004, used counterpart funding for their
    implementation. This contributed to loan savings and restructuring and project closing date
    extension.
   Depreciation of US$ against Yuan. The exchange rate of USD with RMB was 1:8.28 at the
    time of appraisal, but started to drop from July 2005 as the PRC government started to
    implement new exchange rate policies. By project closing date on June 30 2011, the rate had
    fallen to 1:6.40. This significantly reduced the real value of the World Bank loan and
    increased the level of counterpart funding required, as most contracts were denominated in
    Chinese Yuan. The PIUs needed to secure unanticipated supplementary financing to complete
    the project.
   Difficulties in Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The difficulties encountered in land
    acquisition and resettlement costs of Cicheng component resulted in cancellation of a few
    contracts as stated in the procurement plan at appraisal.
   Delayed Tariff Adjustments. During the first few years of project implementation, both
    Ningbo and Hangzhou governments did not see the necessity for tariff adjustments for full
    cost recovery of the investments in sewerage and WWTPs sub-projects and landfill, as well
    as due national economic policy to control inflation. This led to both NSCL and HSWC
    failing to fully comply with the loan covenants in the first few years of project
    implementation.



                                               38
Institutional and Financial Reforms. The project reforms included: establishment of NSCL as
an autonomous company to own, operate and manage all wastewater services in Ningbo city, with
control of all revenues; (ii) establishment of HSWC to manage landfill operations in Hangzhou,
as an autonomous company, with a tipping fee as the main source of revenue; (iii) improved
financial management in NSCL and HSWC with financial performance targets, and tariffs that
were to be revised to agreed targets to achieve financial sustainability.

All institutional and financial reforms were successfully implemented to achieve project
development objectives.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives. The project development objective for
Ningbo wastewater management was achieved by expanding wastewater collection coverage and
treatment capacity to increase the treatment rate to about 85%. Under the project, three WWTPs
with a total capacity of 350,000 m3/d and about 195km collection networks were constructed.
The project development objective for solid waste management was achieved with 100% of the
solid waste in Hangzhou collected and safely disposed of. The project constructed the 2nd phase
of Tianziling landfill, including leachate treatment, and provided landfill equipment and vehicles.
A successful historic city revitalization and regeneration was carried out in Shaoxing historic city
and the Yue Kingdom area, which has received notoriety as a model in conservation and city
regeneration. The integrated conservation and development has brought significant benefits in
tourism and income generation. Table 1 illustrates the Key Performance Indicators which reflect
the satisfactory achievements of PDO.

ZUEP was fully consistent with development plans of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, Ningbo and
Shaoxing, and addressed local priorities and needs. The project made significant contribution to
environmental improvements, historical city development and heritage conservation.
Achievement of all the key performance indicates that the ZUEP was very successful.

Risk to Development Outcome

Governments at all levels in Zhejiang have paid great attention to urban environment
management over the last 10 years, Hanzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo were named as “State
environmental protection model city? attributed to their improved environmental management. In
accordance with “Zhejiang 811 Environmental Protection New Three Year Action Plan (2008-
2010)? and rural environmental protection plan, environmental protection will be continuously
improved and extended to small towns and rural villages. The risk to development outcome is
low. Some potential risks that could impact unfavorably on continuous realization of
development outcomes, are:
(a) Industrial sewage entering the sewer system may not conform to sewer entry standard
requirements. Local EPBs would need to improve monitoring and enforcement to ensure that
industries comply.
 (b) With accelerated urban construction and increased sewage volumes, the volume of sludge
generated will also continuously grow, and there may not be enough capacity at the thermal plant
to dry all the sludge generated. Ningbo will continue its efforts to conserve water, reduce sewage
generation, and improve sludge disposal.
(c) Inadequate budgets and maintenance of cultural heritage assets could lose Shaoxing’s
attraction as a popular tourist attraction. Continued focus would be required to maintain Shaoxing
as a model for protection of historical and cultural heritage conservation. The Government will
make intensive efforts to coordinate maintenance and protection of historical street area so as to
preserve the valuable cultural heritage for future generations...
(e) Inability to maintain the improved Dongqian Lake water quality is a potential risk. Rapid
development and promotion of tourism are likely to increase the pollution discharges to the Lake.
Rural non-point source pollution is also likely to impact water quality. Dongqian Lake investment
Development Co., Ltd. will continue to closely monitor Dongqian Lake water quality, and
eliminate potential sources of pollution from sewage, solid waste, surrounding ecology and lake
sludge, and take appropriate action to eliminate pollution sources.

Economic Benefits. The economic justification of the project was established using a cost
effectiveness approach rather than by a detailed quantitative evaluation of benefits. The Project
has undoubtedly contributed to the Governments’ development objective of continued and
sustainable economic growth, and helped facilitate the policy of public services and tourism
development in Ningbo, Hangzhou and Shaoxing. No economic benefits were computed for each

                                                      40
project component as benefits from wastewater, solid waste, and tourism related investments are
difficult to quantify.

Financial Performance. The financial viability of the Ningbo wastewater component and
Hangzhou Landfill Extension were assessed based on the ability of the tariff to generate sufficient
revenues for NSCL and HSWC to meet their principal financial targets. These targets were a cost
recovery ratio of at least 1.0 and debt service coverage of at least 1.3, set on the assumption that
all wastewater and solid waste charges revenues would be transferred to the companies. Unless
this financial reform could take place firmly without changes from the present practices, the
financial performance of the two companies could be affected. However, both Ningbo and
Hangzhou Governments are providing adequate financial resources to ensure the full operation of
the WWTPs in Ningbo and the Landfill n Hangzhou.

Sustainability. The NSCL and HSWC can be considered sustainable in terms of: (i) an
appropriate institutional arrangement has been set up to provide for managerial autonomy and
sustainability; (ii) the ability to operate and maintain the facilities; and (iii) financial sustainability.
The new WWTPs in Ningbo and the landfill in Hangzhou are being well operated and maintained,
and Ningbo and Hangzhou municipal governments are allowing tariff adjustment to ensure these
operations are fully financed.

Bank and Borrower Performance

World Bank. The World Bank provided continuous and useful guidance during project
identification, preparation, pre-appraisal, appraisal and supervision, including selection of
components, and preparation of consolidated FSR, EAR, EMP and RAP. During implementation
phase, the World Bank sent semi-annual missions to supervise project implementation, reviewed
the bid invitation documents submitted by project office, and provided no objection letters after
bidding document reviews, as necessary. World Bank performance was rated as satisfactory.

Borrower

(a) Government. Government performance was satisfactory. The national and provincial
government’s commitment to the project remained strong and supportive during all phases of the
Project. The provincial government took a strong lead on tariff reform by issuing provincial
guidelines urging municipalities to increase tariffs; they also supported the Project by directing
and coordinating the implementation efforts. Local governments ensured timely provision of
counterpart funds, active policy support to institutional and financial reform of utility companies.

(b) Project Implementing Units. The performance of the Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing PIUs
was satisfactory. Project companies/implementing units were staffed with personnel familiar with
project management procedures, technical requirements of construction management. They had
extensive experience in selection of investigation and design units, bidding agent, construction
supervision unit and procuring contractors. The consultant services of technical support units and
construction supervision units were fully utilized. Hence the construction progress and quality
met the project requirements.

Lessons Learned

ZUEP was a big success through borrower’s sincere cooperation with the World Bank team in
solid waste disposal, wastewater collection and treatment and ancient city redevelopment.
Specific lessons gained include:

(a) Developed “Shaoxing Model? for historical city revitalization and heritage conservation. It
incorporates the goals of urban heritage conservation and social and economic development by
conserving and upgrading the whole urban landscape in historic areas. This approach, has
received much attention among China’s conservation professionals, and is seen as an important
and useful model for heritage protection and urban revitalization in other Chinese cities.

 (b) Institutional Reform. Two institutional changes (NSCL and HSWC) were introduced in the
project, and were considered as pioneering outcomes at time. The major changes were to
separate government functions (policy, regulation, oversight) from municipal utility and service
delivery functions, and to establish financial autonomous companies. Through the provision of
technical assistance on institutional, managerial, financial and operational arrangement and
development of business plans, both companies have developed to become financial sustainable
along with the tariff revisions implemented during the project.

Autonomous utility company can become sustainable and expand considerably with the right
support from governments including annual or biannual tariff adjustment as well as government
policy support.

 (c) Performance Indicators for tariff revision should be more practical and suit local
conditions. Under the great support for the NMG and HMG, both companies complied with
financial covenants for tariff increases. However, tariff revisions in China often take a much
gradual approach and long time especially during the high inflation periods.

(d) Implementation of industrial pollution control and catchment management is key to the
achievement of water quality improvement in rivers/canals and lakes.

(e) Social safeguard policy should be more flexible to meet implementation needs. As a rapid
growing province, project affected people often demand more compensation than national
standards for compensation. These rapid increment in land and resettlement compensation rates
resulted in some contract packages have to be cancelled or delayed. The Bank should look into a
flexible policy regarding resettlement so projects can be smoothly implemented and development
objectives can be realized.
