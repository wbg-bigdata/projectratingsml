PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Bajo Rio
Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1111-ME).
The loan amount of US$150 million was approved by the Board on May 8, 1975,
and the legal documents are dated May 22, 1975. The project was redesigned
and reformulated in 1978 with a total estimated cost of US$130.9 million; the
revised Bank loan was US$50 million (US$100 million of the original loan was
cancelled). The revised loan was approved by the Board on March 29, 1979
even though implementation had already begun in 1977. The final total
project cost in current prices was US$174.5 million, and total Bank
disbursements as of March 31, 1984 were US$43.375 million; US$6.625 million
was cancelled.
2.        The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Region,
Agriculture Division C, after a field visit in November 1983. The PCR is
based on a preliminary report prepared by the Borrower in September 1983,
data and information provided by the Borrower following the visit of the
November mission, and a final completion report submitted by the Borrower in
September 1984. Legal documents, the President's Report, supervision reports
and correspondence were also reviewed.
3.        The draft report was sent to the Borrower on February 6, 1986, for
their comments. Those received from the Ministry of Finance, prepared with
other cooperating agencies concerned, are included as chapter IX of the PCR.
The Operations Evaluation Department has decided not to audit the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO BAJO RIO BRAVO/BAJO RIO SAN JUAN
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT (LOAN llll-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
In the early 1970s, the decline in agricultural production of
Mexico raised concerns about the long-term ability to keep pace with the
growth in domestic consumption and the need to reduce income disparities
among the population. The project was envisaged as an important step to
bring agricultural production back in line with domestic and foreign demand.
Objectives
The project, the second Bank-financed irrigation project in the
area, was to rehabilitate the drainage and irrigation systems on about
280,000 ha, increase agricultural production through changes in cropping
patterns, and alleviate the disparity of income levels among the rural
population.  Total project costs were estimated at US$384.6 million.  The
Bank loan of US$150.0 million was to be disbursed over. 7* years.
Implementation Experience
Project start-up was delayed by a lack of counterpart funds and the
need to reconsider and complete basic studies and designs before construction
of infrastructure could commence. As a result of basic studies, it became
apparent that the project was overly ambitious and should be redesigned and
divided into three phases over a 12-15 year execution period. The project,
as reformulated, was the first phase, comprising the rehabilitation of the
drainage and irrigation system on 130,846 ha and provision of extension serv-
ices and rural roads in the total area of 280,000 ha. The revised project
cost was estimated at about US$130.9 million. The Bank loan was reduced to
US$50.0 million and US$100.0 million of the original loan was cancelled.
Implementation of the revised project was satisfactory. The rehabilitation
and construction of the drainage system and the construction of roads
exceeded the targets. The irrigation and land levelling components fell
short of expectation, and only 60% of the estimated O&M equipment require-
ments were purchased. The research and extension services were substantlilly
strengthened. Total project costs amounted to US$174.5 million, 33% higher
than expected. Total disbursements amounted to US$43.4 million, or 87% of
the revised loan, and the balance of US$6.6 million was cancelled. A Phase
II project is now under implementation and project works are expected to be
completed under the Phase III project (1989-1993).



- iv -
Results
The project impact is difficult to measure at this stage, as all
the investments originally envisaged have only been completed in a small
area. Less crop diversification and shift towards high-value crops than
expected have taken place; yields of the main crops (maize and sorghum) have
increased (yet less than anticipated), due to the strengthening of research
and extension services, better salinity control and the improved road net-
work. The project ERR is now estimated at 12.5%, lower than the 17Z estima-
ted at project reformulation.
Sustainability
Two factors contribute to good prospects for project sustainabil-
ity: (i) the follow-on projects (Phase II and III) are expected to consoli-
date the results of this first project and (ii) project institutions have
proven efficient. However, two factors may have an adverse effect on project
sustainability: (i) assessment of adequate water charges is a continuing
unsatisfactory situation, with a possible negative impact on O&M; and (ii)
the project area lacks the marketing organization required to promote
alternative high-value crops.
Findings and Lessons
The project confirmed some of the lessons already learned from
other irrigation and rural development projects in Mexico (Panuco and Rio
Sinaloa - ORD Report No. 5191; Papaloapan Basin Rural Development (OED Report
No. 5766):
(a) the project was too ambitious in terms of technical and financial
capacity;
(b) large irrigation projects of this nature require adequate basic
studies and advanced stage of final design before appraisal;
(c) the alternative of phasing projects in successive stages, each
benefiting from the experience of the previous one, should be
considered for large and complex projects of this nature;
(d) need for an adequate monitoring and evaluation system;
(e) shifts in the cropping pattern are not only dependent on
investments and technical considerations, but also on price and
support policies of the Government;
(f) a more careful evluation should be made of farmer acceptance of
critical components, such as land leveling, to determine the
incentives available and the farmers' willingness to make the
necessary investments; and
(g) providing for improvement of production supporting services in a
larger area under a first-phase (short-term) project should be
considered while providing for construction and rehabilitation of
costly and time consuming infrastructure under a long-term
multi-phased program concept.

BAJO RIO BRAVO/BAJO RIO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT I
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Mexico's impressive agriculture sector performance until the 1960s
was accompanied by a reduction in the importance of agriculture in terms of
its share of the GDP. Yet, agriculture remained an important sector in the
economy, contributing 40% of the commodity export earnings and employing 40%
of the labor force. At the same time, the decline in agricultural production
raised concerns about the long-term ability to keep pace with the growth in
domestic consumption and the need to reduce income disparities among the
population. Exploitation of extensive agriculture, which contributed to the
dramatic growth of production in the past, had run its course, and the
Government's focus shifted to measures directed at increasing yields and
cropping intensity and crop diversification. Limited land resources mado
exploitation of existing irrigated and rainfed agriculture areas necessary.
The project was envisaged as an important step to bring agricultural
production back in line with domestic and foreign demand.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Project was prepared by the
Government of Mexico, assisted by a local consulting firm (Estudios y
Proyectos S.A.). The project was prepared when Mexico enjoyed an impressive
economic performance, and it was assumed the country would have the financial
means to carry out large projects. A June 1974 Bank mission reviewed the
preparation report and recommended that the project be appraised.
2.02      Project appraisal was carried out by two missions, pre-appraisal in
October 1974 and appraisal in December 1974. The principal recommendations
made by the appraisal mission were that: (a) no tenders be let for lining of
irrigation canals until studies were conducted that indicated water losses in
the canal system; (b) no additional development be permitted in the Bravo
Basin that would further deplete the supply of irrigation water; and
(c) adequate water charges be assessed and collected to cover the cost of
O&M.
Negotiations and Board Approval
2.03      Negotiations focused on the principal issues identified above, as
well as on providing adequate counterpart funds, particularly for credit. A
satisfactory understanding was reached on all of these aspects. The Board



-2-
approved a loan of US$150 million on May 8, 1975. The principal concern
raised during discussion was the high percentage of contingencies (80%) in
relation to project base costs (US$214.5 million). The Board wondered how
and when resultant surplus funds would be cancelled; the staff explained that
contingencies were calculated in accordance with standard Bank estimates and
consequently no surplus funds would result if these estimates proved
correct.
Objectives and Description
2.04      In accordance with the Government's strategy, the principal
objectives of the project were to: (a) increase agricultural production in
the Bajo Rio Bravo Basin; and (b) alleviate the disparity in ineome levels
among the rural population. The project was to complete the rehabilitation
of the irrigation and drainage system and increase yields and diversify crop
production on the 280,000 ha covered by irrigation Districts 25 (Bajo Rio
Bravo) and 26 (Bajo Rio San Juan).
2.05      In order to accomplish the objectives, the project was designed to:
(a)    line most of the irrigation canals with concrete (.bout
3,200 km);
(b)    rehabilitate the existing drainage system and construct an
additional 1,300 km of drains;
(c)    provide an improved all-weather road system (about
2,700 km);
(d)    level about 200,000 ha of land;
(e)    provide intensive extension and research services for the
entire project area;
(f)    purchase additional equipment for operation and maintenance;
and
(g)    provide miscellaneous civil works (buildings) and equipment.
The basic benefit assumptions of the appraisal were that yields and crop
diversification would increase the volume and value of production: (a) by
improving the efficiency of the irrigation system (thereby making more water
available to meet the full requirements of the crops); and (b) by strength-
ening technical services (to improve agronomic practices).
2.06      The executing agency was the Secretariat of Hydraulic Resources
(SRH), which became the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources
(SARK) in 1977. The SRH state representative for north Tamaulipas had
overall responsibility for construction and operations. Designs and tenders
were prepared at SRH headquarters in Mexico City while construction was
carried out by the Construction Division District Office. Production
supporting services and OEM were carried out by the Irrigation District
Managers.



-3-
Project Cost and Financing
2.07      The total original project cost was estimated to be US$384.5
million (Annex 1).  The Bank loan of US$150 million was to finance the
foreign exchange cost and 50% of the technical assistance (extension)
program; the balance was to be financed from the Government budget.
III. PROJECT REFORMULATION
Implementation Probleme
3.01      From the date of project effectiveness (July 30, 1975), It was
*lear that the project was facing major implementation problems: First, the
appraisal mission recommended that water loss studies be conducted before
tenders were let for concrete lining of canals (this recommendation was
justified because studies indicated leakage Wias not severe and irrigation
water was not yet fully utilized). Second, the preparation of other infra-
st.ructure detailed designs and related bidding documents did not begin until
1976 delaying the start of construction. Third, the economic crisis c- 1976
and the subsequent austerity program following the change in administration
in that year created a shortage of counterpart funds. As a result, the
Goverrient and the Bank: (a) realized that the project was overly ambitious
and would have to be carried out in phases, with the existing project
covering only the first phase, and (b) agreed that a conceptual change was
necessary, with a much greater emphasis on drainage, water management, roads,
and extension, and less emphasis on canal lining. Project execution did not
get underway until 1977 and ultimately SARH, as requested by the Bank,
re-evaluated and reformulated the project and submitted a proposal to the
Bank in 1978 to carry out the project in several stages over a 12 to 15 year
period. Under the revised project (now Phase I), the irrigation and to a
lesser extent, the drainage infrastructu a components were scaled down
substantially and emphasis was placed on roads and production supporting
services.
Revised Project Description
3.02      The objectives and assumptions (para. 2.04) of the revises  project
did not change; however, the components of the project were substantially
reduced. The reformulated project provided for:
(a)    improvement, including concrete lining of 190 km of
irrigation canals covering an area of 6,260 ha in Unit 1 of
District 26;
(b)    improvement and construction of 1,476 km of drains over an
area of 102,882 ha in selected areas of Districts 25 and 26;
(c)    improvement and construction of 555 km of roads;
(d)    land leveling on about 78,000 ha;



-4-
(e)    technical assistance and research throughout Districts 25
and 26 ;
(f)    purchase of operation and maintenance equipment; and
(g)    miscellaneous civil works (buildings) and equipment.
Revised Project Cost and Board Approval
3.03      The revised project cost estimate (1977) was US$130.9 million
(Annex 2) of which the Bank loan of US$50 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost and 50% of the technical services cost. The revised project
was approved by the Board Marcli 29, 1979, and US$100 million of the original
loan was cancelled. The actual project cost at completion was US$174.5
million (Annex 3), of which the Bank financed US$43.4 million (25%). The
increase in cost was mainly caused byhigh inflation during project
implementation.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.01      Implementation of the revised project started to gain momentum in
early-1978 and was satisfactory thereafter. In May 1979, the project was
fully staffed and the technical assistance program to farmers well underway,
having a favorable impact on farming practices throughout the area. However,
reflecting pressures from several farmer groups outside the project area,
SARH decided to add new areas to the project's scope: 6,800 ha in the third
unit of District No. 26, and 21,158 ha in the first unit of District No. 25.
Financing of these additional works was done exclusively out of Government
funds. Thus, the area to benefit under the project was increased from
101,800 ha to 130,846 ha. In addition, rehabilitation of rural feeder roads
systems was extended to cover the entire area of the two districts.
Thereafter, preparation of additional designs and bidding documents and
actual construction progressed satisfactorily. Nevertheless, there was a
continuous delay in disbursements, reflecting lengthy and cumbersome internal
procedures regarding billing, verification of supporting documentation,
processing and payment.

4.03      Civil Works (Irrigation, Drainage, Roads and Minor Civil Works).
Irrigation works were essentially confined to rehabilitation and construction
in Unit 1 of District 26 where all components, irrigation, drainage and roads
were completed on about 5,600 ha. Rehabilitation and construction of the
drainage system was one of the most successful components of the project, and
both the kilometer and area targets were exceeded: 2,176 km were completed on
about 131,000 ha. Improvement and construction of all-weather roads were
considered vital to the development of both irrigation districts. More than
755 km of roads were improved and constructed exceeding the target by
200 km. The investment in roads was about US$26 million, or approximately
double the reformulated project estimates. Adequate Bank financing was
available for the additional investments in the roads component from the
equipment and land leveling components. The minor civil works component,
consisting of housing, offices, workshops and complementary works, was
financed primarily by Government funds.
4.04      Land Levelin.  While land leveling was considered essential to
provide more efficient utilization of water and increase yields, it
nevertheless, was the least successful of all of the operations under the
project. Only 15,000 ha, or about 20% of the revised target of 78,000 ha
were leveled. Land leveling was financed from local credit sources as was
envisaged at appraisal. Although the appraisal mission considered land
leveling essential to improve the efficiency of irrigation and yields;



-6-
it has not been widely accepted by farmers. Farmers generally have given
land leveling a low priority in terms of investment and utilization of their
limited financial resources because yields can initially decline and recovery
of investment costs can take several years. The benefits of land leveling
need to be further evaluated and demonstrated under the second phase
project.
4.05      Operation and Maintenaace.  Even though the project and the loan
agreement provided finance for O&M equipment, the Borrower chose to purchase
most equipment by LCB procedures; thus Bank reimbursement was not requested.
Of the O&M equipment purchased, less than 20% was financed by the Bank. Only
about 60X of the estimated O&M equipment requirements were purchased.
Supervision missions and Irrigation District management felt that additional
equipment should have been purchased. Neither the equipment or the O&M
budget were considered adequate to maintain the infrastructure.
4.06      Technical Assistance.  Technical assistances including extension
services and research, was substantially strengthened and improved under the
project. Fifty-seven technical assistance areas (each covering 5,000-
6,000 ha) have been established: 41 in District 25 and 16 in District 26.
Staffing reached its peak in 1981 with 57 agronomists and 141 technicians; a
ratio of one extension worker for each 1,400 ha and approximately 1 to 100
beneficiaries. The number of extension workers was reduced due to budgetary
constraints to 126 in 1982, implying a ratio of 1 extension worker to 146
beneficiaries; which still is considered adequate coverage. A survey
conducted in April 1983 indicated that more than 80% of the farmers are
satisfied with the services. Farmers generally rate the effectiveness and
satisfaction with technical assistance higher than any other production
service or input.
4.07      Research has also been substantially strengthened under the project
with 39 researchers assigned to the Campo Agricola Experimental Rio Bravo
(CAERIB). Major emphasis has been placed on developing new varieties of
maize, sorghum, soybeans and on the control of pests and diseases. Control
of pests and diseases has improved under the project due to improved research
and extension. Investigations were also conducted in relation to drainage
and salinity. New varieties of soyleans, maize for the winter season and
beans for the sprihg season, are now beizg developed and will enable further
changes in the cropping pattern in the future.
Disbursements
4.08      Total disbursements under the project amounted to US$43.375
million, or 87% of the revised loan of US$50 million, and 25% of project
expenditures. There were no disbursements in the first three years of the
project and less than 1% in 1978 (Annex 4). The slow rate of disbursements
can be attributed to: (a) overoptimistic appraisal estimates in terms of the
readiness of the project for execution and capacity for implementation;
(b) lack of counterpart funds which delayed implementation; (c) lower Bank
financing of total project cost than appraised; and (d) internal delays in
processing applications for reimbursement.



- 7 -
4.09      Although disbursements did not begin until after the project was
reformulated in 1977, urgent works did not stop andabout lOX of the loan
amount was disbursed by the time th( reformulated project was approved by the
Board in March 1979. Of the original US$150 mllion loan, US$100 million
were cancelled at the time of reformulation; nevertheless, final
disbursements only reached US$43.375 million by March 1984, and US$6.625
million were cancelled (Annex 5).
Procurement
4.10      The original guarantee agreement provided for major infrastructure
to be contracted on the basis of ICB, except for those contracts of value
less tban US$160,000 and not to exceed an aggregate of US$8 million. These
thresholds were obviously low and were raised three times during project
execution ultimately to US$275,000 per contract and an aggregate limit of
US$16 million. With inflation and devaluation of the peso the threshold for
ICB was still unrealistically low to be of interest to foreign contractors.
Total expenditures were about US$106 million for civil works and US$3.5
million for equipment. The civil works and a large portion of the equipment
contracts were let following LCB.
4.11      Supervision missions discussed the Bank requirements for ICB on
several occasions; however it has been the general practice of SARH to let
many small contracts under most Bank financed projects; thus contracts
awarded normally did not exceed ICB threshold. There is no evidence that the
Bank attempted to enforce the overall aggregate limit for LCB contracts. The
procurement process was further complicated by the protracted implementation
period, budgetary constraints and reformulation of the project which resulted
in many small contracts scattered in both time and place. Procurement
procedures improved after the Public Works Law was enacted in 1980. This law
provided for centralized control and verification of procurement by the
Secretariat of Programming and Budget. Although it resulted in more
uniformity in the application of internal procedures, it did not overcome the
problem of fragmentation and packaging of works in contracts unsuitable for
ICB; thus LCB procedures generally continued to be applied. A subsequent
review of ICB and LCB procurement procedures in Mexico has been undertaken by
the Projects Department and action is now being taken to promote compliance
with Bank procurement policies and guidelines.
Reporting
4.12      SARH regularly submitted progress reports in an agreed format.
A preliminary draft PCR was submitted to the Bank in September 1983, and it
was agreed during the November 1983 supervision mission that a final PCR
would be submitted early in 1984. Additional data and information were
provided during the subsequent five-month period. SARH submitted its final
PCR in Se3ptember 1984 and the iaformation was found to be generally
consistent with that already provided and taken into consideration in
preparing this report.



-8-
Accounting and Auditing
4.13      Bank supervision missions considered that accounts were being
adequately maintained so as to reflect the financial operations, resources
and expenditures of the project. SARE accounts are subject to a series of
internal control procedures by the General Directorate for Internal Auditing
and the Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP). After reviewing the
procedures in October 1979, the Bank agreed to accept certification of
project accounts by SPP in lieu of an audit.  This procedure has been
complied with.
Compliance with Covenants
4.14      Compliance with covenants was satisfactory, except for procurement
and collection of water charges necessary to recover O&M costs. As has been
the case with other projects during the same time period project benefici-
aries resisted paying water charges; as a result, actual fees covered about
one-third of O&M cost throughout the project implementation period. A pro-
posal was submitted to the Bank in 1983 that would provide for adjustment in
water charges sufficient to cover O&M costs by 1985. A list of covenants and
comments on compliance is shown in Annex 6.
V. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
5.01      It is difficult at this stage to make a meaningful measurement of
incremental agricultural production based on changes in the cropping pattern
and yields attributable to the first-phase project operations. Loan 1111-ME,
as revised and implemented, was not a free standing project, but rather
a time-slice of a much longer term investment program. Thus, most project
components were reduced from those estimated in the original appraisal; works
and operations were scattered throughout the entire project area; and there
were major delays in implementation. A phased approach delays the completion
of the combination of works necessary to achieve full development benefits.
All the investments originally envisaged, have only been completed in a small
area, Unit 1 of Division 26, covering about 5,600 ha. In this Unit yields
equalled or exceeded appraisal estimates by crop year 1982 (Annex 11) as
shown below:
Table 5.1: Average Annual Yields in Unit 1, District 26
1982
Actual                    Appraisal
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    Estimates
Maize         2.94    3.50    2.59    3.82    3.39          3.2
Sorghum       3.45    3.75    3.81    4.56    3.92          3.4
Beans         0.80    0.77    N.A.    0.81    0.80          0.8
5.02      At the time of appraisal, crop production in the project area was
dominated by basic grains: maize and sorghum. The basic assumptions were



-9-
that: (a) cropping patterns would shift more toward cotton and horticultural
crops (diversification into higher value cash crops), while the area under
sorghum and maize would decrease (Annexes 7 and 8); (b) cropping intensity
would decrease to provide full water requirements for the first cycle crop,
while second cycle cropping would be substantially reduced; (c) salinity
would be reduced and controlled to improve and maintain the quality of soils
for production; and (d) yields would increase due to availability of water
for optimum crop production and improved agronomic practices, made available
by research and disseminated by the extension services. While the irrigated
area has not increased over the original 280,000 ha (a condition of the
loan), there has been noticeable improvement in soils due to the reduction
and control of salinity, and there are indications of a possible increase in
cropping intensity (para. 5.03).
5.03      Thus far, no important shifts in the cropping pattern have taken
place; and maize and sorghum continue to dominate even in the area where all
investments have been completed and improved extension services are fully
operational. It has become evident that crop diversification had three major
problems: (a) Government pricing policies and production support services
(research, extension and credit) favored basic grain production; (b) the
profitability of cotton production was reduced ay an increase in pests and
diseases, which resulted in frequent and costly spraying; and (c) horticul-
tural crops faced marketing limitations because of the lack of efficient
marketing organizations, as well as seasonal restrictions on the US export
market. Nevertheless, due to the fact that the road network was completed,
research ind extension were subtantially strengthened. Salinity is now being
controlled, and there is a trend towards increasing yields (para. 5.01,
Table 5.1) and cropping intensities. Cropping intensities in 1982 were 1.33
for District 25 and 1.14 for District 26, compared to the overall appraisal
estimate of 1.08 and the revised estimates of 1.20 for District 25 and 1.09
for District 26.
5.04      The conflicting views regarding the availability of 6Aequate water
for optimum crop production at full development have not been resolved. The
appraisal report indicated that under the existing levels of efficiency the
irrigation system would only provide 60X of the theoretical crop water
requirements for cultivation of the 280,000 ha of Districts 25 and 26. It
was estimated that with the project, 85-100% of the water needs (depending on
supplementary rainfall) would be met. The appraisal assumed that all the
irrigation water available would be utilized for optimum production during
the first-cycle crop (spring/summer), and that the second-cycle crop
(fall/winter) would essentially depend on residual moisture and rainfall.
Thus, the total area cultivated in the two cycles would be reduced and a
cropping intensity of 1.08 would be achieved (Annexes 7-8). By utilizing all
available water for the first cycle crop, higher yields would be achieved
that would more than compensate for any reduction in second-cycle cropping.
Both the revised first-phase project and the second-phase project assumed
that water availability would not be a constraint; howerer, the revised
first-phase project assumed cropping intensity could be maintained, while the
second-phase project assumed an increase.
5.05      The second-cycle crop which is relatively minor in terms of total
annual production is now grown essentially under rainfed conditons. When



- 10 -
required and water is available, supplementary irrigation can be used. The
Rio Grande Basin is an atypical area, where double cropping cannot automati-
cally take place under irrigation. At best, the second-cycle crop fields are
substantially lower, and risks of crop losses are much higher, due to adverse
climatic conditions (low and freezing temperatures, and hurricanes). There-
fore, it is reasonable to assume that on the average 10-30% of the area would
be planted during the second cycle with or without irrigation. The crop?ing
pattern and water availability need to be carefully monitored during the
second phase project.
5.06      In 1981, SARH conducted a hydrological study (Estudio Hidrologico
con el Patron de Cultivo) Indicating that adequate water would not be avail-
able to maintain cropping intensity at full development. This issue was
again raised by SARH during preparation of the Borrower's Project Completion
Report. It is possible this premise could be correct if the cropping pattern
were to shift substantially towards higher water requirement crops, as was
envisaged during appraisal. In line with revised project's approach maize
and sorghum continue to dominate and yields increased because of better
drainage, better water management and improved extension/research.
5.07      Land leveling, a major factor for better water management, has so
far been completed only on 15,000 ha instead of the 78,000 ha estimated in
the revised 1,roject. Farmers are reluctant to make the investment in land
leveling because they are not convinced of its benefits. They consider land
leveling to be costly, while only providing gradual increases in yields.
Thus further analyses need to be undertaken to demonstrate the benefits.
5.08      Under the circumstances, it is difficult to see how the cropping
pattern will evolve. In the longer term, it would seem essential that the
cropping pattern should shift towards higher value crops, which would make
additional investments in improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure
more profitable. For this to happen, extension and research services must
make more of an effort to promote crop diversification (para. 5.02).
Research and extension are presently working on some promising alternative
crops, such as soybeans, which have yielded 2 to 2.5 tons/ha in field trials,
and beans as a first-cycle crop, which has yielded 1 ton/ha in the field
trials. It is, however, too early to indicate the applicability and
acceptance of these crops as alternatives to maize and sorghum. Meanwhile,
benefit calculations are conservatively estimated, on the assumption that
maize and sorghum would continue to dominate the cropping pattern (para.
5.12).
5.08      Producer Returns.  The incremental volume and value of production
attributable to Phase I (Loan 1111-ME) project investments cannot be quanti-
fied at this time. Notional cropping intensity and yields for full develop-
ment were estimated during the 1981 appraisal of Phase II (Loan 2100-ME and
are shown in Annexes 9-11. More information is now available (para. 5.01)
thus yield estimates for Phase I (Annexes 10-11) are still considered valid.
5.09      Land Tenancy.  The project has not had, and was not expected to
have, any effect on land tenancy. As is generally the practice throughout
Mexico, a proportion of ejidos and small farmers, with alternative sources of
income either as employees of the farm unit or off-farm employment, continue
to rent out their land to others.



- 11 -
Economic Impact
5.10      As indicated in para. 3.01 and 3.02 decisions were made in 1977/78
to reformulate the project into a broader, longer term program of 10-15 years
and to limit the works under the project to a first tranche of this program.
A Phase II project (Loan 2100-ME) is now under implementation in which
82,000 ha (62% of the project area) would be rehabilitated from 1982 to
1988, However, because of the economic crisis and inadequate counterpart
funds available, the Government and the Bank recently decided to divide Phase
II into two stages, and it would only be during the Phase III project (1989-
1993) that the remaining 50,000 ha (38%) of the project area would be reha-
bilitated. Thus, the Phase I project forms only part of an integrated
program of improved irrigation and drainage, agriculture extension, and
on-farm development to improve the efficiency of the production system.
5,11      Therefore, in view of the difficulty of segregating the impact of
Phase I project investmen.s, an economic analysis was performed on the inte-
grated program, i.e., Loan 1111-ME (Plase I) and 2100-ME (Phase II). This
analysis was recently completed as part of a supervision review for the Phase
II project, and showed an expected economic rate of return (ERR) of 12.5% on
program investments while the Borrower's PCR (September 1984) shows a rate of
return of 13%. These figures are lower than the 19% estimated in 1974 for
Phase I, 17% estimated at reformulation in 1978, and the 17% estimated in
1981 for the combined Phase I and Phase II projects. The ERR has diminished
because: (a) crop diversification (para. 5.02) is not expected to occur to
the extent originally estimated, and lower value basic grains would dominate;
(b) yield increases would be less than estimated under Phase II; and (c)
implementation has been prolonged. The program's economic costs and benefits
are presented in Annex 12.
5.12      The cropping patterns assumed for the reanalysis of the overall
program's economic viability assumes continuation of heavy emphasis on basic
grain production, in accordance with recent observed trends. Should the
Government change its agricultural policy to emphasize crop diversification
on irrigated land, it is expected that the project's viability would be
enhanced through higher valued cotton and horticulture crops. Therefore,
economic results presented herein are considered lower bound estimates.
5.13      Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the program's viability is
sensitive to delays and decreases in benefits and to increases in costs.
A 3% escalation of real costs or drop in benefits would cause the projected
ERR to fall to 12%. However, since Phase I costs and a portion of Phase II
costs are known, remaining costs in future must rise by a much larger factor
than 3% to yield an overall switching value of 3% based on present value
analysis. These results, nevertheless, support the need for cost contain-
ment, expeditious implementation of remaining investments including parti-
cular emphasis on land leveling expected to have significant impact on
production (para. 4.04).

VI   P ERFORMCE OP THE BOROWER
6.01      The -.stitutional performance after the revision of the project in.
1978 was satisfactory. SARH, through its representative of Tamaulipas Norte,
established and adequately staffed a resident office for rehabilitation works
in the project area. The project was also supported by the Offices of Irri-
gation and Drainage in both districts, which are responsible for technical
assistance (extension), research, land leveling, water distribution, water
charges and operation and maintenance. Coordination and cooperation at the
State, District and project levels were satisfactory. There were other
aspects, not financed by the Bank, where the Borrower's performance deserves
mention, namely: (a) marketing; (b) training; (c) credit; and (d) cost
recovery.
Marketing
6.02      The project area lacks the strong marketing organization and
experience of states, such as Sinaloa, required to promote alternative high
value cash crop production (particularly fruits and vegetables) for export;
thus the marketing system would have to be strengthened to facilitate high
value horticulture crop production. Storage capacity for basic grains
(maize, sorghum and beans) has increased substantially and now exceeds
2.0 million tons (70X private and 30% public sector). Storage and. marketing
(through CONASUPO) has been strengthened and favors basis grain production.
Training
6.03      Training, per se, was not a component of the project, however, as a
normal part of the SARH operations, extension and research staff receive
regular periodic training. The impact of extensive training is obvious from
the response of the farmers in the field.
Agricultural Credit
6.04      Use of farm credit has traditionally been high in the project
area. Although the project did not provide finance for credit, assurances
were provided that adequate credit would be made available and this was
generally done. More than 80% of the area planted in 1982 received
institutional credit: 63% from commercial banks and 37% from public banks.
An additional 8% of the area planted benefited from credit provided by
farmers and farmer organizations. The demand and availability of credit are
expected to increase as the program reaches full development.
Cost Recovery
6.05      In theory, it has always been the intention to charge water rates
sufficient to cover the cost of operation, maintenance and administration of
the irrigation system (para. 2.02 c); however, the income from water charges
has declined in relation to costs since 1978. An adjustment made at the
beginning of 1982 increased the revenue (in Pesos) by 80%, but the resulting
coverage of actual costs increased only from 24.5% in 1981 to 29.7% in 1982,



- 13 -
leaving a subsidy of about US$6.7 million. A series of increases in water
charges, at a 30S p.a. rate, was under consideration at the end of 1983, and
an agreement was subsequently reached with SARH to gradually increase water
charges so as to reach a 100% coverage of O&M costs by 1986. In addition to
water charges, the State Government collects a production tax equivalent to
2X of the value of production of each commodity.
6.06      Under the present system of operations, assessment of adequate
water charges is a continuing unsatisfactory situation. Water charges always
meet strong resistance from farmers and are the subject of frequent socio-
economic studies; a study was prepared by SARR in 1981 and submitted to the
Bank. However, these studies are time consuming and often overtaken by
changing economic conditions before they can be completed and implemented.
Also, present procedures for enacting increased water charges call for
negotiations with farmers until agreement is reached. In order to overcome
the perennial problem of adjusting water charges to cover cost of operation
and maintenance, an automatic adjustAent system should be formulated and
implemented by the Borrower. Such an automatic adjustment could be linked to
inflation, farm-gate prices, and costs of production.
VII. PERFORHANCE OF THE BANK
7.01      At appraisal, in 1974, it was assumed that all project works would
be completed over a period of seven years. In retrospect, the results
suggest that this schedule was too ambitious, especially in view of the
inadequate preparation and resultant reformulation of the project, implemen-
tation capacity constraints, and difficulties encountered regarding alloca-
tion of Government counterpart funds, wbich could not have been foreseen in
early 1975. Also, the original project's design concept was not sound since
detailed studies on the need for extensive irrigation canal lining (para.
3.01) were not available at the time of appraisal. The Bank found in early
1976 that the preparation of detailed designs and related bidding documents
for both the irrigation and drainage systems was significantly lagging.
After having analyzed the reasons for lack of progress, it became clear to
the Bank that project scope should be substantially reduced, focusing mainly
on the drainage system, roads and technical assistance to farmers.
7.02      The decision in 1976/77 to adopt a time-slice approach, by
subdividing the project into stages, proved to be correct. Tn spite of all
the difficulties encountered and delays caused by the lengthy reformulation
exercise, the subsequent progress made under the project was satisfactory.
During the early Implementation stages, BanV. missions consistently advised
SRH of the problems the project was facing and the potential risks involved.
The reformulation process actually began in late 1976 but was completed only
in August 1978. Given the prevailing circumstances in Mexico (elections in
1976 and the economic hardships thereafter), it seems unlikely that this
process could have been accelerated.
7.03      Continuity and frequency of supervision was reasonable until 1979.
Thereafter, as implementation gained momentum and progressed, supervision
mission frequency decreased. In view of the shortfalls in the implementation
of the land leveling program and acquisition of O&M equipment, (para. 4.04)



- 14 -
it seems that Bank missions should have monitored these components more
closely. Generally, there was a reasonable mix of professional skills in
Bank supervision missions. Bank staff were active ard productive during the
reform'ilation stage, received full cooperation from fexican professional
counterparts, and succeeded in establishing a constructive and working
dialogue with the Government. The appraisal recommeadation that contracts
for concrete lining of irrigation canals should not be let until studies
regarding water losses were completed was correct. However, the basic
studies indicating that concrete lining was not required should have been
conducted prior to appraisal.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The justification and objectives were correct in view of the
Government's strategy (para. 1.01 and 2.04) for increasing production through
investment in construction and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage
infrastructure. In retrospect the project was not adequately prepared for
appraisal and was overly ambitious. The unavailability of final designs
(para. 3.01), the requirement that water loss studies be conducted before
contracts be let for concrete canal lining, and most of all the shortage of
coumterpart funds (due to the economic conditions) during the first two years
of the project contributed to the delays in implementation and ultimately led
to the decision to reformulate the project.
8.02      Considering the information available at appraisal it would not
have been reasonable to expect that concrete canal lining would not be
required; although obviously the appraisal mission believed that studies
would indicate that some areas would not require concrete lining. Also, in
view of Mexico's impressive economic performance during the preceding years
neither the Borrower or the bank could have predicted the economic slump
(para. 3.01) that followed in 1976 and 1977. Furthermore, it was reasonable
to assume that a more efficient irrigation system would lead to crop
diversification (para. 5.02 a) and an increase in production of high value
crops.
8.03      The principal lesson learned has been to avoid embarking on
over-ambitious projects in terms of technical and financial capacity. It is
also apparent that more thorough basic and feasibility (technical, financial
and economic) studies are required and that completion of basic studies and
a substantial part of detailed design work are prerequisites to appraisal and
approval of projects with major infrastructure components (para. 3.01).
Another major lesson learned under the revised project was recognition that
shifts in the cropping pattern are not only dependant on technical considera-
tions (i.e., availability of water, sufficient drainage) but also on price
and support policies of the Government (para. 5.03).
8.04      The key elements required to achieve significant increases in
yields and cropping intensity now exist: (a) a strong research and extension
service accepted by the farmers (paras. 4.06 and 4.07); and (b) improved soil
conditions (para 5.02). In the future, project management and research and
extension staff should devote more effort to the critical aspects of land



- 15 -
leveling, water management, and the possibility of water availability
constraints at full development of the project area (paras 5.04-5.06). Land
leveling was considered to be a major element of this project that would
contribute substantially to more efficient water utilization and increased
yields. However, land leveling (para. 5.07) has been the least satisfactory
operation under the project in terms of achievements (less than 20% of target
as revised in 1978). Farmers' objections are the high cost of land leveling,
initial reduction in yields, relatively small yield increases, the long
term required to obtain net benefits, and short-term enortization (five
years) for credit (para. 4.04). These objections should be verified and
amendments made where necessary. Financial incentives for investment in land
leveling should be evaluated during the second phase project. Analyses may
indicate that the advantages of land leveling (a more efficient irrigation
system and more water available, particularly to farmers down stream) benefit
all farmers in the project area and therefore should be considered as public
investment the same as irrigation and drainage infrastructure.
8.05      Appropriate and prompt staffing of agricultural extension services
proved to be an important factor for achieving progress in agricultural
productivity. The technical assistance program became very popular among
farmers, and their future cooperation is a prerequisite for the eventual
achievement of the long-term production goals. The impact of improved
technical assistance can be seen in the increased use of inputs (seeds and
fertilizer), better pest control and improved agronomic practices.
8.06      Management at the local level was strengthened and appropriately
staffed; under the existing administrative and organizational constraints,
their technical capacity and actual performance was satisfactory. There was,
however, a series of shortfalls at the central levels, such as: delays in
issuing authorizations for project implementation operations; delays in
processing contractors' bills and paying them on time; delayed acquisition of
badly needed O&M equipment (para. 4.05); and serious delays in disbursing
funds from the Loan Account.   Recently, the Government and the Bank have
agreed on new procedures to expedite disbursements.
8.07      An adequate cost recovery and O&M program needs to be established
to ensure that equipment and funds are available to carry out a regular
maintenance program throughout the project area. Although considerable
progress was made in 1983 towards achieving the stated O&M cost recovery
goals, the Borrower needs to consider an automatic indexing system for water
rates; perhaps linked to the periodic calculation and adjustments for costs
of production and establishment of farm-gate prices.
8.08      Finally every effort should be made to familiarize farmers with
alternative crops, so that cropping patterns can be diversified to maximize
the benefits to the producers.

Our ref: Of. No. 305.III.4.1.
Mr. Otto Maiss
Operations Evaluation Department

Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Maiss:
We acknowledge receipt of your communication of February 6, 1986,
accompanied by a copy of the draft Project Completion Report on the Bajo Rio
Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation Project I (Loan 1111-ME).
As requested, we now give below our comments on the document, for inclusion in
the final version that will be distributed to the Executive Directors of the
Bank.
There is no doubt that the Report contains valuable observations
certain to be of assistance in improving the development and implementation of
future Bank-financed investment projects in Mexico's agriculture sector.
At various points, the document states that the results of the
project did not matcl original projections -- one of various reasons being
that the difficult economic situation Mexico went through in the mid-70s led
to a reordering of Federal Government investment program priorities, and, as
part of that process, to reformulation of this project and reorganization of
it into several phases. Since it was at this juncture that the project began
to take on real momentum, we consider it to be a valid general conclusion that
Phase I was of great benefit in increasing agricultural production through
investments in the rehabilitation and building irrigation infrastructure,
roads, and drainage systems in the project zone.

Although in general terms we regard the OED document as covering all
aspects of the project execution process, we clarify and expand on certain
points in the comments set out below, which we should be glad to see included
in the final version of the Report; they have been drawn up jointly by staff
from the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources, as Executing Agency
for the project, Nacional Financiers, S.N.C., as Borrower, the Secretariat of
Treasury and Public Credit, as Guarantor, and the Office of the Comptroller-
General of the Federation.
General Comments
See new   1.   The Report indicates that because the project was reformulated and
para. 2.e1      redesigned it did not achieve all the original objectives.  On this
score, we think it important to note that the project was initially
negotiated at a time when Mexico's economic stability justified the
planning of projects on such a major scale, with relative certainty that
they would actually be carried out, and in fact the Bank itself, through
its various preparation and appraisal missions, endorsed the intended
size and scope of the project with conviction.
See para.  2.   It is important to make clear that the results of the project were
6.01             satisfactory.  In certain instances, projected goals were exceeded.  In
others, special emphasis was placed on aspects of the project not
financed by the Bank (training, credit, and cost recovery). As regards
farming, notable successes in reducing and controlling soil salinity
helped increase cropping intensity. In addition, coordination and
cooperation at state, district, and project levels also proved
satisfactory.
See para.  3.   It should be emphasized that the project contributed to the improvement
4.07           of farming practices, pest control, and crop selection, and to greater
and more efficient use of inputs.
See new   4.   With regard to the increase in the final cost of the modified project, it
para. 3.03      should be noted that it was a consequence of the unprecedentedly rapid
inflationary process that affected Mexico during the second half of the
70s and the early 80s.
See new    5.   Although no project proceeds were disbursed during the first three years
para. 4.09      of the execution period, it should be pointed out that the most urgent
works in the target zone went ahead notwithstanding. Once the redesign
process was completed, 102 of proceeds were disbursed immediately. It
should also be noted that the revised disbursement program (1979-1984)
was carried out almost entirely, with only US$6.6 million of the final
loan figure of US$50 million being canceled aa of December 21 (sic], 1984.
[TN: No paragraph numbered "6" appears in the original text.]
See new    7.   Regarding the references in the Report to repeated disbursement delays
para. 8.06      occasioned by complicated, time-consuming internal procedures associated
with billing, verification of vouchers, processing, and payment, we feel
it should be pointed out that new mechanisms such as the Statement of
Expenditures have been introduced on some projects as a means of



- 18 -
streamlining the drawing down of loan proceeds. It only remains for the
Bank to approve extension of them to all current projects, a change
which, it should be indicated, is under negotiation.
See para.  8.   Regarding the observation that the project zone lacks the kind of
6.02            commercial organization likely to foster the introduction of other,
high-value crops, it would be advisable to indicate that in fact the
project succeeded in increasing marketing activity in the zone, although
further developmental effort is still needed.
See para.  9-   The Report quotes various internal rates of return for the project:
5.11            182 (page iv); 15% (para. 5.11); and 17% (Basic Data Sheet).  We
recommend clarification as to which figure should be taken as the actual
IRR.
See para.  10.  The Report indicates that procurement of operating and maintenance
4.11            equipment and award of civil engineering contracts were mainly a matter
of local competitive bidding. It should be noted not only that contracts
were awarded according to the procedures agreed on with the Bank but also
that conversations are now being held with the Bank on methods of making
the procurement and contract award process even more efficient and rapid.
See paras. 11. Finally, it should be made clear that although the Borrower has no power
4.14 & 8.07     to set or increase the rates charged for water use, the Secretriat of
Agriculture and Water Resources has set consumption quotas, on the basis
of various analyses of consumer capacity to pay and considering the
production incentives advocated in the National Integrated Rural
Development Program.
Yours, etc.
