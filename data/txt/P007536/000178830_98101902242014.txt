INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR BAJO RIO BRAVO/BAJO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A., with the guarantee of the United
Mexican States, for the equivalent of US$150 million to assist in
financing the Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo San Juan Irrigation Project. The
loan would have a term of 25 years, including seven years of grace,
with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         Some of the major structural features of the Mexican economy -
past present and future - were analyzed in "The Economy of Mexico: A
Basic Report" (192-ME), distributed to the Executive Directors on June 26,
1973. Short-run trends in 1973-74 were covered in "Mexico: Current Economic
Position and Prospects", distributed to the Executive Directors on
September 27, 1974.   Another updating report on the economy will be
prepared by a mission which is scheduled to visit Mexico in July this
year. Country data sheets are contained in Annex I.
3.         For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the Mexican economic system, measured in terms of GDP growth, has
been outstandingly successful. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate
has exceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950s to 1972, Mexico was among
the few countries in the developing world to combine sustained and rapid
growth with monetary and balance of payments stability. Inflation averaged
less than 5 percent a year and the dollar value of the peso was maintained
at the level fixed in 1954.
4.         Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector resources.
The role of government in promoting economic growth was expressed on the one
hand in the development of strategic infrastructure and major utility
industries and on the other in policies which featured price support,
import control and agrarian reform measures in the agricultural sector
and external protection and the provision of fiscal incentives in the
industrial sector.
5.        The relative emphasis of public and private investment was, however,
reflected in changes in the structure of output and employment and the
expansion of manufacturing industry. Agriculture, nevertheless, continued to
be the chief source of.employment and in 1970 accounted for 39 percent
of the economically active population.



6.         In spite of rapid and sustained economic growth over the last
two decades, the combination of a high demographic growth rate - about
3.4 percent per year - and, until fairly recently, primarily import
substituting industrial policies, have prevented an adequate absorption
of the labor force in productive employment. Industrial growth has been
quite substantial - about 8 percent annually over the past two decades -
but could have been even faster if industrial and trade policies had been
primarily focused to exploiting Mexico's unique export opportunities
originating in its contiguity to a large industrial market in which labor
costs are a multiple of those in Mexico. It was only in the early 'seventies
that some major steps were taken to develop manufacturing exports on a
large scale - the system of drawbacks on domestic taxes paid on exports
and the "border industries"' regime were introduced at that time, and these
have been so highly successful as to suggest that a lot more could still
be done. As it is, 40 percent of the labor force is estimated in either
marginal occupations - relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid -
or openly unemployed.
7.        The Mexican strategy for development has, in the past, relied
on a combination of public action and private profit. The Government has
played a highly important role in this process, both as a promoter of key
sectors and as a setter of a regulatory and institutional framework within
which private and social groups could compete and contend, but which was
both firm enough and flexible enough to ensure overall continuity and
stability. As a formula for growth, this system has served Mexico well,
but it has also led to a sharpening of contrasts in income and wealth
between people and among regions. This was not an entirely incidental
by-product of the process of growth; the share of the Government in the economy
was kept down quite deliberately for many years, and evidently the scope of
redistributive policies was limited as long as tax ratios as low as 8 - 10
percent - among the lowest in the world - were maintained. The Government
played a crucial role in the development of private commercial agriculture
through its irrigation and credit policies and of industry through the
provision of infrastructure, education, social legislation and financial
policies, but it did not concern itself primarily with the problems of
the poorest sections of the population. While the land reform of 1917 -
widely spread in the 'thirties - was adhered to, the absence of abundant
fiscal resources prevented major programs to improve the economic status
of the beneficiaries of the land reform. The present Government, however,
came to power on a program of combining past growth policies with much
greater efforts in favor of the rural poor, and has launched a number of
ambitious initiatives in this direction. Their continuity and viability
will depend, inter alia on the Government's continued willingness to mobilize
fiscal resources to support these programs. So far the record is impressive:
the ratio of public revenues to GNP which in 1970 stood at 11.2 percent,
for 1975 is estimated at 15.7 percent.



3
8.        The attempts which have been made by the present administration
(1970-76) to alleviate the poverty of the countryside and to redress some
of the imbalances between rural and urban Mexico have several dimensions.
They include a revised Agrarian Reform Law (1971) and a new Federal Water
Law (1972), both of which are intended to promote a more equitable distri-
bution of basic agricultural resources. These measures have been complemented
by changes in the sectoral allocation of available agricultural credit in
order to increase the share of low-income farmers and ejidatarios (members
of ejidos, which are a form of collective land tenure based on usufruct),
the introduction of higher support prices for basic foodcrops and increased
government outlays for agricultural research, training and extension services,
with particular regard to the needs of peasant farmers. Perhaps the most
significant innovation has been a new program for integrated rural develop-
ment with which the World Bank has been associated from an early stage.
9.        The social and economic needs of the rural sector have not, however,
monopolized government attention; those of urban-industrial development have
also been stressed in the form of heavy public investment in basic industries -
delayed during the 1960s - and an innovative low-income housing program which
has been financed with a five percent payroll tax. Productive investment
has thus been complemented, in the urban as well as the rural economy, by
institutional changes and public expenditures designed to improve the living
conditions of the poor. This parallel effort has, however, generated several
problems of short-run economic management.
10.       In 1971, after monetary and balance of payments pressures had
emerged during the previous year, the (then new) Government took stringent
action to control demand with the effect that the GDP growth rate fell to
3.4 percent by comparison with a decade average of 7.1 percent in the
1960s. In 1972, renewed expansion was stimulated by public expenditure
and the GDP growth rate rose to 7.4 percent. There was another year of
rapid growth (7.6 percent) in 1973 - but this time associated with an
increase of 21 percent in prices (GDP deflator). Inflation was not the
only novelty; private savings, which in the recent past had helped finance
sustained growth, increased by only 11 percent, compared with an average
rate of 18 percent in 1965-71; the inflow of private capital was replaced
by a net outflow, and private investment, particularly in the industrial
sectors, slackened, reflecting some uncertainty on the part of the business
community. In the public sector, there was a record fiscal deficit - amounting
to 5.6 percent of GDP by comparison with an average of 2.7 percent in 1965-71.
A major share of the limited volume of real savings was pre-empted to finance
part of this deficit while net external borrowing of US$1.2 billion (2.4 percent
of GDP) was deployed to finance the rest. These trends were inevitably
reflected in the balance of payments where the current account deficit
rose to 3.0 percent of GDP (by comparison with an average of 2.0 percent
in 1965-71).
11.       Noting these trends, the authorities had, by mid-1973, put a
restrictive monetary and credit policy into effect and complemented this
with what was originally intended to be an austere public finance program



for FY74. Taken together, these measures were expected to restrict demand
and to reduce both inflation and the size of the current account deficit.
The provisional results for 1974 indicate that whereas the former objective
was achieved, the latter was not. Monetary and credit policies were, on the
whole, carried out as planned. The rate of increase of prices thus decelerated
from April onwards, and a positive differential between Mexican and foreign
interest rates was re-established by the end of the year although credit was
not allocated as originally intended because the public sector again pre-
empted a large part of the available quantity. Higher than planned public
expenditures and lower than expected revenues meant,moreover, that the fiscal
deficit was larger than foreseen as were the growth rates of aggregate demand
and real imports. The deficit in the balance of payments on current account
thus amounted to 4.2 percent of GDP rather than the intended 2.8 percent.
Net public borrowing rose to US$2.9 billion of which US$1.8 billion was
required to finance the fiscal deficit, the remainder being needed for
balance of payments purposes including coverage of large capital outflows.
12.       The Government's economic program for 1975 incorporates a major
effort to mobilize additional public sector resources, the increase in
revenues being estimated at more than 3.0 percent of GDP. Monetary and
credit policies will continue to be restrictive although, given attractive
interest rates, domestic savings are expected to rise. Public expenditures -
both capital and current, are expected to increase significantly in real
terms and the planned fiscal deficit amounts to 4.3 percent of GDP, three
quarters of which will be externally financed. Planned internal public
borrowing thus is modest, which means that the private sector will receive
a major share of available credit and private investment is likely to increase.
The resource gap is expected to decline from 2.1 percent to 1.3 percent of
GDP - an improvement which reflects the growth of petroleum exports (projected
at about US$450 million for 1975). The current account deficit is estimated
at 3.5 percent of GDP. The 1975 program is thus designed to increase public
and private investment and public consumption whilst reducing private
consumption by means of taxation and a voluntary increase in private savings.
From an equity standpoint the recent tax measures are progressive. The 1975
program is thus consistent with the Government's overall economic objectives,
and if successfully implemented, should increase the productive capacity of
the economy whilst furthering the cause of distributive justice.
13.       On December 31, 1973, Mexico's outstanding disbursed public debt
of more than one year was US$5.2 billion. Net medium- and long-term public
borrowing in 1974 of US$2.2 billion reflects heavy reliance on external
as well as internal capital to finance the fiscal deficit and some borrowing
- as in 1973 - to offset private capital movements.
14.       Annex 1, Page 4, shows that 41.3 percent of public external
capital contracted in 1968-72 was borrowed from private banks and that
international organizations accounted for the next largest share (22.2
percent). The World Bank accounted for 14.7 percent of all commitments.
New debt contracted in. 1974, however, was obtained at higher interest rates
and on shorter maturities than in the recent past, in the light of a severe
contraction in international capital markets.



-5-
15.       During 1975 it is expected that net public external borrowing of
more than one year will be on the order of US$2.4 billion, which would amount
to 3.1 percent of estimated GDP compared with 2.7 percent in 1974. This
level of indebtedness is consistent with Mexico's projected future capacity
to service the interest and amortization payments, taking account of the
expected growth of real exports in the medium term. The behavior of petroleum
production and exports is an important element in these projections. The
size of Mexico's oil reserves has not yet been determined and published
estimates differ widely from the official ones. However, taking account
of (i) the proven reserves position as known to us, (ii) the likely avail-
.ability of resources for investment, and (iii) the likely supply of invest-
ment goods, the outlook for production in 1975-80 appears to be good. After
allowing for increases in domestic consumption, the rate of growth of crude
output and the export surplus will continue to rise each year. On our
present expectations, by 1980, the net export balance of crude and petroleum
products should be of the order of US$1,000 million. Mexico's debt service
ratio was 24.5 percent in 1973. The estimate for 1974 is 18.0 percent.
Assuming that the average terms of future debt improve slightly by comparison
with those recently obtained, the debt service ratio is expected to be lower
than 25 percent through i980. The Bank's share in public debt outstanding
and disbursed at the end of 1973 was approximately 15.3 percent and its
share in debt service payments was about 7.7 percent. These shares are not
expected to change significantly in the remainder of the decade.
16.       Mexico is thus creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms
provided the Government exercises due restraint in monetary, credit and
fiscal policies; its recent actions in designing the 1975 economic program
suggest it intends to do so.
17.        In order to adequately meet its financing needs to assure continued
growth with equity in the future, Mexico will have to both strengthen its
fiscal effort and supplement that effort with substantial external borrowing.
This is what the Government intends to do. Given that the country's diversified
industrial structure is capable of supplying a good part of its capital goods
requirements, some local cost financing by external agencies is necessary.
Bank loans in sectors like power, transport and industry are traditionally
tied to the foreign exchange cost of projects. I consider some local currency
financing to be justified in other sectors with characteristically low foreign
exchange requirements, especially fer high priority and institutionally complex
projects like those for agrTcultural development which offer substantial economfic
and social benefits and which call for strong institutional support from the
Bank.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
18.       With the US$50 million loan for integrated rural development in
the Papaloapan Basin signed on October 30, 1974, the Bank has made 38 loans
to Mexico for a total of US$1,888 million, net of cancellations. At the
end of March 1975, the Bank held US$1,540 million including US$561 million
not yet disbursed. Most of these loans have been made for power, industry,
transport, water supply,roads and agriculture. The execution of Bank-financed
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. However, financial performance
criteria have not been met under the Fourth Power Sector loan and the matter
is being discussed with the Government; remedial actions are expected in
the near future.
19.        IFC has made 12 investment commitments in Mexico, amounting to
US$54.3 million, of which as of March 31, 1975, US$36.3 million had been
sold, terminated or cancelled. The balance US$18.0 million held by the
Corporation consists of US$15.9 million in loans and US$2.1 million in
equity. Annex 11 contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC
commitments as of March 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
20.        The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico are (i) to support
policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the benefits of
economic growth; (ii) strengthen policies and programs leading to continued
economic growth, both by investing in projects that directly or indirectly
make significant contributions to output and employment and by supporting
changes that will make institutions function more effectively; (iii) help
resolve critical adjustment problems that emerge from Mexico's continued
growth; and (iv) transfer sufficient resources to complement Mexico's quite
appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds for economic
and social investments in a framework of internal and external financial
stability.
21.        The composition of recent and prospective Bank lending to Mexico
follows the evolution of the Government and the Bank's perception of Mexico's
development needs both in terms of sectoral mix and in terms of policy emphasis.
Thus, the Las Truchas steel mill, for which the Bank made a loan in FY74,
is expected not only to further Mexico's industrial growth in an efficient
mannier, but also to support the Governnient's program of industrial decentrali-
zation. Similarly, the Airports Development Project (FY74) is designed to
promote rapid and reliable domestic long-distance passenger transportation
and to contribute to the Government's policy of regional integration. The
earlier (FY73) Mexico City Water Supply Project also pursues multiple objectives.
Responding to the need for expanding urban infrastructure, particularly in
low-income areas, it has helped create a specialized institution for efficient
management of scarce water resources that cuts across existing functional
and administrative boundaries.



22.        In view of the difficult structural problems of Mexico's agri-
culture and the sector's crucial importance to the country's further develop-
ment, the Bank has substantially expanded and diversified its support for
agriculture. Consistent with the overall framework of country and sector
objectives, a three-tier approach is being followed. First, Bank support
is aimed at expanding and strengthening irrigation and agricultural credit
programs so as to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population more
adequately and to generate the foreign exchange for rising import requirements.
Second, to assist the Government in its efforts to raise the incomes of the
rural poor and improve their standard of living through a combination of
directly productive, productive support and social infrastructure invest-
ment. Third,to strengthen Mexico's institutional capability to use scarce
agricultural resources more efficiently.
23.       The present project would be one of the most important undertakings
of the present administration to bring agricultural production back in line
wrth domestic and foreign demand. It would also serve to improve the
incomes of a substantial number of poor farmers. The Integrated Rural
Development Project I (Papaloapan), and the Integrated Rural Development
Project HI (PIDER) being presented to you along with this project, both
have their primary focus on improving the living standards of the rural
poor through integrated, multi-sectoral development. In addition, we are
exploring the possibilities of assisting the Government in its efforts to
expand agricultural education and to develop Mexico's lagoon fisheries.
Finally, the Bank is helping to strengthen Mexico's resource management,
both through the National Water Study which will provide the basis for a
rational water development policy and through assistance in formulating and
implementing a research and pilot program scheme for the tropical Gulf zones;
an operation that, we hope, would lay the foundation for large-scale exploita-
tion of tropical agriculture in the future.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
24.       Agriculture has long been a dynamic element of Mexico's economic
development.   The sector's growth record of more than 5 percent per annum
over nearly three decades (1940-1965) is unique among Latin American countries.
In that period, it managed to satisfy. the demand of a rapidly growing popula-
tion and to transform the country from a net importer to a net exporter of
agricultural products. Since the late 1960s, however, growth rates have
fallen below the growth of domestic demand. Although prolonged adverse
climatic conditions played an important role, structural constraints seem
to be the main cause of sluggish production. The growing dependence on
yield increases and crop diversification, as against further expansion of
the cultivated area, indicates that the past policy of extensive development
has largely run its course. Limited idle resources in the traditional agri-
cultural areas will make short- and medium-term production growth primarily
a function of progress in utilizing more efficiently resources already under
exploitation, mainly in existing irrigation districts but also in the temperate
rainfed areas. Production growth in the long run will, however, depend
increasingly on the large scale development of Mexico's virtually unexploited
tropical Gulf coast.



- 8 -
25.       Although agriculture contributed only 10 percent to GDP in 1974,
the sector is still the largest employer with nearly 4C percent of the
labor force. It is also an important foreign exchange earner. Agricultural
exports totalled US$1.3 billion in 1974, nearly 40 percent of total commodity
exports. However, the net surplus of agricultural trade in 1974 was only
half the 1972 level. Coarse grains, notably maize, wheat and soybeans,
and milk powder account for most of the imports. The most important export
products are cotton and sugar, with 22 percent and 16 percent of total agri-
cultural exports, followed by coffee, tomatoes and livestock. While Mexico
has diversified its agricultural production, maize and beans remain the
subsistence crops for most of the peasants and the basic components of the
Mexican diet. Together they account for nearly 70 percent of the rainfed
and 10 percent of the irrigated cropland.
26.        In relation to its size, Mexico has limited agricultural resources.
Mostly because of inadequate rainfall or poor drainage, only 35 million ha
are considered potential cropland out of a total area of nearly 200 million
ha. However, only 15 million ha, 4 million ha of which are irrigated, are
actually cropped. Water supply and control are, therefore, a sine qua ron
of agricultural production in most of Mexico's cultivable areas. Public
irrigation programs have in fact been a chief source of output growth since
implementation on a large scale in the 1940s, and the land under irrigation
in 1974 contributed more than 40 percent of total agricultural output. Public
irrigation projects have laid the foundation for the development of a modern
commercial sector which helped the country earn the foreign exchange needed
to industrialize.
27.       While until recently agriculture policies were successful in raising
production, they did not attend to the pressing problems of rural unemployment,
high degrees of income concentration and accelerated rates of rural-urban
migration. The rural society is still a composite of striking differences,
in spite of the far-reaching Agrarian Reform Legislation of 1917 under which
more than half of Mexico's total land area was redistributed. The small class
of sophisticated agricultural entrepreneurs contrasts with a large number of
peasants in subsistence agriculture with generally small lots in unfavorable
ecological conditions. These peasants typically work by traditional methods,
barely participate in the market economy, live in primitive social conditions
and subsist on a modicum of food production from their farms. According to
a recent Bank of Mexico study, only 7 percent of the almost 3 million farms
in Mexico are modern, while 53 percent are classified as subsistence units
and another 40 percent as traditional, producing only small or no marketable
surpluses.
28.       More than 20 million people live in Mexico's rural areas.     Agri-
culture is by far their most important employment and income source. About
4 million families, representing close to 40 percent of Mexico's labor force,
depend on agriculture for their livelihood. They comprise three distinct
groups: 1.5 million ejidatarios, 1.2 million private farmers and about
1.3 million landless families. The number of landless agricultural workers



- 9 -
is increasing rapidly as a consequence of limited farm land in relation to
an annual rural population growth of 2 percent. It is estimated that 2
million rural families have incomes of less than US$135 per capita. The
income spread, limited employment possibilities and the lack of infra-
structure and social services have resulted in massive migration from rural
to urban areas.
29.       The present Government has responded to the need of increasing
agricultural production and improving the situation of the rural poor.
It has substantially increased the budget allocations for the rural sector
in absolute terms and relative to other sectors, and significantly changed
other policies. The more important features of its comprehensive and
generally well-designed strategy are: (i) promulgation of new legislation
aiming at a more rational and equitable resource utilization; (ii) reform
and strengthening of the agricultural support services, technical and
organizational assistance, credit and marketing in particular; (iii) expansion
of irrigation and irrigation rehabilitation investment programs; (iv) creation
of the National Water Plan to formulate comprehensive water management
policies; (v) implementation of an integrated rural development program;
and (vi) institutionalization of coordinating mechanisms among government
agencies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.        The proposed project would be the twelfth Bank operation for
agriculture in Mexico. Previous lending in the sector consisted of four
loans for agricultural credit, six for irrigation and one for integrated
rural development. The project was appraised in two stages. The main
mission visited the area in October and a small follow-up mission in
December 1974. Negotiations took place from March 27 to 31, 1975. The
Mexican negotiating team was led by Mr. German Sandoval, Chief of the
Negotiating Section, Nacional Financiera, S.A. A report entitled '"Appraisal
of the Bajo Rio Bravo and Bajo San Juan Irrigation Project" (Report No. 715-ME,
dated April 16, 1975) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Description
31.       The proposed project would develop intensive agriculture and
livestock operations on 280,000 ha in the irrigation districts of Bajo
Rio Bravo and Bajo San Juan, located in the state of Tamaulipas on the
right bank of the Rio Bravo (also known as Rio Grande) along the border
with the United States. The project would complete the rehabilitation and
betterment of the two irrigation districts initiated in 1964 under Bank
loan 336-ME. Performance under the previous loan was satisfactory. Actual
construction costs, crop yields and net farm income at the end of the project
development period approximated i:hose forecast at appraisal. However, the
scope of the project was too limited to achieve the water control required
for extended diversification into high yielding crops and the application
of advanced production techniques.



- lo -
32.       The two irrigation districts form a contiguous block but have
different sources of water supply. The Bajo San Juan District is supplied
from the San Juan River reservoir at Marte R. Gomez, while the Bajo Rio
Bravo District utilizes waters of the Rio Bravo from the Falcon and Amistad
Reservoirs and the Rio Alamo in accordance with the provisions of the 1944
Treaty between the United States and Mexico (see paras. 35-37). The project
works are prinarily designed to allow Mexico to use its share of the
international waters more effecti-vely. This would be accomplished by
lining the irrigation distribution systems to reduce water losses and
leveling project lands to increase efficiency of water use on the farms.
The existing drainage system would be enlarged and extended to lower high
water tables and salinity content of soils. Other facilities would be
provided to bring the districts up to the standard of a modern irrigation
system. The intensive incremental technical assistance program included
in the project would form an integral part of the national research and
extension programs and complement and strengthen ongoing efforts.
33.       The construction schedule is designed to minimize interference
with ongoing production. Thus, project works would only be executed during
the second cropping season on land blocks taken out of cultivation on a
rotational basis for lack of water. Initial work would concentrate on lining
the main canals. This would be done on existing alignments where canals can
be taken out of service for at least a six-month period. Where this is not
possible, parallel canals would be constructed, with appropriate connections
to the existing system. Individual sections of the main canals will be
lined only after completion of infiltration tests and water balance analysis
to ensure most economical specifications (Section 3.02 Guarantee Agreement).
34.       At present, water supply - through precipitation and irrigation -
only meets about 60 percent of crop requirements in the main season. The
proposed investment and technical assistance package would double irrigation
efficiency from its present level and thus provide for adequate water supply
for estimated crop needs in normal years. It is expected that the additional
water supply would be used in the main cropping season. The increased
production value under the project would, therefore, derive from higher
yields and higher value cropping patterns rather than from an increase in
cropping intensity. However, some farmers are likely to plant second crops
although irrigation water availability for this would not be assured.
International Waters Aspect
35.       The water supply of the two districts iS regulated by the 1944
Treaty between the United States and Mexico. Under the Treaty, all flows
in the catchment area of the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande below El Paso are accounted
for and allocated between the two states according to a fixed formula. The
proposed project would increase the efficiency of water use on the Mexican
side without affecting the allocation of water between the United States and

36.       The international treaty does not preclude either country from
constructing additional water control works in the Basin but any ensuing
reductions of inflows to the Rio Bravo are charged against the total water
share of the respective country. The Mexican Government has, therefore,
been asked for an assurance that no development will be undertaken in the
Rio Bravo Basin that would deplete the water supply to the project without the
specific concurrence of the Bank (Section 3.09 Guarantee Agreement).
37.        In the past, the highly saline drainage waters of the Bajo Rio
San Juan District were discharged directly into the Rio Bravo, and American
farmers downstream claimed that their crops were damaged during low river
flows. In order to resolve this problem, the Mexican Government has now
constructed a lined channel to connect the Bajo San Juan to the Bajo Rio
Bravo drainage systems. At times of low river flows, drainage water of the
Bajo Rio San Juan is pumped through these systems ir,to the Laguna Madre at
the Gulf coast and thus kept out of the Rio Bravo.
Land Tenure and Income Incidence
38.       The provisions of the new Federal Water Law on land expropriation
are not applicable in the project area, since it comprises two established
irrigation districts. However, as a result of earlier land reforms, only
2.5 percent of the farmers own more than 50 ha each and 12.1 percent more
than 20 ha. Of the 18,670 farms in the project area, 7,440 '40 percent)
belong to ejidatarios, 7,300 (39 percent) to private farmers and 3,930
(21 percent) to settlers. The average farm size for private farmers is
31.7 ha, for settlers 12.6 ha, an.d for ejidatarios 9.8 ha.
39.       Most ejidatarios, settlers and a large number of private farmers
are among the poorest 40 percent of the population; their income would increase
substantially after full project development. The expected income distribution
among project beneficiaries is a corollary to the land tenure pattern and,
hence, will be only moderately skewed.

Markets and Marketing
40.       The proposed cropping pattern is consistent with market prospects
and the comparative advantage of the project area. Compared to present
national production levels, the project would produce significant quantities
of milk, cattle, vegetables, cotton, beans and oil seeds. Cotton, feeder
cattle and vegetables are also traditional Mexican export commodities.
Mexico's medium and long staple quality cotton has a well-established
international position and the exportable surplus of the increased output
from the project will find easy outlets on the world market. Mexico has
recently imposed export quotas on feeder cattle to secure adequate supply
for the domestic market. The project will help ease these restrictions
and balance the decline of exports from their previous level of nearly
one million head. The outlook for feeder cattle exports continues to be
good in view of the many American farmers along the border depending on
imports from Mexico for their fattening operations, and substantially lower
costs of cattle raising in Mexico compared to the southern United States.
41.       The project area enjoys an even greater comparative advantage with
respect to labor-intensive vegetables such as okra, string beans and squash.
While previous limited production had taken place on an incidental basis
to fill gaps in the US fresh market supply during times of adverse
climatic conditions, major US food chains have of late been relying
increasingly on Mexican supplies for food processing. The projected
vegetable production under the project for export after full devolopment,
equivalent to 15 percent of Mexico's vegetable exports to the US in 1974,
is consistent with the expected demand from the United States contractors.
Overproduc.ion is unlikely to occur since the cropping area is determined
each year by the size of contracts made before the planting season. If
actual production were to deviate from the overall projected demand, adjust-
ments in the cropping pattern could be made easily without jeopardizing the
economic justification of the project because of the versatility of production
in the project area.
42.       The project area has excellent transport access to the major
markets. Presently installed storage and processing capacity would be
adequate for most products, but an expansion of the cotton ginning and milk
processing capacitv would be required. The private sector is expected to
provide for the additional capacity, as well as the packing and transportation
facilities that might be required, as it has done in other parts of the
country.
Management and Organization
43.       The Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRH), which has a long-
established international reputation for the excellence of its technical
staff, would be responsible for the project. While its headquarters in
Mexico City would prepare the final design and issue the tender documents,
field responsibility for construction, operation and maintenance of the
p,c-iect would be delegated to the North Tamaulipas Zone Office. To strengthen



- 1 3 -
the Zone office, experienced personnel from other offices would be transferred
to fill key positions. Agricultural development - annual cropping patterns,
water allocation, technical assistance and credit - would be handled by a
Management Committee, comprising representatives of SRH, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, participating banks and farmer
representatives.
Water Charges
44.       The Government's policy objectives in respect of irrigation water
charges are to (i) enhance the effective use of irrigation water, (ii) recover
fully operation and maintenance costs, and (iii) recover as much as feasible
of the investment costs. At present, however, only about half the operation
and maintenance costs and virtually no investment costs are recovered through
water charges. Further, water charges are levied on an area basis which puts
a premium on land and not water as the scarce factor and, consequently,
encourages farmers to maximize returns on land rather than water. These
practices have to be seen against the historic background of Mexican irriga-
tion development; irrigation water from public investment has traditionally
been considered a free good to the farmer owning land in the command area of
the lrrigation system.
45.       The new Federal Water Law of 1972 constituted an initiative to
redress this situation. However, the relevant provisions of the law on
water charges have not yet been applied since the implementing regulations
are not yet issued. Assurances have been obtained that the Government would,
within seven months after the date of the Guarantee Agreement, issue the
regulations as required to establish and collect water charges to recover
the cost of public investment in irrigation (Section 4.02 Guarantee Agreement).
The regulations are expected to lay down, inter alia, the following principles:
i. Compensation charges for investment cost recovery and service
charges for maintenance would be levied on a volumetric and service
charges for operation on an area basis;
ii. Compensation charges would be differentiated according to the
value of crops grown;
iii. Socio-economic studies would provide the basis for determining the
compensation charges. The studies would be updated every two years
to allow adjustment of the charges according to changes in the
payment capacity of the beneficiaries;
iv. Service charges would be adjusted every two years, taking into
account the foreseeable cost development to ensure full recovery
of operation and maintenance costs.



- 14 -
Investment Cost Recovery
46.        Estimates of the investment cost recovery can be made with
accuracy only after completion of the socio-economic studies. The actual
compensation charges will depend on (a) the farmers' net income after
meeting all crop production costs, taxes and project operation and
maintenance charges, less a minimum living allowance; and (b) an adequate
income incentive to utilize land and water resources most effectively.
Assurances have been obtained that the Government would carry out the
socio-economic studies, in consultation with the Bank, promptly after
completion of the works in each irrigation unit of the project and start
levying compensation charges within five months after completion of the
socio-economic studies (Section 3.10 Guarantee Agreement). The Government
has stated its intention to update the socio-economic studies every two
years and to recover the investment costs in a period not exceeding 25 years.
The actual recovery period would, in this case, be less than 20 years if
government revenues through incremental property and production taxes were
taken into account. Using a 10 percent discount rate as opportunity cost
of capital in Mexico, the investment would yield, in financial terms, a
recovery index of 50 percent through directly attributable incremental
revenues.
Costs and Financing
47.        The project costs, including contingencies (US$170 million), are
estimated at US$384 million. The major cost components are civil works
and technical assistance, which represent 69 percent and 22 percent,
respectively, of base line costs. The Bank loan of US$150 million would
finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of US$129 million - excluding
material and equipment which the Government furnishes to the contractors -
and 50 percent of the technical assistance program (US$21 million). The
remaining costs would be met through government budgetary allocations.
Details of estimated project costs and their financing appear at Annex III.
Procurement
48.        Contracts for civil works would be let under international
competitive bidding and, whenever feasible, be grouped into large packages
of at least US$1.6 million each. International competitive bidding would
not be required for land leveling which SRH would contract in small jobs
with local groups of farmers. This procedure has the advantage of associating
the ejidatarios and farmers ultimately benefitting from the project in the
execution of these works and, more importantly, providing them with training
for adoption of soil conservation practices. International competitive
bidding would also not be required for smaller works which,because of their
nature and timing, cannot be included in the major contracts. The items
exempt from international competitive bidding would account for less than
20 percent of civil works contracts to be financed by the Bank, which has
been the limit for awards on local bids and negotiated contracts under



- 15 -
previous irrigation loans. Building materials and standard equipment items
purchased in bulk orders by SRH under local bidding and furnished to the
contractors would not be financed by the Bank loan.
Disbursement
49.       The Bank would disburse against (i) 45 percent of payment to
contractors for civil works let under international competitive bidding,
for small civil works contracts procured under standard government procedures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank, not exceeding the equivalent of
Mex$2 million each, up to an aggregate maximum of Mex$100 million, and for
land leveling; and (ii) 50 percent of the cost of technical assistance during
the initial period of the project. The loan would be disbursed in seven years,
i976-1982.
Economic Justification
50.        The proposed project represents one of the most important under-
takings of the present administration to increase agricultural production.
The annual incremental production value from the project area - Mex$1.9 billion
(US$152 million) after full development, equivalent to about 4 percent of
Mexico's agricultural production in 1973 - will help reduce Mexico's present
deficit in foodstuffs and improve the balance of payments, both through
export expansion and import substitution.
51.       While the thrust of the project is on increased production, it
would also help reduce unemployment. Under the project, about 17,000 man-
years of new employment would be generated annually, which, together with the
income effects and forward linkages to agricultural processing and marketing,
would contribute to the revival of the sluggish economy in the lower Rio
Bravo Basin with its 500,000 inhabitants. The project would benefit
directly more than 100,000 people and generate additional government
revenues through taxes of US$4 million yearly.
52.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 19 percent.      It
would not fall below 14 percent even if a combination-of unlikely unfavor-
able events were to ensue. Secondary benefits from acceleration of the
general economic activity in the region as a result of the project were
not quantified and, hence, not included in the economic analysis.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. No. 527    Fourth Irrigation Project:   $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Estimated project costs have risen by about 36 percent.
Estimated project benefits will also be higher but probably not
enough to fully offset cost increases. The economic rate of return
from the project is, however, expected to remain acceptable. The
Closing Date has been extended by one year to June 30, 1976 to
enable completion of works.
Ln. No. 695    Fourth Road Project:   $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Closing Date:   Jtme 30, 1975
Five roads included in the project have been completed and
opened to traffic. The remaining six roads are expected to be
completed at various dates up to mid-1976, about one-and-a-half
years behind schedule consequent to initial delays in budgetary
allocati.ons. Four of the project roads had cost increases, mainly
because of design revisions and sharp pr-ice increases in late 1973.
The cost overruns will be fully met by the Government.
Ln. No. 793    Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:    $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All related project construction in Ixtapa Tourism Zone is
eXpected to be completed by mid-1975, which coincideswith the
completion of the International Airport at Zihuatanejo and the
first hotel in Ixtapa. A Trust Fund was recently organized for
the provision of urban infrastructure in the town of Zihuatanejo
and works have been undertaken since December 1974. It is now
estimated that all works related to this project will be completed
.by end-1975,.by which time 526 hotel rooms should also be available
In the tourism area.
Ln. No. 820    Ports Project:   $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
Despite some initial delays in the preparation of tender
documents and processing of disbursement applications, the execution
of this project is on the whole proceeding satisfactorily. Studies
for new port tariffs, have been completed and revised tariffs
introduced on March 7. These revised -tariffs, and other ancillary
actions proposed, will substantially meet the loan requirements.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive-.Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strength and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 824    Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project:    $35 Million Loan
of June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. After a slow
start due to organizational problems, FONEI's estimates to commit
the Bank funds by the second quarter of 1975 and has recently been
appraised for a possible second loan by the Bank.
Ln. No. 825    Second Railway Project:   $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1375
Due to increased costs and delays in implementing a recommended
tariffs increase, the financial position of the railways did not meet
the agreed targets established in the loan documents. New tariffs
have been, however, put in force on January 1, 1975. Execution of
this project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 834    Fourth Power Sector Program:   $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The construction program has been delayed by over a year except
for frequency unification, which is ahead of schedule. Recently, the
borrower has tried to improve its overall construction performance by
strengthening its construction management and the results of the last
six months have been encouraging. The sector's financial performance
was unsatisfactory in 1974 and the Government is considering remedial
measures to improve it.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:    $90 Million Loan of June 18,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily.
However, disbursements from the loan account have been delayed due to
unresolved administrative arrangements between the Mexico Valley Water
Commission (the executing agency) and the Federal Government. It is
expected that disbursements from the Loan account will soon increase
substantially reflecting the progress of the project. A sales contract
between the Water Commission and the State of Mexico, which is a
condition for disbursement of funds aggregating over $40 million,
continues to be under negotiations. Meanwhile, interim arrangements
have been worked out for the sale of water in a limited number of
communities within the State of Mexico.
Ln. No. 910    Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Project:    $110 Million Loan
of June 18, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Commitments and disbursements of sub-loans are progressing satis-
factorily and are ahead of schedule. The amount under the Low Income
Producers Sub-Project is almost fully committed and under the General
Sub-Project is expected to be fully committed by March 1975. Increased
discount rates to the participating banks and higher onlending rates to
borrowers under the General Sub-Project are being proposed to meet
rising costs of loan administration.

Ln. No. 934   Las Truchas Steel Project:    $70 Million Loan of September 12,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Execution of the project and procurement of the equipment
financed by the loan are progressing as scheduled. Cost increases
are, however, expected due to world-wide inflation.
Ln. No. 968    Seventh Highway Project:   $90 Million Loan of March 1, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, l97B
This loan became effective on May 29, 1974. The engineering
for the six roads included in the project, for which detailed engineer-
Ing had not been completed at the time of Board presentation, has now
been completed. The economic justification of the roads concerned
has been confirmed on the-basis of final cost estimates. Construction
works on two road sectors have recently started.
Ln. No. 969    Rio Panuco Irrigation Project:   $77 Million Loan of March 1,
1974; Closing Date:   December Tr, 1980
The loan became effective on May 29, 1974. Execution of the

project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1022   Airport Development Project:   $25 Million Loan of May 28, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The loan became effective on September 16, 1974. The first
group of contracts for this project was awarded in November-December
1974, for amounts averaging 15 percent above appraisal estimates
including contingencies. Discussions have been initiated with the
Government to avoid delays, which would add to further cost
increases.
Ln. No. 1053 Papaloapan Integrated Rural Development Project: $50 Million
Loan of November 15, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,-1980
The loan became effective on January 27, 1975.
