APPRAISAL OF
IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
ROMANIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Romania's agricultural sector is an important contributor to the
national economy, second only to the industrial sector. In 1975, it ac-
counted for about 15% of national income, about 23% of convertible foreign
exchange earnings, and about 38% of labor force. Agriculture has contributed
to Romania's economic growth in several important ways: in addition to pro-
viding food, it has been a source of raw materials for industry; a source of
capital and foreign earnings to help finance industrial development; and a
source of labor for growth of other sectors. Irrigation is important for
stabilizing crop yields in the southern and eastern plains, where rainfall
during the cropping season fluctuates widely from year to year and in some
years results in crop failures. Only about 28% of the economically irriga-
ble land is presently irrigated. Government has been emphasizing expansion
of irrigation to achieve growth and greater stability in agricultural produc-
tion. In furtherance of this policy, Government has requested the Bank's as-
sistance to help finance the Ialomita-Calmatui Irrigation Project, which is
located in the southeastern region of Romania, about 120 km from Bucharest
(Map IBRD 12267).
ii.       Bank lending to Romania, since it became a member in December 1972,
has totalled US$460 million (9 loans) of which US$200 million (4 loans) is
in the agricultural sector. The proposed loan of US$60 million would be the
fifth loan in the agricultural sector and the third in the irrigation sub-
sector. Progress on previous loans is generally satisfactory.
iii.      The proposed project would provide irrigation and drainage facili-
ties for a gross area of 148,500 ha, of which presently only 1% is under small
irrigation schemes and 96% is under rainfed cultivation; the remaining 3% is
saline and unproductive and would be reclaimed under the project. About 80%
of the project area is owned and farmed by 48 Agricultural Production Co-
operatives (CAPs) and the remaining 20% by 5 State Agricultural Enterprises
(IASs). The irrigation system would utilize a maximum flow of 110 m3/sec,
which would be pumped from the Danube river, over a head of about 40 m, into
the main canal. Irrigation water would be distributed through concrete-lined
canals to 115 pressure pumping stations, which would supply water to the pipe
distribution networks for sprinkler and furrow irrigation. The project area
would be drained by 17 surface drainage networks and 23 pumping stations
(82,350 ha); and a number of localized subsurface drainage networks (14,400
ha). Other project works would include reclamation of saline lands (2,650 ha)
and depressions (2,500 ha); land leveling (40,000 ha) and works to control
soil erosion (44,700 ha). The project would also furnish farm machinery and
equipment for operation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage works.



- ii -
iv.       Total project cost, including physical and price contingencies but
excluding interest during construction, is estimated at US$195.0 million, of
which the foreign exchange component would be US$44.6 million. Interest and
other charges during construction on the foreign exchange component are esti-
mated at US$15.4 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$60.0 million would
finance in full the foreign exchange component (US$44.6 million) and the
interest and other charges during construction (US$15.4 million). Of the
local cost (US$150.4 million), 73% (US$109.8 million) would be contributed
from the State budget, 19% (US$28.6 million) would be advanced by the Bank
for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) to the CAPs, and 8% (US$12.0 million)
would be provided by the CAPs.
v.        The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA), through its
various departments and trusts, would be responsible for planning, construc-
tion and supervision of all project activities. Planning and design of proj-
ect works would be carried out by the Institute for Land Reclamation Studies
and Design (ISPIF), and construction by the Construction Trust for Land
Reclamation Works (TCIF); both organizations are a part of the Ministry's
Department of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA). The
project works would be operated and maintained by the Ministry's Central for
Operation of Land Reclamation Works (CELIF). All concerned agencies are com-
petent to carry out the proposed works satisfactorily. Procurement of all
goods financed directly under the proposed loan would be arranged following
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Project implementation would start during 1976 and would be completed in
five years by 1981; irrigation would commence on 16% of the area in 1979,
and the whole area would be under irrigation in 1982.
vi.       The pipe distribution network and the on-farm irrigation equip-
ment serving the CAPs would be financed through BAFI loans. The existing
procedures for on-lending and interest rates have already been reviewed and
accepted by the Bank for previous projects. Arrangements for the supply of
other inputs as well as the marketing aspects of the project are satisfactory.
vii.      At full development in 1986 the volume of production would in-
crease by 210%; the incremental crop production of various project commodi-
ties would be: cereals 376,200 tons; sugar beet 267,100 tons, vegetables and
potatoes 75,400 tons; soybean 27,900 tons, fruits and grapes 14,600 tons;
alfalfa (hay) 84,300 tons; and silage maize and other fodders 491,700 tons.
Net value of annual production would increase by 160% or by US$41.5 million.
Most of the project output would, directly or indirectly, help to earn or
save foreign exchange. The project's economic rate of return is estimated
at 16.3%. The project would raise labor productivity by 250%. Because of
the socio-economic system in Romania, the project would have little direct
effect on the incomes of farm workers, but would help to increase their
incomes indireclty through its impact on the growth and development of the
economy.



- iii -
viii.     Agreements having been reached on the issues set forth in the
report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million to the
Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) under the guarantee of the
Socialist Republic of Romania for a term of 15 years including 3 years of
grace at 8.5% interest. BAFI is a State-owned fiscal agent responsible
for channeling investment funds to the agricultural sector.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania has requested
the Bank's assistance in financing the Ialomita-Calmatui-Irrigation Project.
The proposed project would increase and stabilize the agricultural production
on a gross area of 148,500 ha, located about 120 km northeast of Bucharest
(Map IBRD 12267), by providing irrigation and drainage facilities. Presently,
1,550 ha of this area is irrigated and 143,390 ha is under rainfed cultiva-
tion. About 3,560 ha of saline and uncultivated land would be reclaimed
under the project. The project area is held by 48 Agricultural Production
Cooperatives (CAPs) having an active membership of about 41,200; and 5 State
Agricultural Enterprises (IASs) which employ 16,800 workers.
1.02      Romania joined the Bank on December 15, 1972 and has received nine
loans totalling US$460.0 million. Of these, the Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation
Project (US$70.0 million), the Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project
(US$30.0 million), the agricultural component of the Flood Recovery Project
(US$40.0 million out of two loans totalling US$60.0 million) and the Rasova-
Vederoasa Irrigation and Agricultural Development Project (US$60.0 million)
account for a total lending of US$200.0 million in the agricultural sector.
The proposed loan would be the fifth in this sector, and third in the irriga-
tion sub-sector.
1.03      The proposed project was identified by the Government, and a feasi-
bility report was submitted to the Bank in January 1976. The project was
appraised in April 1976 by a mission consisting of Messrs. S. Niaz (Chief),
T. Haile-Mariam and H. von Pogrell (Bank), and R. Qureshi (Consultant); this
report is based on their findings.
II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Country Background
2.01      Romania has an area of 237,500 km2 and a population of 21.3 million
(mid 1975 estimate), which is increasing at an annual rate of about 1%. The
rural population is estimated at 12 million (57%). GlCP per capita in 1975
is estimated at US$1,300.
2.02      The country is endowed with abundant supply of many natural resources
such as sources of energy, good soils and exploitable irrigation water, but it
also depends on imports of some key raw materials, particularly iron ore. Al-
most all resources are either owned or controlled by the State. The State
manages resource allocation and product distribution to achieve its social



and economic development objectives which are outlined for each 5-year period
in a national plan and are detailed for each year in annual plans.
2.03      Romania's main long term economic objective is to achieve rapid growth
through high rates of investment with emphasis on industrialization, and to
raise the standard of living of its population through equitable distribution
of a part of the gains from such growth. During the 1971-1975 plan period,
national income grew at an average annual rate of 11.3% and industrial produc-
tion at 13.1%. During the same period investment averaged about 34% of the
national income, and real wages increased by about 20%. The volume of foreign
trade increased at an annual rate of 18.4%, and industrial products accounted
for 52.2% of exports in 1975. In the current 1976-1980 plan, industry would
continue to receive priority in investment. National income and industrial
output are projected to grow by about 11% per year through continued high
domestic rates of savings and investment. A major constraint to the economy's
growth, however, is and would be shortage of convertible foreign exchange,
which is essential to obtain better technology for improving the quality of
industrial production, and to import raw materials.
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.04      The Setting.  Agricultural land is estimated at about 14.9 million,
ha of which 65% is arable, 30% is under pastures and the remaining 5% is
occupied by orchards and vineyards. The soils are generally fertile and the
climate suitable to grow a wide variety of crops, and to raise livestock and
poultry. However, droughts and excessive rains are common, causing frequent
fluctuations in production and constraining optimal utilization of agricultural
resources. The country has abundant sources of exploitable irrigation water
including the Danube River which is the major source for areas in the south
and the southeast. About 5.3 million ha or 36% of the agricultural land is
economically irrigable, of which about 1.5 million ha is currently irrigated.
2.05      Major crops are maize (32%), wheat and barley (30%), fodder (16%),
potatoes and vegetables (7%), sunflower (6%), sugar beet (2%) and soybean
(2%). In 1975, the livestock population amounted to about 29.3 million, of
which cattle were about 6.1 million (20%), pigs about 8.8 million (30%),
sheep and goats about 14.4 million (50%). Poultry population was around
78.6 million.
2.06      The agricultural labor force is estimated at about 3.8 million,
most of which consists of either active members of CAPs or employees of IASs.
A large number of the labor force consists of old members, most of whom are
unskilled and therefore cannot be readily used outside of the agricultural
sector. The young are actively sought by industry in accordance with na-
tional priorities and have a tendency to migrate to urban areas to seek em-
ployment. Consequently, the agricultural labor force has declined by about
40% since 1960 and is expected to continue to decline in the future. This
shift of labor from the agricultural sector has to be compensated by stepping
up the rate of mechanization of agriculture.



- 3 -
2.07      Currently, there is one tractor per 80 ha of arable land and one
combine harvester per 220 ha. Fertilizer application is low, and crop yields
amount to about 60% to 80% of the average yields for other East European
countries.
2.08      Agricultural research, training and extension service programs are
satisfactory. Farm workers are generally receptive to new crop and animal
husbandry practices, and the well organized and coordinated institutions
assist them to adapt new technology.
2.09      Agriculture in the Economy.  The Agricultural sector accounted for
about 15% of the national income, 23% of convertible foreign exchange earnings
and employed 38% of the labor force in 1975. It is also a supplier of raw
materials, investment resources and labor to other sectors; and it provides a
large market for industrial outputs. Thus, the direct and indirect impact of
agriculture on the economy is substantial, and the development of the indus-
trial sector largely depends on a stable agricultural output growth and
increases in productivity.
2.10      Annual investments in agriculture increased from Lei 10.3 billion
(US$515 million) during the 1966-1970 plan period to Lei 15.4 billion (US$770
million) during 1971-1975. The sector's share of total investments about
equalled its direct contribution to national income. Despite the increase
in investments, however, annual growth rate of agricultural production was
low, averaging about 3% during 1971-1975, and labor productivity remained
at less than one-third that of industry. This was due mainly to unfavorable
weather (low rainfall in 1973 and 1974, and floods in 1975), and partly a
result of insufficient investments relative to the absorptive capacity of the
sector. There is a need to increase investments in agriculture to help attain
stable growth and development of the economy, and to raise productivity of
farm labor.
2.11      Future Development.  During the 1976-1980 plan period, agriculture's
share of national income is projected to decline slightly, but compared to the
1971-1975 plan, annual average investment would increase by 42% to about Lei
21.9 billion (US$1.1 billion), about 75% of which would be allocated to CAPs
and the remaining 25% to IASs. Investments in irrigation infrastructure and
farm machinery would also rise; area under irrigation would increase by 73%
from about 1.5 million ha to about 2.6 million ha. There would be one tractor
for every 75 ha of arable land; fertilizer application rate would also in-
crease substantially and yields of major crops are expected to rise by 30% to
40%. In accordance with the long-term national planning, the quantities of
livestock would continue to increase at substantial rates and their quality
would continue to be improved by crossbreeding with imported stock and selected
local breeds. Total agricultural output is projected to grow by an annual
rate of about 5.3%. The proposed project is an important component of Gov-
ernment's plan to achieve these objectives.



2.12      Previous Agricultural Projects.  The Bank is currently assisting in
the development of the agricultural sector by lending US$200 million to help
finance four agricultural projects; these will provide irrigation to about
165,000 ha, and will extend credits to a large number of farm entities for
development of livestock and other agricultural facilities. Despite initial
problems, all of the procurement under a 1975 Bank loan for the Giurgiu-
Razmiresti Irrigation Project (Loan 1082-RO) has been contracted. About 60%
of project construction has been completed more or less on schedule and with-
out serious cost overruns. Progress on two other 1975 loans for the Sadova-
Corabia Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1083-RO) and Flood Recovery Project
(Loan 1169-RO) is satisfactory. The fourth loan for the Rasova-Vederoasa
Irrigation and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1247-RO) was approved
in April 1976, and it is too early to judge the progress of this project.
III. THE PROJECT AREA AND NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
A. The Project Area
3.01      Location.  Bounded by the Ialomita river in the south and the
Calmatui river in the north, the project area is located in the districts of
lalomita (58%) and Braila (41%), and is about 120 km northeast of Bucharest
(Map IBRD 12267). The Danube river, which is the project's water source,
flows only 5 to 10 km away from its eastern boundary. Braila (population
170,000), the biggest Romanian port on the Danube and an industrial center,
is about 50 km north of the project area, and Slobozia (population 25,000)
is at the southern project boundary.
3.02      Topography.  In general, the project area is relatively flat but
mildly undulating and lies above the Danube flood plain at an elevation varying
from 20 m to 55 m. About 67% of the area lies between 30 m and 50 m. Ground
slopes are generally less than 2%; larger slopes are found only in about 8,000
ha, where soil erosion is prominent.
3.03      Drainage.  Three natural drainages serve the project area--Ialomita
river in the south; Calmatui river in the north and northeast; and the Lata
Sarata Valley in the middle (Map IBRD 12267). In general, the northern zone
is well drained by the Calmatui river and the Lata Sarata Valley, and the
southern zone by the Ialomita river and several large lakes. The central
zone (north of Lata Sarata Valley) is a mosaic of areas sloping in different
directions and abounds in closed depressions which have no direct outlet to
any of the natural drainages. The drainage of this zone is, therefore, defec-
tive and would require a number of works under the Project to effectively
drain the area.
3.04      Population.  Total population in the project area is estimated at
189,000, of which about 61,000 (30%) constitutes the active labor force.

Labor employed in the agricultural sector is estimated at 58,000 (95% of
active population), of which 41,200 are engaged on the CAPs and the remaining
16,800 are employed in the State farms. Over 50% of labor in the project
farms consists of females.
3.05      Electricity and Water Supply.  All villages in the project area are
served with electricity, which is supplied from the national grid. Each vil-
lage derives its water supply manually from a number of shallow open wells.
3.06      Communications.  Two primary roads, linking Slobozia with Braila,
and Buzau pass through the project area. Secondary roads connect project vil-
lages with these primary roads; almost all villages are accessible by asphalt
roads. The existing farm road network, which is mostly ungravelled, serves
the agricultural needs of the project area adequately. The Bucharest-
Constanta railway line is at the project area's southern boundary, while the
Constanta-Braila line passes through the eastern half of the project area.
B. Natural Resources
3.07      Climate.  The climate is characterized by hot summers and cold
winters, but is temperated by air movements from the Black Sea. Over 40
years (1931-1975) of climatic data are available at Grivita. Ten years
(1965-1974) data indicates that the average monthly temperature in the
growing season (April to October) varies from a maximum of 21.9oC in July to
a minimum of 10.90C in October. Annual rainfall averages 550 mm, of which
380 mm (69%) falls during the cropping season. The minimum rainfall, how-
ever, can be as low as 150 mm in the cropping season and droughts extending
over 60 days were experienced in 7 years out of 41. First frost occurs in
late October and the last in April. The wind velocity averages 2.7 m/sec
in the season and is normally higher during the day than at night. Further
details are in Annex 1.
3.08      Soils.  Detailed surveys indicate that the soils consist of dark
brown Chernozems which have developed over deposits of loess. They are very
fertile, have a medium sandy loam texture, a uniform profile, low to moderate
permeability and a good water retention capacity. These soils are rich in
humus and contain 2% to 3% calcium carbonate. The loess deposits vary in
depth from 3 to 20 m. About 48% of the area to be irrigated is categorized
as Class I, 40% as Class II and 12% as Class III, mostly on account of its
eroded nature and salt accumulation.
3.09      Water Resources.  Both the Ialomita and the Calmatui rivers are
small with maximum and minimum flows around 900 m3/sec and 3 m3/sec; and
90 m3/sec and I m3/sec respectively. Most of Ialomita supplies are used
in its upper reaches for irrigation. Water in both these rivers is insuf-
ficient in quantity for irrigating the project area, and is also polluted
because of drainage effluents and industrial wastes discharging into these
channels. Groundwater of low quality is mostly available throughout the
project area at shallow depths (2 m to 10 m), but in quantities that would



-6-
be inadequate to irrigate large areas. The only reliable source of irrigation
water for the project area is the Danube river, from which water would have
to be lifted for irrigating the project area.
C. Land Tenure and Farm Organizations
3.10      The project area is either owned or controlled by the State.  Of
the gross area of 148,500 ha, about 120,500 ha (81%) is owned by 48 CAPs, and
the remaining 28,000 ha (19%) belongs to 5 IASs. About 5,900 ha of CAP land
is distributed among the eligible cooperative members as individual plots for
their personal benefit in sizes that do not exceed 1,500 m2 per member. The
land owned by a CAP, excluding the individual plots, varies from 1,500 ha to
6,000 ha with a median value of 2,400 ha, and the size of a State farm ranges
from 3,000 ha to 14,000 ha.
3.11      The governing body of a CAP is its General Assembly whose member-
ship consists of all working adults in the CAP. The Assembly elects the CAP's
President, and is responsible for preparing its annual plans, ratifying all
contracts and allocation of CAP's income, all in accordance with the general
guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA). All ex-
ecutive functions are performed by a Council. CAPs meet the labor requirement
from their members and normally do not hire labor. Members are presently
guaranteed a minimum remuneration of Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month, if
planned production is achieved. A bonus is paid if the realized production
exceeds the plan; only 80% of the remuneration due is paid if actual produc-
tion falls below the planned target. The minimum salary is in line with the
corresponding wage for comparable labor in other sectors of the economy.
Based on 1973 and 1974 data, wages in the agricultural sector were about 95%
of the national average.
3.12      The chief executive officer of an IAS is its Director, who is ap-
pointed by the Ministry. He is assisted by a Chief Economist and the chiefs
of the farms in the IAS. The governing body of an IAS consists of its top
management, representatives of the unions and the Party and the elected re-
presentatives of the workers.  IASs employ all labor required, some of which
is seasonal. Labor is paid in accordance with the national wage rates; un-
skilled workers, for example, receive about Lei 1,200 (US$60.00) per month.
Further details are given in Annex 2.
D. Agricultural Production
3.13      Land Use.  Of the net cultivable area of 142,740 ha, about 1,550 ha
is presently irrigated from Ialomita river supplies, and 135,290 ha is under
rainfed cultivation; the remaining 5,900 ha, which is the total area of in-
dividual plots, is partly under rainfed cultivation and partly irrigated by



- 7 -
groundwater. These plots will not be irrigated until agreement is reached
between CAP members and Government on appropriate irrigation methods and
financing of collective on-farm portable equipment and have not been in-
cluded in evaluating project benefits. Without these plots, therefore,
the project area under cultivation amounts to 136,840 ha. Presently the
cropping intensity is 100%. Cereals (maize and wheat) occupy 61% of the
area, while oilseeds (soybean and sunflower) are cultivated on 18%. Sugar
beet (4%), potatoes (2%), grapes and fruit (2%), and fodder crops (13%)
account for the remaining 21% (Annex 1, Table 2).
3.14      Production.  Since a fair amount of technology is already available
to the project area, present crop yields are considered reasonable for rain-
fed cultivation. Due to wide variations in rainfall, however, the yields are
subjected to substantial yearly fluctuations and in some years, due to long
drought periods, there may be a complete failure of some crops. Without
irrigation, this erratic pattern of crop yields is likely to continue.
Based on five representative years, the average yields of major crops are as
follows: maize 3.5 tons/ha, sugar beet 28 tons/ha and sunflower 1.6 tons/ha.
These yields and the corresponding total production are summarized in Annex 1,
Table 2.
E. Farm Inputs
3.15      Seeds, Fertilizer and Pesticides.  Improved seeds are multiplied
on research stations and selected State and cooperative farms. Seed produc-
tion, processing, testing, quality control and distribution is entrusted to
special organizations (SEMROM, AGROSEM, etc.). Seeds of high quality are
produced in large quantities; substantial quantities are also exported. In
Romania, fertilizer production of ammonium nitrate and superphosphate is es-
timated to exceed 5 million tons per year, but about 350,000 tons of potash
is imported. The average fertilizer application rate in the project area is
about 85 kg/ha (active substance). Currently, State farms receive higher
allocation of fertilizers as compared to CAPs, but this disparity does not
exist if lands are irrigated. Government allocates optimum quantities for
irrigated farm lands before allocating any quantity to rainfed areas. Plant
protection measures are usually adequate and timely. Most plant protection
chemicals are produced within the country; the present production amounts
to over 250,000 tons.
3.16      Farm Machinery.  CAPs in the project area are served by the Braila
and lalomita Agricultural Mechanization Enterprises (AMEs), and their six
Stations for Agricultural Machinery (SAMs). The State farms own, operate and
maintain the equipment required by them. As an average, there is one tractor
to every 80 ha in the project area. Land preparation is completely mechan-
ized, while seeding, fertilizing, spraying of pesticides and harvesting
operations are mechanized to a considerable degree on the State farms and
to a lesser degree on the CAPs. Maize, wheat, oilseeds and fodder harvesting,



- 8 -
for example, is almost fully mechanized on IASs, while this operation is
mechanized to an extent of about 80% on the CAPs. About 10% to 15% tractors
need replacement annually and additional tractors will be required to in-
tensify cultivation following introduction of irrigation.
F. Agricultural Research and Extension
3.17      Agricultural Research.  The Academy of Agriculture and Forestry
Sciences coordinates all agricultural research in Romania, which is carried
out in 13 institutes, 6 central stations and 41 research stations. These
facilities, which are well distributed throughout the country's ecological
zones, are staffed by about 1,600 scientists and cover about 80,000 ha. Two
research stations, Braila and Marculesti, are located close to the project
area, and are carrying out research in the applied aspects of irrigated
agriculture. Emphasis is being laid on varietal improvements and water use.
3.18      Agricultural Extension.  Extension services are provided by the
General Directorate of Agriculture in each district. Such services are being
provided in the project area by the Directorates of lalomita and Braila, which
are staffed by specialists in crop production. In addition, each CAP or IAS
has its own specialists, who are furnished by the General Directorate of
Agriculture for CAPs and the Department of State Agriculture for IASs. Thus
the extension staff has a direct say in improvement of cultural practices and
application of technology instead of an advisory role. Instruction manuals
that are prepared and periodically updated by specialist staff are made avail-
able to each farm. Thus the research findings rapidly pass into practice and
the supervisory staff of each CAP and IAS adequately monitor their applica-
tion. Training to field staff is provided at the General Directorate through
short and medium term courses, mostly during the winter months. Further
details are in Annex 1.
G. Investment Financing
3.19      Investments in projects, which specifically benefit the IASs, are
financed generally from the State budget and from compulsory savings of such
entities. The major sources of financing investments in CAPs are loans from
the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI), and savings of the coopera-
tives. Financing of investments in State enterprises under BAFI loans is
relatively small but is expected to increase in future. Investments in those
components of large-scale irrigation works, however, which serve both the IAS
and CAP lands are financed through the State budget; such funds are channelled
through BAFI. Short-term credit for production, and credits for marketing and
processing of agricultural products are also extended by BAFI to suitable
cooperatives.



- 9 -
3.20      BAFI was founded in 1968 for channelling funds exclusively for the
agricultural sector. It has six specialized departments, three of which
administer the financing of production, marketing and processing of agri-
cultural products. The other three are responsible for planning, financial
control and general administration. BAFI operates through 39 branches, with
one branch in each district, and 100 sub-branches. The project area is served
by two district branches (lalomita and Braila) and three sub-branches (two
in Ialomita and one in Braila).
3.21      BAFI obtains funds for its operations from the State budget, depo-
sits by various State enterprises and cooperatives, borrowings from the
National Bank of Romania, foreign loans and its own statutory capital of Lei
800 million (US$40 million). For large-scale investments financed by Govern-
ment, BAFI obtains funds from the State budget at no interest. Deposit funds
with BAFI bear an interest of 1-1/2%. BAFI borrows from the National Bank at
1% per year. BAFI extends long-term loans at interest rates of 3% to 4% per
annum and short-term production loans at 4%. These interest rates are
positive because of near zero rate of inflation in Romania. BAFI loans for
permanent irrigation and drainage facilities and erosion control works are
repaid within 25 years including 5 years of grace, and loans for portable
irrigation equipment are repaid in 8 years including 3 years of grace. The
terms and conditions of BAFI loans are flexible to avoid excessive financial
burden on the borrowing entities. A part of BAFI's net profits are returned
to the State budget.
3.22      Normally, about 70% of the on-farm investments in CAPs are financed
through BAEI loans, but in special cases, up to 95% of such investments may
be financed by BAFI; CAPs are required to contribute the balance. CAPs and
LASs are required to retain a part of their net annual incomes for financing
production expenses in the next cropping season. If CAPs need additional
funds as a result of the project, BAFI has well coordinated plans and ade-
quate resources to provide them with necessary short-term credit for financing
production, marketing and processing.
H. Marketing
3.23      Agricultural produce in Romania is marketed by 13 State controlled
and operated Centrals, each of which deals in specific commodities like cereals,
vegetables and fruits, sugar, etc. In each locality, a few private markets
are operated by peasants for selling the produce from their individual plots.
Such markets handle only a small volume of produce for local consumption.
3.24      Each marketing Central is represented in the country's 39 districts
by a marketing enterprise, which is the Central's executing agency. Each
enterprise has several collecting centers which are suitably located through-
out the district. All enterprises and their collecting centers are well
equipped to efficiently collect, handle and distribute various commodities



- 10 -
without excessive losses. Prices play little or no role in allocating pro-
ducts among various domestic markets. The marketing enterprises, however,
do have adequate incentive in terms of profit margins to promote efficient
distribution.
3.25      The project output would be marketed by four Centrals through
their enterprises and their sub-units. As all production plans are closely
coordinated with produce use and its distribution, adequate measures have
already been planned for handling anticipated incremental output. Storage,
processing and transport facilities would be improved and expanded. Further
details are in Annex 3.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.  Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the project are to increase and stabilize
crop production in a gross area of 148,500 ha by providing irrigation and
drainage facilities; and to raise labor productivity.
B. Description
4.02      The project would consist of (a) irrigation works to serve an area
of 148,500 ha; (b) works necessary to provide efficient drainage in the proj-
ect area; (c) miscellaneous works like land leveling and soil erosion control,
etc.; and (d) farm machinery required to intensify agricultural production and
equipment for operation and maintenance of project works. Detailed features of
works included in the project are described in Section C below; further details
are given in Annex 4. The irrigation and drainage systems are illustrated in
Map IBRD 12267. MAIA would be responsible for implementing the project works,
which would be completed by December 1981.
C. Detailed Features
Irrigation Works
4.03      Main Pumping Stations.,  A floating pumping station (SPA) at about
Km 221 of the Danube river would lift 110.0 m3/sec over about 10.7 m into a
concrete lined main canal. This station would consist of six barges, each
equipped with six pumps of 3.05 m3/sec capacity. A total of seven fixed
pumping stations (SRPA I to SRPA VII) on the canal network would lift irriga-
tion supplies over required heights at locations indicated on Map IBRD 12267;
three of these stations (SRPA I, SRPA III, SRPA IV) would be on the main



- 11 -
canal, while the other four would be on distributaries. The total installed
power capacity of all main stations would be 96,500 kw. Data of pumping
stations is at Annex 4, Table 1.
4.04      The Canal System.  The main canal would be about 38 km long and
would have three reaches: the first (6.5 km) would have a capacity of 110.0
m3/sec; the capacity in the middle reach (23.0 km) would vary from 109.4
m3/sec at head to 23.7 m3/sec upstream of SRPA III; and the last reach (8.5
km) would have a capacity varying from 23.7 m3/sec to 13.8 m3/sec (canal data
in Annex 4, Table 2). At some future date, a navigable canal from the Siret
river (about 90 km north) would join the tail end of the main canal, to extend
navigation up to the Danube. All works, which would be necessary to make the
main canal navigable, would be provided later on as a part of the navigation
project, which is in the 1981-1985 plan.
4.05      Six main distributaries would serve the project area; one of these
would be fed from the main canal by a pumping station (SRPA II). Other dis-
tributaries would serve their areas by gravity except for D3, which would
have three pumping stations (SRPA V, SRPA VI and SRPA VII) to lift supplies
to command the higher parts of the project area in the south and southwest.
All distributaries would be concrete-lined.
4.06      Canal supplies would be regulated at suitable points by gates that
are automated either hydraulically or electrically. In addition to the regu-
lators, structures on the canal nework consist of highway and railway bridges,
drops, siphons and escape weirs. The canal network and the pumping stations
are designed to operate 24 hours per day in accordance with the maximum
irrigation requirement of 110.0 m3/sec. Some of the canals would traverse
zones that are made up of loessial soils liable to settle on wetting. In
such areas, canals would be lined only after they had operated for at least
one working season with partial supplies to avoid canal breakage. A detailed
analysis carried out by a Bank consultant indicates that with this solution
no serious problems are expected for the stability of canals in loess soils.
4.07      Pipe Distribution Networks.  The project area (146,300 ha net)
would be divided into 115 large sectors (140,590 ha) and 18 small sectors
(5,710 ha). The large sectors vary in size from 520 ha to 2,075 ha; each -
would be served by a pressure pumping station and an independent buried pipe
distribution network. The smaller sectors, each below 500 ha, would be sup-
plied with water by mobile pressure pumps. The length of large sectors is
standardized at 3,672 m to facilitate mechanical movement of laterals, while
their width would vary with size. The distribution pipes would be of either
precast reinforced concrete (500 mm diameter or over) or asbestos cement.
Total length of the distribution pipeline is estimated at about 2,760 km.
4.08      Pressure Pumping Stations.  Of 115 stations, 82 would command
103,840 ha for sprinklers, and 33 would pressurize water for 36,750 ha to
be irrigated by furrow. Each of these stations would contain three to eight
pumping units depending on the area served. The capacity of each unit would
vary from 50 1/sec to 500 1/sec. The total installed capacity at the 115
pressure pumping stations would be 121,000 kw (Annex 4, Table 1).



- 12 -
4.09      Sprinkler Irrigation.  About 103,650 ha (74%) would be equipped and
irrigated by sprinklers (5,710 ha in smaller units and 97,940 ha in large
sectors). Sprinkler irrigation would be extended to the remaining 5,900 ha,
when necessary arrangements have been completed (para 3.13).  MIost of this
area has ground slopes smaller than 3%, but has to be irrigated by sprinklers
because of poorly draining soils with low permeability. The large sectors
would be served by distribution pipes laid 612 m apart, with hydrants pro-
vided at a spacing of 72 m. Each hydrant would serve six lateral positions,
24 m apart, but only two could receive water simultaneously. Sprinklers,
spaced at 18 m intervals along the 10 cm portable laterals, would serve an
area of 18 m x 24 m at a minimum pressure of 3.0 atmospheres.
4.10      Furrow Irrigation.  About 36,750 ha (26%) mostly in the southern
and southeastern parts of the project area and with soils of good permeabil-
ity would be irrigated by furrows. Each of the 33 sectors would be served
by a low pressure pumping station and a disribution network, similar to that
for the sprinkler system, but with hydrants spaced at 216 m instead of 72 m.
Each hydrant would feed a set of furrows through a portable butyl pipe pro-
vided with outlets at furrow spacings. Working pressure at the outlets would
be about 0.35 atmosphere and each outlet would be designed to deliver up to
3.5 I/sec.
4.11      Power Supply Works.  The total installed capacity of all pumping
stations, including pressure stations, would amount to about 217,500 kw.
About 240 km of 20 kv and 110 kv power lines would be constructed, as a part
of the project works, to supply power to all pumping stations. In addition,
transformers of required capacities would also be installed at the pumping
stations.
Drainage WJorks
4.12      Surface Drainage Networks.  The surface drainage networks to be con-
structed under the project would serve about 82,350 ha, lying to the north of
the Lata Sarata Valley (Map IBRD 12267). Area to the south of the Valley is
served by drainage works that are either existing or are under construction
as parts of different schemes. Of the 82,350 ha, 25,810 ha would be drained
into the Calmatui river by the construction of eight surface drainage networks;
the remaining 56,540 ha would be served by nine networks that would outfall
into the Lata Sarata Valley. These networks would be designed to remove in
5 days the runoff resulting from a 24-hour storm precipitation of 65 mm (prob-
ability of 1 in 20 years). The average specific discharge would be 0.48 1/
sec/ha. Drainage networks would consist of main and secondary drains, with a
total length of about 311 km. About 180 structures, mostly bridges, siphons
and culverts would be constructed on these drains.
4.13      Pumping Stations.  Twenty three pumping stations, mostly with capac-
ities smaller than 1.0 m3/sec, would be constructed at various locations on
the drainage networks to lift effluent from local depressions into drains,
and from smaller drains into the larger drains. The largest station (SPE 2)
with a capacity of 17.5 m3/sec would pump the drainage water, collected by



- 13 -
the Lata Sarata Valley (and regulated in Lake Strachina) into the Ialomita
river. Details of the drainage pumping stations are given in Annex 4, Table
4. Total installed capacity at these stations would be about 6,000 kw.
4.14      Tile Drainage Networks.  Because of the undulating nature of the
project area and closed drainage (that exists around depressions and lakes),
groundwater is high in some isolated areas and would have to be lowered by
constructing subsurface drainage facilities, as surface drains would be
generally ineffective. Such areas (indicated on Map IBRD 12267) total to
14,400 ha, about 2,650 ha of which is highly saline and presently unproduc-
tive and would be reclaimed (para. 4.16) under the project.
4.15      The subsurface drainage works would consist of independent tile
drainage networks; each would serve an isolated subarea. A network would
consist of a set of burnt clay tile drains that would generally outfall into
surface drains; some would discharge into collector pipes that would convey
the effluent into the surface drains. Drains would be 7 cm to 10 cm in dia-
meter and would be spaced 15 m to 25 m apart. Length of a lateral drain
would not exceed 200 m.
4.16      Reclamation of Saline Lands.  About 2,650 ha, which is presently
saline, would be reclaimed by leaching operations and gypsum treatment. The
annual leaching requirement is estimated at 10,000 m3/ha, which would be ap-
plied in 10 to 12 doses. Gypsum treatment would be at the rate of 2 tons/ha.
The affected area would be completely reclaimed in about 8 years.
4.17      Drainage of Shallow Depressions.  The project area contains about
400 shallow depressions, with areas varying from 20 ha to 5 ha, and a total
area of about 2,500 ha. Most of these depressions get flooded by heavy rain-
fall. Some of these have steep side slopes. The project would provide drain-
age measures for such depressions, which would consist of permanent (para.
4.13) and temporary pumping arrangements and earthwork excavations necessary
to permit efficient drainage of the area.
Miscellaneous Works
4.18      Land Levelling and Slope Correction Works.  About 40,000 ha, con-
sisting mainly of the area to be irrigated by furrows, would be levelled
to slopes not exceeding 8 per 1,000. This would involve an average excava-
tion of 460 m3/ha. In the area to be irrigated by sprinklers, ground slopes
steeper than 3% are found in about 8,000 ha; such slopes would be flattened
to reduce possibilities of erosion. This excavation would average about 100
m3/ha.
4.19      Soil Erosion Control Works.  Of about 44,700 ha affected, erosion
is caused by wind action in about 38,600 ha and by water in 6,100 ha. In the
former, which is mostly in the sandy areas in north and east, shelter belts
consisting of two rows of poplar and cherry trees would be planted. Area
subjected to water erosion would be protected in a variety of ways, which
would consist of providing crop and grass cover, tree plantation, construc-
tion of catch water drains and excavating flat berms to stabilize steep
slopes.



- 14 -
4.20      Other Works.  Other works under the category of miscellaneous works
would consist of relocation of village roads and adjustment of forest bounda-
ries to permit the formation of standard rectangular sectors for irrigation
(para. 4.07). About 400 observation wells to monitor groundwater movement,
and buildings and facilities for operation and maintenance of the project
works would be provided.
Equipment
4.21      Farm Machinery.  About 1,000 65-hp tractors, 45 45-hp tractors,
and some harvesting and transportation equipment (Annex 7, Table 2) would
be provided under the project. About one-half of this equipment would be
needed to cultivate, harvest and transport the increased production follow-
ing introduction of irrigation under the project and the other half would
replace the worn out machines over the next three years.
4.22      Operation and Maintenance Equipment.  The equipment, listed at
Annex 7, Table 2, is considered necessary for the efficient operation and
maintenance of the project works, and would be provided as a part of the
project.
D.  Water Requirement and Availability             -
4.23      Water Requirement.  After allowing for average effective precipita-
tion, net water requirements for crops in the project area were estimated at
3,804 m3/ha. The highest monthly net demand of 1,160 m3/ha would occur in
July. Based on the proposed irrigation methods of sprinkler (74% of area)
and furrow (26%), the overall system efficiency has been computed as 65%.
Gross water requirement, at the Danube River, would be 5,852 m3/ha, which
would amount to a total demand of 903 Mm3 during the cropping season. About
275 Mm3 (30%) would be the July requirement, which would correspond to a
maximum flow of about 103 m3/sec. Further details are in Annex 5. Allowing
for flexibility of operation, leaching requirements for the saline land to be
reclaimed under the project, and a provision for extension of irrigation to
the individual plots (para. 3.13) within the project area, the headworks for
the irrigation system are designed for a maximum flow of 110 m3/sec.
4.24      Water Availability and Quality.  The source of water for the proj-
ect is the Danube river, which carries high flows during the irrigation sea-
son. In this period, the minimum river flows vary from 5,000 m3/sec to 3,000
m3/sec (Chart 15360(R)). Diversions for the project would be the highest in
July, when the Danube flows are seldom less than 5,000 m3/sec. The project,
therefore, would have an assured supply of water. The Danube water, at the
site of the floating pumping station, is potable and is classified as belong-
ing to C2S1 category, which is a good quality irrigation water.

4.25      Water Rights.  There is no international agreement among the Danube
river riparian states for the use of its water for irrigation but a conven-
tion exists for development of the river for mutual benefits, and for protec-
tion of navigation and water quality. The International Water Commission for
the Danube river, of which Romania is a member, is mainly concerned with
schemes which may interfere with navigation and water quality. The maximum
diversion for the project, in July, would amount to about 2% of the minimum
river flow in that month. The Government has confirmed that diversions for
the project would not reduce the Danube flow below the agreed minimum to
sustain international navigation. There is no reason to expect that the
project would raise issues on the use of Danube waters, and no agreement of
other riparians would be required.
E. Status of Engineering
4.26      Various alternatives were studied by the Institute for Land Reclama-
tion Studies and Design (ISPIF) for the project's main works; these included
alternatives with a fixed pumping station at the Danube, alternative sites
for the fixed or the floating pumping station, having two pumping stations
at different locations on the Danube instead of one and corresponding main
canal alignments. The chosen system is the least cost alternative at any,
discount rate. ISPIF has already completed detailed designs and major
drawings of all works; construction drawings would be prepared about six
months ahead of the construction program.
F. Cost Estimates
4.27      The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies
but excluding interest during construction, is estimated at Lei 3,900 million
(US$195.0 million). This estimate is net of taxes and is based on December
1976 prices. The foreign exchange component, which includes both direct
(US$6.5 million) and indirect (US$38.1 million) foreign costs, is estimated
at US$44.6 million or 23% of total cost. The cost estimates are based on unit
rates of work that are prevalent in Romania under the system of regulated
prices of materials and wages. Because detailed engineering has already been
carried out, physical contingencies have been provided at 7-1/2% of irrigation
and drainage works and at 5% of other minor items. Price contingencies on
foreign exchange cost are compounded at annual increases of 8% in 1977 to
1979, and 7% after 1979. Due to near zero inflation in Romania, price contin-
gencies on local costs are provided at 1% per annum. Interest and other
charges during construction on the foreign exchange component are estimated at
US$15.4 million. Project's cost estimate is summarized in the table below;
details are in Annex 6, Table 1.

G. Financing
4.28      The proposed Bank loan of US$60.0 million would finance in full
(a) the estimated foreign exchange component of the project cost, amounting
to US$44.6 million (23% of total cost); and (b) the estimated interest and
other charges during construction on the foreign exchange component, amount-
ing to US$15.4 million. The project's local cost, which is equivalent to
US$150.4 million would be met by the State budget (73%), BAFI loans to farm
entities (19%) and contributions of CAPs (8%). The useful lives of the com-
ponents of the project vary widely. Irrigation will start in 1979 and full
project benefits would accrue seven years thereafter. Normal practice in
Romania is to amortize irrigation projects within 25 years, and in particular,
BAFI loans to CAPs for investments in major irrigation and drainage works are
for terms of 25 years including 5 years of grace. However, in accordance with
current Bank policy, the proposed Bank loan would be made on standard terms
for Romania, i.e. 15 years including 3 years grace.

H. Implementation Schedule
4.29      The project works would be constructed in six years (1976 to 1981)
in accordance with the schedule in Chart 16193. Leaching operations and
chemical treatment of saline soils, however, would continue up to 1984. Ir-
rigation would commence in 1979 on 16% area (22,700 ha) and would cover 51%
area (71,900 ha) in 1980, 76% (106,800 ha) in 1981 and full in 1982. An
estimated schedule of expenditure for the construction period is given in
Annex 6, Table 2, and is summarized below:
Calendar Year                   1976   1977   1978    1979    1980    1981
Annual Estimated Expenditure
(US$ million)                 2.5    39.1    58.4    41.9   36.9       16.2
Cumulative Expenditure
(US$ million)                 2.5    41.6   100.0   141.9  178.8    195.0
I. Procurement
4.30      Although Romanian laws provide for international competitive bid-
ding and for joint ventures involving foreign and domestic enterprises, in
practice all irrigation works are constructed by Romanian Construction Trusts,
which are experienced and familiar with local conditions, methods and regula-
tions. Therefore, only procurement of equipment and materials equivalent in
cost to the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project would be financed
under the proposed loan. It was agreed during negotiations that items costing
US$45 million including contingencies (Annex 7, Table 1) would be procured
following international advertising and competitive bidding in accordance
with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits -
August 1975". Romanian manufacturers would be allowed a preference of 15%
or the applicable custom duty, whichever is lower, but the application of the
preference has not affected so far, and is not expected to significantly
affect, the outcome of bidding. It is expected that foreign suppliers would
win contracts for most of the construction equipment (canal trimming and
lining machines, tile laying machines, dewatering equipment and some motor
scrapers) estimated to cost about US$6.5 million. Other items to be procured
through international competitive bidding (US$38.5 million) are available
domestically and, based on experience with previous Bank-financed projects,
it is expected that Romanian manufacturers would be successful in bidding
for these items. The remaining equipment and materials (Annex 7, Table 2)
estimated to cost US$41.3 million would be procured under Romanian procedures
and would not be eligible for disbursement under the proposed Bank loan.



- 18 -
J. Disbursements
4.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$60.0 million would be disbursed, net
of taxes, over five years as follows:
(a)  Equipment, materials and         -   100% of foreign expenditures
spare parts (US$44.6 million)        and 100% of local expenditures
ex-factory.
(b)  Interest and other charges       -   Amounts due.
accrued on or before
December 14, 1981
(US$15.4 million)
An estimated schedule of disbursements is at Annex 8. Disbursements under
the Bank loan would be made against standard documentation. Savings, if any,
could be used to finance additional items for the project provided these
were found justified by the Bank and were procured in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines; otherwise the savings would be cancelled. No provision
has been made under the Bank loan for an unallocated category.
K. Environment and Health
4.32      The project area is free of endemic diseases like malaria and
bilharzia. The project would neither adversely affect the environment nor
the public health. Construction of irrigation works, which consist of canals
with fluctuating supplies and piped distribution network, would not promote
mosquito breeding or spread of malaria. Some of the lakes in the southern
part of the project area have therapeutical qualities; none of the project's
drains would outfall into these lakes. The project would not have adverse
effects on the quality of the Danube waters.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
The Borrower
5.01      The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) would be the
borrower under the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania. BAFI
has the prime responsibility for the development of the agricultural sector.
In addition to functioning as the only source of credit for the agricultural



- 19 -
sector, it also acts as a fiscal agent to the Government in respect of
channeling State funds for investments and for collection of revenues due to
the State. Its other duties include financial control and supervision over
projects that are financed either by the State or BAFI. To discharge its
responsibilities effectively, BAFI already has adequate legal, financial and
administrative powers.
5.02      The chief executive officer of BAFI is its President, who is
appointed by a State Decree. He is assisted by a Senior Vice-President and
a Vice-President. BAFI's Board of Directors consists of the President, the
two Vice-Presidents, and representatives of various departments of this bank,
certain ministries, and of other related organizations. BAFI has six depart-
ments, of which three are operational and the other three deal with planning,
accounting and administration activities; it has 39 branches--one branch in
each district, and 100 sub-branches.
5.03      BAFI has a statutory capital of Lei 800 million (US$40 million)
and a reserve fund representing accumulations of net profits of Lei 800
million (US$40 million). Its other sources of funds are the State budget,
short-term borrowings from the National Bank of Romania and deposits from
socialist organizations. BAFI would meet the project expenditures from a
special project account, which would receive funds from the annual State
budgets and through disbursements from the proposed Bank loan., BAFI is in
good financial condition. Because of its strict policies and procedures
governing recoveries of loans from its borrowers and their deposit accounts,
and rigid control and inspection of operations at the project level and
disbursements, there are no reported losses due to bad debts.
Implementing Agencies
5.04      The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA).  The overall
responsibility for planning, construction, operation and maintenance of all
project works, except works relating to power supply, would rest with MAIA.
The Ministry of Electrical Energy would have the responsibility for power
supply works. The general organization of MAIA is illustrated in Chart 16194,
and its departments responsible for project implementation are described below.
5.05      Department of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA).
The responsibility for planning, design and construction of irrigation works
would rest with DIFCA, which is headed by a Deputy Minister and is organized
in four directorates of (i) Construction and Local Development; (ii) Technical,
Investment and Cooperation; (iii) Planning and Finance; and (iv) Supply. The
planning and design of the project works are being carried out by ISPIF, which
is under the Technical, Investment and Cooperation directorate. Project con-
struction would be undertaken by the Braila regional branch of the Construction
Trust for Land Reclamation Works (TCIF), which is under the Construction and
Local Development directorate. Project construction would be supervised by
the Group for Supervising of Investment (GSI), which is also under the
Technical, Investment and Cooperation directorate. All the above units of



- 20 -
DIFCA are adequately staffed and, after having successfully completed similar
irrigation projects serving nearly 1.5 million hectares, have the required
experience to carry out the project works satisfactorily.
B. Operation and Maintenance
5.06      The irrigation and drainage works, to be constructed under the
project, would be operated and maintained under the direction of Central
for Exploitation of Land Reclamation Works (CELIF) which is headed by a
Deputy Minister of MAIA and has the responsibility for operation and main-
tenance of all completed irrigation projects. CELIF has 17 operational
units, called enterprises or IELIFs, which are based in districts. Each
IELIF has several sub-units, known as Systems; each System maintains about
20,000 ha to 25,000 ha of irrigated land. Typical organization of an IELIF
is at Chart 16192.
5.07      The project's irrigation and drainage works would be operated and
maintained by two existing enterprises--the Braila IELIF and the lalomita
IELIF. The former, which is already maintaining the Braila Terrace (72,000
ha) and the Viziru Terrace (35,000 ha) irrigation schemes, would be respons-
ible for the project works north of the Lata Sarata Valley (about 100,400 ha).
The latter, which is presently maintaining the Calarasi scheme (84,000 ha),
would operate and maintain the project works south of the Valley. Coordina-
tion between the two IELIFs is assured by the directorate in Bucharest. The
new IELIF Systems responsible for maintaining the project works would be
adequately staffed by technicians and supervisors who have either worked
in other units before or have been trained for this purpose.
5.08      The power supply works would be maintained by the Ministry of
Energy. The on-farm portable equipment would be maintained by the farm
entities and the farm machinery would be maintained either by the AMEs or
the IASs.
5.09      The annual operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation and
drainage works is estimated at Lei 198.0 million (US$9.9 million). Details
are given in Annex 7, Table 3. The annual consumption of electric energy
is estimated at 240 million kwh which, at Lei 0.33 per kwh, would cost about
Lei 79.2 million (US$3.96 million). The country's generating stations and
the national grid have the capacity to supply the above requirement of elec-
tric energy.
C. Supporting Agricultural Services
5.10      MAIA has a General Directorate of Agriculture in each district;
agriculture in the project area would therefore be supervised by two Direc-
torates at Braila and Slobozia. The General Directorates plan and supervise



- 21 -
agricultural programs including input supplies in cooperation with CAPs and
IASs. Extension effort is furnished by these directorates through their
specialist staff who advise the resident specialists at each farm whenever
required. The two General Directorates are each equipped with a soil labora-
tory, where soil samples are analyzed and fertilizer requirements are speci-
fied. These Directorates are also the main centers to provide training to
the technical staff of the farm entities in these districts. Short-term
courses are offered during the cropping season, while long-term courses are
arranged during the winter months. Adequate arrangements exist for distri-
bution of seed and fertilizers. The existing AMEs and SAMs in the project
area, as well as the mechanization units of the IASs, are well organized and
equipped with maintenance workshops. These would be able to maintain the
farm machinery furnished under the project adequately.
D. Recovery of Project Costs
5.11      All investments in the project, except for the cost of portable
on-farm irrigation equipment and distribution pipelines chargeable to CAPs,
would be financed through the State budget. The cost of distribution pipe
and portable equipment serving CAP lands is estimated at about Lei 780 mil-
lion (US$39.0 million) excluding price contingencies. This would be financed
through BAFI loans (70%) and CAPs' savings (30%). The BAFI loans would be
recovered according to the terms of these loans, which are satisfactory
(paras. 3.21, 3.22). Of the remaining investments, cost of farm machinery
would be recovered fully through unit rates charged by AMEs for mechaniza-
tion services; the cost of all other items, together with the operation and
maintenance costs, would be recovered from the CAPs and IASs through direct
and various indirect mechanisms.
5.12      According to the existing procedures, the only direct recovery is
through a nominal water charge, which amounts to about Lei 220 (US$11.00) per
ha. This would yield a total revenue of about Lei 33.9 million (US$1.7 mil-
lion) per year. The present value of these annual revenues, over an assumed
project life of 40 years discounted at 10% and in constant 1976 prices, is
estimated at about Lei 230.0 million (US$11.5 million). This would recover
about 17% of the operation and maintenance costs only, and would result in
a Cost Recovery Index of about 6%. The scale of water charges and other
details are in Annex 9.
5.13      The Government would mainly recover project costs from the benefi-
ciary farms indirectly through (a) IASs' contribution to a Depreciation Fund
kept by BAFI (Annex 2); (b) annual profits made by IASs on their operations,
a part of which is credited to the State Treasury (Annex 2); (c) profits made
by the State by buying tradeable commodities at administered low domestic
prices and exporting them at much higher world prices; (d) net returns to
the State from investments of CAPs' Development Fund; and (e) general link-
age benefits to the economy as a result of the increased and stable output
from the project. Although it is difficult to quantify these indirect reve-
nues accurately, it is expected that these would enable recovery of all of
the project investments financed by the State.



- 22 -
5.14      The nominal water charge would not result in a wasteful use of
irrigation water because the volume and timing of irrigation water applica-
tion is controlled by a Government agency (IELIF) in accordance with the
recommendations of the research institutes and in consultation with other
concerned agencies. Because of the socio-economic system in Romania, water
charge has little or no direct resource allocative or income distributive
effect. Since the project is not likely to increase the remuneration of the
CAP members and the wages of employees in the IASs (para. 6.12), and prices
of all inputs and outputs are fixed and have not changed in the last decade
significantly, any increase in water charge is neither essential nor recom-
mended.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.15      The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are quite
strict and satisfactory. BAFI's accounts are subject to a continuous audit by
independent internal inspectors, and an annual audit by inspectors from the
Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior Control. The Court, which re-
ports directly to the President of the country, conducts an independent audit
of BAFI's accounts and of results of audits by inspectors from the Ministry of
Finance. Details are in Annex 10.
5.16      BAFI will keep separate accounts for all project expenditures in-
cluding those related to goods and services financed out of the proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan. These accounts will be audited according to the
existing procedures.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that a
report on project accounts, audited by the Ministry of Finance, would be sub-
mitted to the Bank annually within five months of the close of the Romanian
fiscal year.
F. Monitoring
5.17      In order to measure project implementation against the proposed
schedule and project performance, following completion of construction,
against project benefits foreseen during appraisal, BAFI would submit neces-
sary information through periodic reports to the Bank. This would include
data on progress of construction of all physical facilities under various
project components, progress in the procurement of equipment and materials
and data on project expenditures. Information on area brought under irriga-
tion, cropping pattern followed, crop yield and output, and relevant data on
operation and maintenance cost of irrigation and drainage works would be
submitted annually. During negotiations, it was agreed that details of the
above-stated information would be furnished to the Bank.



- 23 -
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production
6.01      Although permanent irrigation and drainage facilities to be con-
structed under the project would command a net area of 146,300 ha (148,500
ha gross), portable on-farm equipment in the project cost estimate would
serve only 140,400 ha net (142,650 ha gross), and on-farm equipment for the
remaining 5,900 ha, which is the aggregate area of individual plots, has not
been included in the cost estimate (para 3.13). For this reason, as well as
the wide variety of cropping patterns used by CAP members, production from
the area under individual farming (5,900 ha or 4% of project area) has not
been included in the economic evaluation.
6.02      Without the project, cropping pattern, yields and outputs are
expected to remain the same as at present because of advanced rainfed tech-
nology. With the completion of project works, area available for agricultural
operations would increase by 3,560 ha (3%) to 140,400 ha due to reclamation
of previously unproductive lands. Following introduction of irrigation, it
would also become possible to adopt double cropping on about 14,000 ha. The
total cropped area under the project, therefore, would amount to 154,340 ha
with a cropping intensity of 110%. In pursuance of Government policy to
intensify production of livestock oriented and industrial crops on irrigated
lands, the major change in the cropping pattern after the project would con-
sist of a 17% reduction of area under wheat and sunflower and an increase of
16% of area under maize, soybean and sugar beet. The entire double cropped
area would be occupied by silage maize.
6.03      Average yields of maize and wheat would increase by 125% and 95%
respectively. Yield of soybean, sugar beet, sunflower and potatoes would
increase respectively by 100%, 80%, 55% and 150%. Yield of alfalfa, silage
maize and grasses would respectively increase by 100%, 75% and 300%, while
yield of fruits would approximately double. The expected yield increases,
which refer to long-run averages over the project area, are based on the
results of experiments and actual achievements over large areas in other
irrigation projects, and would result from (a) adequate and timely irriga-
tion; (b) effective drainage of irrigated project area; and (c) increased
inputs of fertilizer, which are made possible by the introduction of irriga-
tion. The yield increases are expected to develop over four years, following
introduction of irrigation, at the rates of 30%, 70%, 90% and 100%. It is
estimated that the project area would be at full production by 1986, 7 years
following commencement of irrigation over the first part of the project area
in 1979.  This development period is reasonable because the time required to
adopt the new technology of production is short as the use of irrigation
water and other complementary inputs is controlled by the Government through
its trained and experienced technicians.



- 24 -
6.04      At full development in 1986, the total volume of agricultural pro-
duction would increase by 210%. The gross annual production including by-
products, valued at the domestic farmgate prices, would increase from about
Lei 560.0 million (US$28.0 million) to about Lei 1,350.0 million (US$67.5
million). Present and future with project cropped area and production are
summarized in the table below; details are given in Annex 1, Table 2:

B. Markets
6.05      The project would increase the production of cereals by about
376,200 tons, oilseeds by 13,600 tons, sugar beet by 267,100 tons, vegetables
(including potatoes) by 75,400 tons, fruits (including grape) by 14,600 tons
and fodder by 576,000 tons. These incremental outputs, except wheat, are
expected to be utilized by a growing domestic demand. These amounts would
have little or no adverse effects on the internal market because these would
be only minor proportions of the projected national production of these com-
modities by 1985 or thereafter. Market prospects of various crops are given
below; further details are in Annex 3.
6.06      Cereals.  The incremental output of wheat (25,500 tons) is likely
to be used to expand exports. The major markets include UK, France, Federal
Republic of Germany, Italy, Austria and USSR. However, most of the project
output of maize (350,700 tons) would be utilized as livestock feed in and
around the project area. The livestock subsector is expected to grow in
accordance with the national development plan in response to the domestic
and export demands.
6.07      Oilseeds.  The net incremental output of oilseeds would amount to
13,600 tons, which is equivalent to about 2,600 tons of oil, and 11,000 tons
of oilcake. The oil would be exported and the oilcake would substitute for
about 10% of current imports. The world market outlook for oilseeds and their
products is attractive and would continue to be attractive in the foreseeable
future.
6.08      Sugar.  Project output of sugar beet would yield an annual equiva-
lent of about 37,400 tons of sugar, which would satisfy about 30% of projected
additional domestic demand (140,000 tons) by 1990.
6.09      Vegetables.  The entire incremental output of vegetables (including
potatoes) would be consumed mainly in the urban areas of the surrounding dis-
tricts. Even if supply exceeds demand in the region, a part of the additional
output could be easily consumed in other parts of Romania because domestic
demand is expected to grow by 60% by the turn of the century.
6.10      Fruits.  The additional output of apples and grapes would be used
in the region. Present per capita consumption, estimated at about 50 kg per
year, is low. Even if this consumption level remains unchanged, projected
population increase would raise the regional demand by about 15,000 tons in
1990.
6.11      Fodder.  Project output of maize silage, alfalfa hay and other
fodders would be used to feed a growing livestock population in the region.
A major part of crop by-products would be used as livestock feed and the rest
plowed in.



- 27 -
C. Prices
6.12      Because of the nature of economic management in Romania, market
forces have little or no influence in determining domestic prices. Domestic
prices are fixed by Government and rarely vary in response to changes in
demand and supply. The present official domestic prices, which are consider-
ably lower than the prices of comparable commodities elsewhere, have not
changed significantly since the mid 1960's, and the project outputs are not
expected to alter them. For these reasons, two sets of prices have been used
to evaluate project benefits--the official domestic prices for both inputs
and outputs in the financial analysis of farm budgets; and prices derived
from the Bank's forecast of world prices for 1976-1985 for the tradeable
commodities and the official domestic prices for the non-tradeable in the
economic analysis. These prices are given in Annex 3, Table 1.
D. Producer Income
6.13      The project would increase farm incomes substantially (Annex 9),
but it would have little direct effect on salaries of employees in the IASs
or remunerations to active members of the CAPs. All workers in the IASs are
employees of the Government and are paid according to national wage scales.
The current normal wage for unskilled farm worker on an IAS amounts to about
Lei 1,200 (US$60.00) per month. Similarly, each active member of the CAPs
is presently guaranteed a remuneration of Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month,
which the member supplements with income from individual plots. This re-
muneration, which is in line with wages of comparable labor throughout the
economy, is paid only if planned production is achieved. The remuneration
to employees of the IASs and active members of the CAPs are unlikely to
change in future with the project unless the Government revises its national
wage scales, because the Romanian socio-political system does not permit
income disparity among labor of comparable quality throughout the economy.
This would not affect farm workers' incentives to participate in the project,
however, because failure to work according to the yardstick established by
the Government would, by law, result in (a) forfeiture or reduction of re-
muneration; (b) loss of supplementary bonus earned on account of exceeding
planned targets; and (c) loss of right to individual plot. The farm workers,
who are unwilling to work under these penalties, would have no other employ-
ment opportunities as the labor market is under Government control. In the
long-run, the project would help to increase the income of the farm workers
in the project area only indirectly through the project's impact on the growth
and development of the economy. In fact, these indirect project benefits
would also flow to other workers within and outside the agricultural sector
just as in the past when real wages had increased with the national income.



- 28 -
E. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.14      Main Benefits.  The major quantifiable benefit from the project
would be a significant increase in the area's agricultural production which,
in terms of volume, is estimated at 210%. At border prices of inputs and
outputs, the net value of annual production would increase by about 160%
or by Lei 830 million (US$41.5 million). Most of the project output would,
directly or indirectly, help to earn (save) foreign exchange. The unquanti-
fiable linkage benefits would include (a) the effects that would result from
the stable and increased supply of raw materials to forward-linked enter-
prises; and (b) development of new and improvement of existing facilities
that would be made possible by additional earnings (and savings) of con-
vertible currency and project-induced domestic investment resources. The
project would raise the real wages and standard of living of the population
through its impact on the growth and development of the economy. it would
also reduce underemployment in the project area and would increase labor
productivity by 250% from about Lei 12,400 (US$620) to Lei 43,400 (US$2,170).
6.15      Beneficiaries.  About 41,200 active members of the CAPs would re-
ceive only marginal direct benefits from the project. These farm workers and
about 16,800 employees of IASs would mainly benefit indirectly through the
general increases in the national wage scales which would result from the
project's impact on the national income.
F. Economic Rate of Return
6.16      The total cost of the project, excluding farm machinery and price
contingencies, is estimated at Lei 3,568 million (US$178.4 million). This
is equivalent to Lei 25,410 (US$1,270) per ha or Lei 61,500 (US$3,075) per
farm worker including the employees of the State farms. The economic rate
of return, based on quantifiable benefits, is estimated at 16.3%. The rate
of return is relatively more sensitive to variations in project benefits than
changes in investment costs. If project benefits are reduced by 20%, but the
cost stream remains unchanged, the rate of return would be 12.0%. Details
are in Annex 11.
6.17      The risk of investment in the project is low.  Design of the proj-
ect has been prepared in detail, and project construction would be completed
by the end of 1981, within the estimated total cost, which is considerably
lower than costs of similar projects in other member countries. The Govern-
ment has satisfactory plans to supply the farms with the necessary complemen-
tary inputs and supporting agricultural services. Farm workers are receptive
to new technology and would have adequate incentives to participate in the
project. Anticipated crop yields are comparable to or lower than the average
yields obtained from other irrigated areas in the region. The marketing
system is well organized. Therefore, attainment of the project's objectives
is reasonably assured.

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMEENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following:
(a) procurement of equipment and materials, listed in Annex 7,
Table 1, and estimated to cost US$45.0 million would be
arranged following international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (para. 4.30);
(b) a report on project accounts, audited by the Ministry of
Finance would be submitted to the Bank annually within five
months of the close of the Romanian fiscal year (para. 5.16);
and
(c) necessary data and information would be furnished to the Bank,
through periodic reports, to measure project implementation
and performance against scheduled targets (para. 5.17).
7.02      With the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$60 million to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry,
with the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania for a term of 15
years including 3 years of grace.

ROIIANIA
IALOMITA-CALIATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agriculture
1.        General.  Romania has a total area of 23.7 million ha, of which
about 14.9 million ha (63%) constitutes agricultural land, 6.3 million ha
(27%) is under forests and the ramining 2.5 million ha (10%) is non-arable.
Of 14.9 million ha agricultural land, about 9.7 million ha (65%) is arable,
4.5 million ha (30%) is under pastures and meadows and 0.8 million ha (5%) is
covered by orchards and vineyards. About 5.3 million ha is irrigable, but
currently about 1.5 million ha is irrigated. During the 1976-1980 plan
period, another 1.1 million ha would be provided with irrigation facilities.
By 1981, a total of about 2.6 million ha would be under irrigation; the
increase since 1970 would then be over 300%.
2.        The country is endowed with good soils, a climate which is general-
ly suitable (from April to October) for agriculture and exploitable water
resources. Fluctuations in rainfall, lack of drainage and severe soil erosion
caused by wind and water limit agricultural production in many parts of the
country. Major crops are maize (32%), wheat and barley (30%), fodder (16%),
potatoes and vegetables (7%), sunflower (6%), sugar beet (2%) and soybean (2%).
At the end of 1975, Romania had 6.1 million cattle, 8.8 million pigs, 14.4
million sheep and goats and 78.6 million poultry.
3.        Project Area Topography and Drainage.  The project area, located
about 120 km northeast of Bucharest, is about 10 km west of the Danube river
(21ap IBRD 12267). It lies on a mildly undulating terrace, which is about 20 mr
to 55 m above the Danube river water level. The project area includes a gross
surface of 161,400 ha between the Ialomita and the Calmatui rivers. A natural
drainage, called the Lata Sarata Valley, flows from the west to the southeast
to Lake Strachina, and divides the project area into the northern (70%) and
the southern (30%) parts. A major part of the northern area drains either
into the Calmatui river in the north or the Lata Sarata in the south but
several depressions, that have formed due to the wetting and settling action
of the loessial soils, have turned into major and minor saline lakes. These
depressions now afford drainage to the lands that surround them; water from
these lakes cannot find access to the existing natural drainage channels and
therefore drainage of a major part of the project area needs to be improved,
especially if the area is to be irrigated. H1ost of the southern project area
drains into either the Ialomita river or the lakes in this area. Excluding
the non-arable areas, the net area presently available for cultivation is
142,740 ha. After project execution, the net area would increase by 3,560 ha
(3%) to 146,300 ha due to reclamation of saline (2,650 ha) and other (910 ha)
areas.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Climate.  The climate in the project region is basically continental
with hot summers and cold winters. A weather station is located at Grivita,
which is almost in the middle of- the project area. Long term (over 40 years)
data recorded at this station is available; average of climatic data for the
last ten years (1965-1974) is summarized in Table 1. Average monthly maximum
temperatures vary in the cropping season from 260C in April to 34.80C in July,
and average minimums vary from --2.20C in October to 10.80C in July. First
frost occurs around end October to early November. The ten year average
annual precipitation at Grivita is 550 mm, of which about 380 mm (69%) occurs
during the cropping season. The long term average at this station is 480 mm,
of which about 250 mm falls during the cropping season. Rainfall could be as
low as 150 mm during the cropping season with very long (30 to 60 days) dry
periods occuring every third or fourth year. Droughts, extending over 60
days, have been experienced in 7 years out of 41. The relative humidity
averages 70% during the cropping season with a low of 67% in July and a high
of 76% in October. The wind velocity (during the day) averages 2.7 m/sec in
the season with a low of 2.2 m/sec in September and a high of 3.7 m/sec in
April. The velocity is generally higher during the day as compared to the
night.
5.        Soils.  Detailed soil surveys, including chemical and mechanical
analyses, have been carried out by specialized institutes in Romania and
a detailed soils map of the project area is available. Most soils consist
of chernozems of high agriucltural value, which have developed on loess
deposits under steppe conditions. In a small part of the project area,
mostly along the Calmatui river in the north and along its eastern boundary,
the soils consist of sands and sandy silts. The chernozem soils are sandy
loams and consist of silt (55% to 70%), clay (18% to 32%) and sand (5% to
20%). The loessial zones are mostly compacted; only in some parts soils are
liable to settle on wetting. The chernozem soils have a dark humic A horizon,
some 40 to 80 cm deep, which contains about 2% to 3% calcium carbonate. They
have a uniform structure, with permeability varying from low to medium, and a
good water retention capacity. The field capacity of the soils varies from
about 25% to 12%.
6.        Land Classification.  About 48% of project area is classified as
belonging to Class I; 40% to Class II and the remaining 12% to Class III,
mostly on account of its eroded nature and salt accumulation. Under the
project, a part of the Class III land would be reclaimed.
7.        Present Land Use and Yields.  Excluding the area occupied by vil-
lages, lakes, forests, roads and railway lines, the area presently available
for cultivation is 142,740 ha, of which about 5,900 ha is farmed by eligible
members of CAPs as individual plots for their personal benefit. The remaining
136,840 ha is presently cultivated by CAPs and IASs. About 1,550 ha, located
near the project area's southern boundary, is irrigated from the waters of the
Ialomita river; the remaining area is all rainfed. Grain maize is grown on
38% of the cultivated area, while autumn-sown cereals (principally wheat)



ANNEX 1
Page 3
occupy 23%. Industrial crops cover about 22%; these are sunflower (13%), soy-
bean (5%) and sugar beet (4%). Alfalfa, fodder maize and pastures account for
another 13% of the cultivated area. The remaining 4% is taken by potatoes
(2%), vineyards and orchards (2%). Inspite of an advanced standard of hus-
bandry, average yields are low (maize 3.5 tons/ha, wheat 2.3 tons/ha) due to
fluctuations in rainfall and a consequential low use of fertilizers. Area
under various crops, their present average (over past 5 years) yields and
production, are summarized in Table 2.
8.        Future Land Use and Yields.  In Romania, irrigated  areas receive
priority over rainfed areas for fertilizer allocation. Since increase of
fertilizer use beyond the present levels would not materially increase yields
in the absence of timely irrigation, future yields without the project are not
expected to be any different from the present yields. The cropping pattern is
also not expected to change. Further details are in Annex 11, Table 4.
9.        After project implementation, the cultivable area excluding individ-
ual plots, would increase by 3,560 ha (3%) to a total of 140,400 ha due to
reclamation of saline (2,650 ha) and other (910 ha) lands. The cropping
pattern would also change in pursuance of Government's policy to intensify
production of livestock oriented and industrial crops. The major changes
(Table 2) would consist of a reduction of area under wheat (8%) and sunflower
(9%) and an increase of area under maize (10%), soybean (4%), sugar beet (2%x
and alfalfa (1%). Another change of major importance would be a 10% increase
in the intensity of cultivation; almost all double crop cultivation would be
for maize silage.
10.       Crop yields would increase significantly following project comple-
tion because of: (a) timely and assured water availability; (b) higher
levels of fertilizer application and better use in quality of other inputs
made possible by irrigation; (c) improved surface and subsurface drainage; and
(d) additional availability of land preparation and other farm machinery.
Yields of major crops would increase as follows: maize by 125%; wheat by 95%;
alfalfa and soybean by 100%; sugar beet by 80% and sunflower by 55%. The
adopted yields are expected to be achieved within four years following intro-
duction of irrigation by increments of 30%, 40%, 20% and 10%. The adopted
crop yields are significantly lower than those actually achieved under project
conditions at the research and demonstration farms and are comparable to those
achieved in other irrigated areas of the region. Maize yield, for example, at
the Braila research station averaged 12.0 tons/ha against a yield of 8.0 tons
assumed for the project.
Farm Inputs
11.       Labor and Mechanization.  Land preparation is completely mechanized,
while seeding, fertilizing, spraying and harvesting operations are mechanized
to a considerable degree on the State farms and to a somewhat lesser degree on
the cooperative farms. The degree of mechanization also varies with the crop.



ANNEX I
Page 4
For example, harvesting of maize, wheat, oilseeds and fodder is almost fully
mechanized on IASs, while this operation is mechanized to an extent of about
80% on the CAPs. Harvesting of sugar beet is mostly by labor. Manual labor
is mostly used for weeding and harvesting of vegetables, and occasionally
employed for spraying of pesticides. It is also used extensively for various
operations in the orchards, vineyards and vegetable farms.
12.       Mechanization services are provided to the CAPs by the Central for
Agricultural Mechanization, which is under MAIA (Chart 16194). This Central
has an Agricultural Mechanization Enterprise (AME) in each of the 39 dis-
tricts; each AME has 16 to 19 Stations for Agricultural Machinery (SAMs). A
SAM serves 6 to 8 CAPs, and performs all field operations on a contract basis
at rates that are fixed by regions. The project area CAPs would be served by
6 SAMs, 3 are under the Braila AME and 3 in Ialomita AME. These AMEs and
SAMs are well equipped with repair workshops and qualified mechanics. Farm
machinery and implements required by the State farms are owned, operated and
maintained by them. Each IAS has a separate section within its organization
which manages all of its equipment. These sections are also well equipped
with all necessary facilities and staff for the proper upkeep of their
equipment.
13.       Seeds.  Improved seeds for all project crops are available in
Romania in the required quantities, and would be used in the project area.
Seed development and multiplication is a continuous process, which is en-
trusted to the research stations and selected State and cooperative farms
under a State organization (SEMROM). Overall guidance is provided through
special institutes, whose activities are coordinated by the Academy of Agri-
culture and Forestry Sciences. Processing of seeds is also a responsibility
of SEMROM. Testing and certification of seeds is done by special organiza-
tions under the Ministry. Seed distribution is arranged by another State
organization AGROSEM. Romania exports seeds of maize and sunflower.
14.       Fertilizers.  In spite of a rapid increase in manufacturing capa-
city of fertilizers and an output now approaching 5 million tons 1/ per annum,
the application of fertilizers remains low, because of emphasis on export.
The allocation of fertilizers to State farms and cooperatives, based on a
formula which takes into account soils, climatic conditions and cropping
patterns, is reviewed each year by the Ministries of Agriculture and Chemical
Industries. First priority is given to the irrigated areas and the State
farms, and the rainfed areas on the CAPs receive a lower priority. Fertilizer
application in the project area is not likely to increase without irrigation.
Following introduction of irrigation, due emphasis would be on increasing crop
production. Consequently application of fertilizers would be increased to the
levels recommended by research, as also its effective utilization. It is
estimated that at full development, requirements of ammonium nitrate and
1/   A 600,000 ton capacity ammonium nitrate plant is located at Slobozia, at
the project area's southern boundary.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
superphosphate would approximately double from about 40,000 tons to 80,000
tons. Annual requirement of potash would be small (about 1,000 tons), as it
is applied to potatoes and sugar beet only.
15.       Plant Protection.  Romania's production of phytopharmaceutical
products has increased from about 8,000 tons to about 25,000 tons during the
last decade. It includes a wide range of insecticides, fungicides, herbicides
and pre-emergence weed killers. The current use of these chemicals seems
satisfactory, although the herbicides are generally in short supply. After
the project, the use of these chemicals is expected to increase from the
present 2,000 tons to about 4,200 tons.  Plant protection efforts are super-
vised in each district by an inspectorate under the General Directorate of
Agriculture. This unit is staffed with 3 to 4 specialists and 6 technicians,
and provides specialized back up to the resident staff at the CAPs and the
IASs.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agricultural Production Organizations and Investment Financing
A. Background
1.        In pre-World War II Romania, a large portion of the agricultural
land was owned by landlords and the church, but was cultivated by tenants.
There were also a number of peasants who owned and cultivated their small
farms. In 1921, an attempt was made to limit ownership to a maximum of 300 ha
per family, but the pattern of land ownership and production remained virtually
unchanged until 1945.
2.        The transformation of agricultural land ownership and production
from pre-war Romania to the present was achieved in three phases during 1945-
1962. The first phase (1945-1948) of agricultural reform aimed at establish-
ing a small-scale peasant-oriented farm structure. About 1.6 million ha
belonging to landlords and the church were expropriated; 70% were distributed
among about 0.9 million agricultural workers and small farmers and the remain-
ing, combined with existing government owned land, was used to establish the
initial State Agricultural Enterprises (IASs). At the same time, medium and
large farms were discouraged through the selective use of quotas and prices.
3.        The second phase (1949-1958) involved a move towards large-scale
farming through collectivization of small farms and expansion of state enter-
prises. The farmers were strongly encouraged through pricing mechanism to join
the collectives, but this was not very successful as the farmers did not want
to lose title to land and were not accustomed to organized group production.
Consequently, Agricultural Associations were formed in early 1950s, in which
participating farmers pooled their lands without losing titles and were paid
according to their contribution to production. Despite these efforts, about
30% of the agricultural or 45% of the arable lands were still operated indi-
vidually in 1958.
4.        The final drive into coLlectivization was completed during 1959-1962
through determined Government efforts. During this phase, private farms and
Agricultural Associations were emerged into what are presently known as Agri-
cultural Production Cooperatives (CAPs).
5.        Since 1962, the structure of agricultural farms has been further
consolidated by reducing the number of farming enterprises. Presently there
are about 4,400 CAPs in Romania, wihich consist of about 9.0 million ha (60%)
of agricultural land. About 3.4 million families constitute the membership of



ANNEX 2
Page 2
these cooperatives. The CAP farms produce about 60% of all cereals, 70% of
oilseeds, 40% of potatoes and almost all of the sugar beet. The project area
contains 48 CAPs with a total area of 114,200 ha (80% of total) and an active
membership of about 41,200. Size of these farms varies from 1,500 ha to 6,000
ha with a median of about 2,400 ha.
6.        The present number of IASs in Romania is 390; these and other State
units contain about 4.5 million ha (30%) of agricultural land or 2.0 million ha
(21%) of cropland. These employ a total of about 300,000 workers, and produce
about 30% of all cereals, 30% of oilseeds, and 10% of potatoes. There are
five enterprises in the project area, which have an area of 28,540 ha (20% of
total) and employ about 16,800 permanent and seasonal workers. Size of IASs
varies from 3,000 to 14,000 ha.
7.        About 1.5 million ha (10%) of agricultural land is presently culti-
vated by about 150,000 individual farming families. Most of this area is
located in the mountainous region and is of marginal quality. These farms
produce about 19% of the total milk production, 19% of eggs, 14% of meat and
15% potatoes. There are no private farms in the project area.
8.        Members of CAPs are allowed to retain small plots of cooperative
land, usually not exceeding 1,500 m2 per active member, for their personal use.
Production on such plots is intensive with much higher yields than national
averages obtained from rainfed areas. In the project area, such plots total
to about 5,900 ha, about 5,200 ha of which are located outside of communities.
Most of these plots are under rainfed cultivation, and some are irrigated from
groundwater. The design of the project works provides for the capacity re-
quired to irrigate the plots located outside the communities, after agreement
is reached between the farmers and the State on appropriate irrigation methods
and financing of on-farm irrigation network, and the economic viability of
irrigation of such plots is established.
9.        Agricultural production organizations are still evolving.  As
economic activities in agriculture become more complex, the size and nature of
operations change and resource needs increase. Some CAPs have already started
forming Intercooperative Associations in an effort to pool resources for in-
vestments in processing, dairy and beef fattening and in other resources.
Joint ventures among CAPs, Intercooperatives and IASs are also on the increase.
Such jointly owned and operated agri-businesses are likely to be increasingly
important sources of output with the growth and development of agriculture.
B. Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Organization
10.       The land and assets of a CAP are owned jointly by its members.  The
management of a CAP is the responsibility of its President, one or two Vice



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Presidents, a Management Council and the General Assembly. The governing body
of a CAP is its General Assembly, which consists of all working adults in the
CAP. The General Assembly meets quarterly and is responsible for drafting the
production, investment and financial plans; for ratifying major contracts with
suppliers, buyers, mechanization enterprises, etc.; and for deciding the allo-
cation of income. A CAP's President is elected by its General Assembly for a
two year term and his appointment is subject to approval of the district's
General Director for Agriculture. The General Assembly also elects the repre-
sentatives of the technicians and the members of the CAP's Management Council
and ratifies the President's choices for chiefs of farms within the CAP and
its chief economist.
11.       The Management Council is the executive body of the CAP which is
responsible for coordinating the CAP's operations and meets once or twice
a week. Its membership consists of the President and Vice-Presidents (if
any) of the CAP, the chief economist, chiefs of the farms in the CAP and the
elected representatives of the technicians and the members. The President
and the Vice-Presidents conduct the day-to-day operations and are assisted by
the chief economist, who is not only responsible for the preparation of a
sound investment plan but also for the accounting and the financial management
of CAP's affairs. The chiefs of farms are the heads of production units and
are always engineers (agriculturalists). They are assisted by a farm economist
in charge of accounting and financial management of the units and by techni-
cians in the fields of irrigation and livestock.
12.       CAPs do not own farm machinery or equipment but rely on the service
of state owned and operated Agricultural Mechanization Enterprises (AMEs).
These enterprises are responsible for providing all farm machinery and imple-
ments to CAPs, whenever required, in return for fixed charges for various
operations, which may be paid either in cash or in kind.
Allocation of Production Income
13.       The net farm income of a CAP (value of total production minus cost
of production excluding labor contributed by members) is allocated between two
funds: the Development Fund, which is at least 18% of the net income, and
the Consumption Fund, which is at most 82%; allocation between the two is some-
what flexible and varies from CAP to CAP. The Development Fund is a compulsory
saving mechanism under which funds are set aside for partial financing of
future investment on the CAPs and of production expenses in the next cropping
season. This Fund is deposited with the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry
(BAFI) and earns 1% to 2% interest. In general, about 85% of the Consumption
Fund is distributed among the members; about 8% is allocated to social security
and 7% to emergency and entertainment funds. The General Assembly of the co-
operative has the power to alter the percentages of Development and Consumption
Funds to keep the personal incomes to members in line with personal incomes
elsewhere in Romania.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
14.       Each active member of the cooperative is presently guaranteed an
equivalent minimum salary of about Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month 1/, which
is in line with the minimum wage for comparable labor employed by IASs.  The
actual salary of an active member in any given year is increased if actual
production is above the planned targets, but this does not exceed the maxi-
mum wage to) comparable labor employed in the State sector because the Romanian
socio-economlc system does not permit a wide disparity in income to workers of
similar skills.
C. State Agricultural Enterprises
Organization
15.       IASs are owned by the State and are operated and managed by employees
in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA). A single enterprise
may consist of several farms; each farm may specialize in producing either
field crops, vegetables, industrial crops, fruit, milk or meat. The chief
executive officer of an IAS is a Director, who is appointed by the General
Director of IASs in the Ministry. He is assisted by the chief engineers of
the farms in the IAS and a chief economist/accountant. Other technicians re-
quired for the farms are included on the staff. The governing body of an IAS
consists of the top management, chiefs of the farms, representatives of the
unions and the Party and elected representatives of the workers. Storage,
transport and farm equipment is owned by the IAS; these are maintained by a
Central Service Unit.
16.       Salaries of the staff of IAS are fixed by law but vary according
to "norms" 2/ and skills; 80% are paid semi-monthly or monthly and the re-
mainder at the end of the season provided the planned targets are met. If
production exceeds the target, special premiums are paid. In 1975, salary
scales were increased by up to 48%; the revised scales would remain effec-
tive during 1976-1980 Plan Period. Past and revised salary scales are given
below:
1/   This is the guaranteed salary for members of crop producing farm units.
The corresponding salary for members of livestock farms amounts to
Lei 1,500 (US$75.00), and of vegetable, grape and fruuit farms Lei 1,200
(US$60.00) each. If the Consumption Fund in any given year is low, BAFI
extends loan to the cooperative to ensure payment of the guaranteed
salaries to members. Such a loan is usually repayable within one year
and carries no interest.
2/   "Norm" refers to the expected volume of work, which should be performed
under given conditions, and usually corresponds to a 10-hour day and a
25-day month.

Distribution of Profits
17.       The prof4t of an IAS is defined as th2 gross '.a!-dc of production
less production costs, which include cost of labor and depreciation on all
capital investments in the IAS. Payments concerning depreciation are made
by the IAS to BAFI, who maintains a Special Depreciation Fund, which is used
as a source of financing future investments in the Public sector.
18.       Normally, about 10% of the profit is credited to a Consolidation
Fund, which is used to finance minor on-farm investments on any enterprise
under the Ministry. About 40% of the profit is allocated to Risk Insurance
Fund, which is used to meet extraordinary loses. The remaining 50% is
credited to the State budget. Profits in excess of the planned, after pay-
ment of labor premiums, are allocated between the Consolidation Fund, the
Insurance Fund and the State budget in the ratio of 25%, 30% and 45% respec-
tively.
D. Investment Financing
19.       Once a project is included in the annual plan, the CAP or IAS pre-
pares a technical and financial proposal with the help of staff from BAFI
and the concerned General Directorate of Agriculture. This proposal is
normally backed up by detailed studies and designs made by relevant insti-
tutes. After the proposal is approved by the competent authority, it is
reviewed by BAFI and a decision to finance the project is taken.
20.       Investments in CAPs are financed from the Development Fund (para.
13) and from BAFI loans. The Fund may finance up to 30% of the costs and the
BAFI Loans up to 95%, depending on the project, the financial status of the
cooperative, etc.



AN4NEX 2
Page 6
21.       Loan repayment periods vary; periods for typical loans are- vine-
yard or orchard 10 years; feedmill 12 years; dairy unit 20 years; and on-farm
irrigation equipment 8 years including 3 years of grace.  Current interest
rates on investment loans to CAPs amount to 3% including interest during
construction, with penalty rates of up to 5%. 1/
22.       At present most investments on IASs are financed from the State
budget, funds for which are channeled through BAFI; credit financing is of
minor importance. In future, however, credit financing of investments on IASs
is likely to increase. Such lending would also be handled by BAFI. Interest
rates on investment loans to lASs range from 2% during construction to 4%
thereafter; penalty on delayed payments ranges up to 6%.
23.       In the past, preference in allocation of investment funds was given
to IASs because these were considered as the model farm organizations. Due to
CAP's larger share of production and employment, however, Government has
recognized that the growth of the agricultural sector depends largely on the
development of agriculture in the cooperatives and consequently more effort is
now being made to increase investments in the cooperatives. CAPs' share of
investment in agriculture would increase from about 70% during the 1971-1975
plan period to about 75% during the 1976-1980 plan.
1/   The low interest rate is in line with generally low prices of other
inputs and outputs in Romania. Interest rates play little or no re-
source allocative role in the country because they are "taxes-on"
rather than "prices-of" capital.

Marketing, Markets and Prices
A. Marketing
Organization and Management
1.        Marketing of agricultural produce in Romania is entrusted to State
owned and operated marketing Centrals 1/. These Centrals were established
in late 1960's to assist MAIA in the procurement, storage, processing and
distribution of agricultural products. Unlike other departments of the Min-
istry, however, the Centrals are independent economic units with separate but
coordinated plans, budgets and accounts. Presently, there are thirteen Centrals
which specialize in marketing specific commodities such as cereals, vegetables
and fruits, sugar, meat, milk, etc. Each Central has its headquarters in
Bucharest and an enterprise in each of the country's 39 judets (districts).
The enterprises are the executing agencies of the Centrals and procure and
distribute products through their sub-units known as collecting centers 2/.
2.        Normally, each Central is headed by a director general who reports
directly to the concerned Deputy Minister. He is assisted by directors of
commerce/marketing, economics/accounting and technical matters. The composi-
tion of each enterprise's administrative personnel is similar to that of the
Central, and a chief engineer, a marketing specialist and an economist or an
accountant are normally on its staff.
3.        The enterprises and their sub-units are well equipped to facilitate
smooth flow of products without excessive losses. Storage losses of well
dried grains are estimated at about 2% but are higher for perishable commo-
dities. The number of the collecting centers in any region and the market
facilities which are available to them vary depending on the mix and volume
of commodities handled. However, care is taken to allocate collecting centers
among different localities and to provide them with adequate supplies in ac-
cordance with planned production of commodities.
1/   A number of "peasant free markets", which sell produce from individual
plots of CAP members or private farmers, also exist but their importance
is insignificant.
2/   The exception is the Central for sugar which does not have an enter-
prise in each district and the collecting centers.  This Central owns
and operates 13 sugar refineries. The refineries procure and transport
the raw materials, process them and distribute the final products (sugar,
candies, etc.).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Procurement
4.        All procurements and sales by the marketing enterprises (or Centrals)
are arranged through standardized and legally binding contracts, which are
signed at the beginning of each year. These contracts specify types, volumes,
prices and places of delivery. Frequency of deliveries vary depending on the
production cycle; livestock products are delivered daily or weekly. The
delivery plans of contracting farms (CAP or IAS) are evaluated periodically,
based on frequent visits to farms, by experts from the concerned collecting
centers for assessing prospective outputs. This helps the marketing Centrals
in reviewing planned sales for domestic consumption or export.
5.        The CAP and the IAS farms are responsible for the delivery of prod-
ucts to the collecting centers but all costs of transportation are paid by the
Centrals. Each farm is expected to provide its own packaging materials; the
collecting centers reimburse the IAS farms for such materials (about Lei 17 or
US$0.8 per ton for grain) but not the CAP farms, who are allowed to take back
the packing materials after delivery.
Distribution
6.        Normally, the collecting centers distribute the products to different
outlets in accordance with the State plan. These outlets consist of the export
markets, the domestic food processing industry and the retail markets most of
which are owned and operated by the marketing Centrals. Distribution of feed
to the livestock subsector is also their responsibility.
7.        Presently, most marketing Centrals are responsible for the physical
handling of commodities for export, and a few export through other specialized
agencies of MAIA such as FRUITEXPORT, which specializes in export of fruits
and vegetables. However, identification of international market prospects
and sale agreements, and planning of international deliveries are responsibil-
ities of the Ministry's export organization (AGROEXPORT), which operates in
collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
8.        All production plans in Romania are coordinated with expected prod-
uct use and its distribution. Since prices are fixed by law and play little
or no role in allocation of outputs, performance of agencies marketing domes-
tically is limited to efficient physical handling and distribution of commodi-
ties in accordance with the State plan. The Centrals, enterprises and col-
lecting centers are well staffed and organized, and are provided with the
necessary facilities to allow them to perform their functions properly.
They are revenue earning entities and derive their incomes from "profits".
Their costs of operation, retained "profit" margins and contributions to the
State budget are fixed in accordance with established Government guidelines.
The marketing margins of the collecting centers amount to about 10% to 15%
of purchase prices but this could vary according to the complexity of pro-
cessing involved.

Marketing of Project Output
9.        Adequate measures have already been planned for handling anticipated
incremental project output, which would be marketed by four existing Centrals
through their enterprises and their sub-units. The Central for Sale of Cereals
and Compound Feedstuffs (CVPC) would market wheat, maize, soybean and sun-
flower. The marketing of fruits and vegetables would be the responsibility
of the Central for Vegetables and Fruits (CPLF). The Centrals for Sugar (CIZ)
and grapes (CVV) would market, respectively, sugar beet and its products, and
grape and its products. Under separate but related projects, 5 new silos
(260,000 tons capacity) would be constructed in and around the project area to
store grains; construction of these silos would be completed by 1982. Similar-
ly, an existing vegetable cannery at Fetesti; soybean and sunflower factories
at Slobozia; and a winery at Insuratei would be expanded to process additional
outputs of vegetables, oilseeds and grape. Present output of sugar beet is
processed in existing plants located at Buzau and Braila. A new plant (520,000
tons capacity) is under construction at Tandarei and would be able to process
the incremental output of sugar beet when completed. Because of the existence
of well-organized marketing Centrals, and the planned expansion of processing
facilities, there would be no organizational constraints to the disposal of
project output.
B.  Markets
10.       Project output could be exported and/or consumed domestically; the
outlook for expansion of both markets is good. It is difficult to determine
how much of the project output would be allocated between foreign and domestic
markets, as the allocation depends on the national production and Government
policy. However, Romania is presently a net exporter of most of the project
commodities and is expected to remain so in the foreseeable future. The
country trades with many nations in Western and Eastern Europe, and in less
developed areas. It has established favorable trade relationships with the
European Economic Community and the United States has recently granted it the
most favored nation status. Domestic demand for most agricultural products is
projected to increase by at least 50% by 1990 when real per capita personal
income is expected to reach about US$3,000.
11.       Cereals.  With the project, the additional production of maize and
wheat would increase by about 350,700 tons and 25,500 tons, respectively.
Romania is a net exporter of both of these cereals. Annual export of wheat
increased from about 240,000 tons in 1971 to about 780,000 tons in 1973, while
that of maize remained unchanged at about 350,000 tons during the same period.
The major traditional importers of Romanian cereals are UK, France, Federal
Republic of Germany, Italy and Austria. These countries imported an average
of 70% of maize and 50% of wheat exports from mid-1960's to early 1970's.
During the same period, USSR imported about 15% of Romania's maize exports,



ANNEX 3
Page 4
and lately about 40% of wheat exports. The potential for expanding export of
cereals to Eastern Europe and the USSR is particularly promising because the
region's demand for imports is likely to increase.
12.       Project output of wheat would be used to expand exports.  However,
virtually all additional output of maize is likely to be used as livestock
feed. The livestock subsector is expected to grow rapidly in accordance with
the national plan based on the rising domestic and export demands. At least
50,000 tons of the additional output of maize would be utilized by dairy, beef
fattening, pig fattening and poultry farms which would be established within
the project area during 1976-1980 plan period. The balance is likely to be
used to feed a growing livestock population elsewhere in the region.
13.       Oilseeds.  With the project, production of soybean would increase by
about 27,900 tons but that of sunflower would decrease by about 14,300 tons.
This would result in a net additional oilseed output of about 13,600 tons or
an equivalent of about 11,000 tons of oilcake and 2,600 tons of oil. The
oilcake would substitute about 11% of current imports and the oil is likely to
be exported. The world market for oilseeds and their products is attractive
and it is expected that it would continue to be favorable in the foreseeable
future.
14.       Sugar.  Romania has traditionally been a net exporter of sugar, but
recently imports have tended to exceed exports. Annual exports peaked at
about 159,000 tons in 1972 but declined to insignificant levels thereafter
while imports stabilized at about 70,000 tons during the same period. The
decline in exports could be due partly to reduced production which resulted
from unfavorable weather but it was also partly a result of increased domestic
demand. The per capita consumption of sugar in Romania is presently estimated
at about 30 kg, which is among the lowest in Europe. Domestic demand is ex-
pected to increase by about 80,000 tons by 1980 and by a further 60,000 tons
by 1990. Projected incremental production of sugar from two previous Bank-
financed irrigation projects (Giurgiu-Razmiresti and Rasova-Vederoasa Irriga-
tion Projects) would almost substitute for the current level of net imports,
and the expected production from Ialomita-Calmatui Project would meet about
one-third of the projected additional domestic demand by 1990.
15.       Vegetables.  At full development, the project would increase annual
production of vegetables (including potatoes) by about 75,400 tons. Most of
this could be used to supply a growing demand in the four judets 1/ (districts)
adjacent to the project area, whose current total population is estimated at
about 2.1 million. Presently, the annual per capita consumption of vegetables
in the region is estimated at about 200 kg. 2/ Assuming a population growth

2/   This includes potatoes and other vegetables.  The information is based
on interviews with representatives of the Central for Vegetables and
Fruits in Braila judet.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
rate of about 1% per annum and other factors which influence demand remaining
unchanged, the demand for vegetables in the four judets could increase by
about 60,000 tons in 1990. This potential market would absorb most of the
additional output of vegetables from the project area. If supply exceeds the
regional demand, the excess quantities could be used by consumers in other
parts of Romania. The domestic demand for vegetables is projected to grow by
about 60% by 1990.
16.       Fruit.  The project would increase the annual production of fruit
(mainly apples and grapes) by about 14,600 tons, all of which would be used
mostly by the urban consumers in the region. Assuming a per capita fruit
consumption of about 50 kg per year 1/, the additional population in the four
judets mentioned above (para. 15) would increase demand by about 15,000 tons
in 1990.
17.       Fodder.  The anticipated project output of silage maize and alfalfa
hay would be used to feed the growing livestock population in the region. A
part of crop by-products would also be used as livestock feed, and the rest
would be plowed in.
C. Prices
Domestic Prices
18.       Because of the system of economic management in Romania, market
forces have little or no influence in determining domestic prices. Prices are
fixed by the Government and vary according to quality of products and in some
instances according to the delivery dates; the present prices have not changed
significantly since 1963. Domestic production prices reflect the cost of
production plus a pre-determined "profit" margin. Prices of all commodities,
which are low when compared with prices of comparable products in other coun-
tries, reflect low prices of inputs including labor.
19.       The IASs are required to sell their products to the marketing enter-
prises or their sub-units, but the CAPs make their deliveries based on con-
tracts signed with the marketing agencies at the beginning of each cropping
season. Prices of cereals received by the CAPs for their contract deliveries
are about 40% higher than those paid to the IASs. Prices of oilseeds are
uniform throughout Romania, except for soybean whose contract price for the
CAPs is 25% higher than that received by IASs.

(1083-RO) Annex 7, page 5.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
20.       Domestic prices of vegetables, potatoes, fruits, sugar beet and
grapes are fixed by grades and dates of delivery. No price differentials
exist between CAP and IAS production and in most cases among regions, but
prices are higher for early deliveries. The price of any of these crops can
vary within the maximum price for early delivery and superior quality crop and
the minimum price for late delivery and poor quality crop, but cannot decline
below the floor or exceed the ceiling prices.
Prices Used for Project Appraisal
21.       The averages of official farmgate prices of project commodities
which are applicable to all producers throughout Romania, and CAP contract
prices are shown in Table 1. For financial analysis of farm budgets, the CAP
contract prices are used. For economic analysis, however, prices of tradeables
have been derived from the Bank's forecast of world prices for the period
1975-1985 and for the non-tradeables, official domestic prices are used. The
former category includes cereals, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, grapes and
sugar beet (sugar); the latter includes mainly fedders and crop residues.
Romania is a price-taker in the world market and project output of tradeables
would have little or no influence on international or domestic prices.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Description of Project Works
General
1.        The project works would consist of (a) irrigation works to serve a
gross area of 148,500 ha (146,300 ha net); (b) drainage works to serve the
above area, including 2,650 ha of presently saline lands that are to be re-
claimed; and (c) miscellaneous works, which include land levelling, soil ero-
sion control and other minor works. Detailed description of each category and
works included therein is given below; the irrigation and drainage system is
illustrated in Map IBRD 12267.
Irrigation Works
2.        The irrigation works would consist of a Floating Pumping Station
on the Danube river; a lined canal network with seven pumping stations; 115
pressure pumping stations, 18 mobile pressure pumps, and pipe distribution
networks; on-farm portable sprinkler and furrow equipment and power supply
works. These works are described below in detail.
3.        Floating Pumping Station.  This Station (SPA) would be located at
Km 221/650 (measured from the Black Sea) of the Danube river (Cremenea Branch)
by extending the existing basin of the pumping station for the Viziru Terrace
Irrigation Scheme, which irrigates about 35,000 ha lying to the north of the
project area. Because of a wide fluctuation (2.1 m to 10.0 m) in the Danube
water levels, a floating pumping station is more economical than a fixed
station. The Station would consist of 36 pump units, which would be mounted
on 6 barges. Each pump would have a capacity to lift 3.05 m3/sec over 10.7 m,
and the total station capacity would amount to 110 m3/sec. The pumps would
deliver water, over the protective levee, into a discharge basin at the head
of the main canal. The installed power capacity at the Station would be
18,200 kw (Table 1).
4.        The Canal System.  The main canal would be about 38 km long and
would be aligned along the northern boundary of the project area, south of
the Calmatui river. The canal would extend from the discharge basin of the
Floating Pumping Station (SPA) to the Pumping Station SRPA IV (Map IBRD
12267). For the first 6.5 km of its length, the canal would be in the old
flood plain of the Danube. Pumping Station SRPA I, located at the end of
this reach, would lift the whole discharge a maximum of about 38 m, on to the
terrace where all of the project area lies. The remaining 31.5 km length of
the main canal would be on the terrace. The canal would have a trapezoidal



ANNEX 4
Page 2
section, with its bed width varying from 15.0 m to 4.0 m, and the depth from
4.0 m to 2.3 m (Table 2). The canal would be lined with 20 cm thick cast-in-
place concrete slabs, which would be placed over graded filter layers. Two
other pumping stations would be located on the main canal at Km 29.5 and Km
38.0. A third pumping station at Km 22.0 would lift 2.3 m3/sec from the main
canal to feed distributary D4. Further details of the pumping stations are
given in para 8 and Table 1.
5.        At some future date, a navigable canal from the Siret river (Siret-
Baraganu project) would join the tail end of the main canal under the proj-
ect with a view to extend small craft navigation from the Siret to the Danube.
The Siret canal would also supply a part of the project's water requirements
(about 10 m3/sec in the western part), whenever such supplies would be surplus
to the needs of the Siret-Baraganu project. Such an arrangement would permit
a substantial saving in the cost of pumping Danube water (about 10 m3/sec over
a total lift of about 57 m).
6.        The main canal would feed five distributaries by gravity and one
distributary by pumping (Station SRPA II). All distributaries would be lined
with concrete with thickness varying from 20 cm to 6 cm. The biggest distri-
butary (D3), which would serve all of the project area to the south of the
Lata Sarata Valley in addition to a large area in the northern part, would
have a capacity of about 60 m3/sec. Several smaller distributing canals,
which would also be concrete lined, would supply water to the pressure pump-
ing stations. At suitable locations, provision would be made to spill sur-
plus water into the drainage network. Total length of the canal system would
be about 376 km, which would involve earthwork excavation and fill of about
19.5 million m3, and concrete lining of about 5.5 million m2.
7.        There would be a total of 211 major and minor structures on the
canal system. Of these, important structures are: 12 highway bridges, 6 rail-
way bridges, 13 secondary road bridges and 40 gated regulators, drops, siphons
and escape weirs. The canal system and the pumping stations would operate 24
hours per day. Regulation of supplies within the canal network would be auto-
mated through constant downstream water level gates. By providing a large
freeboard (1.0 m to 1.5 m) sufficient storage capacity would be available
within the various reaches of the main canal and the distributaries to cater
for hourly fluctuations of irrigation demand. About 104 km of canal network
would be controlled centrally by electrical automation through a Data Center,
which would be located at Baraganul. Regulation of the remaining system would
be through the hydraulically controlled gates at individual control points.
8.        Pumping Stations.  A total of seven fixed pumping stations would
lift irrigation supplies within the canal network; of these, 3 stations would
be located on the main canal, and 4 on the distributaries. Data on these
pumping stations is given in Table 1. The biggest station (SRPA I) would be
located at the foot of the terrace and would consist of 14 pumping units ca-
pable of lifting water over a height of 37.8 m. Ten of these units, with a



ANNEX 4
Page 3
capacity of 10.0 m3/sec each, and four smaller units, with a capacity of 2.35
m3/sec each, would convey the full discharge on to the main canal at the
terrace. The installed power capacity at this station would be 59,400 kw.
Two other stations (SRPA III and SRPA IV) would respectively pump 23.7 m3/sec
over 10.4 m height, and 13.8 m3/sec over 7.8 m into the higher reaches of the
main canal following these stations. The installed capacity at these two
stations would be 4,100 kw and 2,100 kw.
9.        Station SRPA II would pump 2.3 m3/sec over about 12 m from the main
canal into distributary D4. The other three stations (SRPA V, SRPA VI and SRPA
VII) would serve the network of distributary D3. The biggest of these stations
(SRPA VI) would pump 37.4 m3/sec over 9.1 m across the Lata Sarata Valley for
the southern part of the project area, and Station SRPA VII would further
raise about 19.6 m3/sec over about 7.6 m for the higher portions of the proj-
ect area. The total installed power capacity for all eight stations, includ-
ing the Floating Station, would be 96,500 kw (Table 1).
10.       Pressure Pumping Stations.  There would be a total of 115 pressure
pumping stations on the irrigation system; their location is shown on Map IBRD
12267. These stations would serve an area of 140,590 ha; of which 103,840 ha
of sprinkler area would be supplied by 82 high pressure stations, and 36,750
ha of furrow area by 33 low pressure stations. Smaller blocks totalling 5,710
ha would be served by mobile diesel or electric pressure pumps. The capacity
of the pressure pumping stations would vary from 0.41 m3/sec to 2.08 m3/sec
over a head varying from a minimum of 39 m to a maximum of 76 m. Each station
would have 3 to 8 units depending on its total capacity. The total installed
capacity of these stations would be 121,000 kw. The smaller mobile pumping
units would have a capacity of 0.05 to 0.07 m3/sec for a head of 50 m to 65 m.
11.       Power Supply Works.  In order to supply power to all pumping sta-
tions under the project, about 240 km of 20 kV and 110 kV power lines would be
constructed as a part of the project. A number of transformer substations
would also be constructed at the irrigation and drainage pumping stations.
12.       Pipe Distribution Networks.  The area to be irrigated is divided
into 115 large rectangular blocks varying in size from a minimum of 520 ha
to a maximum of 2,075 ha. Each block is served by one pressure pumping sta-
tion, and a piped distribution network originating from the pressure station.
The distribution network would consist of precast reinforced concrete pipe
(for sizes above 500 mm diameter), and asbestos cement pipe (for sizes below
500 mm). These types of pipe, up to the stated sizes, were found to be the
least costly as compared to the other types. Total length of the pipeline
for the whole project would be 2,763 km.
13.       Sprinkler Irrigation.  About 103,650 ha, mostly north and south-
west of the Lata Sarata Valley, would be irrigated by sprinklers. Most of
this area has less than 3% ground slope and would be sprinkler irrigated



ANNEX 4
Page 4
mainly because of the low permeability and poorly draining soils. About
97,940 ha would be served by fixed pressure pumping stations and the remaining
by mobile diesel or electric pressure pumping units. The average size of the
area to be served by a pressure pumping station would be about 1,250 ha.
Generally in sandy soils, the sector size would measure 3,744 m x 3,672 m
or 1,374.8 ha; in clayey soils, the sector size would be 4,992 m x 3,672 m
or 1,833.1 ha. Distribution pipes would be laid at intervals of 612 m, and
hydrants would be spaced 72 m apart on the distribution pipes. Each hydrant
would have connections for 6 laterals, but only two could be served simul-
taneously at a pressure of 3.0 atmospheres. Sprinklers would be spaced at
18 m intervals; each would serve an area of 18 m x 24 m. Laterals would have
a diameter of 10 cm. During the peak month, irrigation water would be sup-
plied for 20 to 22 hours per day, with an intensity of 7 mm to 8 mm per hour.
Irrigation intervals would vary from 10 to 12 days on silty loams, and 6 to 8
days on sandy soils.
14.       Furrow Irrigation.  About 36,750 ha, mostly located in the southern
part of the project area and in the southeast (Map IBRD 12267) would be ir-
rigated by furrows. Pressure would be provided by 33 pumping stations. Aver-
age size of the area served by a pressure station would be about 1,110 ha. Dis-
tribution pipes would be laid at a spacing of 612 m, and hydrants would be pro-
vided at intervals of 216 m. Each hydrant would feed 16 to 20 furrows through
a portable butyl rubber pipe with outlets at furrow spacings, at a pressure of
0.35 atmosphere. Length of furrows would not exceed 200 m, and the maximum
discharge in one furrow would be about 3.5 1/sec.
Drainage Works
15.       The drainage works would consist of several surface drainage net-
works including drainage pumping stations; tile drainage networks serving a
total area of about 14,400 ha, including 2,650 ha of saline land; and reclama-
tion of about 2,000 ha of shallow depressions. These works are described below.
16.       Surface Drainage Networks.  About 122,700 ha of the project area
would require surface or tile drainage works; the remaining area being pre-
dominantly sandy is already well drained. About 82,350 ha, lying to the north
of the Lata Sarata Valley, would require an extensive drainage network, while
the remaining 40,350 ha lying to the Valley's south would need some drainage
facilities to supplement the existing or under construction minor features.
The project's surface drainage facilities would, therefore, basically serve
the northern 82,350 ha, which is divided into 37 hydrological basins (Table 3).
Of these, 18 basins located in the northern and eastern parts of the project
area and totalling 25,810 ha would be drained into the Calmatui river by 8
networks. The other 19 basins covering 56,540 ha would be served by 9 net-
works; these would outfall into the Lata Sarata Valley. The drainage networks
(Map IBRD 12267) would be designed to remove in 3 to 5 days the surface run-
off resulting from a storm precipitation of 65 mm in 24 hours (occurrence



ANNEX 4
Page 5
probability of once in 20 years). The specific yield would vary from 0.40
1/sec/ha to 0.80 1/sec/ha and is estimated at 0.48 1/sec/ha for the whole area.
17.       The main channel of each drainage network would have a capacity that
corresponds to the area drained by that network. The largest drain would be
designed for a flow of 10.8 m3/sec. It would have a bed width of 3.0 m, a
depth of 2.0 m and a velocity of 0.57 m/sec. All drains would have trapezoidal
sections with relatively flat side slopes. In larger basins, secondary or
tertiary drains would be provided, as required, at a spacing of 612 m, in be-
tween the irrigation pipes. In certain cases the secondary or tertiary drains
would also carry effluent from the tile drains (para. 21).
18.       The Lata Sarata Valley also drains an area of about 22,000 ha, which
is located west of the project area. The total discharge that would flow
through this natural drain, following construction of the project drainage
works, is estimated at 48 m3/sec. The present section of the Lata Sarata
channel, having a capacity of about 12 m3/sec would be remodelled in certain
reaches to handle the additional discharge to be contributed by the project's
drainage works. Lata Sarata outfalls into Lake Strachina. An earthfill dam
(not a part of the project), located near the downstream end of the lake, is
nearing completion and would regulate the flow in the lake for the benefit of
a fisheries project. A drain with a capacity of about 17 m3/sec would convey
escapages from this dam to the lalomita river with the assistance of a pumping
station (SPE 2). No channel remodelling work is required either in the
Ialomita or the Calmatui rivers to carry the drainage effluents discharged
by the project drains.
19.       The total length of the drains to be constructed under the project
would amount to about 311 km. These would involve an excavation of about 13.8
million m3. About 180 structures, mostly bridges, siphons and culverts would
be constructed on the drains. Except for a few, these structures would be
minor.
20.       Pumping Stations.  Twenty three pumping stations (Table 4) would be
provided on the drainage networks in order to (a) pump out the drainage water
from depressions into the surface drains, and (b) to pump water from the
secondary drains to the main drains or from the main drains to the natural
drains for ultimate disposal. The location of these stations is shown on Map
IBRD 12267. Only seven stations would have a capacity larger than 1.0 m3/
sec; the largest station (SPE 2) with a capacity of 17.5 m3/sec would be
located to pump the drainage effluent from Lake Strachina into the Ialomita
river (para. 18). All of the drainage pumping stations would be driven by
electric power and the total installed capacity would be about 6,000 kw.
During an average year, these stations would consume about 2.7 million kwh
of energy.
21.       Tile Drainage Networks.  In isolated parts of the project area,
especially around lakes and larger (also deeper) depressions, the ground



ANNEX 4
Page 6
water table is high and would be drained by tile drains. Total area of these
parts, where tile drains are considered necessary for providing effective
drainage, is estimated at 14,400 ha; these are scattered throughout the proj-
ect area and are illustrated on Map IBRD 12267. Their general distribution
is given below.
Location                                                                   Area
(ha)
Around lakes and depressions in northwestern
and northern parts of the project area                                  6,070
In area served by furrow irrigation, mostly
south of the Lata Sarata Valley                                         8,330
Total                                                                  14,400
Of the 6,070 ha in the northwestern and northern parts, about 2,650 ha consti-
tute land that is either under and around the saline lakes, or the lowest part
of large depressions that are occasionally flooded by drainage water from sur-
rounding lands and, therefore, is presently unproductive. This area would
have to be reclaimed by leaching operations and chemical treatment (para. 23).
22.       Independent tile drainage networks would serve the above-mentioned
areas. A tile drain would be up to 200 m in length and would generally dis-
charge into the nearby tertiary or secondary surface drain. Only in about
20% of the area, the tile drains would outfall into collector pipes, which
in turn would discharge into the surface drains. Tile drains would be
designed for a specific flow of 0.40 1/sec/ha. Tiles would be of burnt clay
and would have diameters varying from 7 cm to 10 cm. Collector pipes would
be up to 20 cm in diameter. Length of tiles would be 33 cm. Tiles would be
laid in trenches 20 cm wide and 1.5 m to 1.8 m deep, and would be covered
by a 5 cm to 7 cm gravel layer. Spacing of tile drains would vary from 15 m
to 25 m, depending on the soil type.
23.       Reclamation of Salted Land.  The salt content of the water in those
lakes that are to be drained and reclaimed under the project varies from about
2,000 to 18,000 mg/l; the salinity at the bottom of these lakes, therefore,
is quite high. Mostly the salinity is of the saline-alkaline type. Loca-
tion of the salted land (2,650 ha) is shown on Map IBRD 12267; size of the
individual parcels of salted land ranges from about 60 ha to 460 ha, with
a total area of 2,650 ha. Following the dewatering of these lakes, the
drainage system serving this area would be constructed. Until the time the
irrigation system is extended to the salted lands (70 ha in 1978; 1,130 ha
in 1979; and 1,450 ha in 1980), leaching of salts would commence through



ANNEX 4
Page 7
the normal precipitation. With completion of irrigation facilities, a total
of about 10,000 m3 of water per hectare would be applied to the salted area
through 10 to 12 doses. The area would also be scarified, deep-plowed and
levelled.
24.       After about two years of leaching, it is expected that in some
areas (around saline lake fringes) the electrical conductivity of soil would
reduce to 15 millimhos or less and it would become possible to grow some salt
tolerant crops like barley, sorghum and Sudan grass. Over 50% of the area
would also require gypsum treatment at a rate of about 2 tons/ha. It is
estimated that the salted lands would be fully reclaimed in about six years
following commencement of leaching operations, and it would be possible to
grow the normal project crops on this land from 1985.
25.       Drainage of Shallow Depressions.  A total of about 400 shallow de-
pressions, varying in area from 20 ha to 5 ha and with a total area of about
2,500 ha, would be permanently drained and made suitable for irrigated agri-
culture. Presently these depressions get flooded from heavy rains. Some
depressions have slopes steeper than 3%; these would be dressed to milder
grades.
Miscellaneous Works
26.       This category consists of minor works, which are essential for the
success of the project's irrigation and drainage works. Works involving main-
ly earthwork include land levelling and slope correction in parts of the proj-
ect area. Other features are soil erosion control works, observation wells,
relocation of communications and forest boundaries, and facilities required
for operation and maintenance of the project. These are described below.
27.       Land Levelling.  About 40,000 ha, consisting mainly of the area to
be irrigated by furrows (para. 14), would require medium land levelling. The
average quantity of excavation per hectare would be about 460 m3, which would
involve a total earthwork of about 17.0 million m3.
28.       Slope Correction.  In the area to be irrigated by sprinklers, a
number of ridges or low hillocks, with slopes exceeding 3%, exist in about
80,000 ha. Such slopes promote soil erosion and would be flattened to milder
grades as a part of the project, to reduce this tendency. A total excavation
of about 0.8 million m3 would be involved, with average per hectare excava-
tion of about 100 m3.
29.       Soil Erosion Control Works.  In the project area, about 44,700 ha
are affected by soil erosion. In about 38,600 ha, located mostly in the
sandy areas along the northern and eastern project boundaries, erosion is
caused by wind. In the remaining 6,100 ha, located on the steeply sloping
banks of the Lata Sarata Valley, erosion is caused by rainwater runoff.



ANNEX 4
Page 8
Areas affected by wind erosion would be protected by planting two rows of
poplar and cherry trees in shelter belts. These shelter belts would be
aligned perpendicular to the prevalent wind direction. About 133 ha of land
would be occupied by such plantations.
30.       The area (6,100 ha) where erosion is caused by water would be pro-
tected in several ways. These would include planting annual crops in strips
(2,900 ha), overseeding existing pastures (2,170 ha), re-seeding existing
slopes (260 ha) and seeding new slopes (370 ha), planting new pastures (100 ha),
and tree plantations (70 ha). Physical works to protect about 230 ha would
consist of providing catch water drains at the edge of agricultural land and
providing flat berms to break steep slopes. All of these measures would help
to stabilize and protect the sloping land from soil erosion.
31.       Relocation of Communications.  A total length of about 83 km of
regional and village roads would be relocated as a result of the construction
of the irrigation and drainage works, and the formation of rectangular blocks
for irrigation.
32.       Observation Wells.  About 400 wells would be installed in the proj-
ect area to monitor the groundwater levels. These wells would be 15 cm in
diameter and would vary in depth from 5 m to 15 m. They would be located in
those parts of the project area where drainage problems exist, and ground-
water depths are less than 10 m.
33.       Relocation of Forest Boundaries.  There are three main forests with-
in the project boundary with a total area of 2,650 ha. These have an irregular
shape, which complicates the efficient utilization of the surrounding agri-
cultural land under irrigated conditions. The boundaries of these forests
would be adjusted to permit the formation of standard rectangular blocks for
the mechanical movement of lateral pipes for sprinkler irrigation. This would
involve cutting trees in the irregular parts of the forest boundaries and
planting trees in other corners. The cost of this operation is estimated at
Lei 9.4 million (US$0.47 million).
34.       Facilities for Operation and Maintenance.  A number of offices, stores
and warehouses would be constructed under the project, as essential facilities
for its operation and maintenance. These facilities would be used by the
construction forces during the project execution, and by IELIF for the opera-
tion and maintenance of the project.

ROMANIA
IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Water Requirement and Availability
1.        Need for Irrigation.  Annual rainfall in the project area averages
about 550 mm, of which 380 mm (69%) falls during the cropping season. The
minimum rainfall, however, can be as low as 150 mm in the cropping season and
droughts extending over 60 days or more were experienced in 7 years out of 41.
In three consecutive dry years (1949 to 1951), the annual rainfall was less
than 390 mm. Years when there is low rainfall in April and May and which are
preceeded by low precipitation during the winter are not uncommon. Even in a
year of normal rainfall the effective rainfall is less than the crop require-
ments. Irrigation, therefore, is essential if agriculture in the project area
is to be developed to its full potential.
2.        Net Water Requirement.  The net water required for various project
crops were calculated by DIFCA in collaboration with the Agricultural Research
Station at Braila, and the National Institute for Land Improvement of the
Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences. These requirements, after al-
lowing for the effective rainfall available in four out of five years (80%
probability) are given in Table 1. The net water requirement per cropped
hectare, weighted in the ratio of project crops, is estimated at 3,804 m3/ha,
of which the maximum monthly demand would be in July and would amount to
1,160 m3/ha. The net water requirement for the whole project area would
amount to about 587 Mm3, of which 179 Mm3 would be in July.
3.        System Efficiency.  The overall efficiency of the project's irriga-
tion system is estimated at 65%. This is based on efficiencies of 70% for
sprinkler areas and 55% for furrow areas; these are inclusive of the con-
veyance and operational losses.
4.        Gross Water Requirement.  Gross water requirement, at the Danube
river, at 65% efficiency would amount to 5,852 m3/ha, which would be equi-
valent to a total demand of 903 Mm3 during the cropping season. About 275
Mm3 (31%) would be the gross July requirement, which would correspond to a
maximum flow of about 103 m3/sec. Leaching requirement for the saline land
to be reclaimed, and a provision for extension of irrigation to a total of
about 5,900 ha of individual plots of CAP members justify a design of the
main pumping station and the headreach of the main canal for a capacity of
110 m3/sec.
5.        Water Availability.  The project would derive its water supply from
the Danube river which flows close to the eastern boundary of the project
area. The Danube, which drains about 814,000 km2 in central and eastern



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Europe, is a reliable source of water. It carries high discharges (6,000 to
13,000 m3/sec) between March and July and lower flows (2,000 to 6,000 m3/sec)
during the rest of the year. Typical flow patterns of the Danube river at
the Iron Cates, about 500 km upstream of the Floating Pumping Station for
three years (representing a typical wet, normal and dry year), are illustrated
in Chart 15360(R). The project's maximum water requirement of 110 m3/sec
(para. 4) would be in the month of July, when the Danube river flow is seldom
below 5,000 m3/sec. Water supply for the project's irrigation system, there-
fore, is quite assured.
6.        Water Quality.  The Danube water is potable and of good quality for
irrigation. Tests made during the past few years, on samples collected up-
stream of the Floating Pumping Station, classify the Danube water as C2S1. It
contains about 330 mg/l of total suspended solid and has a pH value of 7.65, a
conductivity of 630 millimhos and an SAR of 0.75.
7.        Water Rights.  The Danube is an international river with Romania,
Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Federal Republic of Germany and
Bulgaria as major riparians. Romania is the largest riparian, and also the
last country through which the Danube river flows before entering the Black
Sea. There is no international agreement between the riparian states for the
use of the Danube waters, but the international Water Commission for the Danube
river, of which Romania is a member, looks after the interests of its member
countries in respect of navigation and water quality. This Commission is
mainly concerned with such schemes which might interfere with either the
river's navigability or its water quality. Maximum diversion for the proj-
ect, being about 2% of the minimum river flow in July, would not affect naviga-
tion and therefore would not concern the Commission.
8.        Under Romanian procedures, a large water development project must
receive a clearance from the National Water Council, which manages all water
resources in Romania, before its construction can commence. This Council
has approved the use of Danube water for this project.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Farm Budgets and Recovery of Project Costs
A. Farm Budgets
1.        All workers in the IASs are employees of the State and are paid in
accordance with the national wage scales for comparable labor. The normal
salary for unskilled farm worker amounts to about Lei 1,200 (US$60.00) per
month. Each active member of CAPs is presently guaranteed a remuneration of
about Lei 1,000 (US$50.00) per month which is paid only if planned production
is achieved 1/. This remuneration is in line with Government wage scale for
comparable labor in the IASs and throughout the economy 2/. The project,
therefore, would have little direct influence on incomes to active members of
CAPs and wages to employees of IASs. The remunerations can change only when
the Government revises its national wage scales because the Romanian socio-
economic system guards against wide disparity in income to workers of similar
skill through the country. This, however, is unlikely to affect cooperators'
participation in the project because failure to work properly according to
Government established "norms" may involve (a) forfeiture of pay or a reduc-
tion in salary; (b) loss of supplementary wage for over fulfillment of plans;
and (c) loss of rights to individual plots.
2.        Although the project is not expected to have a significant direct
impact on wages to cooperative members, it would raise the incomes of the
farm units by about 200%. Farm budgets have been prepared for two coopera-
tives, CAP I (Table 1) and CAP II (Table 2), which were selected as typical
samples from among the 48 project cooperatives. The following assumptions
were made while preparing these farm budgets:
(a) Cropping Pattern and Yields. The present cropping pattern
is the same as that which actually exists in the CAPs, and
the present yields represent 5-year average for the project
area. The future cropping pattern, and yields would be the
same as for the project area (Annex 1, Table 2).
1/   This policy became effective in January 1976.  See Hotarirea Marri
Adunari Nationale Nr. 23/1975 (Official Bulletin of State Council,
December 9, 1975).
2/   The cooperators supplement their salaries with incomes from individual
plots, which are given to each active member for personal use.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(b) Annual Production Costs. Annual production costs, both
present and future with the project, are given for all
project costs in Table 3. These do not include water
charges and amortization on loans. Labor costs have been
excluded from the production costs. Prices of inputs are
in Table 4.
(c) Labor. The entire demand for labor would be supplied by
members, and no labor would be hired. Underemployment is
currently prevalent and the expected additional demand for
labor, in the future with the project, would be supplied
by the members.
(d) Prices. CAP contract prices which are used to evaluate
outputs are in Annex 3, Table 1.
(e) Water Charges. Under current Romanian law, a nominal water
charge is levied on all cooperative and State farms that
use irrigation water. It consists of (i) a fixed annual
charge per hectare, which is levied on the basis of crop
sown; and (ii) a variable charge of Lei 18 (US$0.90) per
1,000 m3, which is levied on the basis of volume of water
used. The scale of the fixed annual charge is given below:
Crop                               Annual Charge
(Lei/ha)           (US$/ha)
Field Crops                        138                 6.90
Vegetables                         190                 9.50
Fruits                             122                 6.10
Forage                             183                 9.15
On the basis of the project's cropping pattern and the
volume of water expected to be consumed, the total annual
water charge is estimated at about Lei 220 (US$11.00) per
ha.
(f) Amortization of Loans. Investment cost, representing the
cost of distribution pipelines and mobile irrigation equip-
ment that would serve cooperative lands, is estimated at
about Lei 780.0 million (US$39.0 million); this would be
transferred to CAPs. Of this cost, about 30% would be con-
tributed by CAPs through their Development Funds and the
remaining 70% would be treated as BAFI loans to the CAPs.
Repayment of such loans has been annualized over the as-
sumed project life of 40 years at 3% per annum.

4.        The farm budgets indicate that, after project charges, farm income
to CAP I would increase by about 220% and to CAP II by about 170%. These
budgets, therefore, depict an average increase in the farm income of project
area CAPs of about 200%. Normally, at least 18% of the farm income is alloc-
ated to the Development Fund, and at most 82% to the Consumption Fund (Annex 2).
However, these percentages can be altered by the General Assembly of the CAPs
to keep the personal incomes of the members in line with incomes of comparable
labor in other sectors of the economy. As a result, the incremental Consump-
tion Fund is not necessarily distributed to the members as remuneration. All
risks associated with the project would be borne entirely by the coopera-
tives rather than by the members, and corresponding returns to risk and
entrepreneurship would also accrue to the farm units.

B. Recovery of Project Costs
Costs
5.        Investment.  Government would finance all project investments
initially, but would transfer the cost of distribution pipe and mobile
irrigation equipment serving CAP lands to the concerned cooperatives. Of
this cost, estimated at about Lei 780.0 million (US$39.0 million), excluding
price contingencies, about 30% would be contributed by the CAPs through their
Development Fund. The remaining Lei 546.0 million (US$27.3 million) would
be treated as BAFI loans to CAPs and would be recovered in accordance with
existing on-lending terms of BAFI, which are satisfactory. Similarly, the
cost of farm machinery, amounting to about Lei 151.2 million (US$7.6 mil-
lion) without price contingencies would be chargeable to AMEs. This cost
would be financed through the State budget and recovered through unit rates
charged by the AMEs for rendering mechanization services. Of the remaining
investment (excluding price contingencies) of Lei 2,857.0 million (US$142.8
million), Lei 2,080.0 million (US$104.0 million) would be chargeable to the
CAPs and Lei 777.0 million (US$38.8 million) to IASs.
6.        Operation and Maintenance.  The annual operation and maintenance
cost of project facilities would amount to about Lei 198.0 million (US$9.9
million) (Annex 6, Table 3). About Lei 158.4 million (US$7.92 million)
would be chargeable to CAPs and the remaining Lei 39.6 million (US$1.98
million) to IASs. The entire cost would be financed through the State budget.
Recovery of Costs
7.        According to existing procedures in Romania, the only direct mechan-
ism for recovering project costs is through a nominal water charge which would
amount to about Lei 220 (US$11.00) per ha. This would yield a total annual
revenue of about Lei 33.9 million (US$1.7 million) beginning with project
year 10 (1985), and lesser amounts before that year. The present value of
these recoveries, over assumed project life of 40 years in constant 1976
prices and discounted at 10%, is estimated at about Lei 230.0 million
(US$11.5 million). This would recover only about 17% of the operation and
maintenance cost of the project, and would result in Cost Recovery Index
of about 6%. Details about the streams of costs and recoveries are in
Table 5.
8.        The direct recoveries underestimate the revenues which would
accrue to the Government as a result of the project. In addition to
water charges, the State would recover project costs indirectly through
(a) IASs' contribution to the Depreciation Fund (Annex 2); (b) annual
profits made by the IASs on their operations, a part of which is credited
to the State Treasury (Annex 2); (c) profits made by the State by buying
tradeable commodities at the administered low farmgate prices and export-
ing them at much higher world prices; (d) net returns from investments of

CAPs' Development Funds which are deposited with BAFI; and (e) general
linkage benefits to the economy resulting from the additional output
under the project.
9.        Because of the socio-economic system in Romania, price of irri-
gation water has little or no direct resource allocative or income dis-
tributive effect in the country. The low water charge, which is in line
with the generally low prices of inputs and outputs, is unlikely to result
in wasteful use of irrigation water because decision on the volume and
timing of irrigation water application is made by Government agencies
according to the recommendations of the concerned technical institutes.
Furthermore, the price of water can change only with a general revision
of agricultural prices. Therefore, no increase in water charge is essen-
tial and recommended.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Accounts and Audit
A. Project Accounts
1.        The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) would keep sep-
arate accounts for all expenditures related to the project. Project invest-
ment funds to be financed from State budget would be transferred quarterly
to BAFI by the Ministry of Finance for disbursements.
B. Audit and Control System in Romania
2.        To support its highly centralized decision-making process, Romania
has an elaborate control and audit system designed to keep the managers of
the economy advised on the progress of, and deviations from, planned activ-
ities. This control system has three major objectives: (i) to audit ac-
counts to ensure accurate financial status; (ii) to determine that resources
are being used in accordance with national plans; and (iii) to recommend de-
sirable changes in resource use.
3.        The system is organized like a pyramid.  At the top is the Court of
Superior Control, while at the bottom are accountants who check and approve
routine transactions at the enterprise level. The numerous organizations
perform either "Internal Control" or "External Control". These controls can
further be divided into two broad categories: the preliminary control which
covers day-to-day transactions; and the posterior control which resembles
annual audits. Thus an enterprise, during a period of one year, is inspected
by (i) its own chief accounts; (ii) the internal controller, who reports both
to the general manager of t:he Central and Minister concerned; (iii) inspec-
tors from the financing banks, who report to the Ministry of Finance; (iv)
controllers from the Ministry of Finance; and (v) inspectors from the Court
of Superior control.
Internal Control System
4.        Preliminary Control.  The chief accountant at each commercial unit
is responsible for checking and approving all financial transactions. He re-
ports directly to the General Manager of the Unit and reports disagreements
to the manager of the supervising unit. To ensure the objectivity and inde-
pendence of the chief accotntant, he is nominated by the supervising unit or
the Ministry concerned and cannot be changed by the management of the unit
he audits.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
5.        Posterior Control.  This is performed by special "Internal Control
Units" at least once a year for all enterprises, unless specifically exempted
by the Ministry of Finance. Such exemptions are given to very small units
which are audited once every 2-3 years. The audit involves a check of 14
items listed in Law No. 5 of 1970. Some of the checks are:
-    Inventory:  quantity, quality and value
-    Payments, receipts, etc.:  their accuracy and validity
-    Documents:  e.g. orders, checks
-    Entries in accounting books:  their conformity to the
rules of the Ministry of Finance
-    Status of assets and liabilities:  actual vs. book entries;
and
-    Techno-economic indicators:  e.g. productivity, input/output
ratios, etc. and their accuracy.
External Control System
6.        This audit function is performed by organizations outside the op-
erational units such as banks, Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior
Control.  This also involves preliminary and posterior controls.  The prelim-
inary audit is performed by inspectors in each Ministry (or bank) and the
posterior audit by controllers from the Court of Superior Control.
7.        Four banks (BAFI, Investment Bank, Foreign Trade Bank and the Na-
tional Bank) monitor the "economic" use of investments in sectors they fi-
nance. These banks comment extensively on the desirability of an investment
before it is approved by the State, and supervise and certify the appropri-
ateness of investment work before releasing payments against supplies. Their
field branches exercise control on day-to-day transactions.
8.        The Ministry of Finance oversees the work of all ministries.
Through its own controllers and by reviewing the reports of the Internal Con-
trollers, it ensures that actual performance conforms to the annual plan ap-
proved for each Ministry, and that the accounts of the Ministry and the Cen-
trals/Enterprises under it are maintained properly. The Finance Ministry re-
ports its findings to the Council of Ministers. Any expenditures exceeding
the allocation in the annual plans approved for a Ministry/Central must be
evaluated by the Finance Ministry and approved by the Council of Ministers.
9.        The Court of Superior Control controls the main State bodies in
Romania such as banks and the Ministry of Finance. It reports directly to
the President of Romania. To perform its function, it receives the follow-
ing reports regularly:



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(i) quarterly reports from BAFI and other banks on their
financial status;
(ii) Finance Ministry's audit reports; and
(iii) annual internal control reports from each Ministry,
including recommendations made by Internal Controllers.
The court prepares its report annually and recommends on possibilities of
improving the economic use of resources. It also coordinates the overall
control system and ensures that there is no waste or duplication, and acts
as the counsellor of the State Council.
Conclusion
iO.       The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are
quite strict and satisfactory. The continuous audit of different organiza-
tions involved in project implementation would ensure that project funds,
including those which would be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan,
wolild be used properly.

IALOMITA-CALMATUI IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. General
1.        The choice of this irrigation project is based on the principle of
efficient resource utilization rather than as a means for distributing income
to the project farmers. The socio-political system of Romania has income dis-
tribution mechanisms, which would pass on the project benefits to a much wider
segment of its population instead of only the project farmers.
2.        The total cost of the project, excluding farm machinery and price
contingencies, is estimated at about Lei 3,568 million (US$178.40 million).
This is equivalent to about Lei 25,410 (US$1,270) per ha or Lei 61,500
(US$3,075) per farmer. The project would provide permanent facilities to
irrigate 146,300 ha net, but includes on-farm equipment for 140,400 ha.
Project benefits have been computed from 140,400 ha only. Its main benefits
would be to increase the volume of agricultural production in the project area
by about 210% and to raise labor productivity by about 250% from Lei 12,400
(US$620) to Lei 43,400 (US$2,170). The annual net value of crop production,
at border prices of inputs and outputs, would increase by about 160% from Lei
530 million (US$26.5 million) to Lei 1,350 million (US$67.5 million). The
project would also help to reduce instability in agricultural production
caused by frequent shortages of rainfall, ensure additional supply of raw
materials to forward-linked industrial enterprises and the livestock sub-
sector, earn and save foreign exchange which could help to reduce balance
of payments deficits and/or provide additional supply of convertible currency
to the industrial sector, and would eventually help to raise national income
and real wages. Thus, the direct and indirect benefits of the project on
the economy would be substantial, and these benefits would be obtained at
moderate costs and low risks.
B. Economic Rate of Return
3.        The economic rate of return on the project investment, based on
quantifiable benefits, is estimated at about 16.3%. No separate rate of
return on investment in drainage works has been computed, as these works
are nct independent of the irrigation works. Cost and benefit streams are
calculated over an assumed project life of 40 years (Table 1). Other as-
sumptions made in computing the rate of return are summarized below:



ANNEX 11

(a)  Implementation Schedule.  Construction of irrigation and
drainage works would start in 1977; project works would
be completed in 1981. Irrigation would commence in 1979
on 22,700 ha, and would cover 71,900 ha in 1980, 106,800 ha
in 1981 and the full 140,400 ha in 1982. Corresponding
areas cropped under irrigation are summarized below and
detailed in Table 2. Area under rainfed cultivation, du-
ring the period of irrigation introduction, is in Table 3.

/1  These areas are those which start yielding benefits following completion
of leaching operations.
(b)  Investment Costs.  Investment costs (schedule of expendi-
ture in Annex 6, Table 2) have been estimated using
December 1976 prices. The economic cost streams exclude:
(i)  price contingencies; because all inputs and outputs
are evaluated in constant prices, and relative prices
are assumed to remain unchanged over the life of the
project;
(ii)  cost of farm machinery, because this is reflected in
the annual production cost of mechanization services;
and
(iii)  salvage value of construction equipment, estimated at
about Lei 260 million (US$ 13.0 million).

(c) Cropping Pattern and Yields. The present and future without
project cropping pattern and output is given in Table 4. With
the project, cropped area would increase by about 17,500 ha
due to an increase in the cropping intensity (13,940 ha), and
reclamation of previously unproductive land (3,560 ha).
Future cropping pattern and yields are given in Annex 1,
Table 2. Peak yields from any given area would be obtained
four years following commencement of irrigation in incre-
ments of 30%, 70%, 90% and 100%. However, full benefits
from all project land would not be obtained until 1986,
seven years following commencement of irrigation. The
projected yields and their development period are based
on actual experiences in other irrigation projects in the
region. Development of output in future with project is in
Table 5, and value of output without and with project is in
Table 6.
(d) Prices of Outputs. Output prices which are used for economic
analysis are in Annex 3, Table 1.
(e) Prices of Non-labor Inputs. Prices of inputs are in Annex 9,
Table 4. Non-tradeables (seeds and transport, machinery and
miscellaneous services) have been evaluated using domestic
farmgate prices, and tradeables (mainly fertilizer) using
border price equivalents. Domestic prices of fertilizer were
increased by 200% to reflect their real resource costs to the
economy.
(f) Shadow Wage Rate. Labor, which mostly consists of the old and
unskilled, is presently underemployed with little opportunity
of employment outside of agriculture. Because of an expected
increase in demand for labor with the project and of the de-
clining trend in the agricultural labor force, underemployment
could decline to an equivalent of about 20% of supply by late
1980s. For this reason, the shadow wage rate has been assumed
at about 80% of the official salary for unskilled farm workers
in both the future without and with project.
(g) Annual Production Costs. Annual costs of production based on
border price equivalents of inputs are detailed in Tables 7
and 8.
(h) Operation and Maintenance Costs. Annual costs of operation and
maintenance are detailed in Annex 6, Table 3.

C. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
4.        Risk.  The risk of investment in the project is low.  Design of
the project has been prepared in detail, and the Government has well organized
and coordinated plans to supply the necessary manpower and materials to com-
plete construction by 1981. Usually, in Romania project construction is com-
pleted within the time specified by Government, and cost overruns are rare.
5.        The projected crop yields are comparable to or lower than average
yields obtained from other irrigation projects in the region. Government has
satisfactory plans to provide farmers in the project area with timely and
adequate supply of complementary inputs and services which would be necessary
to achieve project objectives. Farm workers are expected to participate in
the project fully because failure to do so according to recommended cultural
practices would involve severe financial penalties.
6.        Sensitivity Analysis.  Results of sensitivity tests, under various
assumptions, are compared with the basic rate of return in the table below:
Economic
Assumption                                                        Rate of Return
=()
Basic Run                                                             16.3
Investment Cost increased by 15%                                      14.6
Project Benefits reduced by 20%                                       12.0
Investment Cost increased by 15% and
Benefits reduced by 20%                                             10.6
The economic rate of return is more elastic with respect to changes in project
benefits compared to changes in investment costs. Even if the project benefits
are reduced by 20%, the ERR would remain satisfactory at about 12%.
