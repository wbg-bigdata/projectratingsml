PETROLEUM PROJECT
I.   THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Policies
1.01     Colombia is rich in energy resources, particularly in
hydroelectricity and coal. Its reserves of oil and natural gas are modest by
international standards, yet significant at the national level. Its
recoverable coal reserves are estimated at 10 billion tons (4,6oo MMTOE).  Its
hydropower potential is estimated at 100 GW which could yield some 440 TWh
(equaling about 110 MMTOE) per year or 5500 MMTOE over 50 years. Gas reserves
of 4.07 TCF (121 MMTOE) representing 30 years of present production, are small
in comparison, as are the oil reserves of 734 million Bbl (102 MMTOE),
representing 13 years of present production:

a/ Recoverable
The table shows that there is an imbalance between reserves and production for
different sources of energy. For example, the huge reserves of
hydroelectricity and coal contribute only 25% and 12% respectively to annual
production while the rather modest gas and oil reserves contribute 22% and 41%
respectively to annual production. Rational use of Colombia's energy
resources would focus on a gradual, long-term shift of production demand from
oil to coal and hydroelectricity and it is current government policy to
emphasize further hydropower and coal developments. However, in the medium-
and short-term there is an urgent need to increase recovery rates of existing
hydrocarbon reserves and discover new ones. The hydrocarbon sector is
discussed in Chapter II.
1.02     Colombia's coal resources are very substantial even on international
scale, with recoverable reserves estimated at some 10 billion tons, of which
only about 20% can be classified as measured. At present rates of domestic
utilization, reserves would last two thousand years. In view of the magnitude
of reserves, it is the Government's policy to encourage domestic consumption
of coal to substitute for natural gas and for fuel oil, and to promote coal
exports, particularly from those deposits located near the Atlantic Coast.
Coal production grew at about 7% per annum on average over the 1970s to reach



- 2 -
a Level of about 5 million tons in 1983. Production came from about 400 small
and medium-scale mines, virtually all of which are non-mechanized, run by the
private sector and located in Central Colombia.  More than half the production
and consumption of coal is concentrated in the highlands near Bogota. Sixty
percent of all coal is consumed by industry, and most of the rest by the power
sector. Residential consumption and exports represent only a small share of
total output. A major coal development project under way in the north of the
country and 150 km from the shore will increase the production capacity by 15
million tons of coal per annum at the end of this decade; the full output will
be exported. 1/ Colombian coal is bituminous, of high calorific value
(mostly over 6,000 kcal/kg) and with low sulphur content (mostly less than
1%). All of the coal consumed domestically by the cities in the center of the
country is produced in Central Colombia. Some of this coal possesses coking
properties. In 1983, domestic coal prices, which are freely set by market
forces, typically ranged between US$25 and US$35 per ton delivered to the
large consumers in the industrial centers of Bogota, Medellin or Cali. This
is below international prices, but high internal transport costs imposed by
distance to ports and difficult terrain all but rule out the export potential
of coal from the interior of the country.
1.03     Colombia's hydroelectric potential, at about 100 GW, is amongst the
largest in the world. The country has made strides in developing this
potential (hydroelectric power generation grew at about 10% per annum during
the 1970s), and total installed hydro-capacity at present is 4 GW.
Hydroelectric plants currently represent about 70% of total electric power
generation and 80% of the installed capacity, and thermal plants the
balance. The largest part of the thermal capacity is located on the northern
coast, where hydro potential is limited, but where there is abundant coal and
natural gas. The rapid expansion of the hydro-system continues due to its low
cost and plants now under construction will virtually double capacity by 1988.
However, the optimal mix of hydro, coal and gas-fired plants needs to be
determined in order to take advantage of the projected increased supply of
coal and the existing availability of a natural gas surplus. This matter is
curtently studied by the Government.
1.04     Other energy forms are geothermal energy, which has understandably
received only little attention in view of all the other rich energy sources,
and firewood which remains an important energy source as primary household
fuel.
National Energy Study
1.05     To assemble relevant base material on the energy sector and to
develop energy options, the Government has undertaken a major effort to
improve sector knowledge through a National Energy Study (ENE), which
1/       The project is a joint venture of CARBOCOL, the national coal
production company, and INTERCOR, an Exxon subsidiary. The project
cost is currently estimated at US$3.2 billion.



was carried out between 1979 and 1982 by the National Planning Department
(DNP) with the help of local consultants and technical assistance from UNDP
and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The study came up with the
following major energy options:
(a) a further increase in the proposed leveL of hydrocarbon
exploration by private companies and ECOPETROL, and a pricing
policy for petroleum products, which will allow ECOPETROL to
finance from internal sources a larger share of its investment
program;
(b) adoption of energy conservation policies, particularly in the
transport sector, aimed at reducing growth in consumption of
liquid fuels;
(c) selection of a variety of energy substitution programs and
policies, especially in the residential and industrial sectors,
and to a lesser extent in the transport sector, through use of
hydroelectric power, coal, gas, and renewables in place of
petroleum products;
(d) production of liquid fuels from gas, coal, and biomass
resources;
(e) the undertaking of additional coal export projects and
development and exports of uranium and natural gas derivatives
(methanol and LNG);
(f) filling rural energy needs through renewables and expansion of
rural electrification.
1.06     This study provides significant information needed for energy
planning; it includes a preliminary evaluation of energy demand growth and of
investments that could best serve such growth. However, much work remains to
be done, particularly in the selection of alternative energy sources. The
following studies related to the ENE are now about to commence, part of which
will be financed by foreign technical assistance; particularly the Federal
Republic of Germany will be providing assistance on modeling and data
gathering, France on industrial energy savings, Italy on rural
electrification, and the OAS on energy use in transportation. Several energy
sector agencies and the Ministry of Public Works will provide counterpart
staff and DNP will coordinate the external assistance.
Financing of the Energy Sector
1.07     Over the past five years, CoLombia has been reasonably successful in
mobilizing external resources to finance energy development. This has been
achieved through direct private foreign investments (in oil exploration and
production and lately in coal) and external loans to the energy agencies,
including power companies and the National Electricity Development Bank
(FEN). However, the current large debt of Latin American countries makes it
difficult for Colombia to mobilize additional external long-term funds. Local
financing requirements are covered by internally generated resources and
Government contributions, with the incipient local capital markets providing



- 4-
to date only a marginal share of the financing. In order to increase internal
resource mobilization by the main agencies dealing in the energy sector, oil
prices and electricity tariffs have been increased significantly in real
terms; domestic prices of oil products are now broadly at the international
level, which is adequate. In all, despite the recent achievements, mobilizing
the financial resources required for the energy sector will require continuous;
efforts by the Government; at the same time, energy sector investments offer
excellent avenues at present to improve Colombia's balance of payment position
in the medium and long-term.
Conclusions
1.08     The main issue in Colombia's energy sector is the investment
priority, which will be addressed by the current studies being undertaken by
the Government. Investments in coal and hydropower are priority, but long-
term. Investments in gas are uncertain due to lack of a streng market.
Investments in oil are priority in the short-term, in particular in
exploration to increase reserves, and in production and refining to lower
imports. Together with ECOPETROL, the private sector has strongly
participated in the oil investments (exploration and production under
association contracts) in the past and is expected to do so in the future.

II.   THE HYDROCARBON SECTOR
Overview
2.01     Colombia is a mature petroleum province which has been relatively
well explored; it has exported considerable quantities of crude oil starting
in the 1920's. However, policies pursued during the 1960s and the early 1970s
contributed to a deteriorating oil situation.  Prices to consumers and
producers were kept artificially low, thus promoting consumption and dampening
incentives for development of new reserves.  Since 1976, the country has been
a net importer of petroleum products, with adverse repercussions on the
national balance of payments. Since then, the Government has gradually taken
the steps required to (i) limit the domestic use of liquid fuels by increasing
consumer prices to adequate levels (internal prices were increased by more
than threefold in real terms between 1974 and 1980, and, lately, have
fluctuated around the international prices); (ii) attract foreign investors
to explore in Colombia by increasing the producer price to international
levels for newly discovered oil; (iii) encourage the concession holding
companies to pursue an aggressive drilling program by increasing the producer
price for newly produced oil; (iv) mobilize the financing required for
increased production from new fields and old fields by enhanced oil recovery
schemes; and (v) encourage substitution of petroleum products by other forms
of energy, where appropriate. These policies have yielded significant
results. Consumption growth of petroleum products was only about half of GNP
growth from 1979 to 1981, whereas it was higher than GNP growth from 1975 to
1977. Since 1979 accelerated exploration has increased recoverable reserves
by about 343 million barrels, and production has increased by an average 7%
p.a., from 123.4 MBD in 1979 to 152 MBD in 1983. Further pursuit of these
policies may make Colombia self-sufficient in hydrocarbons in the 1990s.
Institutional Aspects
2.02     The central authority responsible for the development of petroleum
resources in Colombia is the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The Ministry is in
charge of all policy matters and of the overall organization and
administration of the sector. The National Planning Department (DNP) reviews,
and the interministerial committee CONPES approves major hydrocarbon
investments which require foreign financing. The Empresa Colombiana de
Petroleos (ECOPETROL), a state-owned company, was established in 1948, and
started operations in 1951, by operating the concession fields and the
refinery that reverted from an oil company to Colombia after the expiration
of the concession. It plays an active role in exploration, production and
refining (Chapter III). ECOPETROL is the main executing arm of the Government
in the hydrocarbon sector.
2.03     In February 1984, as many as 42 exploration/production contracts with
about 25 foreign and local oil companies were active in Colombia. Thirty two
of these contracts involved exploration, six production, and five exploration
and production. The companies include majors such as Exxon and Texaco;
independents like Occidental and Houston Oil and Gas; a European company - Elf
Aquitaine; many smaller companies such as Louisiana Land and Exploration and
PETROCOL, a Colombian company which received assistance from IFC.



- 6 -
2.04     The local service industry is reasonably well developed and ECOPETROL
contracts it frequently in particular concerning detailed engineering design.
drilling/workover services and assembling of certain oil field equipment in
Colombia using foreign technology through joint foreign/local partnerships.
Petroleum Geology and Exploration
2.05     Colombia's prospective sedimentary areas cover 586,000 km2, and are
divided into 12 basins of unequal size and prospectiveness (Annex 2.2).
Eleven of these basins have recognized hydrocarbon source and reservoir rocks
with adequate traps usually of the structural type (anticlines and/or
faults). Jurassic and particularly cretaceous shales are usually considered
to be source rocks of the oils trapped in overlying reservoirs. The Upper Rio
Magdalena Valley, the Middle Magdalena Valley and the Llanos Orientales basins
are considered the most prospective (see map IBRD 18402). Colombia's geology
is described at Annex 2.1.
2.06     Colombia's history of petroleum activity dates back to the early
1900's. So far, nearly 900 exploratory wells have been drilled in 11 of the
sedimentary basins (Annex 2.2). This resulted in the discovery of recoverable
reserves of about 3 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of gas of
which 618 million barrels of oil and most of the gas remained to be produced
as of December 1982 (Table 2.2 and Annex 2.3). Taking into account production
during 1983, new discoveries (Elf, Occidental) and secondary recovery reserves
from Casabe (70 million Bbl), total recoverable reserves at December 31, 1983
are estimated at 734 million barrels (Annex 2.3). On average, Colombia's
exploratory efforts have resulted in a ratio of one commercial well discovery
for nine dry wells or an overall success ratio of 10% which is favorable
compared to many other countries. At the 1983 rate of production (150 MBD),
the reserve/production ratio for oil is 13 years which is somewhat Low, but
better than the 10.5 in 1979. The upper, middle and lower Magdalena valLey
have been explored most as shown in Annex 2.2. However, there is scope for
additional exploratory work, particularly in the Cauca, Sabana de Bogota, and
Amazona basins. ECOPETROL is promoting these and all other basins actively to
the! international oil industry (para. 2.14).
Contractual Aspects of Oil Exploration
2.07     Historically, the legal framework governing oil exploration in
Colombia was of the concession type, where the exploration period was three
years (with a possible 3-year extension), and the production period 30
years. The concessionaire was 100% owner of the oil produced, and had to pay
royalties (initially 14.5% - later 20%) and income tax. In 1969, a new legal
framework was introduced - the association contract - and since 1974, no new
concession contracts have been entered into. There are still 16 concession
contracts in effect which will expire, for the most part, in the 1990's.
2.08     The association contracts provide the Government, through ECOPETROL,
with the possibility of a significant involvement in the venture, in the event
of a commercial discovery, without the obligation to incur the necessarily
rislky exploration expenditures. The main features of the association
contracts are: (i) an exploration period of up to 6 years, and a production
period of 22 years; (ii) companies are allowed to choose areas without
limitations as to the size, shape, or location, and to propose to ECOPETROL



-7 -
the terms and conditions regarding the mileage of seismic profiles to be run
during the first year and the number of exploration wells to be drilled during
the second and third years on which agreement needs to be reached; (iii)
companies bear the exploration risk, but in the case of commercial
discoveries, ECOPETROL reimburses the companies for 50% of the cost of the
discovery well out of future production and pays in cash 50% of the subsequent
development and operating costs; (iv) technical control of the operations is
agreed to between the parties, and the operator may be either ECOPETROL or the
partner, but is normally the partner; (v) during exploitation of the contract
areas, the operator must deliver to GOC, through ECOPETROL, a royalty
amounting to 20% of the liquid hydrocarbons and gas produced in the area; the
rest of the oil and gas produced is owned by the partners on a 50/50 basis;
(vi) exports are allowed only after domestic requirements are met; and (vii)
apart from the 20% royalty and the sharing on a 50/50 basis of the balance of
production, companies only pay taxes in accordance with the General Tax Code
applicable to all companies who are not concession holders; such tax
regulations allow amortization of intangible drilling costs (20% per annum)
and depreciation of tangibles over the "useful Life" of the investment.
2.09     Since 1976, the Government has also increased producer crude oil
prices to provide adequate incentives for exploration and production. Until
1975, crude oil was priced domestically at US$1.60/Bbl. Since 1976, however,
association contracts provide that for "new" discoveries, ECOPETROL will
purchase crude oil at the C.I.F. Cartagena price for similar crudes. In the
case of fields that were under production at that time ("old" or "basic" oil),
there is now a price for "base" crude (production following the normal decline
of specific fields) and for "incremental" crude (production in addition to the
normal decline). The price of base crude is about US$5-7/Bbl and adjusted
annually wi,:h inflation indices, while the price of incremental crude is
calculated according to a formula, reflecting the ratio of incremental over
basic crude production and the international price, but cannot exceed 50% of
the international price of crude oil. It is set to allow the firm to attain a
discounted rate of return on the investment of about 20-25% (Ministerial
resolution 058 of May 1980). The incremental price incentive system has
helped reduce the natural decline in the production of those fields to 5-6%
since 1976 compared to 6-9% from 1971 to 1976.
2.10     In 1975, The Government also revised the payment clauses which then
resulted in sales of crude oil at exchange rates which were 20-35% below the
official rates. Foreign companies continue to receive 25% of payments in
local currency and 75% in US$ outside of Colombia, but these are now converted
at official exchange rates. Moreover, the scope for profit remittances abroad
(particularly those resulting from discoveries of natural gas) was improved.

2.11     In all, the new financial/contractual framework has been successful
iln attracting private investors as the following table indicates (although
exploration activity declined in 1983 in line with the world-wide trend):

Similarly, the annual average of exploratory wells drilled had declined
sharply from about 34 during 1961-1969 to about 20 during 1970-1974 and
further down to about 16 during 1975/76.  However, a sharp increase in
exploration has taken place since then, after price increases for association
crude was announced (para. 2.09):
Number of Exploratory Wells Drilled
1977   1978    1979   1980   1981   1982   1983   Total          Yearly Average
20     26       29      59    100      75      37    346            49
The decline in number of exploratory wells drilled from 100 in 1981 to 75 in
1982 is mainly due to the average higher cost per well in the Llanos area
which was the main focus of exploration in 1982 when exploration expenditures
increased slightly over those in 1981. The increased exploration activity
since 1979 has resulted in an increase in recoverable reserves by about 343
million barrels (or nearly 53%) over the five-year period 1979-83. The recent
discoveries in Apiay (operator ECOPETROL), Cano Limon (Occidental), Casanare
(Elf), Cocorna (Texaco), and Castilla (Chevron) have also contributed to stir
industry interest in exploring in Colombia.
Exploration and Production Strategy
2.12     Concerning accelerated promotion of exploration, the Government has
turned to private international oil companies, while at the same time allowing
ECOPETROL to explore in certain areas with its own resources (Annex 2.5).
ECOPETROL's exploration program will concentrate on areas in the vicinity of
its producing fields where the geology is reasonably well known. In addition,
ECOPETROL is carrying out seismic surveys part of which it uses to promote
acreage to private industry. As a result, ECOPETROL has accumulated large
quantities of exploration data which are likely to stimulate additional
exploration interest by private oil companies. Foreign companies are
exploring the less known areas, which carry a higher exploration risk, but
where the financial rewards will be competitive in relation to
contractual/financial conditions elsewhere. In particular, the execution of
the proposed Llanos pipelines (para. 2.22) is expected to spur industry
interest in that area, given the considerable reduction in transport costs.



- 9-
Moreover, ECOPETROL has recently embarked, for the first time, on an important
promotional effort towards the oil industry. It has prepared an audio-visual
program on Colombia's geology and its legal/fiscal framework for presentation
to the oil industry in seminars in May 1984. ECOPETROL anticipates that
foreign companies will invest some US$450 million in exploration in Colombia
over the 1984-88 period, more than double its own budget of about
US$200 million. These investments should result in the discovery of about
150 MMB recoverable reserves in the medium term. In conclusion, the
exploration strategy is balanced and reasonable.
2.13     As of December 31, 1982 recoverable reserves were estimated at 618
MMB (Table 2.2). During 1983 average production was 150 MBD. In 1983
ECOPETROL had 46% of recoverable reserves of oil and also 46% of production.
This compares with 29% of reserves and 13% of production for associations
which are relatively new and where the fields are not yet fully developed, and
27% of reserves and 41% of production for concessions which represent much
older fields which are fully developed.

2.14     To increase production, ECOPETROL has embarked on a program of
increased recovery from existing fields through infill and step out drilling
and application of enhanced oil recovery techniques (and the project would
assist in these efforts).  It has carried out an enhanced oil recovery scheme
(EOR) in its La Cira fields and is planning to carry out the Casabe EOR scheme
to be financed under the project. Texaco is carrying out an EOR scheme in
Cocorna field under association contract, also to be financed under the
project. However, there is an estimated additional potential for EOR of
another 200 MMB from existing fields, half of which from ECOPETROL's own
fields and the other half from fields under concessions. ECOPETROL and the
private oil companies are studying the potential for EOR and at least one
major concessionaire is actively considering implementation of an EOR scheme
in its fields.
Production and Consumption of Crude Oil
2.15     Crude oil production declined throughout the 1970's, from 218.1 MBD
in 1970 to 124.1 MBD in 1979, or an average decline of 6% per annum.  Since
1980, however the trend has been reversed, in part because of the new policies
introduced since 1975 regarding pricing (para. 2.09) and payment provisions,
and production has increased from 124.4 MBD in 1980 to 152.0 MBD (taking
account of 2 MBD apparent inventory drawdowns) in 1983, an average increase oi
7% per annum. Despite this turnaround, Colombia still remains a net importer
of oil:

The balance of payment impact of oil imports is considerabLy understated in
the above table as Colombia imports high value products (essentially gasoline
and crude oil), and exports a low value product (fuel oil). The net cost of
imports reached US$350 million in 1981, and declined to US$210 million in
1983. Without the proposed project these imports could increase to about
US$L billion.  Even with the project, the net cost of oil imports could reach
US$250 million by 1988, unless additional discoveries are made and quickly
developed. These estimates are based on information available in early



- 11 -
1984. Since then Occidental has had further successful exploration wells in
the Llanos area, so that they estimate the reserves at Cano Limon as so
significant that Colombia would definitely become a net exporter in petroleum
in the next few years.
Refineries and Products Consumption
2.16     With increases in the demand for petroleum products, the refining
capacity in the country has also expanded from 78 MBD in the 1960s to 176 MBD
in 1979, and 220 MBD in 1984. At present, there are five refineries operating
in Colombia. Two refineries, at Barranca Bermeja and Cartagena, account for
the bulk (210 MBD) of refinery capacity. In February 1984 the refineries
were operating at about 85% of capacity.
2.17     The Colombian market for oil products is characterized by a large
share of gasoline (nearly 50% of products consumption), and a relatively small
share of fuel oil (less than 7%). This is due to extensive use of hydropower
in the central and southern part of the country and the use of coal and to a
limited extent, natural gas, as a boiler feedstock for power generation and
industry, mainly in the northern part of the country.
2.18     Despite heavy investments in recent years in cracking facilities, the
output of Colombia's refineries does not match the pattern of demand, with
light products being short and heavy products being in excess. As a result
ECOPETROL imports crude and gasoline in proportions, which optimizes the use
of its refineries, but also minimizes its losses since part of the imported
crude is reexported after refining as fuel oil at a lower price (The price
differential varied from US$10 per barrel in 1982 to US$3.5 per barrel in
1983.). A consultant (Bechtel, U.S.A.) has been appointed recently to carry
out a master plan study for the refining sector in Colombia, which will
examine the feasibility of further conversions and upgrading in the existing
refineries, as well as the option of constructing a new refinery which would
refine and crack mainly the heavier ends (Fondo Barril).
2.19     The Government has also taken measures to limit the growth of
gasoline consumption by increasing the retail price of gasoline, so that
gasoline consumption which grew by 5-6% annually in the 1970's, has been
increasing by about 3% a year since 1980. The consumption of diesel oil
increased at a similar rate as gasoline. The share of fuel oil (which
includes that of a heavy crude being used directly as a fuel oil substitute),
has been declining since 1980 and this is expected to continue, as fuel oil is
being replaced by coal. The Government is also attempting to increase the
efficiency of energy use in transport by encouraging mass transportation
systems, in particular buses and cars with low fuel consumption.
The Pipeline System
2.20     The Colombian pipeline system comprises about 7,700 kilometers of
pipelines of various sizes which run principally along the Magdalena River,
beginning at Neiva, to Cartagena and passing through the refinery at Barranca
Bermeja (Map IBRD 18402). The cities of Cali, Medellin, Bogota, Barranquilla,
Bucaramanga, and Santa Marta are also linked by the pipeline system.
Generally, crude oil flows northwords from the fields to the Barranca Bermeja
refinery, and the refined products flow North and South from there. In



- 12 -
addition there are two short pipelines which run from the oil fields at Orito
to Tumaco, and from the oil fields in the Western Llanos to Yopal. Further
there is a gas pipeline network which carries gas southward from the Guajira
offshore fields, and northward from the Jobo/Tablon gas field, to Cartagena,
BarranquilLa and Santa Marta.  The pipeline sizes range from 4 to 16 inches
and they traverse terrain which ranges from rugged mountains to swamp lands.
ECOPETROL owns 65% of the national pipeline system, and the private foreign
and local companies own the balance. One local pipeline company, PROMIGAS
which owns a gas pipeline from Guajira to Cartagena received financial
assistance from IFC.
2.21     The recent discoveries in the Western Llanos at Apiay, Cano
Garza/Trinidad and Cano Limon by ECOPETROL, Elf and Occidental respectively
could have the potential to produce a total of 70 MBD per day, according to
preliminary estimates.  The only existing means to transport this crude to the
refineries at present is by tank-truck, which is three to five times more
costly than by pipelines, in addition to the disadvantage of less
reliability. The construction of pipelines to those fields has therefore
become high priority;  the design has been optimized from the point of view of
the national economy and once commissioned, they will give a further impetus
to the exploration activity in that province. A northern pipeline of about
290 km would move the Occidental association crude from Cano Limon to Rio
Zulia where it would enter existing westward bound pipelines. A southern
pipeline of about 480 km would transport the ECOPETROL Apiay crude and
Ecopetrol/Elf Casanare crude westward to Velasquez where it would also enter
an existing pipeline.  Both projects are essential to bring the Llanos area
fields to their full production level.
Consumer Prices of Oil Products
2.22     Up to 1975, retail prices for oil products in Colombia have been low,
as the country was a producer. As gasoline imports grew, and the balance of
payment impact of oil imports began to be felt, the Government gradually
increased consumer prices in real terms so that they were on average within
10% of international levels since 1980. The prices were last increased in
January 1984 basically to adjust with the domestic inflation, and are as
follows:
Table 2.4
January 1984 Retail Prices of Oil Products
Domestic Price                 Border Price
C$/Callon        US$/Gallon           US$/Gallon
Gasoline                77.5              0.87                 0.82
Diesel Oil              77.5              0.87                 0.88
Kerosene                77.5              0.87                 0.73
Fue; oil                40.8              0.46                 0.62
Thus the prices of gasoline and kerosene are above the CIF price, the price of
diesel oil is practically at the border price level and that of fuel oil is
some 25% below the FOB price. This is mainly because gasoline, diesel oil and
kerosene are heavily taxed (about 30% of the retail price), while the tax on



- 13 -
fuel oil, which is in surplus and being exported, is low (about 4%). Although
the price of fuel oil is below international levels, it did not cause any
demand distortions, given that fuel oil was partly substituted in the past
couple of years by still cheaper coal and gas. In conclusion, Colombia's
price level for petroleum products is satisfactory.
Natural Gas
2.23     Colombia has large natural gas reserves (about 4.05 TCF equivalent to
some 700 million barrels of crude oil), which are presently considerably
underutilized (at the present production rate of 370 MMCFD, reserves are
sufficient for about 30 years). The main difficulties for utilization of
natural gas are the location of the reserves (most of the reserves are in the
Guajira province, in the Northeast, which lacks infrastructure, and is far
from potential markets), and the lack of opportunity for fuel oil replacement,
Colombia having already replaced much of the fuel oil consumed by cheaper
coal. Therefore, even though prices for natural gas are particularly low, the
market remains very limited in spite of the financial incentive.

Power generation represents the main outlet, while industrial, petrochemical
and refining industries account for the balance. The residential market is
insignificant. Gas is being gradually phased out from power generation and
being replaced by coal and hydroelectric power.
2.24     In the next five years, consumption of gas is not expected to
increase significantly. The main economic applications of gas to be
considered are fertilizers and petrochemicals, in addition to the production
of methanol and compressed natural gas (CNG). The most obvious use of fuel
oil substitution is not a viable proposal, since (i) the Castilla heavy crude,
which is used as fuel oil, cannot be used elsewhere due to its high metal
content and (ii) much of traditional fuel oil consumption has been substituted
by coal. Under UNDP financing, a Japanese consulting company has carried out
a study for potential use of gas in production of fertilizers, and
petrochemicals. Moreover, ECOPETROL has embarked on a small pilot project for
use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in a fleet of vehicles. As gas represents
an important resource with potential in Colombia, DNP and ECOPETROL are
carrying out a gas utilization study that would help the Government and
ECOPETROL establish a strategy for gas use.

Government Strategy and the Role of the Bank
2.25     The Government's long-term strategy in the energy sector is to
develop its abundant coal and hydropower reserves and to substitute, where
appropriate, demand for petroleum products. In following this strategy, the
Bank's past involvement in Colombia's energy sector has essentially been in
the power sector. The Bank has made 29 power loans totalling US$1,708.6
million. In March 1984, the last power loan was made to the Financiera
Electrica Nacional, a financial intermediary which mobilizes financing for
various electric utilities (Loan 2401-CO). A coal exploration loan was
approved in October 1983 (Loan 2349-CO). However, in the short run there is
an urgent need to develop existing oil reserves and discover new ones to
couinter the natural decline of existing fields and to increase domestic
production. The proposed project would represent the Bank's first operation
in Colombia's petroleum sector and would address this need.
2.26     The Colombian Government has developed a comprehensive framework of
petroleum sector policies. Both producer and consumer prices for crude oil
and petroleum products, respectively, have since 1980 closely followed world
market prices fostering efficient supply and demand management.  The legal and
financial aspects of the contractual framework offered to private oil
companies has led to the signature of 59 new exploration contracts between
1980 and 1983, and exploration and production investments by the private
sector more than doubled compared to the previous 4 year period, so that the
private sector share of production augmented from 43% to 54% of total
production in the three years from 1980 to 1983.
2.27     In the light of these developments, the Bank reviewed ECOPETROL's
five year investment program, which was subsequently reduced from US$2.8
biLLion to US$2.1 billion on the advice of the Bank. The investment program
was structured in order to emphasize support for private sector activity and
to concentrate on low risk investments. Of the overall petroleum sector
investment of US$3.1 billion (para. 3.25) almost 70% are either private sector
investment (31%) or in direct support of the private sector: exploration
prom.otion (2.5%), contribution to association contracts (12%), pipeline
infrastructure (11%), and refineries (12%). The two Llanos pipelines are
designed with excess capacity on the advice of the Bank to accomodate
procluction from new fields in the Llanos. This would improve the
attractiveness of the area by reducing transport cost and the time required to
exploit new fields.  Refining capacity would be expanded to process increased
private sector production of crude.
2.26     ECOPETROL's own investment program is now almost exclusively focussed
on fields and facilities that reverted to it under concession agreements with
private oil companies, which include refineries.  ECOPETROL's own efforts are
furthermore concentrated on low risk activities leaving the high risk
undertakings with high potential returns to the private sector, where it can
make its most efficient contribution.  ECOPETROL reduced its own exploration
program to about US$200 million compared to US$450 million estimated to be
invested by the private sector. The program (about 4% of total petroleum
sector investments excluding the exploration promotion elements) is carried
out in areas close to existing fields on well known structures. ECOPETROL
will continue to develop its own fields and carry out the quick yielding
enhanced recovery program in its Casabe field with private management

assistance (together about 20% of total sector investment). ECOPETROL's
miscellaneous investments (including major maintenance) account for the
remaining 8% of total sector investment. Yearly review of the investment
program and financing plan would focus on high yielding projects and an
adequate role of the private sector.
2.29     Bank financing is directed towards quick yielding, high return
projects that have a large impact on Colombia's balance of payments and
ECOPETROL's capital structure with the purpose of improving its prospects to
raise long term funds from commercial banks. ECOPETROL's two lead banks have
expressed reservations about additional long-term lending to ECOPETROL under
present circumstances. These serious difficulties in obtaining long term
financing at reasonable cost has adverse implications for the financing of
ECOPETROL's share of the development of attractive new discoveries in
association with private sector partners, and for the development of its own
reserves, and enhanced oil recovery schemes. The two major investment
components proposed for Bank financing, the Casabe enhanced recovery project
and the association contract investments would lead to additional crude
production, which by 1988 is forecast to amount to 20% of total crude
production in Colombia. Apart from contributing to Colombia's balance of
payments (about US$450 million in 1988) this would strengthen ECOPETROL's
internal cash generation which would finance as much as 60% of its investments
and improve its debt/equity ratio. By providing funds for these activities
the Bank would ensure quick implementation and provide ECOPETROL with the
necessary funds to finance its share under association contracts with its
private partners. In financing a small amount of the Cano Limon-Rio Zulia
pipeline the Bank would act as a catalyst to mobilize export credits.
2.30     Bank financing and the proposed financial covenants would improve
ECOPETROL's creditworthiness and increase the potential for commercial
lending. B-Loan arrangements would be pursued with the two lead banks of
ECOPETROL, which have indicated interest in such an arrangement after the
above described improvement of ECOPETROL's finances and an improvement of
Colombia's economic outlook. Thus, Bank financing would allow ECOPETROL to
mobilize commercial long term funds in the medium term and to take immediate
advantage of high return investment opportunities.
2.31     Colombia has a large potential for secondary recovery programs (about
200 million barrels of crude oil). The implementation of such schemes is
complex, since they require close monitoring of the water flows and their
sweeping efficiency and prompt correcting measures if necessary. On the
Bank's recommendation, ECOPETROL has recently set up a special unit for
preparation of enhanced recovery projects. The proposed Bank Loan would
finance technical assistance in the critical phase of the Casabe enhanced
recovery project and for secondary recovery pilot projects. In particular, a
competent team of specialists would be trained which would develop a
comprehensive approach to future enhanced recovery programs, which possibly
could be implemented with private sector participation. In addition, the
proposed Bank project would help ECOPETROL establish adequate environmental
protection policies. In preparation of the proposed project, the Bank has
established sound relations with ECOPETROL, oil companies which are
ECOPETROL's private partners, and cofinancing agencies. Bank operations with
ECOPETROL could further deepen this dialogue and contribute to the efficient
development of Colombia's petroleum sector, taking account of the role of the
private sector.

III. THE BORROWER
Background and Scope of Activities
3.01     The Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos (ECOPETROL) was created in 1948
and began operations in 1951 when the De Mares concession and the Barranca
Bermeja refinery reverted to the state from the Tropical Oil Company (Exxon)
at the end of a 30-year concession. ECOPETROL's present statutes were
published in January 1970 under Decree 062.  It is a state-owned corporation,
directly involved, or associated with private companies, in the exploration of
some 6.8 million ha, and it has performed geological and geophysical studies
over a further 20 million ha. In 1982, ECOPETROL's sales were about 5% of
Colombia's GNP and the existing gasoline excise tax provided about 8% of total
Government tax revenue.
3.02     ECOPETROL's fields account for about 46% of Colombia's overall
production;  in addition, ECOPETROL has a 60% share (including a Government
share of 20%) in the association contracts which account for 13% of
Colombia's production (para. 2.06). All domestic production from oil
companies (under association and concession contracts) is sold to ECOPETROL as
long as Colombia is a net importer. ECOPETROL controls all the country's
refinery capacity of about 220,000 BD and about 65% of the total national oil
and gas transportation system, which comprises about 7,700 km of pipelines.
ECOPETROL is the sole exporter of hydrocarbon products from Colombia.
3.03     ECOPETROL has interests in a number of companies whose principal
activities range from exploitation and development of oil fields to
transportation and distribution of products and petrochemicals. ECOPETROL
also owns interests in coal (49% of CARBOCOL)1/, electrical utilities and
financial corporations. At present, the total amount of its subsidiary
interests accounts for 12% of ECOPETROL's net worth. Annex 3.1 lists the
principal companies.
Organization, Management and Staff
3.04     ECOPETROL is governed by a five-man board, chaired by the Minister of
Mines and Energy, and appointed directly by the President of Colombia. The
directors customarily are persons with experience in industry and commerce.
The board meets every week and is kept well informed. The board has broad
powers concerning all aspects of ECOPETROL's operation and has delegated
adequately to ECOPETROL's chief executive.
3.05     Reporting to the board is ECOPETROL's chief executive (president),
who is also appointed by the President of Colombia. Assisting him are five
vice presidents, responsible for exploration, production and manufacturing,
engineering and projects, finance, and administration. ECOPETROL's
1/ In FY1984, the Bank made a US$9.5 million loan to CARBOCOL for coal
exploration and technical assistance (Loan No. 2349-CO of October 1983)
(para. 2.25).



- 17 -
organization chart appears in Annex 3.2. The current president of EGOPETROL,
who was appointed to his post in August 1982, is a qualified and competent
manager who has a chemical engineering background and previously was on the
board of directors of several large enterprises in Colombia. His five vice
presidents are all professional oilmen whose length of service with ECOPETROL
is 16 years and above.
3.06     In general, the company is mature, competently staffed and
organized. The fields, refineries and pipelines it inherited were delivered
in good working order and with trained personnel to operate them. It is from
this corps of engineers, geologists, accountants, and administrators that
ECOPETROL has drawn most of its current senior management.
3.07     As of December 31, 1983, ECOPETROL's staff numbered 8,000 of whom
2,500 were technical supervisory staff. ECOPETROL has no difficulties
recruiting competent professional and support staff, largely because overall
salaries and benefits paid are considered to be among the best of public
enterprises in Colombia. After 10 years of service, employees enjoy free
education for their children right through university, medical treatment for
all family members, interest free loans, subsidized food and an excellent
retirement plan. Turnover of staff is low. Around 1980, when salaries in the
oil industry abroad rose rapidly, ECOPETROL lost some qualified personnel, but
at the present time salaries paid by ECOPETROL are competitive. Professional
salaries are adjusted annually by a general and a merit increase and are
approved by the president.   Non-professional staff salaries are fixed by
negotiations every two years with the union, which is strong and well
organized, but with which ECOPETROL's management has been able to deal
effectively.
3.08     ECOPETROL has a yearly training budget of about US$750,000 excluding
the salaries of employees while in training; it also excludes the training
provided by contractors and suppliers under construction contracts and
equipment purchase orders. ECOPETROL has three kinds of staff training,
within ECOPETROL, within Colombia and abroad; each one of its nine
operational districts designs and implements its training program under the
guidance of a company-wide training coordinator who resides in Bogota, and who
is also directly in charge of training of personnel assigned to the Bogota
area. Training activities cover technical, financial and managerial,
personnel and skilled crafts. In 1983 each employee went on average on two
training assignments of all types and durations; about 230 assignments were
abroad.
Budgets, Procurement, Accounts, Audits and Insurance
3.09     General:  ECOPETROL's budgeting, accounting and administration
procedures are those used by the major oil companies whose concessions
reverted to the state and have been modified only in the interest of
standardization and to meet the needs of a state-owned company. In general,
these procedures are adequate with the main weaknesses being in the
arrangements for external audit (para. 3.15). rts financial records are well
kept and up-to-date, and the costing/budgeting system reasonably well
maintained.



- 18 -
3.10     Budgets:  ECOPETROL's planning department prepares, on an annual
basis, five-year financial projections and work programs as well as each
year's budget. Reports on operating investment budget performance are
prepared by computer and are sent to all departments and operating units on a
monthly and quarterly basis respectively. The budget is prepared in detail
with explanations of the basic assumptions used. Of the 1980 to 1983
investment budgets only 80% was carried out due to delays and optimistic
budgets. However, ECOPETROL has taken adequate steps to strengthen its
planning and budgeting system.
3.11     Delegation:  In spite of board approval of the annual budget,
investments over C$30 million or US$450,000 must again be approved by the
board and any company indebtedness above US$500,000 must be authorized by the
Government. With the board meeting at least once a week and with GOC's
recognition of the importance of ECOPETROL to the economy, it appears that
there are no undue delays. Further, unforeseen capital expenditures, if
sufficiently urgent, can be treated as "emergencies" and presented to the
board after the fact. Adequate spending authority is delegated down to
division chiefs (C$250,000 or US$5,000 in foreign exchange).
3.12     Procurement:  ECOPETROL's procurement is generally done through
bidding invitations sent to leading national and international companies
(particularly those established in Colombia), and which have been prequalified
and put on rosters. This is a practice inherited by ECOPETROL from the
private oil companies. The procedures are well supervised and are quick and
efficient.
3.13     Accounts:  ECOPETROL's accounting system reflects the various systems
used by the major foreign oil companies.  Electronic data processing is widely
used to monitor income and expenditures against budget. Balance sheets and
income statements do not show individual "cost centers" but the income and
costs from these centers can be retrieved from the computer when required,
although this is not done systematically. The accounts and material coding
systems are good and handled proficiently.
3.14     Internal Audit:  There are no internal audit procedures in ECOPETROL
which can be considered truly "independent". However, there is an "internal
control" group of 50 accountants who report directly to the vice president,
Finance. This group has a yearly work program which is kept secret and
includes reviews of its management systems and procedures.
3.15     External Audit:  By law, the external audit of ECOPETROL's accounts
is carried out through the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic
of Colombia by means of a Special Fiscal Auditing Team assigned to
ECOPETROL. Although the scope of this audit is thorough and detailed, the
focus is more on compliance with the law than the certification that
ECOPETROL's financial statements accurately reflect its financial
performance. To supplement this Government audit, agreement has been reached
that ECOPETROL's financial statements and the project accounts will be audited
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and ECOPETROL and that the audited
statements would be submitted to IBRD within four months after the end of each
fiscal year.



- 19 -
3.16     Insurance:  ECOPETROL carries adequate insurance on its major
facilities and equipment in operation against all major hazards, such as fire,
destruction, etc. Insurance against hazards of transportation, and delivery
of goods is regularly arranged.
Financial Performance
3.17     ECOPETROL's finances are complex essentially because of ECOPETROL's
varied scope of activities, and the existing legal/contractual framework
governing petroleum exploration and production in Colombia. ECOPETROL's
revenues originate from the domestic sale of oil products and natural gas, and
the export of fuel oil and middle distillates. On the expenses side,
ECOPETROL purchases the full output of oil and gas produced in Colombia by
private oil companies. In addition, ECOPETROL imports crude oil (to make up
for the shortfall in domestic crude production) and gasoline (to optimize its
financial returns). Lastly, ECOPETROL produces natural gas and crude oil,
which is processed together with the domestically-purchased and the imported
crude in its two major refineries.
3.18     The prices and volumes of ECOPETROL's operations which are heavily
affecting its financial performance are largely determined by forces external
to ECOPETROL. The prices at which ECOPETROL sells oil products and natural
gas are Government-regulated. The prices at which it purchases domestic crude
oil and natural gas from the foreign companies are based on the concession and
association agreements, where a distinction is made between old or basic oil,
incremental oil and new oil, and an adjustment is made for crude quality. 1/
The prices at which it exports fuel oil, and imports crude oil and gasoline
are fixed by the international market. The volume of domestic sales are
determined by market forces and the volume of imports is a function of the
domestic sales and domestic production, which is to some extent determined by
foreign operators within the framework of the association and concession
contracts.
3.19     Within this framework, ECOPETROL operates in a financially and
economically responsible manner, as all investment decisions are taken
following a careful economic assessment of all alternatives. ECOPETROL is
financially autonomous, although it received in 1980 a US$100 million equity
contribution from the Government. In subsequent years, prices received by
ECOPETROL were sufficient to cover operating costs and a reasonable part of
investment costs. ECOPETROL is virtually exempt from income taxes. However,
through sales taxes on gasoline products, the Government collected in 1982
C$15.7 billion (US$240 million), or about 8% of total Government tax
revenue. ECOPETROL is a net user of foreign exchange due to (i) net imports
of petroleum, (ii) payment of 75% of local purchases of oil in foreign
exchange, and (iii) imports of capital goods, equal to about 60% of
ECOPETROL's investments.
1/       Old oil:  oil discovered before 1976, and originating from the
natural depletion of the fields (1983 price: US$5-7/bbl).
Incremental oil: Oil discovered before 1976, and originating from
additional investments in the fields (1983 price: US$15-17/Bbl).

As the above table indicates, ECOPETROL made small losses in two out of the
past four years and small profits in the other two years. In 1983 for
example, ECOPETROL made an overall profit of US$10 million.  ECOPETROL
generated profits from (i) the purchase of domestically produced oil at an
average of US$11.7/Bbl compared to average revenues from domestic sales of
products of US$21.9/Bbl 2/; (ii) its 50% share in association contracts with
foreign partners, and its own production, where cost vary from field to field
and are of the order of US$5-15/Bbl; and (iii) 8% of the 20% royalty on
1/       ECOPETROL's official accounts overstate revenues, as those include
rebates given to electric utilities purchasing natural gas; the
rebates are included in the operating expenses. ECOPETROL's revenues
and expenses in this report have been stated net of rebates.

90% of that of fuel oil, the balance being basically taxes.

association contracts, which it retains. However ECOPETROL makes losses on
imports of crude and gasoline for which it pays international prices, but for
which it receives only about 70% of those prices, the other 30% being
essentially excise taxes.
3.21     The low profitability of ECOPETROL is partly due to foreign exchange
losses on foreign debt which are expensed through the income statement in each
year. As foreign exchange losses do not represent immediate outlays but are
only paid when the loans fall due, ECOPETROL's cash flow is strong. Over
1980-83, it was able to finance from internal sources about half of its
investment program of approximately US$1.0 billion.
3.22     ECOPETROL's balance sheet as of December 31, 1983 can be summarized
as follows:

a! At the exchange rate US$1.0=C$88.77
It shows that the current ratio was rather low at 0.7 in December 1983.
ECOPETROL's main difficulty in the last two years has been the unavailability
of long-term financing, with the consequent resort to short-term borrowings.
In recent years, ECOPETROL was only able to get two long-term loans, one
syndicated by Chemical Bank (US$200 million in 1979) and the other by
Manufacturer's Hanover Trust (US$100 million in 1980). Since 1980, ECOPETROL
has been financing its investment program by internal funds and short-term
borrowings. The amount of short-term borrowings peaked at US$365 million at
end-1982, and as of end-1983, the outstanding amount of short-term borrowings
was US$200 million. Had ECOPETROL obtained long-term rather than short-term
financing, its current ratio at end-1983 could have been an acceptable 1.1
rather than 0.7. One of the purposes of the Bank loan is to help ECOPETROL to
improve its financial structure and enable it to have access to commercial
long-term lending. As part of the project ECOPETROL has agreed to improve its



- 22 -
current ratio to 1.1 by 1986 and to review its investment and financing plan
on an annual basis with the Bank.
3.23     At end-1983 ECOPETROL's debt:equity ratio 1/ was 65:35.  This ratio
is calculated on a very conservative basis, because it is based on unrevalued
assets while long-term Liabilities are revalued.  In accordance with Colombian
law, ECOPETROL revalues only partly the assets in its books. For instance, at
end-1983, for insurance purposes ECOPETROL's operating assets (excluding
pipelines) were estimated at US$1.9 billion, against a book value of US$0.75
billion; therefore, had ECOPETROL revalued its assets on the basis of
replacement costs, its debt:equity ratio at end-1983 would have been 33:67
rather than 65:35.
Sector Investment Strategy
3.24     A breakdown of ECOPETROL's past investments from 1980 to 1982 shows
that ECOPETROL doubled its annual investment program from US$156 million to
US$339 million:

The past investment program shows a relative balance between exploration
(which accounted for 19% of the program), development (25%), refineries (20%),
pipeline (25%), and regular investments (11%).  Over the three years it shows
a decline of refinery investments in relative terms, but a rapid increase in
development and pipeline expenditures, reflecting ECOPETROL's preoccupation
with rapid yielding productive investments and the fact that ECOPETROL had
completed before 1980 all major expansion and optimization in the Barranca
Bermeja refinery. The refinery investments during 1980 to 1982 constitute
mainly the expansion of the Cartagena refinery.
3.25     ECOPETROL's investment plan for 1984-1988 was originally US$2.8
billion. After discussion with the Bank and taking into account ECOPETROL's
project implementation capability and the financial constraints, ECOPETROL
reduced its program to a realistic US$2.1 billion (Annex 3.3). The petroleum

sector investment program below shows an adequate balance between private and
public sector investments, between exploration, development, pipelines and
refineries and has a size which is tailored to (i) the urgent needs of
increased production, (ii) financial capabilities (para. 5.04), and (iii)
implementation capacity, since it would result in an increase of ECOPETROL's
annual investment budget of only 6% p.a. (para. 3.33):

The table 3.4 shows that the private sector activity would be strongest in
risky exploration and development of new fields, whereas ECOPETROL would
concentrate its efforts on development of fields, which reverted to it after
expiration of concessions, as well as infrastructure (pipelines and
refineries) that is complementary to private sector activities.



- 24 -
3.26     The table 3.4 shows that ECOPETROL will keep its investments in risky
oil exploration at US$40 million per year, with the expectation that the
private sector will invest about double that amount. With its exploration
budget, ECOPETROL intends to shoot 14,800 km of seismic at an average cost of
US$5,300 per km, which is adequate given some difficult terrain in the
Llanos. ECOPETROL would drill 46 exploration wells at an average cost per
well of US$2.7 million, which is reasonable.
3.27     ECOPETROL's investments in field development of US$990 million
represents the bulk of its investment program and reflects the high priority
it attaches to increasing production. The largest part of ECOPETROL's
development program is its 50% share in field developments (US$379 million)
under association contracts with private oil companies which would pay the
other 50% share. The next largest part is ECOPETROL's investment in EOR of
the Casabe field.  Both investments (including the pilot EOR) are of very hig3h
priority and are part of the proposed project and discussed in detail in
Chapter IV.  In addition, ECOPETROL plans to spend US$225 million to continue
development drilling in its own fields (13 old and one new): Lisama, Tesoro,
Peroles, Llannito, Nutria, Galan and Cristalina in the central district;
Orito, Churuyaco, Acae and La Hormiga in the southern district; Rio de Oro
and Tibu in the northern district;  and Apiay in the Llanos Orientales.  The
cost estimate is based on on-going operations and therefore very realistic.
This investment is of highest priority since it will help ECOPETROL maintain
at least the production level achieved in 1983 in its fields which would
experience an overall yearly production decline of about 8% without additional
drilling and surface production facilities. The additional production oi
20,000 BD in 1988 is valued at US$300 million, indicating a very high rate of
return on investment.
3.28     ECOPETROL's 1984-88 investment program for pipelines comprises 11
projects totalling an investment of about US$323 million. A large part of the
investment (US$145 million) consists of the Apiay-Yopal-Velasquez pipeline
which will handle the recent finds made in Los Llanos by Ecopetrol (Apiay) and
Elf (Casanare). Another project totalling US$172 million includes in the Canc
Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline scheme and changes to the Velasquez-Barranca
Bermeja and Zulia-Ayacucho pipeline systems to permit transporting to the
refinery the finds made by Occidental in Los Llanos (Cano Limon).
3.29     The Apiay-Yopal-Velasquez pipeline based on industry norms, would
have a mean cost of US$127 million which compares with ECOPETROL's estimate of
US$145 million. Given the uncertainties of pipeline construction in
mountainous areas, ECOPETROL's estimate is reasonably conservative. For an
investment of US$167 million, 1/ ECOPETROL and its partner Elf would
ultimately derive a yearly saving of transport cost of approximately US$100
million (based on a production of 30,000 BD from Apiay and Casanare). For the
Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline which ECOPETROL is undertaking with
Occidental, the benefits to be derived are of the same order of magnitude as
those envisaged for the Apiay-Yopal-Velasquez/Barranca Bermeja pipeline
systems discussed above.
1/       which includes modifications to the Velasquez - Barranca Bermeja
pipeline system.



- 25 -
3.30     Two additional investment program items, each costing a little under
US$50 million, are the Combustoleoducto from Barranca Bermeja to Cartagena
which will permit transporting excess residual fuel to the coast for export or
for hydrocracking at Cartagena, and the expansion of the Poliducto Sebastopol-
Medellin which will provide a product transport capacity of 50,000 BD to
southwestern Colombia and will also provide diversity of transport risk by
establishing a separate pipeline route to the southwest. These projects are
presently under construction and would be completed in 1985 and 1986
respectively.
3.31     Two pipeline terminals, La Sabana and Medellin are also included in
the investment program. The second phase of the La Sabana terminal costing
about US$15 million has been included in the program to handle the increased
requirements of the Bogota region and to permit abandoning the old terminal
for Bogota which is extremely congested and presents a hazard to safety. This
will permit gradually phasing out the old terminal and moving all products
terminals to La Sabana. The expansion of the Medellin terminal will cost
about US$10 million and is needed to acconodate the growth in that area.
Finally the program contains also five small projects aggregating just under
US$8 million.
3.32     In refineries ECOPETROL's major proposed investment is a new refinery
unit which would mainly use the heavier ends of petroleum, of which Colombia
presently has an oversupply, for cracking and refining into lighter products,
of which there is a shortage (para. 2.18). Refinery configuration, its
location, technology, cost and overall justification compared to increased
gasoline imports is still under study for at least another two years.
Therefore, there is provision for studies of US$1 million in 1984 and 1985,
after which a decision can be taken. Allocation of US$252 million is spread
over the outer years from 1986 to 1988. Other investments are for energy
conservation and pollution control for the Catagena refinery and for
rehabilitation and balancing in the Barranca Bermeja refinery totaling US$106
million. There is an obvious need for further investments, but their costs
and justification still need to be studied in detail.
3.33     In conclusion, the ECOPETROL's investment program of US$2.1 billion
is well balanced concerning its size and its different components. It would
be supplemented by US$1. billion of private investments. In terms of
management of the investment program, the private sector is responsible for
about half, since it would manage its own program plus ECOPETROL's share of
US$.4 billion in associations field developments. ECOPETROL's investments in
1988 would be about US$460 in current prices and constitute a 6% increase p.a.
over actual investments of US$350 million in 1983. It reflects ECOPETROL's
commitment to (i) participate in the development of new discoveries under
association contracts with Elf Aquitaine, Occidental Petroleum and other oil
companies which make successful discoveries so as to increase production
rapidly, (ii) increase productivity of old fields through EOR methods, and
(iii) further develop existing fields. Moreover, the investment program would



- 26 -
permit ECOPETROL to possibly increase reserves through exploration and to
maintain and enlarge the transport infrastructure and refineries to adequately
supply the domestic market. In addition, the program leaves considerable
investments in exploration, production and pipelines to the private sector to
benefit from their expertise and financial resources. ECOPETROL has agreed to
an annual review of its five year financial projections (para. 5.13) by the
Bank, and such review would include the size and composition of ECOPETROL's
investment program. Moreover, ECOPETROL has agreed, that it would initiate
new investments only if they do not adversely affect its capabilities to
implement the proposed project.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01     The main objectives of the project are to increase the production of
oil in Colombia through enhanced recovery methods, and to contribute to the
development of oil fields (discovered by private oil companies) in joint
ventures between private companies and ECOPETROL thus improving Colombia's
balance of payments and ECOPETROL's finances by reducing imports. In
addition, the project would strengthen ECOPETROL's capabilities in enhanced
oil recovery technology and environmental protection and would provide
transport infrastructure to allow production increases and to spur further
exploration. The project is of high priority given that enhanced oil recovery
for older fields and development of newer fields under association contracts
is the most economic approach to increase oil production in the medium-term.
It represents some 30% of ECOPETROL's investment program over 1984-88 (para.
3.25). The project would have a major impact on reduction of Colombia's
dependence on imported oil. Its increase of production would be 36 MBD in
1988, or 9% of Colombia's projected imports in 1988 in value equivalent.
Project Description
4.02     The project contains four main components:  (i) Casabe enhanced oil
recovery; (ii) field developments under association contracts; (iii) the
Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline, and (iv) technical assistance and training.
(a)  Casabe Enhanced Oil Recovery
The primary recoverable reserves of the field are estimated at
252 million Bbls out of which 210 million Bbls have already
been produced as of 'December 31, 1982. The field produced
about 5000 BD in February 1984. An estimated 70 million
barrels of additional oil can be recovered from the existing
Casabe field (owned and operated by ECOPETROL) through water
injection of about 243,000 barrels of water per day over 1985-
2004. At a cost of some US$336 million before contingencies,
it will produce an additional 20MBD (of an annual value of
about US$300 million) when the enhanced oil recovery program is
completed in 1988. The project includes: (i) the drilling of
about 500 wells to inject water in 4 overlapping reservoirs
(Al, A2, Bl and B2) of the Colorado and Mugrosa formations of
tertiary age at a depth varying between 3,000 and 5,000 feet;
(ii) the drilling of 53 new oil well producers and the working
over of 324 existing oil well producers to allow oil production
from the 4 above mentioned reservoirs; (iii) the design and
construction of expanded surface facilities for the gathering
of fluids from the producing wells and for the handling of
increased production of fluids, separation of crude oil from
water, crude oil storage and transfer to the main pumping
station at Barranca Bermeja; (iv) the drilling of 14 shallow
water producing wells (800 feet), construction of water
gathering lines and the design and construction of water
storage facilities and an injection station as well as
injection flow lines; and (v) facilities for treating residual



- 28 -
water after initial separation from oil to remove any
pollutants before disposing of the water into the nearby
Magdalena River. Successful execution of this project
component would require resolution of difficult technical
problems which may emerge as the project implementation
advances. To assist in handling them, provisions would be made
under the proposed loan for consultant and engineering services
for the detailed design, execution and monitoring of the
execution; the Bank would also maintain close supervision.
(b) Field Developments under Association Contracts
In accordance with the association contract in effect in
Colombia, ECOPETROL shares 50% of the development cost of
discoveries made by foreign oil companies (para 2.09).
Companies such as Occidental Petroleum (U.S.), Elf Aquitaine
(France) and Chevron (U.S.) have made recent discoveries in the
Llanos Orientales basin (Cano Limon, Casanare and Castilla
respectively). Texaco has started enhanced recovery programs
in an old field, by steam injection in Cocorna. At a total
cost of US$329 million before contingencies, these developments
will produce an additional 16.5 MBD, with an annual value of
about US$250 million, in 1988 (Annex 4.1). ECOPETROL
participates for 50% of the cost of the above projects and will
receive directly 40% (US$100 million) of the production with
the Government receiving another 20% (US$50 million) in
royalty. These developments require large expenditures in
drilling, pumping, steam injection, surface processing and
separation facilities, gathering lines and pipelines. Unless
ECOPETROL can finance its share, delays are likely to take
place. It is therefore proposed to provide under the project,
financing for part of ECOPETROL's share in these ventures.
(c)  Cano Limon - Rio Zulia Pipeline
The association company, of which ECOPETROL and Occidental
Petroleum own 50% each, will own and operate a pipeline from
Cano Limon to Rio Zulia to transport the Cano Limon crude to
Rio Zulia where it would enter an existing pipeline to the
Barranca Bermeja refinery. The pipeline will be approximately
290 km long and will have diameters of 18/20 inches with an
ultimate capacity of 180,000 BD; initially the system would
have three pump stations with the addition of a future fourth
station in order to attain the ultimate capacity and thus be
able to handle the production from potential future
discoveries. The investment of about US$140 million, compares
to yearly savings of about US$40 to 50 million at 30,000 BD
uLtimate production, showing a maximum payout period of four
years, which is favorable. Since the peak production is likely
to be higher, the payout period wouLd likely be less.



- 29 -
(d) Technical Assistance, Training and Studies
This component includes (a) technical assistance, training, and
pilot studies for EOR, and (b) study to monitor present
pollution and to establish standards of environmental
protection. ECOPETROL presently operates about 40 oil fields
directly, while private companies exploit under association and
concession contracts respectively 19 and 17 fields. Out of a
total oil originally in place of about 13 billion barrels, it
was recently estimated that only about 3.0 billion barrels, or
22,5% could be recovered ultimately using the existing
production techniques. Using enhanced recovery techniques, an
additional 100 million barrels could be recovered from
ECOPETROL's fields (excluding Casabe). It is therefore
proposed to include in the project (i) technical assistance to
Ecopetrol's Enhanced Oil Recovery Unit for design and
supervision of studies, planning and evaluation of pilot
tests; (ii) specialized analyses of cores and fluids in
foreign laboratories equipped for enhanced oil recovery
studies; (iii) reservoir simulation studies (in 18 fields
operated by ECOPETROL and foreign companies);  (iv) four field
pilot enhanced oil recovery tests iacluding drilling, workover
and specialized completion services for about 25 wells; and
(v) training of ECOPETROL's personnel in enhanced oil recovery
methods and techniques (overseas training of 5 professional
staff of ECOPETROL). This will enable ECOPETROL and its
consultants to: (a) identify high priority fields with
enhanced oil recovery potential; (b) define an implementation
program to economically recover additional oil from the
existing fields; and (c) carry out field pilot tests to
confirm the feasibility of enhanced oil recovery projects in
specific producing fields and evaluate institutional/
contractual arrangements for future EOR projects. Lastly, it
is proposed to provide for a specialized study to establish a
policy framework for environmental protection.
Project Preparation
4.03     Preliminary feasibility studies of the Casabe secondary oil recovery
component were completed by ECOPETROL in 1977 with the help of DeGolyer and
McNaughton (U.S. consultants).  Since then ECOPETROL carried out three pilot
water injection tests in different reservoirs to test the validity of the
results of the preliminary studies. The tests gave positive results as the
ratios of water injected to oil production varied between 12 and 15 1/. Thus,
the field pilot results confirmed the forecast made by the engineering
studies. The enhanced recovery program in Casabe has been drawn up and basic
engineering work on designs and equipment specifications have been completed
by ECOPETROL with the help of Williams Brothers Engineering
1/ This compares favorably to the ratio of 13.3 reported in a study of 86
waterfloods in similar fields in the U.S.A.



- 30 -
(U.S. consultant). ECOPETROL started implementation of secondary recovery
investments in the field in 1982, and drilled about 150 injection wells until
February 1984, using four contracted rigs and one ECOPETROL rig. ECOPETROL is
in the process of installing surface facilities. The proposed project
includes the continuation of the secondary recovery investments.
4.04     Concerning the four field developments under association contracts
proposed to be financed under the project, preparation of field development
programs is the responsibility of the private oil companies which are the
operators of these fields, i.e. Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Occidental Petroleum
and Texaco. Over the years 1981 to 1984, ECOPETROL declared the discoveries
of Chevron, Elf Aquitaine and Occidental Petroleum commercial and approved the
EOR project of Texaco, based on feasibility studies carried out by the private
operators. ECOPETROL normally approves the commerciality of the discoveries
within three months of submission, the last approval having been given in
Januiary 1984 for the latest Elf Aquitaine discovery. After submission of the
feasibility study the operator submits to ECOPETROL an annual development
program for review and approval.
4.05     The Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline has been studied by ECOPETROL and
Occidental Petroleum in detail. One regional optimization study analyzed five
different alternatives for evacuation of the Llanos crude and established that
the proposed pipeline is part of the optimal solution. Other optimization
stuclies concerning the detailed routing and the optimum combination of
pipeline diameter and pumping horsepower have also been carried out.
Project Implementation
4.06     The Production Projects Division of the Production Department is in
charge of the implementation of all aspects of the Casabe enhanced oil
recovery project. The Production Department is headed by an Assistant Vice
President, who reports to the Vice President - Operations .
4.07     The Production Projects Division is headed by a competent and
experienced engineer, whose staff consists of ten qualified engineers in all
the relevant engineering disciplines (civil, electrical, mechanical, petroleum
etc.). The division has commissioned William Brothers (U.S. consultant firm)
for all aspects of basic design, procurement, evaluation and construction of
surface facilities. It also receives support from the drilling division at
heaquarters for all aspects of drilling contracts awards and from the
Superintendent of Casabe field for supervision on drilling operations. During
implementation important coordination problems are resolved by a committee
headed by the Assistant Vice President, Production; the committee is composed
of the head of the Production Projects Division, the Manager of El Centro
District (where Casabe is located), the superintendent of the Casabe field,
and the heads of the driLling divisions at headquarters and at Casabe. This
committee meets on a monthly basis. The division staffing and organizational
arrangements for making important decisions are satisfactory, and ECOPETROL
has agreed to maintain satisfactory staffing and organizational arrangements
for the implementation of that part of the project.



- 31 -
4.08     The injection wells are to be drilled by four contracted and one
ECOPETROL drilling rigs. For workovers of old producers, and for well
completion, seven service rigs are to be contracted for. Specialized services
such as logging, perforating and cementing would be performed by
contractors. Surface facilities, such as pumping equipment to handle the
increase in oil production, would be acquired directly and installed by
contractors under ECOPETROL's supervision.
4.09     Regarding the field development, the private oil companies are in
charge of developing the reserves, once ECOPETROL has given its approval to
the initial development plan and its annual review. This arrangement is
satisfactory. Preliminary development plans which are submitted prior to
declaration of commerciality were reviewed by the Bank and are reasonable.
The Bank also reviewed the reserves evaluation studies and detailed one-year
development plans for such reserves which were satisfactory. For subsequent
years ECOPETROL has agreed to submit to the Bank for its approval the annual
development plan for the fields to be financed by the Bank, not later than
November 15 of each year.
4.10     Concerning the Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline, Occidental has issued
tender documents in June 1984 and a contract has been signed for turnkey works
with Mannesmann (Germany) in August 1984 under which the general contractor
will do the detailed design, supply the materials and construct and commission
the pipeline system. Inspection during construction will be carried out
jointly by Occidental and ECOPETROL assisted by consultants. Occidental would
be operator of che pipeline under the association contract. A condition for
disbursements on this component would be contractual arrangements between
ECOPETROL and Occidental Petroleum, satisfactory to the Bank, for construction
of the pipeline according to a feasibility study and financing plan,
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.11     One part of the technical assistance will cover the enhanced oil
recovery pilot studies for fields other than Casabe, and will be carried out
by consultants to be selected according to Bank guidelines and to be appointed
by ECOPETROL. These consultants will also be in charge of training ECOPETROL
personnel in the techniques of enhanced oil recovery. ECOPETROL has recently
set up a special unit in the Production Projects Division specifically in
charge of EOR. The role of this unit will be to gather reservoir information
on all Colombian fields and develop a program to implement enhanced oil
recovery projects. This program would: (i) define the training needs of the
staff of the project unit; (ii) identify specialized technical assistance
needs to help the unit develop the enhanced oil recovery program and supervise
its implementation; (iii) hire specialized consultants to review and evaluate
field prospects (about 18) for enhanced oil recovery; (iv) arrange for
specialized analyses in overseas laboratories on oil and core data from
candidate reservoirs; and (v) design and implement field pilot tests. A
qualified engineer has already been appointed to head that unit, and agreement
has been reached that another two staff members will be appointed before
December 31, 1984.
4.12     Another part of the technical assistance consists of a study to
monitor present pollution and to establish standards of environmental
protection for the oil industry in Colombia. Such a study would be carried
out by external consultants, who would be selected according to Bank
guidelines.

Implementation Schedule
4.13     Implementation of the works necessary for water injection in the
northern part of Casabe (122,000 BD of water) started in 1982, and is expected
to be completed by February 1985. The second phase involving implementation
of works in the southern part of the field includes the drilling of about 250
injection wells, and working over 190 oil producers, equipping them, and
connecting them to the injection station and the field battery of
separators. Implementation would begin in the second half of 1984, and
cornmissioning would take place at end-1987. The detailed impLementation
schedule appears at Annex 4.2.
4.14     With regard to the associations' field development component,
contracts would be let after preparation by the oil companies and approval by
ECOPETROL of the detailed one-year development plan and its annual review and
approval by the Bank.
4.1.5    Contractor mobilization for the construction of the Cano Limon - Rio
Zulia pipeline would take place during the fourth quarter of 1984 with
completion of the pipeline scheduled for January 1986.
4.16     The different consultants for the technical assistance component
involving enhanced oil recovery (other than Casabe), and environmental studies
are expected to be appointed in early 1985.
Cost Estimates
4.17     The detailed cost estimate of the project appears at Annex 4.3.  It
is summarized below:

The cost estimate is expressed mid-1984 prices. Physical contingencies are at
7%, which is considered adequate given the advanced stage of project
preparation. Price contingencies are provided at 8% in 1985 and 9% over 1986-
1988 for foreign cost and 20% in 1985 and 1986 and 18% in 1987 and 1988 for
local cost. The Colombian currency is projected to devalue by 28% in 1984,
23% in 1985, 13% in 1986, 10% in 1987, and 9% in 1988. The technical
assistance component provides for 280 man-months of consulting services.
Financing Plan
4.18     The financing plan for the project would be as follows:

ECOPETROL would finapee US$390 million or 40% of the total project cost from
its internal cash generation, which would be equal to the local currency
cost. ECOPETROL's contribution to the cost of the project is equivalent to
26% of its internal cash generation available for investments during the
period under review (para. 5.05). The private oil companies would finance
US$274 million or 28% of total project cost, representing half of the
association field developments and of the pipeline including contingencies.
The private oil companies, being all subsidiaries of large international oil
companies would have no particular difficulties in mobilizing their share.
Cofinancing of US$187 million would represent 19% of total project cost of
which 11% would come from export credits and 8% from commercial bank loans.
The export credits would be for tubular goods (well casing and tubing) and
wellheads; and line pipe and pumping stations. The proposed Bank loan of
US$130 million would be 13% of total project cost.
4.19     The distribution of financing between the four components would be as
follows: of the Casabe EOR scheme, ECOPETROL would finance 64%, cofinancing
17%, and the Bank 19%. Of the field developments under association contracts,
the private operators would pay 50%1 of expenditures from their own financial
sources as equity; ECOPETROL would finance 22% from internal cash generation,
and cofinancing and the Bank loan would account for 16% and 11% respectively,



- 34 -
all of which would be accounted as ECOPETROL's equity in the association as
its contractual obligation. The private operator would finance 50% of the
pipeline, ECOPETROL 4%, the Bank 7%, and cofinancing would account for the
balance all of which would be considered equity. Concerning the Technical
Assistance component, ECOPETROL would finance from cash generation the local
currency portion and the Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange.
4.20     ECOPETROL has reviewed, together with the Bank, those contracts which
would lend themselves to export credits, and will attempt in the future to
mobilize such credit. Moreover, ECOPETROL is in the process of identifying
additional sources of commercial financing, which could be further encouraged
through a potential B-loan from the Bank which would be required by the first
half of 1985. If some of the envisaged cofinancing would not materialize
ECOPETROL could curtail the Casabe secondary recovery and the association
field developments without compromising the projects viability. Concerning
the pipeline, sufficient cofinancing has been mobilized and the pipelines'
sponsor (Occidental Petroleum) has committed himself in addition to raise the
necessary financing to fill any shortfalls. ECOPETROL has prepared a
financing plan which would be reviewed annually by the Bank together with
ECO)PETROL's investment program (para. 5.13).
4.21     The proposed Bank loan would be at the standard variable interest
rate for 14 years including four years grace. The favorable cash-flow
projections of the project and ECOPETROL would allow terms which are more
stringent than the usual country terms (17 years).  One of the objectives of a
possible B-loan would also be to lengthen the maturities of potential
commercial bank loans (para. 4.20). The proposed terms of the financing
package would enable ECOPETROL to improve its current ratio from .7 in 1983 to
at least 1.1 in 1986 and thereafter and to maintain a satisfactory debt
service coverage ratio of at least 1.4. ECOPETROL would pay to the Government
a guarantee fee equal to 10% of the standard Bank rate and rounded to the next
highest tenth of a percentage point.
Procurement
4.22     Goods and services for the project components financed from the
proposed loan and to be procured under international competitive bidding
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines, would include (a) drilling and
(b) pumps for both Casabe and pilot enhanced oil recovery projects and
(c) some pipeline equipment including tanks, cathodic protection and
telecommunications 1/. Other specialized services such as cementing, logging
and perforating needed during completion of wells would be procured by
requesting bids from all firms known to supply these services since there is
only a small number of companies worldwide which offer these services.
Consultants would be selected in accordance with World Bank guidelines.
1/ Although the pipeline would be built under a turnkey contract, ECOPETROL
has agreed that a condition of contract award be that the turnkey contractor
procure as an agent of the association of ECOPETROL/Occidental Petroleum at
least US$10 million of equipment and services for the pipeline under the Bank
guidelines.

4.23     Procurement arrangements for the project components to be financed
from the proposed loan are summarized below:

Procurement for items to be financed from other than World Bank sources would
follow acceptable oil industry practice, which would result in competitive
prices in line with the cost estimates. The association partners, who are the
operators for the association field developments, would procure the drilling
services and selected specialized services (which represent about 50% of total
foreign exchange cost of these developments and is equal to ECOPETROL's share)
according to Bank procurement guidelines, thus allowing disbursements against
these contracts. The association partners would carry out all other
procurement according to industry practice.
Items Proposed for Bank Financing and Disbursements
4.24     The proposed Bank loan would finance:
(a) 50% of total expenditures representing 100%6 of the foreign
exchange component for drilling services for Casabe, the other
four field developments, and enhanced oil recovery field pilot
tests;
(b) 90% of total expenditures representing 100% of the foreign
exchange component of specialized services (logging,
perforating and cementing) for Casabe, field developments and
enhanced oil recovery field pilot tests;
(C) 100% of the foreign expenditures for pumping units for Casabe,
for the enhanced oil recovery field pilot tests and for
pipeline equipment comprising crude oil storage tanks, cathodic
protection and telecommunications;



- 36 -
(d) 100% of the foreign expenditures for enhanced oil recovery
studies, technical assistance, training and laboratory tests.
4.25      Annex 4.4 provides a schedule of disbursements, which
essentially conforms with the statistical profile as of February 1984
for Energy Projects. Loan proceeds would be disbursed into a dollar-
denominated special account in Banco de la Republica, to be established
by ECOPETROL solely for the purposes of the project. Upon ECOPETROL's
request, the Bank would make an initial deposit into the account of up
to US$20 million. Disbursements from the special account would be made
for eligible expenditures under the Loan. Replenishment of the dollar
equivalent amount of disbursements from that account would be made upon
receipt of withdrawal applications from ECOPETROL. After disbursement
from the loan account of a total of US$65 million, the Bank would begin
to recuperate the initial deposit. In addition to the external auditing
of ECOPETROL the revoLving fund account would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. All disbursements would
ultimately be documented by a certified statement of expenditures.
Ecology and Safety
4.26     No major environmental risks are likely to result from the Project.
So far, ECOPETROL has had an excellent safety record and its pollution and
fire prevention practices, which are standard for the petroleum industry, are
satisfactory. Oil spills resulting from pipeline failures and blowouts are
always possible, but ECOPETROL is experienced and takes precautionary
measures. With respect to the Casabe component, Williams Bros (US) in
association with Techniavance Ingenieros (Colombia) were awarded a contract in
April 1983 to carry out the complete design of the gathering, processing and
handling system of produced crude oil and associated residual waters. The
basic engineering design report was finalized after review by ECOPETROL's
Procluction Projects Department in December 1983. Upon completion in 1985 the
system would have the capacity to desalinate and strip all traces of residual
oil from up to 240,000 BD of residual waters containing up to 120 tons/day of
salt. Since fresh water will be injected, this is ample desalinacion
capacity. Thus, the processed water will not pollute the Magdalena river into
which it would be discharged. Maximum modification of the salinity of the
river waters in the immediate vicinity of the project area would be I PPM.
equivalent salt, which is fully acceptable. The Cano Limon - Rio Zulia
pipeline will be beneficial to the environment since it will replace road
tanks transport which is hazardous, noisy, environmentally dirty and less
fuel-efficent. Furthermore, under the Project, ECOPETROL is to appoint
consultants to carry out a specialized study to establish a policy framework
for environmental protection (para. 4.02).
Project Risks
4.27     The risks associated with the project are those inherent in the
petroleum industry. With respect to the enhanced oil recovery component, all
information already available on the Casabe field established it as an
excellent candidate for secondary recovery by water injection. ECOPETROL has
already taken steps both during the preparation of the project and initiation
of implementation of the first phase of this component to ensure an efficient



- 37 -
and careful execution. The key factor has been thorough organizational
arrangements of the project unit and technical assistance from a well known
and reputable foreign engineering firm.
4.28     The risks associated with the field development component have been
minimized as the operators, who contribute 50% of all development investments,
will all be well known and experienced oil companies. In all, the risks have
been carefully evaluated, and considering the potential benefits of the
project to the Colombian economy, are worth taking.
4.29     The risks associated with the Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline are
minimal, since the feasibility study has established that there are sufficient
reserves for adequate utilization of the pipeline. A qualified and
experienced contractor would be in charge of construction, thus minimizing any
possible delays. Occidental Petroleum would have adequate incentive to
properly operate and maintain the pipeline, to allow production from the Cano
Limon field.
Reporting Requirements
4.30     In order to allow the Bank to reach an informed judgement on the
progress of the project, agreement has been reached that ECOPETROL will
provide the Bank with quarterly progress reports covering technical progress
of the Casabe enhanced oil recovery scheme, the association field
developments, the Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline, the studies on enhanced oil
recovery, and environmental protection, procurement status and funds
committed/spent. A completion report will be submitted at the end of the
Project.

V. FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
ECOPETROL's Projected Financial Statements
5..01      ECOPETROL's financial projections for the 1984-88 period, based on
historical trends and a detailed analysis of the underlying volumetric and
price structure, are in Annex 5.1 and are summarized below. The projections
were made in current Colombian Pesos (C$) to permit (i) a realistic analysis
of the effects of real exchange rate variations, and of variations in domestic
and international prices, (ii) a comparison with ECOPETROL's own financial
projections, which are made in C$, and (iii) close monitoring of actual
results during project implementation. Below is a summary of ECOPETROL's
projected income statements, balance sheets and cash-flow, expressed in US$ at
projected exchange rates to give the reader a feeling of the orders of
magnitude and to eliminate the effects of domestic inflation, which is
projected to be about double the international inflation after 1984.
5.02       The summarized income statements below show that ECOPETROL would
continue to make profits from 1984 to 1988, which however would not exceed
9.7% of sales (in 1987):

Export sales of fuel oil would continue t.o represent about 25% of total sales,
and imports of crude oil and gasoline wo,ild increase from 29% of operating
costs in 1984 to 40% in 1988.  The operating ratio would remain reasonable at
90% and below.
5.03     The above analysis is based on a presentation of accounts in line
with ECOPETROL's present practice, which however does not adequately take into
account inflation.  For compari.son, the! income statement was adjusted
concerning two aspects, which are partly offsetting:
(a) annual depreciation based on revalued assets rather than historical
values, as in ECOPETRCL's firiancial statements; and
(b) the exchange losses were tak,en into account only for the portion
repayable in each year., rather than the exchange loss on the total
foreign exchange outsta.nding as in ECOPETROL's financial statements.
As a result, depreciation would be atbout double and exchange losses would
decrease about one tenth:

Adjusted Net Income               38          7         84         73       -47
The adjusted net income would still be positive, except for 1988, when the
depreciation adjustment would havE! an overproportional impact due to
compounded local inflation rates ighich would exceed by 15% compounded
devaluation rates.  During supervision of the proposed project, the Bank would
discuss with ECOPETROL the possitbility of adequate inflation accounting.



- 40 -
5.04         The summarized balance sheets below show that the current liabilities
are projected to drop in 1985 and 1936 below the 1984 level due to repayment
of short-term debt which is replaced by long-term debt, so that the current
ratio improves over that period from 0.8 to 1.1, in compliance with the
proposed covenant (para. 5.13).

The equity and reserves would triple from 1984 tc) 1988, while the long-term
debt including pension fund would increase only b y 66Z. As a result, the
debt/equity ratio would improve to 60:40 based. on historical values, and even
30:70 based on revalued assets.  The revaluation o f assets for these
projections are based on a value, which a reputablh! external consultant firm,
Marsh-McLennon (USA) established for ECOPETROL's as sets in 1982 for insurance
purposes, after a detailed desk and field sti.dy.  The revaluation of assets
would be carried out for the calculation of the debt,/equity ratio, but not be
recorded in ECOPETROL's books.  The debt service cov erage ratio would be fully
satisfactory at above 2.0 until 1988.
5.05     The summarized cash flow from 1984 to 1988 b elow shows that the net
operating income before depreciation over this period provides US$2.4 billion
equal to 115% of the proposed investment program of US $2.1 billion.
Additional cash generation comes from the increase in l-he pension fund (9%)
and from non-operating income (10%).  However, inte7.est and principal payments
of long and short term debt during the period are eciual to 53%, increase in
working capital and other assets 11%, and investmenl:s ir. subsidiaries another
7%, leaving 61% for internal financing of ECOPETROL s in vestment program.
Thus ECOPETROL intends to borrow about 40Z of its irivestnient program or US$880
million.

The proposed World Bank loan of JS$130 million would represent some 6% of
ECOPETROL's overall investmer ts cver 1984-88, and about 14.6% of ECOPETROL's
overall long-term borrowings of US$890 million in the period under review.
ECOPETROL would in future re ly to the extent possible on supplier's credits
(US$300 million) to finance part of the equipment required for its
investments. Moreover, ECO'?ETROL is in the process of identifying possible
long-term financing from it s lead 'anks, which could be encouraged further by
a possible B-loan. These L,nd other loans, including the proposed World Bank
loan would finance about U'$590 million. Finally, ECOPETROL expects the
private sector to match EC OPETROL's investment program with the provision of
another US$1.0 billion ov'3r the five-year period.

5.06     The supporting  voliinmetric and pricing assumptions for the above
financial statements are- in Annex 5.2 and are summarized below:

Fuel oil demand is  projectecd to remain static, due to satisfaction of
increased demand b y coal. Demand for gasoline and other products is projected
to increase at 3.5% per anniim, except for other products in 1985.

The aggregate domestic crude production was projected after detailed field by
field analysis. After deduction of crude which is used directly as fuel oil
and addition of imported crude, the production of fuel oil, gasoline and other
products was projected as percentages of refinery throughput. Of the fuel oil
production, part is used for ECOPETROL's internal consumption, part for
domestic sales and the bulk is exported. The difference between gasoline
demand and production is imported ranging at about 10% of demand. Of other
products, the excess of production over demand is exported, ranging at about
8% of production of other products.
5.07      The cost of crude and gasoline imports, and fuel oil and products
exports are based on latest Bank's price projections. Colombia would become a
net exporter in 1986 and 1987 but return net importer in 1988.

5.08     The domestic crude oil purchases by ECOPETROL are projected according
to association contracts (basic, incremental and new crude) and concession
contracts (basic and incremental crude) and by applying the price formulae
agreed for their purchase. In a similar way the cost of gas purchases was
determined.

5.9      The following macroeconomic assumptions were used:
Table 5.8
Inflation and Exchange Rate Variation
1984     1985       1986      1987     1988
Local Inflation                      1.20     1.20       1.20      1.18      1.18
Foreign Inflation                    1.04     1.08       1.09      1.09      1.09
Current Exchange Rate Variation   1.28        1.23       1.13      1.10      1.09
Real Exchange Rate Variation         1.10     1.11       1.03      1.02      1.00
Local inflation is projected at about 20% p.a., whereas international
in.Elation would increase from 4% in 1984 to 9% in 1988. Annual devaluation of
the C$ vs US$ would be 28% in 1984 tapering off to 9% in 1988. This implies a
real devaluation of the C$ in each year, cumulating to 28% until 1988.
5.10     Under the above assumptions, the Government and ECOPETROL would have
to increase consumer prices in C$ by 5% annually over the domestic inflation
rate to maintain ECOPETROL in a sound financial situation, thus meeting the
proposed financial covenants. With this increase and the assumptions used for
foreign and domestic inflation, future exchange rates, and future oil prices,
domestic prices expressed in US$ would increase broadly at the same pace as
current international oil prices (Annex 5.2, Page 9, Coefficient 8).
Major Features and Sensitivity of Financial Projections
5.11     The above financial projections are relatively conservative.  They
are based on domestic production levels, which do not include production from
potential new discoveries, so that domestic production actually declines in
1988. The projections also show that the increasing share of high priced
association crude would rapidly increase ECOPETROL's costs. Association crude
will increase from 13% 38% of Colombia's production in 1983, to $389 in 1988,
while the share of concession crude (at a price of about half the one of
association crude) would decline from 41% to 20%. As a result, the average
cost of purchases by ECOPETROL would more than double in current terms from
US$11.71/Bbl in 1983 to US$26.71/Bbl in 1988.
5.12     Moreover, ECOPETROL's financial projections are highly sensitive to
many of the basic assumptions used, partly because (i) ECOPETROL is involved
in exports and imports, (ii) its purchases of domestic crude are denominated
partly in US$ whereas its sales are in C$, and (iii) its operation is
relatively large. With the annual sales volume of US$1.8 billion in 1983,
even small variations in volume or price of, say, 5% have a major impact on
sales and profits (about US$100 million). The financial projections show that
the continued financial soundness of ECOPETROL will depend on a large number
of factors, but in particular on the three below:
(a)  Domestic Increase in Demand and Crude Oil Production:  At present
ECOPETROL has to import the shortfall between domestic consumption
and production. In 1983 ECOPETROL imported crude at an average price
of US$28/Bbl while it purchased domestically produced crude at an
average price of US$11.71/Bbl. Thus a decrease in production or an
increase of consumption over projected levels would worsen



- 45 -
ECOPETROL's finances considerably. The assumptions result in an
increase of imports volume of gasoline and crude from 44 MBD in 1984
to 64 MBD in 1988.
(b) Price Levels and Exchange Rate: About 60% of ECOPETROL's operating
and investment costs are at prices which are related to international
prices. Thus an increase of the international petroleum price or of
international inflation would increase ECOPETROL's costs
accordingly. In addition, a higher real devaluation of the C$ than
projected levels would also worsen ECOPETROL's financial situation,
given that about 75% of ECOPETROL's revenues, but only about 40% of
its expenditures are in C$, the balance being in foreign exchange.
Finally, domestic inflation at higher levels than projected would
worsen ECOPETROL's finances, unless domestic prices of petroleum
products are adjusted accordingly.
(c) The Investment Program: Obviously, the magnitude of ECOPETROL's
investments, together with ECOPETROL's ability to mobilize long-term
financing will have an important impact on its financial
performance. ECOPETROL's investment program of US$2.1 billion
contains only high yielding projects with fast production increases
(para. 3.25). ECOPETROL is unable to reduce its investment program
any further, without reducing the projected production under (a),
thus damaging its financial performance. The projections show that,
on average, ECOPETROL would be able to finance from internal sources
some 60% of its investment program, after investments in other
companies.
Financial Covenants
5.13     To ensure that ECOPETROL's financial performance will remain
satisfactory, the following assurances have been obtained during negotiations:
(a) ECOPETROL's operating income, before depreciation and debt
service charges, for each full fiscal year shall be equivalent
at all times to at least 1.4 times the aggregated debt service
requirements, for the respective year;
(b) ECOPETROL's long-term debt to equity ratio shall not be greater
than 60:40, based on revaluated assets according to a method to
be agreed by the Bank; ECOPETROL shall complete the
revaluation of assets for the calculation of this covenant not
later than March 31, 1985;
(c) ECOPETROL's current ratio shall be at all times at least 0.8 in
1984, 0.9 in 1985 and 1.1 thereafter;
(d) ECOPETROL will submit to the Bank on an annual basis, not later
than February 28 of each year, detailed five-year financial
projections, including ECOPETROL's five-year investment program
with particular details on investments in the following year,



- 46 -
and financing plan for short-term and long-term borrowing, and
discuss with the Bank measures to be taken if such projections
show that ECOPETROL will not be able to meet one or more of the
financial covenants.
The above assurances constitute in effect a proxy for pricing covenants, as
they will ensure that the prices to ECOPETROL are maintained at adequate
levels; in view of the financial impact of both crude imports, and domestic
crude purchases, domestic prices will have to be maintained close to the
international level.
Financial Rate of Return
5.14     A financial rate of return for the Casabe Enhanced Oil Recovery
Project was calculated conservatively on the basis of the average prices
ECOPETROL is expected to receive for product sales. The calculation appears
at Annex 5.3. The financial rate of return for ECOPETROL is 18.9%, which is
satisfactory. The financial rate of return for the field developments is
identical to the economic return, given that the operators receive
international prices for crude, and that ECOPETROL would have to import crude
in the absence of these field developments.

VI. - ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01     The proposed project constitutes about one third of ECOPETROL's
investment program from 1984 to 1988 and focuses on the production of crude
oil with quick yielding returns. However, ECOPETROL's other planned
investments in exploration, pipelines, and refineries are also of highest
priority to enable ECOPETROL to satisfy adequately domestic demand (para.
3.25). By 1988, the Casabe EOR scheme and the association field developments
would provide an additional production of 36MBD or 20% of Colombia's projected
demand. The annual economic value of this production in 1988, based on the
current replacement cost of imported oil in 1988, would be about US$540
million, or 9% of Colombia's projected imports in 1988. Columbia's share
would be US$450 million and the companies' share would be US$90 million.
Total oil recovery from Casabe EOR scheme and association field developments
over the 20 years life of the project will be 140 million barrels. Concerning
the Cano Limon - Rio Zulia pipeline, for an approximate investment of US$157
million, the yearly saving would be about US$40-50 million based on an
ultimate production of 30MBD from Cano Limon, thus showing a maximum pay-out
period of four years,which is favorable. The estimated rate of return would
be at least 18%. Since the peak production is likely to be higher the
benefits are also likely to be higher.
Casabe EOR Scheme
6.02     The Casabe Enhanced Oil Recovery project will permit the recovery of
an additional 70 million barrels, for an investment (in 1983 prices) of
US$354.3 million. By 1988, additional production will be 20 MBD, equivalent
to annual import savings of US$300 million at 1988 current prices, or 5% of
Colombia's imports. The base economic rate of return was calculated at prices
expressed in constant 1984 dollars and is very favorable at 42.7% (Annex
5.3). The following sensitivity analysis was performed:
Table 6.1
Sensitivity Analysis
Rate of Return (%)

Production Down 25%                                       32.5%
Production Down 50%                                       20.0%
Investments Up 25%                                        34.8%
Investments Up 25%, Production Down 50%                   14.4%
Project Completion Two Years Delayed                      27.6%
Price of Crude Oil Down 25%                               30.0%
As the above table indicates the project remains viable even under the most
pessimistic scenario of an increase of investment cost by 25%, coupled with a
decrease of production by 50%, which is extremely unlikely.

Association Field Development Schemes
6.03     The associations proposed to be included in the project are those
between ECOPETROL and Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Occidental Petroleum, and
Texaco. For all of these ventures, the economic rates of return are a
favorable 23% or higher (Annex 6.1) as the benefits of the investments would
ma-terialize early.

The total production from the four field developments would be 16.5 MBD in
1988 with an annual value of US$246 million at 1988 current prices of which
60% (or us$144 million equal to 2.5% of Colombia's imports) would accrue to
Colombia, the balance being the share of the private operators. Total
production over 20 years would be 70 million barrels.
Conclusion
6.o4     The project would provide significant benefits to the Colombian
economy. It would provide for 20% of Colombia's domestic sales in 1988, it
would replace alternative imports valued at about US$540 million in that year,
thus relieving Colombia's balance of payments and bring Colombia close to self
sufficiency in 1988. In addition, the project would strengthen ECOPETROL's
financial situation, since it would avoid costly imports, and thus generate
sufficient funds to allow further increases in production and reserves.
Moreover, the project would strengthen ECOPETROL's capabilities in the
techniques of enhanced oil recovery, and permit the preparation of additional
EOR projects whose economic benefits can be expected to be important.
Lastly,the environmental component would help ECOPETROL monitor any negative
effects on the environment and develop appropriate guidelines for the
petroleum industry so that the accelerated production program does not cause
enviLronmental damage.

GEOLOGY OF COLOMBIA
General
1.      Colombia's geology is relatively well known, as exploration started as
early as 1916. Colombia's backbone is the northern part of the Andes
Mountains. This mountain system is divided into the Eastern, Central and
Western Cordilleras. The structural grain in the southern part of Colombia is
north-northeast; in the northern part, Eastern Cordillera, and northwest,
Western Cordillera; the Central Cordillera dies in the plains bordering the
Caribbean Sea.
2.      Geomorphostructural subdivisions around the Andean backbone's of
Colombia are from East to West:
(a) The Guyana Shield made out of igneous and metamorphic rocks;
(b) The Oriente Plains with a thick sedimentary pile wedging out toward
the shield;
(c) The Eastern Cordillera composed mainly of sedimentary rocks with
patches of basement; it branches out into the Perija Mountains along
the Colombo-Venezuelan border to the east of Lake Maracaibo, and the
WSW-ENE trending Merida Andes of Venezuela;
(d) The Upper and Middle Rio Magdalena River, a down-faulted sedimentary
area with thick Creataceous formations that have sourced ample
hydrocarbons;
(e) The Central Cordillera and its resurgent, up-faulted block, the Santa
Marta Mountain made out mostly of igneous and metamorphic rocks; snow
capped dormant volcanoes highlight this chain;
(f) The Cauca Valley which exposes intermontane sedimentary sections, so
far devoid of commercial hydrocarbon finds;
(g) The Western Cordillera which also contains mainly igneous and high and
low grade metamorphic rocks; and
(h) The Pacific Coast Range with thick Tertiary sediments often resting on
ultra-basic rocks within an otherwise undetermined section.
3.      The stratigraphic sequence extends from Paleozoic rocks (in the
Eastern Cordillera) to Late Tertiary (particularly along the Caribbean and
Pacific Coast basins), through Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous formations,
the latest ones being particularly extensively developed in central Colombia.
4.      Orogenic events occurred several times during the long geological
history of Colombia; they finally resulted in the present day geomorphic
subdivisions. The main oroganic phases are reported from the end of the
Paleozoic, Early Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Late Tertiary periods.

Petroleum Geology
5.      The prospective sedimentary basins of Colombia including the offshore
cover an area of about 746,000 km2.  These are generally distributed into 12
basins of unequal size and prospectiveness. With the exceptions of the
Pacific Coastal and Cauca Basins, they all have recognized hydrocarbon source
and reservoir rocks with adequate trapping usually of the structural type
(ariticlines and/or faults). Jurassic and particularly Cretaceous shales are
generally considered to be source rocks for the oils trapped in overlying
reservoirs (mostly sands of variable quality, rarely carbonates).
6.      The petroleum basins of Colombia are as follows:
(a) The Upper Rio Magdalena Valley, commonly referred to as the "Upper
Mag" with a 1982 production of about 40.5 million Bbls in the Cabrera,
Dina, Ortega, Tello and Tetuan fields. The overall exploration
success ratio is 0.16.1!
(b) The Middle Magdalena Valley or Mid-Mag, from Honda to El Banco; this
remains the most prolific producer in Colombia with the La Cira,
Infantas, Casabe, Velasquez fields. The 1982 production was about
67.8 million Bbls. The overall success ratio is 0.22.
(c) The Lower Magdalena Valley or Lower Mag which encompasses all the
Caribbean Coast from the Gulf of Uraba in the west to the Santa Marta
massif in the east. Producing fields are: Cicuco, El Dificil, Jobo-
Tablon. The overall success ratio is 0.15. The 1982 production was
about 5.8 million Bbls. So far only minor production in the order of
50 to 100 BD has been established in the Caribbean Coast sub-province
where large mud volcanoes or diapirs are reported along the coast.
These features are similar to those of the Trinidad environment where
abundant oil was discovered.
(d) The Catatumbo Basin corresponds to the western part of the Maracaibo
basin of Venezuela. Well known fields, now essentially depleted, are
Rio de Oro, Petrolea, Rio Zulia, and Tibu. 1982 production was about
2.6 million bbl. The overall success ratio is 0.22.
(e) The Putumayo Region or Oriente Sur bordering with Ecuador, has
several almost depleted fields: Burdine, Churuyaco, Orito, Nancy,
Sucio, Temblon. The 1982 production was 18.2 million bbl. The
success ratio in the Putumayo is 0.24.
(f) The Guajira Peninsula Basin is separated from the Santa Marta Massif
and the Cesar-Rio Rancheria Basin by the Oca fault, a major regional
strike-slip fault. So far only dry gas was discovered (initial
1/ The success ratio is taken to be the number of discoveries (whether
commercial or not) divided by the number of wildcat wells drilled since
the beginning of oil exploration.

Annex 2.1
Page 3 of 3
reserves are around 3.5 TCF) near Rio Acha and current production is
220 MMCFD. The success ratio is 0.19.
(g) The Llanos Orientales Basin situated east-northeast of the Andes is a
deep basin at the foot of the mountains. Great thicknesses, possibly
repeated by faulting, of Tertiary sands and shales overlie a
Cretaceous that contains several shales rich and mature. The shales
are usually considered as the source for the oil accumulated in Lower
Tertiary and uppermost Cretaceous reservoir beds. 1982 production was
about 6.4 million bbl. The success ratio in 1982 was about 0.29.
(h) The Cesar-Rio Rancheria Basin corresponds to an eastwards extension
toward Venezuela of the Lower Mag basin. The same rock sequence
exists; structural and combination traps are reported. So far
exploration efforts have not been successful - 12 dry holes have been
drilled.
(i) The Cauca Basin is an intermontane basin with mainly continental
sediments often of volcanic origin. The prospectiveness of the basin
is rather low and only one exploratory well, a dry hole, was drilled.
() The Pacific Coast - Atrato Basin is a large basin extending from the
Guayaquil area in the south to the Panama Darien in the north in which
hostile environment prevails: rugged topography, lack of
communication network, sparse population and high rainfalls. Tertiary
sediments are reported to be very thick (several thousand meters), but
no good source rock or potential reservoirs have been detected so
far. The Paleocene and Upper Cretaceous formations seem to lie at
great depths except along the edges of the basin where formations
wedge-out against and/or onlap thick basaltic traps of Late Cretaceous
age. Except for a minor gas discovery, no commercial discovery has
been made. However, taking into account the size of the basin, and
the limited amount of exploration undertaken so far, the
prospectiveness of this basin remains to be established.
(k) The Sabana de Bogota Basin corresponds to the plateau about half way
between the Cordillera Oriental and the Rio Magdalena Valley. The
geology consists of folded and faulted Cretaceous sediments with
extremely thick (several thousands of meters) Cretaceous shales which
are often considered to be the source rocks for the Mag Valley
production. Obviously in the Sabana, the prospects if any lie at
greater stratigraphic depths, perhaps Triassic or Upper Paleozoic. So
far four dry holes were drilled.
(1) The Amazonas Basin which consists of the eastern Putumayo and the
Colombian panhandle or trapeze southwards to the Amazon river, has
been little explored due to its remoteness and lack of obvious
petroleum attractiveness. The northern part, along the edge of the
Guyana Shield, might contain heavy oils since it might constitute an
extension of Venezuela's Orinoco tar belt. Exploration would take off
if some interesting results were to be obtained across the border in
Brazil or Peru.

ECOPETROL'S EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION STRATEGY
Objectives
1.       ECOPETROL's principal objectives in exploration and production
consist of increasing the hydrocarbon resource base of the country and
promoting a rapid increase in production so as to achieve self sufficiency in
the near term.
Exploration Strategy
2.       In order to achieve an increase in the hydrocarbon resource base of
the country, ECOPETROL has 42 ongoing association contracts with private oil
companies. These are making a considerable effort in exploration (83 and
63 wells drilled respectively in 1981 and 1982). In addition ECOPETROL is
carrying out a large effort in seismic works (about 14,000 km over 1984-1987)
to help attract additional companies in the most promising basins and drill on
its own about nine exploratory wells annually during the period 1984-1987.
While ECOPETROL's role in exploration is small, it is an important catalyst
for continued effort on the part of companies. On the other hand ECOPETROL
has achieved the same rate of success (about 10%) as the oil companies.
ECOPETROL's strategy has been highly successful in the past and continued
effort at the same level in the future should result in the discovery of
additional reserves of about 150 MMBBLS in the medium term.
ECOPETROL's Exploration Priorities
3.       ECOPETROL will concentrate its drilling efforts in areas of lesser
risk and greater potential while at the same time carrying out seismic works
in the other areas of greater risk where it will attempt to attract private
oil companies. ECOPETROL defined the following order or priority in its
efforts of exploration:
Priority Order
from high to low                              Sedimentary Basins (km2)
1                                   Llanos Orientales (192,000)
2                                   Valle Medio de Magdalena (24,000)
3                                   Putumayo (50,000)
4                                    Catatumbo (8,000)
5                                   Valle Superior de
Magdalena (15,000)
While ECOPETROL will concentrate its efforts in above five
sedimentary basins, it will continue to rely on the very attractive terms of
the association contracts to promote exploration to the private oil sector in
the other sedimentary basins as follows: Valle Inferior de Magdalena (62,000
km2), Guajira (11,000 km2), Pacifica y Valle del Atraco including the offshore
platform (90,000 kn2), Sabana de Bogota (9,000 km2), and Amazonia (108,000
kin2). The effort made by ECOPETROL in exploration promotion however may not
be sufficient and the Bank is discussing with ECOPETROL the possibility of an



- 58 -
Annex 2.5
Page 2 of 2
exploration promotion project in these sedimentary basins which might consist
of additional seismic surveys and reinterpretation of seismic data in order to
make them more attractive to the oil companies.
Production Strategy
4,       ECOPETROL has concentrated its development efforts as follows:  First
on its own high productivity discoveries in the Llanos Orientales such as
Apiay, second on infill and step out wells in its older fields and third on
carrying out secondary recovery and enhanced oil recovery projects in the most
promising fields.
Production Priorities
5.       ECOPETROL is developing Apiay field as the highest priority.  The
reserves are estimated at about 20 MMBBLS while the targeted production by end
1984 is about 7,000 BD. Total investments in wells and production facilities
are about US$13MM. Operating costs are estimated at US$3.0/BBL.
6.       ECOPETROL has also made a consistent and successful effort in the
past in the continuous development of its old fields through infill and step
out wells. As a result production decline has been arrested in certain
fields. This effort will continue in the period 1984-1987 through the
drilling of about 40 wells a year in 13 fields located in 3 operating
districts. The total investment would be about US$225MM with a gain of
production of about 20,000 BD by early 1988. Economic rate of return would be
in excess of 100%.
7.       In the areas of secondary and enhanced oil recovery, ECOPETROL is
injecting about 100,000 BD of water in the field of La Cira that results in a
production of 10,000 BD of oil. Injection of carbon dioxide has also given
some positive results in the Galan field but further tests need to be
conducted.
8.       In association with Texaco, ECOPETROL has entered into a steam
injection program in the field of Cocorna. The additional reserves are
estimated at 52 MMBBLS with an expected total production of about 22,000 BD by
1987. The corresponding investments amount to US$140MM excluding physical and
price contingency.
9.       Finally ECOPETROL is embarking upon a water injection program in
Casabe that would yield 70 MMBBLS additional reserves and an incremental
production of 20,000 BD by 1987 for a total investment of US$329MM excluding
physical and price contingency.
10.      ECOPETROL has also agreed with the Bank to set up a special enhanced
oil recovery unit to promote further secondary and enhanced oil recovery
projects in Colombia and carry out pilot test programs in the near term.
About 200 MMBBLS of additional oil could possibly be recovered in the medium
term, half of which would come from ECOPETROL's own fields and another half
from concessionaires fields. ECOPETROL's special enhanced oil recovery unit
will carry out the necessary studies with the help of consultants to define a
program for recovering additional oil from older fields in Colombia. This
program would be financed under the project.

PETROLEUM PROJECT
FIELDS DEVELOPMENT
IN ASSOCIATION WITH PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES
Summary
1.       The associated operating companies (Elf, Oxy, Texaco and Chevron)
estimated the total additional oil reserves to be recovered from their fields
at about 70 MMBBLS during the next 20-year period. Total investments required
during the period 1984-1987 for drilling new wells, constructing new
production facilities and infrastructure amount to 329.0 MM US$ excluding
physical and price contingencies. Incremental production is about 16,500 BD
by 1988 with operating costs varying between 3JS$/BBL for Oxy and Elf to about
6.2US$/BBL for Texaco steam injection project. These operating costs
represent costs of labor, transport, fuel, consumables and management
overhead, 30 percent of which represent fixed costs and the rest varies with
the level of production. Future oil prices shown in Annex 6.2 represent the
equivalent FOB international oil prices at Cartagena. It is assumed that a
pipeline will be operational to transport Oxy and Elf crude in 1987 and 1988
respectively.
Elf Association
2.       Elf is developing six fields:  Barquerena, Tocaria, Cano Garza, Cano
Garza Norte, Gravo Sur, and Gloria norte with a drilling program of 12 wells
over 1984-1986 for a total of 20 producing wells by 1987.
3.       Elf has installed production manifolds, separators, treaters, storage
tanks and pumping stations in each of Cano Garza, Barquerena and Tocari fields
in 1983 and is planning both their expansion and new surface facilities in
Gravo Sur and Gloria Norte fields by end 1984 to achieve surface production
facilities capacity of about 20000 BD.
4.       Elf estimates total reserves at about 38 MMBBLS. While total
production from these fields may reach 16000 BD, incremental production due to
investments during the period 1984-1987 (86.8 MM US$) excluding physical and
price contingencies) is estimated at about 5200 BD by 1988. This production
level would be maintained for about 4 years before declining at about 8X per
year (Annex 6.2). Operating costs would average 3.0 US$/BBL representing
about the same costs Elf has experienced in Trinidad field in the same
area.   During the period 1984-1987 production from the Casanere fields will
be trucked to the refinery at Barranca Bermeja at a cost of 12.0 US$/BBL.
Starting in 1988 production will be shipped via pipeline at a cost of
6.0 US$/BBL.

Oxy Association
5.       Oxy declared the field of Cano Limon commercial in December 1983.
Reserves are estimated at 37 MMBBLS.l/During 1984-1985 the development program
calls for the drilling of 6 wells in addition to the two discovery wells that
will be converted into producers. In addition Oxy will construct production
facilities including production manifold/flowlines, separation equipment,
crude oil storage and pumping station as well as facilities for the personel
(camp, office), warehouses and an air strip. Total investments over the
period 1984-1987 amount to about 98 MM US$ excluding physical and price
contingencies while operating costs are estimated at 3.0 US$/BBL for an
incremental production of 5000 BD by 1988. This incremental production would
be maintained for about 2 years before onset of decline at about 8% per year
afterwards. Operating costs are in line with those experienced by Elf in the
same area and for the same type of fields. During the period 1984-1986
production will be trucked to the refinery in Barranca Bermeja at a cost of
10.0 US$/BBL while starting in 1987 it will be shipped via a pipeline at a
cost of 5.0 US$/BBL
Texaco Association
6.       Texaco is developing the fields of Cocorna and Nare and starting an
enhanced oil recovery program consisting of huff and puff steam injection in a
reservoir about 2000 foot deep. Estimates of recoverable reserves amount to
52 MMBBLs. Over 1982-1983 Texaco has already drilled 80 wells, is finishing
construction of steam injection facilities with a capacity of 10000 BD, built
a 20 inch oil line, a storage tank and pumping station with 20,000 BD
capacity.
7.       During 1984-1987 Texaco plans to drill 64 additional wells, build 2
additional steam injection units each having a capacity of production of 5000
BD.
8.       Total investments during the period 1984-1987 amount to about 140 MM
US$ for an incremental production of about 5000 BD by 1988. This rate would
be maintained for about 4 years before an onset of 8% annual decline
afterwards. Texaco estimates operating costs at 6.20 US$ which would include
labor, transport, fuel, consumables and management overhead.   Production from
Cocorna is transported via pipeline to the refinery in Barranca Bermeja at a
cost of 0.50 US$/BBL.
Chevron Association
9.       Chevron drilled 3 wells in Castilla field in 1983 for a total fluid
production of 10000 BD, and built a second storage and heating/treating
station to achieve a capacity of dehydration of 15000 BD of total fluid. The
crude produced in Castilla contains high level of metals and is not suitable
for refining. It is sold directly to industries in the Bogota area that use
it as fuel. Chevron estimates reserves at about 25 MMBBLS.
10.      Chevron plans to drill one additional well and improve the
dehydration facilities of the first storage and heating/treating station in
1/ This information is based on data vailable in early 1984. Meanwhile, further
exploration wells were successful and Oxy estimates reserves as significantly
larzer.

1984 for a total investment of 5.0 MM US$ excluding physical and price
contingencies. Incremental production is estimated at 1300 BD by 1988 to be
maintained for about 4 years before declining at about 8% per year. Chevron
estimates operating costs at about 5 US$/BBL representing the costs of labor,
transport, fuel, consumables and management overhead. Production from
Castilla is trucked to Bogota at a cost of 12.0 US$/BBL.

COLOMBIA
PETROLEUM PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL PROJECTION
General
The financial projections are expressed in current pesos (C$). The
main coefficients used for domestic and foreign inflation, exchange rates, and
real domestic and international oil prices are on page 9 of this annex.
I. Income Statements
a. Revenues
The breakdown of oil revenues appears on page 10 of this Annex. The
sales volume is derived from the sales forecast for gasoline, fuel oil and the
products.
The domestic prices to ECOPETROL for 1984 were announced in January
1984, and are as follows:
Product                              C$/Gal              US$/Bbl
Gasoline                                 48.17                20.44
Middle Distillates (average)             50.00                21.07
Fuel Oil                                 40.14                17.03
For future years, the prices were escalated in accordance with the
assumed rates of domestic inflation, and domestic real price increases.
Regarding exports of fuel oil and middle distillate, the average prices
received in 1983 were respectively US$24.17/Bbl and US$42.20/Bbl. In future
years, the export prices were escalated in accordance with the anticipated
international inflation and international real crude oil price increases.
With regard to natural gas, four different prices are in effect, as
follows:
Gas Prices (in effect, January 1984)
C$/MCF               US$/MCF
Electricity L                             44.25                 0.45
Petrochemicals                            77.7                 0.78
Industry and Commerce                    120.0                 1.21
Residential                              135.0                  1.36
1/ Rate excludes subsidy paid by ECOPETROL to power companies which reduce
the effective price paid by utilities further. ECOPETROL has been asked
to provide details.

Annex 5.2

The first three are sales prices to customers. The price of
residential gas is somewhat higher, as the distribution companies
(Barranquilla, Cartagena mostly) charge an additional distribution margin.
In future years, it was assumed that the price of gas would increase
at the same pace as domestic inflation.
Page 12 of this annex shows the breakdown of gas sales by year, and
the corresponding revenues.
b. Expenses
(i) Purchases
ECOPETROL purchases crude oil from the companies operating in
Colombia, and imports crude oil and gasoline. The concession and association
contracts in effect provide for two categories of crude oil, i.e. basic crude
and incremental crude for discoveries made until 1976. The price of basic
crudes, which reflects, inter alia, their qualities, is indexed in accordance
with the following formula:
F = 1 + [0.75 ( A/100 + 0.25 (B/C - 1)]
where A is the annual percentage variation of the international price index, B
is the domestic price index variation, C is the exchange rate variation.
Incremental crude is indexed as follows:
P = Pi (0.3R + 0.2)
where Pi is the c.i.f. import price, and R is the ratio of incremental and
basic productions. The price of incremental crude cannot exceed 50% of the
international price.
In the case of crude oil discovered after 1976, ECOPETROL buys the
crude at the international price. For the purpose of the forecast, the price
of basic crude was assumed to increase at the same pace as international
inflation; the price of incremental crude was escalated in accordance with the
international oil price, taking into account the 50% limit of the c.i.f. price
of imported crude; the price of new crude was assumed to increase in line with
the international oil price. In addition, ECOPETROL buys condensate (on
average 3.1 MBD at US$3.2/Bbl) and pays transportation charge for domestic
crude (estimated at C$76/Bbl in 1984).
Page 12 of this Annex shows the purchases of natural gas. ECOPETROL
buys natural gas from three producing companies. The price of Guajira gas
(US$1.59/MCF in 1984), is linked to the fuel oil price; the prices of El
Dificil, Payoa and Provincia gas (respectively US$0.95, US$0.67 and
US$0.57/MCF) are linked to international inflation; the price of Jobo Sucre
gas (US$0.70/MCF) is constant. In the forecast, the purchase price of gas was
projected in accordance with the contractual arrangements.

Annex 5.2
Page 3 of 13
The quantities of imported oil were derived from the difference
between the demand, and the domestic production (excluding crude used directly
as fuel oil), and the price of imported crude oil was based on US$27.56/Bbl in
1983, and escalated in parallel with the international oil price.
The quantities of gasoline imports were derived from the difference
between domestic production and demand. The future price of gasoline imports
was derived from the actual price paid in 1983 (US$32.71/Bbl), and escalated
in parallel with international crude oil prices.
(ii) Operating Expenses
Direct operating expenses were taken to be C$46.6 billion in 1984
(budget) and escalated in accordance with domestic inflation, and the growth
rate in domestic sales volume.
(iii) Depreciation
With regard to exploration expenditures, including seismic, and
unsuccessful drilling, these are amortized over five years. Development
expenditures are amortized over 10 years. The forecast assumes that the
annual depreciation expense would be equivalent to 12% of the average gross
assets in operation during the year.
(iv) Interest
Interest expense includes the interest on the long term debt (whose
annual breakdown in US$ appears at Page 13), and interest on the short term
debt (assumed to be 15%).
(v) Exchange losses
The amount of exchange losses was calculated by averaging (in US$)
the debt outstanding during the year, and calculating the increase in the
value of that average due to the difference in exchange rates at the year's
beginning and at year end.
(vi) Taxes
As ECOPETROL receives a credit towards income tax equivalent to its
full investment program, it will not have income tax obligations during the
forecast period.
(vii) Other
Non operating income and other, non operating expenses, were assumed
to increase at the same rate as inflation.

II. Balance Sheets
a. Balance Sheet Items
Cash was assumed to be escalating, at the minimum, in accordance with
local inflation.
Accounts receivable were assumed to be 6.5% of domestic sales and 6%
of export sales.
Inventories were assumed to be 8% of total sales, plus 70% of 1983
actual inventories, escalated in accordance with local inflation.
The investment program (in US$) appears in Annex 3.3. Work in
progress was assumed to be 50% of the annual investment program.
Other assets include mostly ECOPETROL's investments in its
subsidiaries, particularly Carbocol. They were assumed to increase in
accordance with ECOPETROL's obligations as follows:
Year              1984      1985       1986      1987       1988
Investment
(C$ million)                6,000    7,320       8,784    337         387
Accounts payable were assumed to be 19% of overall purchases, plus 7%
of crude and gasoline imports, plus 4% of domestic sales (Fondo Vial), plus
30% of actual 1983 accounts payable escalated in accordance with domestic
inflation.
The amount of short term debt is based on ECOPETROL's requirements to
maintain an adequate level of cash.
Other liabilities were assumed to increase at the same pace as
domestic inflation.
No increase in paid-in capital was assumed troughout the forecast.
b. Ratios
(i) current ratio = current assets/current liabilities including
current portion of long-term debt
(ii) long-term debt/equity ratio = (long-term debt 1/ + pension
fund)/(equity + long-term debt 1/ + pension fund)
(iii) long-term debt/equity ratio after revaluation of assets =
(long-term debt 1/ + pension fund)/(equity + long-term debt 1/ +
pension fund + revaluation surplus)
1/ Excluding current portion of long-term debt

(iv) debt service coverage ratio = (operating income +
depreciation)/(debt service) where debt service is interest for
short-term and long-term debt and principal for long-term debt and
reduction, if any, of short-term debt during the year.
c. Revaluation of Assets
Balance Sheet Figures 1983             Revalued Figures 1983
C$MM                                     C$MM

Revaluation Surplus: C$MM 81,693
For 1984 and subsequent years, assets were revalued with local
inflation:
(i)  (revalued gross assets), = (revalued gross assets)    x (local
inflation)t + (increase in gross assets)t x [I + (local inftation-
1)t/2]
(ii)  (accumulated depreciation)t = (revalued acc. dep)t-i x (local
inflation)t + (new depreciationt x [1 + (local inflation- 1) t/21
(iii)  (net revalued assets)t = (revalued gross assets)t - (revalued
accumulated depreciation)t
(iv)  (revaluation surplus)t = (net revalued assets)t - (net
assets)t
III. Volumetric and Production Data (page 10 of this Annex)
a. Crude Production
This is the total domestic crude production; it includes ECOPETROL's
production and that from association and concession contracts (based on a
field by field analysis).
b. Crude Used as Fuel Oil
Due to heavy metal content, some crude does not lend itself for
refining and is therefore used as fuel oiL. This use is estimated at 8 MBD
from 1984 to 1986 and to increase to 10 MBD thereafter.

Annex 5.2
Page 6 of 13
c. Total Throughput
This is a function of domestic demand and the relative import price
of crude and gasoline. The total throughput is projected to be 10% below
refinery capacity in 1984 and reaching 100% in 1987.
d. Imports of Crude
Necessary to provide sufficient crude for the refinery throughput.
Import = total throughput - crude production + crude used as fuel oil - 3.1
MBD.
This 3.1 MBD is condensate produced in the gas fields and is bought by
ECOPETROL.
e. Fuel Oil, Gasoline and Other Products Production and Demand
The domestic demand is given below:
Domestic Demand (MBD)
1984       1985       1986       1987       1988
Fuel Oil                          19         18         19         19         20
Gasoline                          81         84         87         90         93
Other Products                    65         65         67         70          73
TOTAL                          165        167        173        179        186
Fuel oil demand is projected to remain static, due to satisfaction of
increased demand by coal and gas.  Demand for gasoline and other products is
projected to increase at 3.5% per annum, except for other products in 1985.
The production is projected as a percentage of the total throughput. The
average percentages are:
Fuel oil-                             25.7%
Gasoline                              36.8%
Other Products                        34.8%
TOTAL                                 97.3%
Over the years these percentages vary to reflect changing import price
relations of crude and gasoline.
f. Domestic Prices for Petroleum Products
The prices are those received by ECOPETROL in 1983 compounded by the
inflation and real price increase indexes (7) given in page 9.
g. Export Prices for Petroleum Products
These prices are the international prices in 1983 and adjusted for
subsequent years in line with Latest projections of the commodities division,
according to the index (6) in page 9.

h.  Prices for Domestic Purchase of Crude Oil
These price projections for purchase of crude oil are explained in
page 2 of this annex.
IV. Gas Production, Sales and Purchases
a. Production
The production of two fields, i.e. Guajira and Payoa, are expected to
increase by about 4.5% and 3.5% annually. The production of two fields, i.e.
Provincia and Lisarna are expected to stay at the existing levels, whereas the
production of the two fields of El Difficil and Jobo Sucre are projected to
decline rapidly by about 15% and 19% respectively.
b. Purchase Prices
Are explained in page 2 of this annex.
c. Sales
(i) Quantities
Industry demand is projected to increase by an annual average of
8.9%, with an exceptionnally large increase of 28% in 1985 and a smaller rate
than average in subsequent years. Electricity demand is projected to remain
at about the 1983 level, due to new electric power generated by coal.
Residential demand is projected to remain at about 1% of total demand.
(ii) Prices
The prices are those obtained by ECOPETROL in 1983 adjusted for
local inflation every year.
V. Debt Schedule
a.  Chemical Loan:                   The loan of MMUS$ 200 was made in
1979 for ten years including five
years of grace at LIBOR + 3/4%.
Thus first repayments are due in
1984, totaLing MMUS$ 36 annually.
Interest was assumed at 14.5% p.a.
b.  Manufacturers Hanover Trust:   The loan of MMUS$ 100 was made in
1980 for ten years including five
years grace at LIBOR + 5/8%. Thus
first repayments are due in 1986,
totaling MMUS$ 18 annually.
Interest was assumed at 14% p.a.
c.  Other:                           Opening balance 1984:  MMUS$ 74
Average interest: 7.3%
Last repayment: 1991

Assumptions for Financial and Economic Analysis
of Casabe EOR Scheme
The investment costs in constant 1984 prices of US$354.3 million,
which includes physical contingencies but excludes price contingencies, are
distributed over the implementation period from 1984 to 1987. Incremental
production starts in 1985 at 3.85 MBD from the wells already completed by then
and increases to 20 MBD by 1988, when all investments are completed. Full
production capacity is sustained for five years, up to 1992, when the field
experiences a 20% annual decline in production until the year 2003. In the
financial analysis, the price of oil, which ECOPETROL receives was assumed to
be the domestic price of gasoline from 1984 to 1988, expressed in constant
1984 US dollars, minus US$4/Bbl for refining cost. (This conservative
assumption presupposes that in the absence of the scheme other domestic
production would be available and ECOPETROL would not have to import the
equivalent volume at international prices). From 1989 on, the price increase
would be 2% p.a. In the economic rate of return, the price of oil was assumed
to be the international price of crude from 1984 to 1988 as assumed in the
financial projections, but expressed in constant 1984 dollars, and increased
by 2% p.a. thereafter. Thus the total analysis was done in constant 1984
dollars. The operating costs after production at plateau level are calculated
as follows:
fixed = 30% of operating cost at plateau level
variable cost _ 70% of operating cost at plateau level x production
production at plateau level
The operating costs are calculated in the same way for the other fields.
