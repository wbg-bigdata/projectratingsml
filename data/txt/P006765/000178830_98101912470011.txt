STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
I. SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE INDUSTRY IN COLOMBIA 1/
A.   Economic Setting
1.01      Colombia has made substantial progress during the past two decades
in the transition from a predominantly rural and agricultural economy made
up of largely self-contained regions to a more integrated urban industrial
economy. The productive base of the economy has been widened appreciably,
and there has been substantial diversification of production in both the
agricultural and industrial sectors. The country has become less dependent
on coffee as a source of foreign exchange earnings, and fluctuations in
domestic economic conditions resulting from unpredictable shifts in world
coffee prices, while still considerable, have become more manageable.
Colombia's population is becoming increasingly urbanized (66% in 1978), and
the value added of the manufacturing sector is now about 20% of GDP. GDP grew
at an annual average rate of about 6.0% over 1967-78, while the manufacturing
sector expanded at a rate of around 7.0%, which was satisfactory but not
exceptional either in absolute terms or in relation to the GDP growth rate as
a whole. After a seven-year period (1967-74) of fast overall growth of 6.6%
p.a. (Annex 3, Table 1), with manufacturing growing at 8.3% p.a., world
recession and domestic stabilization policies slowed GDP growth to 4.4% p.a.
2/ over 1974-77, and manufacturing growth decelerated to 4.0% p.a. Both rates
rebounded to about 8.5% in 1978. Capacity utilization began to rise in
1976 and reached 86% in 1978. Information on investment in manufacturing is
not yet available for 1977 or 1978, but it is likely to show a strong resur-
gence, as domestic demand has continued to expand rapidly. The current high
capacity operations in much of the sector indicate a need for a substantial
surge in investment over the next few years. Manufacturing employment has
also grown satisfactorily (about 4.5% p.a. over 1964-73), with its share in
total employment rising from 12.4% in 1964 to 15.5% in 1973, the latest year
for which complete figures are available. Factory employment (i.e., in plants
of 5 or more workers) grew at 5.2% p.a. over this period and increased from
6.2% to 8.1% of total employment. Indications are that the share of manufac-
turing employment in total employment has increased further since 1973.
Despite the progress made in industrialization during the past two decades,
Colombia's economy is still based on a large traditional sector on which a
relatively small modern sector is superimposed.
1/   See para. 1.04 for the definitions used in this report for small-scale
and small- and medium-scale industry, respectively.
2/   Gross national income was growing much faster than the 4.4% estimated
for GDP, due to rapidly growing incomes from illegal exports and improved
terms of trade of coffee. Real income appears to have risen as much as
7.8% per year during 1974-77, resulting in heavy demand pressures
and contributing to inflation.



-2-
1.02      The dramatic expansion of manufactured exports that began in 1967
ended in 1975 with the world recession and has since been reversed, as the
unusually large inflows of foreign exchange due to higher coffee prices
and receipts from illegal exports have led to government policies, resulting
in a sharp appreciation of the Colombian peso in real terms. Rapid growth
in coffee exports in the 1975-78 period, together with strong domestic demand
and lower incentives for exporting, reduced the share of manufacturing
exports in total exports to about 14% in 1978. The trade-weighted real
effective exchange rate index for non-coffee exports dropped from 100 in
1970 to 79 in 1978, with much of the decline occurring in 1976 and 1977.
As a share of manufacturing output, exports reached 6.5% in 1974, but were
down to 4% by 1977. It is estimated that manufactured exports decreased 10%
in real terms from 1974 to 1978.
1.03      Relatively uneven income distribution, low productivity and wages,
and scarcity of permanent jobs traditionally have been problems in Colombia.
Along with accelerating inflation, income distribution may have worsened
during the early 1970s as real wages in many sectors of the economy, including
manufacturing, stagnated or fell at a time when average income per capita was
rising. Increases in employment were probably not sufficient to result in
significant improvements in family incomes at the lower end of the scale.
Since about 1975, however, some recovery may have occurred, especially in the
rural sector, as high coffee prices have boosted incomes of producers and
workers, and on average more members of family units have been employed.
Unemployment has generally decreased since 1976, and in early 1979 it was less
than 10%, i.e., lower than at almost any time during the last decade. There
are a number of indications that Colombia's traditional excess supply of labor
is lessening, due mainly to a sharp decline in the population growth rate, a
flow of emigrants to Venezuela and elsewhere, and the rapid expansion of the
economy.
B.   Structure and Characteristics of SMI
1.04      Economic impact.  Small- and medium-scale industry (SMI) plays
an important role in Colombia's industrial sector and deserves special atten-
tion from an economic point of view. There is no generally accepted defini-
tion for either small- or medium-scale industry in Colombia. For the purpose
of this sectoral analysis, SMI is defined as manufacturing enterprises employ-
ing 5 to 99 workers, i.e., the definition adopted by the National Department
of Statistics (DANE) and upon which the national statistics are compiled.
On the other hand, the frequently used Bank definition of small-scale industry
(SSI) is US$250,000 or less in fixed assets. While the two concepts are not
identical, they are similar, and the SMI sector analyzed in this chapter is
representative of the SSI target group of the project (para. 4.13). To
analyze the performance of SMI, a dynamic analysis, tracking the same set of
firms classified as SMI in the initial survey to see how they perform over
time, is preferable to the typical static analysis of comparing firms classi-
fied as SMI or large industry in different years. Unfortunately, the tracking.
data necessary for the dynamic analysis have rarely been collected; except as
noted in para. 1.08, available comprehensive data on SMI in Colombia (and most
other countries) permit only the static analysis.



- 3 -
1.05      In 1978 SMI employed some 45-50% of the labor force in factory
manufacturing, 1/ produced about 25-30% of manufacturing output, and employed
20-25% of the manufacturing sector's assets. Although widely distributed
among all industrial subsectors, SMI is particularly important in the produc-
tion of non-durable consumer goods, and to a lesser extent in the manufacturing
of intermediate goods for large-scale enterprises. Food (15%), apparel and
footwear (16%), and metal products industries (excluding machinery and equip-
ment) (11%), accounted for over 40% of the SMI employmenlt in 1975 (Annex 3,
Tables 2/3). SMI accounts for over 20% of factory employment in all major
industrial categories except the production of beverages, tobacco, textiles
and petroleum/coal.
1.06.     In industries where technical economies of scale are not overly
dominant, SMI has some distinct advantages for a developing economy such
as Colombia's. Average labor intensity and capital productivity of SMI in
Colombia are relatively high 2/ (Annex 3, Table 4), as its investment cost
per job is only about one-third that of large-scale manufacturing (plants
of 100 workers and up). Further, the type and location of the employment
generated differ, with SMI using a greater proportion of unskilled workers;
a higher share of SMI is found in rural areas and small urban centers, which
serves well Colombia's rather segmented local markets.
1.07      SMI makes other less direct contributions to industrial development.
It plays a significant role in the formation of entrepreneurial talent,
providing both a training ground and a context in which underutilized skills
can be put to work. The majority of large firms in Colombia have previously
been among the ranks of SMI. The presence of SMI helps to increase the effi-
ciency of the entire manufacturing sector, 3/ due to both the complementary
relation it has to some large-scale producers and the competition it creates
for others. Large industry and SMI both benefit when the latter provides
intermediate inputs for the former under subcontracting or other arrangements.
While many large firms earn high returns on capital in Colombia, 4/ the
presence of smaller competitors has tended to improve efficiency and thereby
reduce product prices in many sub-sectors. Some larger firms reportedly were
induced to export in the early 1970s by the difficulty of competing with SMI
1/   These data on factory manufacturing exclude productive units of less than
five workers, and household industries. In 1973, this "cottage-shop"
sector accounted for nearly half of all manufacturing employment.
2/   Based on 1976 data for Colombia, the ratio of market price to opportunity
cost (shadow price) is greater for labor than for capital, implying that
capital is "underpriced" in the market relative to labor.
3/   Capital productivity of large plants was observed by Todd to be higher in
those three-digit industries in which a significant share of output came
from SMI.  (John Todd, Efficiency and Plant Size in Colombian Manufactur-
ing, Yale Ph.D. dissertation, 1972.)

forthcoming.

in the domestic market. 1/ Promotion of SMI can also be an effective means of
increasing output in the short run, as the lead time required by SMI to increase
production is generally shorter than for larger firms.
1.08      Performance.  The growth performance of Colombian SMI firms during the
1970s was reasonably good. The increase in employment in SMI enterprises be-
tween 1970 and 1975 amounted to 3.2% p.a., while value added in constant prices
rose 2.5% p.a.   The corresponding figure for larger industries was 7.5%
for employment and 4.4% for value added (Annex 3, Table 5). However, these
figures may be misleading, as the contraction or expansion of individual firms
can lead to a change in their classification over time, so that the enterprises
making up the SMI or larger industry group in one year may be markedly differ-
ent in subsequent years. A study by the Colombian statistical office, DANE,
of the growth patterns of a sample of firms defined as SMI in 1970 indicated
that through 1975 there had been an increase in employment of these firms of
4.5% p.a. For a sample of larger firms in the study their rate of increase in
employment was only 3.3% p.a. These data suggest that the higher growth rate
for the entire group of larger firms in the economy in those years was due
to the appearance of new firms in this category, most of which came from SMI
enterprises "graduating" into the larger group. In general, SMI has been in a
good position to take advantage of the rapid growth of domestic demand during
the 1970s due to SMI's flexibility in modifying output, and the fact that it
is less constrained by national market size. Aggregate SMI employment and
output growth has been most rapid in the metal working industries (Annex 3,
Table 6), with the average annual increase in employment above 6% in recent
years. Wooden furniture, leather, and chemicals also recorded rapid employment
growth.
1.09      Average labor productivity 2/ in SMI, while above that of the
economy as a whole by about 45% in 1975, rose little during the decade 1966-75;
as a result, increases in output were associated with increases in employment
rather than productivity gains. This is a desirable result for a labor surplus
economy, ceteris paribus, as it implies a greater relative use of abundant
labor than scarce capital. Between 1966 and 1975 the annual growth rate in
labor productivity was 1.8%, which is relatively low for a country that has
been growing as rapidly as Colombia and lower than the 2.8% of the previous
decade (1956-66). The rapid growth of factory employment in the last decade
was fostered by stagnant real wages and the expansion of export-oriented
industry. After allowing for differences in labor force composition, labor
productivity is probably 20-35% lower in SMI than in large industry, a differ-
ential which appears to have been rather stable over the years. A wage
differential of 10-30% 3/ between SMI and large industry exists, due mainly to
(a) the effects of unions in larger plants, and (b) greater efforts by larger
industry to decrease job turnover by paying higher wages.

-5-
1.10      The nature of growth in SMI firms is likely to change in the future,
however, as it appears that the labor surplus condition typical of the Colombian
economy may be much less pronounced in the future than it has been in the past.
In this case, higher labor productivity will then become necessary for continued
success, which will depend on the ability, especially of smaller firms, to
increase their capitAl and modify their production processes. Adequate access
to credit and to technical assistance will become increasingly important. If
the experience follows the pattern of other countries (e.g., Japan and Taiwan)
which have passed through this transition, real wages will advance rather
quickly. Although this transition is likely to be gradual, it is nevertheless
important that the requisite institutional structures to aid SMI be strengthened
in advance of the tightening of the labor market.
C.   Growth and Development Constraints
1.11      While many efficient SMIs have thrived, others which also have good
potential are hampered by a number of obstacles. Inadequate access to credit
on terms suitable to finance either fixed asset purchases or working capital
seems to be among the most important of SMIs' development constraints. Due to
their weaker bargaining position, many SMIs have to finance sales for 90 days,
yet are forced to pay cash for raw materials. With the prevailing tight
credit situation in Colombia (para. 2.02), a manufacturing enterprise often
has to pay its suppliers in advance and/or make credit available to its
customers in order to increase its sales and capacity utilization rate.
Moreover, the problem is compounded by reluctance on the part of financial
institutions to lend to small industry because of (a) greater risks of failure;
(b) lack of acceptable guarantees; (c) higher administrative costs in process-
ing and handling relatively small loans; (d) lack of reliable accounting
information; and (e) limited possibilities for additional income from other
banking transactions of SMIs. Recent surveys I/ have shown that the institu-
tional credit/value added ratio was 0.11 for SMI as against 0.32 for large
industry. On average, credit provided about 70% of the sources of funds for
large industry, but less than 45% of the funds of SMI, indicative of the
easier access to cre'dit of large firms.
1.12      Inadequate and expensive raw materials supply affects product
quality and capacity utilization, and weakens SMI's ability to compete with
larger industry. The purchasing capacity of SMIs is often too small for
effective negotiations with raw material producers and usually compels them
to purchase through middlemen charging mark-ups of 25-40%. Raw material
availability problems also reflect both disorganized and monopolized markets.
Conglomerates of large input and final goods producers has been able, in some
cases, to squeeze out SMIs with a view to consolidating their'market control.
Liberalization of raw material import restrictions and support for SMI in
input producing industries could help to maintain competitive markets for
those products and thus contribute to the development of SMIs.

research association).



-6-
1.13      On the other hand, several innate advantages have helped a number of
SMIs in several subsectors to compete effectively with larger industry. Lower
labor costs give SMI some advantage, as does the ability to adapt low-cost
techniques to their needs. In some industries, the ability to interact
closely with clients assists productive innovation and adaptation. Capacity
to react quickly to evolving market demand has been important in recent years.
Finally, some SMIs are protected by regional market segmentation in Colombia
which raises distribution costs for large-scale producers. However, possible
changes in policy to remove many of the above constraints to SMI growth,
encourage competition and promote appropriate factor prices, could bolster SMI
and likely improve overall industrial sector performance.
D.   Government Policies
1.14      Colombia's 1975-78 development plan gave emphasis to rural develop-
ment, economic decentralization, and more equal income distribution. For the
first time, the plan emphasized SMI's economic and social importance in creating
employment opportunities and furthering regional development. On the other hand,
policy-making mechanisms to promote SMI have not been well coordinated, and
public and private institutions providing assistance to SMI have suffered from
a lack of coordination and long-term planning. There is a need to institu-
tionalize within the government responsibility for (i) gauging the impact of
the existing and proposed government policies and programs on SMI; (ii) ensur-
ing a sufficient and timely flow of resources to SMI; (iii) taking steps
conducive to countrywide promotion and coordination of technical and financial
services to SMI; and (iv) establishing a coordinated policy framework to
promote SMI.
1.15      While the National Planning Department is charged with formulating
national policies and budget priorities, it cannot be expected to undertake on
a continuing basis detailed analyses of SMI policy alternatives. Corporacion
Financiera Popular (CFP), with its long experience and specific objectives of
supporting SMI, is now in the process of rebuilding its research department.
A main topic would be to review the current practice and proposed policies
regarding availability of and access to credit for SMI. Another important
component of such research would be geared to a fuller understanding of the
character, regional distribution, and growth process of SMI. Sufficient raw
data now exist, including those of CFP, DANE, and other public entities, to
permit considerable headway along these lines. Also, the impact on SMI of
the issues described below will be studied on an ongoing basis by CFP, and
the results of such studies will be available to the government for policy
decisions.
(1)  Raw materials availability and price.  SMI complaints about
difficulties in raw materials availability and high prices are
frequent. One solution, cooperative purchasing by SMI firms,
has not yet had much success in Colombia. Facilitating and
encouraging raw material imports for SMI would both counteract
monopoly power of raw material suppliers in some subsectors and
alleviate scarcities suffered by SMI.



(2)  Access to improved technology  nd to reasonably priced machinery.
The competitive position of SMI often rests on the ability to
acquire productive equipment which can be used in more labor-
intensive and smaller-scale production processes than that used
by large firms. Equipment is frequently second hand, adapted or
renovated., Policy steps which could assist SMI in the6e respects
include: (a) encouragement of information flows with respect to
available technology, including courses, arranging meetings, circula-
tion of published information, and organization of information for
consultation; (b) support for research in relevant technological
innovations and adaptations; and (c) greater technical assistance in
the purchase of both imported and locally procured used machinery.
(3) Government procurement. The public sector, including many impor-
tant decentralized agencies, accounts for a large volume of purchases
of manufactured goods, many of which can be produced by SMI (e.g.,
office supplies). To facilitate SMI bids, the government could
(i) give wider publicity to available procurement contracts and
simplify bidding procedures; (ii) reduce for SMI the typical 6-12
months delays in payment of bills that cause more difficulty for SMI
than for larger industry; and (iii) focus on relatively small but
still efficient contract sizes.
(4) Industrial parks have received much attention as a tool of
regional decentralization and SMI development. CFP plans to use
an industrial condominium-type approach, whereby CFP first finances
the construction of industrial parks and subsequently the purchase of
individual factory shells. Industrial parks should be an efficient
tool for moving industry from the major urban centers to nearby
industrial zones, but are not likely to provide sufficient
motivation by themselves to lure industry to the less developed
regions of Colombia.
E.   Prospects
1.16      SMI contributed significantly to the growth of output and employment
in Colombian manufacturing during 1970-78 and, if given sufficient access to
credit and an adequate economic environment, can play an important role in the
future. It appears that the number of small entrepreneurs increased substan-
tially in the 1970s, due mainly to better formal education and the substantial
experience managers and employees accumulated in both SMI and large industry,
which enabled them to establish their own businesses. A continuation of the
recent healthy overall economic growth is expected, and the increasing com-
plexity of the economy, coupled with rising income levels, is creating signi-
ficant demands for new products. The Colombian economy is expected to continue
to grow at about 6-7% per year through 1983, and factory manufacturing at 7-9%.
Past experience indicates that the value added of firms in the SMI size range
should also be growing at about the average growth rate for the manufacturing
sector. With SMI's output/capital ratio probably continuing to be somewhat
above the total factory manufacturing sector's average of about 0.5, i.e., at
least 0.6 to 0.7, the net additional capital 1/ required to sustain an SMI
growth rate of 7-9% per year would be as follows:

This implies average net investment increases by SMI of around US$105-140
million p.a. during 1979-83, about one-third of which would represent fixed
asset investments, and the remainder working capital. The proposed Bank loan
(para. 4.12) would finance the equivalent of 8-10% of the investment during
the estimated three-year disbursement period.
II. FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMI
A.   The Financial Sector and Policy Framework
2.01.     Colombia's relatively well-diversified financial system consists
of the central bank (BR), commercial banks, development banks (financieras,
including CFP), one public industrial investment bank (IFI), one public
agricultural bank, one public mortgage bank, several savings and loan associa-
tions, insurance companies, mutual funds and two stock exchanges (in Bogota
and Medellin). The system's structure has been shaped by past government
policies favoring institutional specialization. The existing 26 commercial
banks (23 private and 3 public) dominate the regulated financial system,
accounting for 42% of the institutional portfolio in December 1978 (Annex 3,
Table 7). The savings and loan associations (17.5%) and the financieras
(16.3%) rank next, followed by the mortgage bank (10.6%) and the agricultural
bank (9.7%). Lending by these institutions is supplemented by BR rediscounting
facilities which have been established to finance particular sectors. For
industry the most important of these funds are (a) Fondo Financiero Industrial
(FFI), which rediscounts loans made by financial institutions to mostly SMIs;
(b) Fondo de Inversiones Privadas (FIP), which generally serves firms larger
than those covered by FFI; and (c) Fondo de Promocion de Exportaciones (PROEXPO),
which provides primarily export credit to a wide range of exporters.
2.02.     For many years the financial system has been subject to strict
government control through a complex system of reserve requirements, forced
investment regulations and official interest rate ceilings that vary according
to the various categories of borrowers and savers, and that are established by
Colombia's Monetary Board (Junta Monetaria). In the past three years, the



-9-
government has reinforced measures aimed at restricting money supply growth,
principally by establishing reserve requirements for commercial banks of 46%
of sight deposit levels existing on January 31, 1977, and of 100% of deposits
in excess of these levels. The resulting average reserve requirements for
commercial banks s presently around 80%, which has strongly limited commercial
banks' ability to expand credit. Consequently, about 78% of t e portfolio
increase of commercial banks in 1977 and 1978 was financed with BR loans or
rediscounts from the development funds.
2.03.     As a result of the tight monetary policies, institutional credit for
most economic activities has been severely curtailed. While the consolidated
outstanding portfolio of the financial system grew in real terms at an average
rate of 4.1% p.a. in 1973-78, the industrial loan portfolio increased by only
1.8% p.a. in the period, compared to a 7.4% p.a. average growth rate of
industrial value added. The private financieras have continuously increased
their share of the total institutional industrial portfolio, from 42.9% in
1973 to 53.3% in 1978 (see Table 2.1 below). Still, the share of the industrial
portfolio within the financial system decreased from 34% in 1973 to 30.7% in
1978, and industry has been forced increasingly to tap the extrabank (largely
non-institutional) credit market. On the other hand, in February 1980 the
Monetary Board removed the 100% marginal reserve requirement and increased
over a 5-month period the average reserve requirement to 50%; this move should
result in a more rapid expansion of commercial credit to industry and other
sectors.

B.   SMI Financing
2.04               Since the 1960s it has been difficult for SMI to obtain access to
financing from either commercial banks or the extrabank market. Table 2.2
shows the evolution of SMI financing by various types of institutions between
1973 and 1978. Over 60% of the SMI loan portfolio of commercial banks and
financieras is now financed by FFI or other special credit lines. However,
while in aggregate the amount of public funds available for lending to SMI has
increased in real terms since 1974, it still represents only about 10% of the
total available for industry (as compared with SMI's 25% share in output and
industrial sector assets), and increases in available resources have come in
sporadic doses that have not always been conducive to the steady institutional
development of SMI lenders.

2.05      Interest rates. I/  The cost of industrial credit varies according
to the source and terms of funds used. Maximum nominal interest rates are
established by the monetary authorities, but financial intermediaries, through
additional charges and collection of interest in advance, can vary the cost of
funds. As a result, effective interest rates from private intermediaries vary
between 35-40% p.a. on short-term loans; for comparable loans the extrab3anking
market is charging 40% p.a. and more. The interest rates on short-term loans
have increased about 4-8 points in the last year as the Monetary Board has
steadily restricted lending growth. In a major policy shift, the Monetary
Board in February 1980 freed interest rates on certificates of deposits and on
short-term loans; it is still too early to gauge the impact of this shift.
Intermediaries charge effective rates of 25-30% p.a. for medium- and long-term
loans using BR rediscounting facilities. Term loans to SMIs using BR redis-
counting facilities have interest rates between 22% and 27% p.a., but these
funds can be scarce. The comparable annual effective interest rate on Bank
subloans under the DFC-type projects is 27-30%, i.e., at the high end of the
range for BR rediscounting lines. Most rates on BR rediscount lines (many of
which were recently increased ) have generally been positive in real terms, as
inflation averaged 23-24% from 1976-79. With the objective of maintaining
positive interest rates in real terms under the proposed loan, the government
and BR have agreed to review subloan interest rates semi-annually and, if
necessary, make modifications (para. 4.14).
C.   Institutional Credit for SMI 2/
2.06      Fondo Financiero Industrial was created by the Monetary Board
in 1968 with the objective of financing, through commercial banks and
financieras, investment necessary for production increases of SMI. FFI
finances working capital, fixed assets, debt consolidation, and technical
assistance. Small and medium industry and mines are eligible for financing,
subject to certain limitations depending on the location, size, cost per job,
and export performance of the firm (Annex 3, Table 8).
2.07      A wide variety of financial intermediaries have made more than
10,000 loans with FFI funds for a total of Col$6.7 billion. 3/ Of these,
about 50% by number and two-thirds by amount were lent during the three-
and-a-half-year period ending June 1978. While greater resource availability
has allowed FFI lending to increase (Annex 3, Table 9), the raising of asset
limits for eligible FFI subborrowers to a maximum of Col$60 million (which is
well into the medium industry range) and increasing scarcity of credit
from other sources have left FFI resources inadequate to meet demand, par-
ticularly of smaller firms.   The FFI had a sufficient positive interest
1/   All interest rates stated in this paragraph are annual effective rates,
taking account of interest prepayments, but no other charges or loan-
related costs to the borrower.
2/   Corporacion Financiera Popular is treated separately in the following
chapter.

spread until 1977, when Resolution 71/76 raised the interest rate paid by BR
on legal reserves of banks (which are FFI's major source of funds) from 18% to
23% without allowing for a corresponding increase in onlending rates. BR
planned to sell bonds for Col$1,270 million in 1979 and Col$851 million in
1980 to obtain enough resources to at least maintain FFI's disbursements
at the 1978 level (Col$2,400 million). However, these resources could repre-
sent a heavy cost to BR, since the interest rates that it would have to offer
to prospective bond holders (similar to the 27.5-28% rate for the newly
created Titulos Agroindustriales) are much higher than the present 19-20%
average FFI rediscounting rate. For this reason, BR also channels to
FFI some bank reserves that have no cost to BR, in order that FFI on the
whole has a positive spread between cost of funds and interest rate charged.
2.08      Over the past ten years, FFI has shown itself to be an effective
mechanism for providing credits for SMI. With a year-end 1978 portfolio of
Col$2.9 billion (US$68 million equivalent), it is estimated that FFI has
provided credits to over half the enterprises in the SMI sector, and perhaps
as many as three-fourths of the enterprises eligible under FFI regulations
(Annex 3, Table 9).
2.09      Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (CAJA), a public develop-
ment bank, was created in 1933 to provide mainly agricultural credit to clients
with no access to other financial institutions. While CAJA has made some
efforts to provide industrial credit, it has limited itself to carrying
out very small programs usually related to rural industrialization. As of
June 30, 1978, CAJA's industrial portfolio amounted to only Col$510 million,
equivalent to 2.7% of CAJA's total portfolio of Col$18.9 billion. CAJA has
been facing financial difficulties, due mainly to very high adminis-
trative costs (18% of portfolio in 1978) and over-diversification without
having adequate management controls. The average size of CAJA's loans has
been substantially lower than SMI loans made by other institutions for two
reasons: (a) the Junta Monetaria has established that CAJA can lend with its
own resources only to enterprises with assets below Col$750,000 and for
amounts not exceeding Col$300,000; and (b) CAJA has an extensive branch
network of 844 branches that can reach many places not covered by other
financial institutions.  However, the Junta Monetaria's policy of limiting
CAJA industrial financing to lending only to very small enterprises at a very
low interest rate (14%) has prevented CAJA from playing a more important
role in the SMI sector (Annex 3, Table 10). In 1977, reflecting a change in
policy, CAJA transferred or released its industrial lending staff, and now has
little capability for small industry lending on a significant scale.
2.10      In addition to FFI, CFP and CAJA, other financial institutions also
provide resources to SMIs in limited amounts. The most significant ones are:
(i) Private financieras and commercial banks. Most of the credit
provided by private intermediaries involves FFI loans, predominantly to the
upper range of SMI clients. Also, the intermediaries provide some short-term
credit in the form of overdraft facilities based on the SMI entrepreneur's
creditworthiness. While sufficient data are not available to quantify the
amount of the latter type of credit, since it is classified as consumer loans,
it is considered to be fairly small in aggregate terms but quite helpful to most
of the modern, formal sector SMI in maintaining adequate liquidity positions.



- 13 -
(ii) PROEXPO, the government's export promotion agency, has been offering
credit through the banking system at preferential rates for exporting enter-
prises (17% p.a. to final borrowers as of December 1979). Its contribution
to SMI, however, has been relatively marginal, since most exporting enterprises
are outside the size range of SMIs.
(iii) Instituto ue Financiamiento y Desarrollo Cooperativo (FINANCIACOOP)
was created in 1969 to meet the particular needs of cooperatives in Colombia.
By the end of 1978, FINANCIACOOP's outstanding portfolio amounted to Col$800
million (US$19 million), of which Col$100 million were granted to some 20
small industrial production cooperatives. Loans are generally for up to 3
years at an annual interest rate of 17% plus a commission of 4%; in addition,
borrowers are required to buy FINANCIACOOP shares equivalent to 5% of the loan
size. While FINANCIACOOP has been marginal in its assistance to small industrial
production cooperatives, it may have a useful role to play in assisting SMI,
especially in the fields of inputs purchasing, marketing, and possibly manu-
facturing.
D.   Sources of Technical Assistance to SMI
2.11      Overview and experience.  Considerable financial and human resources
have been mobilized during the past decade to provide technical assistance
for SMI in Colombia. However, establishing and maintaining a competent
technical assistance staff has proved to be quite difficult, even in the
large urban centers, as government institutions generally cannot offer com-
petitive salaries to experienced technical assistance specialists. Further-
more, lack of coordination and planning of the institutions involved has
presented a major obstacle to the optimum use of limited resources, as there
is no consistent national strategy for technical assistance, and knowledge
of overall or specific needs for technical assistance and availability of
service is deficient.
2.12      On the other hand, the experience that institutions have gained,
combined with the higher priority now being placed on technical assistance,
is likely to lead to improvements in the future. Most importantly, the
institutions have learned that any technical assistance must offer clearly
identifiable benefits to the firm, such as increased profits commensurate
with the effort required by the entrepreneur, and that any group training must
be accompanied by individual attention within the enterprise to translate the
general principles into specific action. Finally, they have also learned that
efficient systems.must be developed to translate strategies formulated at the
national level into local actions. These lessons are now being incorporated
into the various technical assistance programs described below.
2.13      Need for technical assistance.  CFP estimates that operations
of half of Colombia's 12,000 SMIs could benefit from direct technical assist-
ance. The areas with the most pressing need for direct consultancy are
(a) financial control and marketing, (b) production and quality control,
(c) development of entrepreneurial capabilities through general management
seminars and courses, and (d) information on technological development, new
markets and sources of credit. Medium-scale industry, in particular, also
needs readier access to information on export markets and procedures.



- 14 -
2.14      Sources of technical assistance.  Private consultants specializing
in SMI play a small but important role in satisfying the most pressing needs
for individual in-plant problem solving. However, the majority of SMI con-
sultants are located in Bogota, Medellin and Cali, and potential customers
in other parts of the country face problems in finding suitable consultants.
Private consultants are seen by many small firms as costly considering their
likely benefit. This view has affected the willingness of SMIs to utilize
available technical assistance credit or to pay fees adequate to attract
capable individuals in sufficient numbers to the consulting profession.
Convincing the smaller firms of the cost effectiveness of private technical
assistance will require more evidence of obvious successes. Also, at least
initially, smaller firms should not be asked to bear the full cost of the
technical assistance. The resulting subsidy should normally be borne by the
government, by offering either low-interest loans to finance private technical
assistance or low-cost or free services of public technical assistance agencies.
2.15      Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA), Colombia's vocational
training agency, is by far the most important technical assistance institution
in terms of size of staff and sectoral and regional coverage of assistance
to SMI. SENA currently employs about 120 industrial advisors in 18 regional
offices who provide assistance to about 1,500 entrepreneurs per year. Mostly
in the framework of cooperation with other institutions, SENA developed a
large number of programs in various subject areas with the intention of
helping to improve specific operational aspects of the firm. Assistance
provided by SENA was in the form of an unstructured mix of seminars and
conferences for entrepreneurs and senior employees, as well as some individual
in-plant consultancy.
2.16      On the basis of an in-depth analysis of effectiveness and constraints
on its technical assistance, SENA revised its programs in 1978. The new
approach to technical assistance, now being implemented, will broaden the
scope of assistance provided by SENA towards "integral assistance" covering all
major areas of an enterprise's activity. Integral assistance is designed to
improve management of SMI through two consecutive group and individual training
sessions of 100 hours each spread over about six months, giving equal weight
to: (i) general management, (ii) marketing, (iii) production (process and
technology), (iv) finance and accounting, and (v) industrial relations. The
seminars would be followed by a series of individual consultancy assistance to
the participants, with the intention of putting into practice within the
enterprises the concepts presented in the seminars. Most importantly, each
participating entrepreneur would be assisted in self-diagnosing deficiencies
and in preparing an action plan to remedy them. This would also lead to the
identification of financial requirements and the preparation of longer-term
development plans for the enterprises. SENA's staffing plans are well in
accordance with its new approach, as the current professional staff for
technical assistance to SMI will more than double to 250 by 1985. This should
enable SENA to provide technical assistance to between 1,500 and 2,000 SMIs
annually in 1980-85, while substantially improving the quality and broadening
the scope of assistance (para. 3.29).
2.17      Fundacion para el Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica
(FICITEC) is a small private non-profit organization which is providing
in-depth, long-term consultancy to about 20 mostly medium-scale enterprises
per year. FICITEC's volume of activities has been stagnating for quite



- 15 -
some time and its overall focus is tending toward research. In 1976
PROEXPO established, in support of its activities of financing Colombia's
non-traditional exports, a small group of five specialists who have been
increasingly effective in providing useful assistance to exporting SMIs, which
are generally the larger and better organized firms.  Two gover _ -at institu-
tions, Instituto de Investigaciones Tecnologicas (IIT) and the Fondo Colombiano
de Investigaciones Cientificas y Proyectos Especiales (COLCIENCIAS), are
active in technological research and transfer of industrial technology to SMI.
COLCIENCIAS has recently initiated several innovative programs and is playing
the more active role in supporting SMI. However, since both COLCIENCIAS and
IIT allocate only a small share of their human and financial resources to
SMI, the overall effect will remain limited.
TII. CORPORACION FINANCIERA POPULAR
A.   Basic Structure
3.01      Ownership.  Banco Popular, a government-owned commercial bank,
founded CFP in 1967 in response to a study undertaken in 1962 to determine
the needs of Colombia's SMI. CFP's main institutional objective, as broadly
defined in its statutes, is to assist in the promotion and development of
small- and medium-scale productive enterprises by providing medium- and
long-term financing. To achieve these goals, CFP's operations are governed
by a Statement of Policies ("Guias Operacionales"), which has been modified
from time to time to reflect the evolution of CFP's operations. The present
statement was agreed upon between CFP and the Bank prior to implementation of
Loan 1451-CO, and would continue to guide CFP operations under the proposed
project. CFP agreed at negotiations that, except as explained in para. 3.25,
it would not modify its policy statement in any way that would materially
(and adversely) affect the financial condition or operations of CFP.
3.02      To provide local financing as required under Loan 1451-CO, PROEXPO
contributed Col$150 m llionr ir equity to CFP during 1978. This had the
effect of giving majority (52%) ownership of CFP (Annex 3, Table 11) to PROEXPO.
In practice, however, the Ministry of Economic Development (12% ownership), to
which both PROEXPO and CFP are administratively attached, has played the key
role in guiding CFP since 1975. CFP has received increasingly strong support
from the Ministry, which has clearly helped in its institutional development.
Banco Popular and its subsidiary, the Corporacion de Ferias y Exposiciones,
now hold 35% of CFP's equity.
3.03      Management and staffing.  The salient position of the Ministry
of Economic Development notwithstanding, major decisions on CFP's operations
are taken by the 8-member Board of Directors (Annex 3, Table 12), which has a
broad representation from government, private sector, and industrial associa-
tions. Board members generally take a keen interest in CFP operations,
and are well informed about CFP activities. Appropriately, the Board has
recently delegated to CFP's manager increased authority in the selection of
key management staff and establishment of creditworthiness criteria for
borrowing. A Board-appointed four-member Loan Committee has responsibility
for approval of medium-sized loans (up to Col$5 million), while the Board
reviews most larger loans itself.



- 16 -
3.04      CFP's Regional Advisory Boards (RABs), the first of which were
created in 1976 to increase the local linkage of CFP regional offices,
have been quite successful. The RABs are normally composed of the manager of
the local Banco Popular office, a local representative of ACOPI 1/ (the SSI
association), and two prominent local bankers or industrialists. The RABs'
first-hand knowledge of the local environment and entrepreneurs has made
them quite effective in their role of reviewing and approving credit
applications. Also, the RABs' close contact with the local industrialists
ensures that management of CFP receives feedback from clients on the quality
of services. Finally, the RABs are improving coordination among CFP and other
local entities that could assist SMI, and are promoting a comprehensive
approach to dealing with the needs of SMI.
3.05      While CFP's staff is relatively young and inexperienced, on the
whole they possess sufficient knowledge and skills to carry out their tasks
effectively. As with many public sector institutions in Colombia, management
and staff turnover (Annex 3, Table 13) has been a problem. While CFP
achieved a period of relative management stability from 1975 to mid-1977, and
made substantial progress in institutional development, a complete management
turnover in August 1977 dealt a serious blow to CFP. The ensuing management,
made sharp cuts in salaries and staff levels which tended to erase some of
the accomplishments of the prior administration. During the twelve months
to August 1978, over half of CFP's professional staff left the institution.
However, the present management team, which assumed control in September
1978 following the change in government, is raising CFP's operational effec-
tiveness and consolidating its organization (Annex 3, Table 14).
3.06      A major accomplishment of the present management has been to halt
staff turnover and improve morale, mainly by raising salaries and instituting
a policy of promotion from within. Most department managers now have at least
three years of experience with CFP and at least one year in their current
jobs; their collective experience is helping to streamline procedures and
improve operating practices. The management has also emphasized productivity
and monitored more closely the efforts of regional offices to increase
lending while containing costs. Whereas professional staff increased from 66
to 153 during 1974-76, the number had been cut to 129 by year-end 1977,
leading to decreases in certain important ancillary services such as technical
assistance. CFP plans small increases in professional staff in line with
expanding operations, with emphasis on strengthening technical assistance
services at the regional office level.
3.07      CFP expanded its regional offices from 9 to 14 in 1975 to support
national policies of promoting industrial'decentralization. While at first
several of the additional offices had difficulty in generating sufficient
revenues to cover overhead costs, promotion and "word of mouth" publicity has
greatly improved loan demand in the new areas. The performance of each
regional office now depends far more on its own effectiveness than the
smallness of the market it serves; except for the large offices in Bogota,
1/   Asociacion Colombiana Popular de Industrias.



- 17 -
Medellin, and Cali, cost efficiency (as measured by administrative costs per
loan) does not vary much by office size. CFP has no plans to open additional
offices, as it feels that the present network can adequately serve the needs
of a large proportion of SSI.
3.08      CFP has recently received a US$300,000 UNDP grant for a UNIDO-
executed technical assistance project, to provide experts in cooperatives,
marketing, loan supervision, loan appraisal, financial systems, industrial
parks development and information systems. The Bank assisted in the design of
the project, and is following closely its implementation. The UNIDO project
coordinator, who is experienced in SSI development and knows CFP well, can be
expected to ensure that each of the experts, and the UNDP project as a whole,
make a significant contribution to CFP's institutional development.
B.   Systems and Procedures
3.09      Loan appraisal and supervision.  Appraisal quality, while gener-
ally good, has decreased somewhat under the second Bank loan, due to
large staff turnover in the operations area of CFP and the long period with-
out term resources between the two Bank loans. The main problem is that
appraisals tend to focus excessively on the existing enterprise, while greater
emphasis on the incremental impacts of the proposed project is needed. The
UNIDO loan appraisal expert is attempting to orient credit analysts more
towards making judgments on the project. This emphasis on improving the
financial and market analysis of the proposed project, plus streamlining the
documentation to reduce appraisal time, will be contained in revised loan
procedures, the substance of which was discussed during negotiations and
would be approved by CFP's Board prior to loan effectiveness. Subsequently,
the UNIDO expert will train credit analysts individually or in small groups
in the new procedures, and train central office staff to monitor and advise on
project appraisals.
3.10      The quality and scope of supervision of loans by CFP (Annex 3,
Tables 15 and 16) has varied widely over the past five years, depending
mainly on management's concern about quality of portfolio at the time.
Informal supervision through occasional brief visits to plants works satis-
factorily in the ten smaller.offices of CFP where personal knowledge of
clients is good, and arrears in these offices are thus much lower than average.
The larger offices, which have more difficulty in monitoring clients due to
the greater instability of small urban entrepreneurs and enterprises, are
presently stepping up formal "preventive" supervision in an effort to improve
their arrears situation (para. 3.21). On the whole, CFP's present control of
its clients in arrears is quite good, wit-h each client in arrears monitored
monthly, and CFP quick to take the most appropriate action (e.g., additional
financing, refinancing or sueing for collection).
3.11      Information systems.  The quality and scope of statistical reporting
on CFP operations have improved markedly over the past several years, mainly
due to the impact of Bank reporting requirements established under the two
previous loans. CFP expects to have most accounting and statistical reports,
including those for the Bank, computerized by the end of 1980, and subsequently
may rent or purchase its own computer. CFP has recently instituted monthly



- 18 -
budget ceilings in its various regional offices, which are closely monitored
and are effectively assisting in cost control. While it has also streamlined
administrative procedures in order to speed up loan processing, significant
delays occur occasionally, particularly in some instances that involve Board
approval. Only in a few cases where appraisals are inadequate or the accept-
ability of the loan is in doubt do these delays seriously hamper project
implementation.
3.12      CFP has an adequate internal auditing staff, and its annual accounts
are reviewed by Board-appointed auditors. The external audit reports called
for under the Bank Project Agreements have been acceptable, and have contained
unqualified opinions. However, CFP has changed the external audit firm each
year since 1975, reportedly since the Board was not fully satisfied with the
clarity of reports or the auditors' recommendations, and each year delayed the
appointment of new auditors until the audit year in question had finished.
This practice has led to delays of three to four months in submission of audit
reports to the Bank. Selection of external auditors and improvements regarding
the submission of their audit report were discussed between CFP and the Bank
during negotiations, a d CFP stated that it would submit the 1979 audit report
to the Bank by April 30, 1980, as required by the Project Agreements.
C.   Resources
3.13      CFP's sources of funds are detailed in Annex 3, Table 17. CFP has
had three principal sources of local borrowings to finance its lending pro-
grams, namely FFI, PROEXPO, and, until recently, Banco Popular. Of these local
sources, as shown in Table 3.1, FFI has been overwhelmingly the most important
in terms of providing funds on terms and conditions suitable for the needs of
the bulk of CFP's SMI loans. About half of the remaining local funds were
channelled to larger industries under PROEXPO's export credit lines and to
Colombia's public petroleum enterprise under resolution 28/77.

- 19 -
As can be seen from Table 3.1 above the Bank, USAID and the Kreditanstalt
fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) have provided the bulk of foreign resources for CFP.
3.14      Annex 3, Table 18 shows that CFP's total outstanding borrowings
increased by more than 50% in 1977, with borrowings related to foreign
lines of credit nearly doubling. However, much of the increase in foreign
borrowings resulted from disbursements of subloans committed in 1975 and 1976
under USAID and Bank loans. Although use of FFI grew rapidly, CFP suffered a
serious resource shortage from mid-1977 to mid-1978, since the second Bank
loan was not yet effective and the government delayed providing CFP with
either new lines of credit or the full equity contribution (Col$50 million was
provided) required under the Guarantee Agreement of Loan 1451-CO, 1/ and
lending fell off sharply. The delays by the government in channelling the
local financing to CFP resulted in the Bank temporarily deferring, during part
of 1978, processing of disbursement requests under Loan 1451-CO. The local
funds were finally made available in late 1978 as an equity contribution of
Col$183 million by PROEXPO. 2/
3.15      CFP received substantial increases in resources during the second
half of 1978 through the second Bank loan and the new equity from PROEXPO
(Annex 3, Table 19). This enabled CFP to increase total disbursements from
Col$389 million at mid-year to Col$1,150 million by year-end (Annex 3, Table
19). Total borrowings increased 33% and total equity 57% over 1977 levels.
Resource availability changed again at year-end 1978 as FFI exhausted its
funds and curtailed operations until mid-March 1979. FFI has recently adopted
a policy of giving preference to smaller loans, which to date have been made
almost exclusively by CFP and CAJA, so CFP is likely to fare better than other
intermediaries during periods of resource shortages. However, use of FFI and
PROEXPO lines decreased in 1979 due to some delays in processing of FFI loans
in late 1979 that backlogged many requests (this problem has reportedly been
overcome), and declining manufactured exports that reduced demand for PROEXPO
credits. In addition to the local rediscount lines of FFI and PROEXPO, CFP
had available for commitment small amounts from Bank Loan 1451-CO, DM 2
million of DM 8 million from KfW for similar purposes, and the US$4 million
component of the Bank-financed Intermediate Cities Urban Project (Loan 1558-CO)
for lending in slum areas of 23 cities. The latter is for special purposes and
has a projected four-year commitment period ending in 1983.
1/   The following net incremental contributions from a source not utilized by
CFP prior to 1977 were required:

2/   In total, CFP received Col$244 million as paid-in-equity by the end of
1978, which was in excess of the target set under Loan 1451-CO. This
resulted in greater net revenues in 1979.



- 20 -
3.16      While on the whole CFP has fared adequately in terms of obtain-
ing resources for lending, the recurring surpluses and shortages of funds
have hampered CFP's efforts towards stable growth and the development of an
experienced staff. Recognizing the adverse impacts of short-term widely
fluctuating resource availability, the Bank recommended CFP to seek non-tradi-
tional, permanent sources of local funds to complement the funds obtained
from FFI and PROEXPO. This was considered necessary because: (i) the avail-
ability of FFI funds has been fluctuating; (ii) FFI rediscounts, on average
finance only 70% of subloans, so CFP has to provide additional funds in order
to utilize FFI resources; (iii) the criteria and procedures under Bank and FFI
lines require at least some subproject analysis and documentation of subproject
expenditures, and can only be applied with difficulties to some viable but
relatively unorganized SSI firms that need financing quickly; and (iv) PROEXPO
export credits can be used only by the very few SMI which export. Local
resource requirements related to the second loan have been met almost wholly
by increases to CFP's equity, which has clearly helped to increase CFP's
profits and meet the needs mentioned above. Accomplishments to date in
diversifying CFP's sources of borrowings for SSI, however, have been limited,
as government efforts to control inflation have included policies to restrict
the creation of new credit lines.
3.17      As part of the proposed project, about Col$150 million p.a., or a
total of Col$450 million, would be needed in incremental local funds (para.
3.31) for the period 1980-82. This government contribution to CFP during
1980-82 would be equivalent to 25% of the proposed Bank loan amount (see Table
4.1 below), as compared with the 50% of the loan amount that was required for
1977-79 under Loan 1451-CO. The Government agreed at negotiations to make
the Col$450 million available at conditions that are adequate for CFP to
make term loans to SSI clients, and enable it to maintain an adequate debt/
equity ratio. At least Col$150 million would be provided in the form of
equity, 50% of which should be paid in by year-end 1981. Col$150 million in
incremental funds for 1980 will most likely be provided by FFI and IFI.
D.   Financial Position and Results
3.18      Although CFP's available resources have fluctuated widely on a
quarterly basis, total assets.(Col$1,877 million in 1978) and portfolio
(Col$1,743 million) grew rather steadily on an annual basis at a nominal rate
of about 40% from 1974 through 1978. Provisions for bad debts of between
3.5% and 3.9% of loan portfolio have proven to be adequate, as the bulk of
CFP's loans are-backed by real guarantees. While CFP suffered some liquidity
problems prior to 1977 due mainly to high arrears on loans and delays by the
government in disbursing USATD funds to CFP, short-term borrowings avoided
any serious crises at that time, and CFP's cash flow position has been rela-
tively good since (Annex 3, Table 20). CFP's debt:equity ratio rose from
1.3:1 in 1974 to 3.1:1 in 1977, but dropped to 2.6:1 by year-end 1978 due to
the capital provided by PROEXPO. Recent levels have continued to be substan-
tially below CFP's present maximum debt:equity ratio of 5.5:1 as specified in
CFP's policy statement and the Project Agreement for Loan 1451-CO.
3.19      Since 1974 both CFP's gross income and financial expenses have
increased at about 40% p.a. in nominal terms (Annex 3, Table 21), slightly
faster than its asset growth. While the Project Agreement of Loan 1451-CO



- 21 -
required CFP to reduce administrative costs from 7.8% of average total assets
in 1976 to 5.8% by 1981, CFP managed to reach the lower level during 1978
(Annex 3, Table 22), and economies of scale from increased lending should allow
CFP to stay close to this level. However, the rapid attainment of the 5.8%
level adversely affected CFP's capacity to carry out its development role,
particularly regardivg technical assistance (para. 3.26).  Also, CFP expects
relatively higher administrative cost ratios in 1980/81 due to the start-up
cost of its new technical assistance programs (para. 3.30), and to slower-
than-expected asset growth in 1979. Therefore, CFP agreed with the Bank at
negotiations to maintain administrative costs below 7.5% of average total
assets in 1980, 6.9% in 1981, and 6.0% in 1982. The appropriateness of this
limit would be reviewed by the Bank from time to time in light of CFP's
profits and anticipated technical assistance programs. Due ainly to rela-
tively high administrative costs and an adequate but not exceptional gross
margin on resources of 8-9%, CFP profits have been low in recent years.
However, profits after taxes rose to Col$8.5 million, or 2.0% of average
equity for 1978 (Annex 3, Table 23), as compared to Col$5.3 million, or 1.6%
of average equity, in 1977; results for 1979 indicate a large improvement
over the 1978 level, with after-tax profits of about Col$40 million.
3.20      Although established by CFP's Statement of Policies as a long-
term goal, it is not realistic to expect CFP to make sufficient profits to
compensate fully for erosion of its equity through inflation, especially given
CFP's developmental objectives and the justifiable policy of using a portion
of profits to provide technical assistance to SSI. Also, CFP feels strongly
that because of the increase of about 3 points in FFI interest rates in early
1979, combined with the fact that CFP's clients tend to be smaller and finan-
cially weaker than the clients of private intermediaries, its interest
rates are at an adequate 21-26% level. However, CFP's Board reviews interest
rates periodically and would consider increases or charging additional loan
fees if-inflation should accelerate or interest rates on rediscount credit
lines should decrease. During recent years, CFP's interest rate structure has
exceeded inflation except for brief periods, and it is compatible with rates on
other development credit lines in Colombia (para. 2.05). The real value of
CFP's equity base has been maintained by periodic capital contributions from
PROEXPO and Banco Popular, and CFP would receive additional equity as part of
the proposed project (para. 3.17).
3.21      A major concern of the Bank and CFP has been the quality of CFP's
portfolio, and notable achievements have been made. Portfolio affected by
arrears (Annex 3, Table 24) fell steadily from 20.2% of portfolio at year-end
1975 to 10.5% by year-end 1978, and arrears of 360 days or more fell from 7.0%
to 5.1% over the same period. The key measures to obtain these improvements
were (i) application of substantial penalty interest rates (normally 36%),
(ii) monthly follow-up of clients in arrears, and (iii) speedy resolution of
arrears cases, through either extending additional loans, rescheduling, or
foreclosure. Present arrears levels are reasonable given the adequate real
guarantees of most CFP loans, the adequacy of provisions for bad debt, CFP's
developmental role, and the occasional need to show greater flexibility in
demanding prompt repayment from smaller enterprises, who often have liquidity
problems due to poorer cash management and/or the recurring credit shortages
in Colombia that affect them more seriously.



- 22 -
E.   Operations
3.22      Lending operations.  In line with its statutory objectives, CFP has
focussed primarily on lending to smaller industrial firms that do not have
alternative credit sources. In 1975-78, 80-90% of CFP loans went to enter-
prises with less than Col$3 million (about US$80,000 equivalent) in assets
(Annex 3, Tables 25/26). The subsectoral distribution of lending was satis-
factory, with food (15%), apparel and footwear (13%), and non-metallic minerals
(10%) accounting for the greatest lending shares over the past three years.
CFP has substantially increased lending outside t e major departments of
Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and Valle de Cauca, from Col$169 million in 1975 to
Col$476 million in 1978, a 41% p.a. growth rate over the period, as compared
with a 28% p.a. growth rate in the three major departments. On balance, these
figures confirm CFP's successful efforts towards lending to a broad and
regionally well-diversified range of SSIs.
3.23      In recent years, the great bulk of CFP's lending was undertaken
using credit lines designed for specific purposes. However, the rollover
funds under previous Bank loans and the local financing contributions connected
to these loans have allowed CFP to develop its own specialized lending programs.
One major innovation is the Special Artisan Credit line of Col$90 million
earmarked by CFP to finance mostly working capital requirements of very small
labor-intensive firms located outside the areas of influence of Bogota,
Medellin, and Cali. CFP lowers its normal guarantee requirements for these
loans if the firm signs a technical assistance agreement with SENA. Experience
with the design of this line has been good, and the Bank would provide addi-
tional resources for it under the proposed loan (para. 4.13). CFP has also
earmarked Col$90 million for a short-term working capital credit program for
small firms that have particularly suffered during the current credit shortage
in Colombia. While this program departs from CFP's normal practice of making
medium- and long-term loans, it has been very helpful to those SSI with
limited access to credit from private banking sources.
3.24      Equity investments.  CFP has made several equity investments
(Annex 3, Table 27) in small industrial enterprises, with poor results con-
sidering in particular the time CFP had to spend in managing the projects
and the eventual losses incurred. CFP fully recognizes tha most small firms
do not have the adequate legal structure and controls, and that CFP itself
does not have the institutional capability required to make minority equity
investments. As a general principle, CFP does not intend to make further
equity investments in manufacturing enterprises.
3.25      Construction financing.  CFP has financed several buildings designed
to contain small numbers (about 4-8) of small industrial firms, and has
approved financing construction of an industrial park for SSI in Rionegro,
located 50 Km. from Medellin, using funds from IFI. Following construction,
CFP intends to sell space in the park to about 35-40 enterprises, and to
finance their purchases by making subloans under the proposed loan. Before
starting construction, CFP surveys clients extensively to ensure that adequate
demand exists to sell the buildings at a reasonable profit. CFP is also
reviewing its experience in financing individual plant construction, with the
objective of placing greater emphasis on financing production facilities, as



- 23 -
opposed to storage and office space, outside the major urban centers. With
funds for SSI being scarc , CFP s financing of construction should focus on
those projects that lead directly to increases in production and employment,
and are located in zones designated for industrial development. A policy
framework for the financing of construction along those lines has been
agreed upon with CFP and the respective changes in CFP's Statement of Policy
satisfactory to the Bank would be approved by CFP's Board prior to loan
effectiveness.
3.26      Technical assistance.  After an initial period of randomly imple-
menting a small number of technical assistance programs, CFP began in 1974
to make a systematic effort to set priorities and design programs based on an
evaluation of specific needs. In mid-1975, technical assistance activities of
CFP were strengthened by a US$1 million loan from USAID, and a technical
assistance advisor recruited by UNDP helped to develop a National Plan for
Technical Assistance which outlined CFP's strategy and the cost in terms of
staffing and financial resources. In addition to a small technical assistance
department at headquarters, 17 advisors were attached to the regional offices.
However, in May 1978, in an effort to reduce costs, CFP discontinued all direct
technical assistance activities, replacing them to some extent with systematic
supervision of clients. A survey of over 200 subborrowers under Loan 1451-CO
found that prior to soliciting a CFP subloan, about 25% had received technical
assistance from SENA, 10% directly from CFP, and only one firm had used a
private consultant; only two firms were dissatisfied with the assistance they
had received. While this result is adequate, the type and depth of technical
assistance can still be improved.
3.27      CFP's involvement in technical assistance is basically in three
main areas: (i) arrangement, frequently with other organizations, of courses
and seminars, and of specific industrial conferences for groups of entrepre-
neurs and senior staff of SMI; (ii) direct technical assistance, which has
been limited to the very first stage of identification of needs in the context
of supervision of clients; and (iii) technical information services. CFP's
participation in arranging seminars and conferences, which may have suffered
in earlier years to a certain extent from lack of focus, is now much more
demand oriented. Similarly, CFP's technical information services have proved
quite useful. However, an evaluation of CFP's past and current experience
with technical assistance has to focus on provision of specific assistance to
individual enterprises, since the needs for this type of assistance are more
frequent and pressing than for other categories.
3.28      CFP's management has recognized that: (i) effective direct technical
assistance to a large number of individual enterprises would require more staff
time than CFP could allocate (CFP has found that effective assistance which
would markedly improve operations and profitability of an enterprise requires
about 2 man/months of consultancy on average); (ii) CFP's technical assistance
advisors generally do not have the necessary qualifications and experience to
perform in-depth consultancy on specific problems of SMI; and (iii) diversifi-
cation into technical assistance on a large scale would involve the risk of
seriously reducing the effectiveness of CFP's financial assistance. Consequently,
CFP intends to (i) continue to train its technical advisors to diagnose
individual needs for assistance and provide for a link with private consultants



- 24 -
and SENA; (ii) reinforce the existing agreement between CFP and SENA (and
possibly other organizations) in terms of quantity and quality of assistance
to be provided to CFP's clients; and (iii) strengthen relations between CFP
and private consultants, including action to improve gradually quality and
availability of consultants. Based on the pre-diagnosis performed by credit
supervisors, the te.:hnical assistance advisors would prepare more detailed
diagnoses of the needs of selected existing and potential clients of CFP. CFP
estimates that about 8 technical assistance advisors are required to perform
the above functions. The total cost of this small staff (about Col$5 million
per year) can be borne by CFP without outside assistance.
3.29      Cooperation between CFP and SENA would be particularly important in
view of SENA's new program of integral assistance (para. 2.16), which requires
systematic advance planning of courses and listing of participants. Therefore,
CFP and SENA intend to establish jointly annual programs of cooperation which
would determine in advance for each region the number of CFP clients who would
obtain integral assistance training. The first planning exercises of this
kind would be performed for 1980, but would necessarily have to be kept
flexible, since CFP is not yet sufficiently aware of the needs of its clients
and SENA has to determine its exact capability to provide integral assistance.
3.30      CFP is preparing a strategy paper on its revamped technical assist-
ance program, covering, inter alia, the cooperative program with SENA (para. 3.29)
and the technical assistance component of the proposed loan (para. 4.16).
CFP would also prepare annual technical assistance plans and review such plans
with the Bank. In the short term, CFP's new technical assistance programs may
have only modest success, as important constraints to effective and broad-based
technical assistance--mainly deficiencies in number and quality of consultants
from public institutions, and reluctance of SMI to pay the cost of private
assistance--may be overcome only in the long run. Still, actions being taken
by CFP to improve provision of technical assistance to its clients are in the
right direction, and establishment of the relatively low-cost program planned
by CFP seems amply justified.
F.   Financial Projections
3.31      Projections of sources and uses of funds.  CFP's financial projec-
tions have improved substantially in quality and scope since the Bank first
became involved with the institution, and now play a key role in determining
operational strategies and lending programs. Projections have become quite an
effective planning tool, partly because the projections of most key figures
such as total assets, income, and expenses made during appraisal of Loan
1451-CO in 1976 have been within 5% of the actual results achieved. For
appraisal of the proposed loan, CFP prepared and discussed with the Bank
detailed financial projections (Annex 3, Tables 28-32) that assume: (i)
disbursement of the proposed Bank loan over three years; (ii) Col$150 million
p.a. in new local financing for 1980-82 (para. 3.17); (iii) 16% p.a. growth in
withdrawals from FFI; and (iv) a 24% p.a. average increase in withdrawals from
PROEXPO.
3.32      CFP projects loan disbursements rising from Col$1,150 million in
1978 to Col$2,770 million in 1982, a 25% p.a. nominal growth rate or about a
5% p.a. rate in real terms. Almost half of the lending increase will be



- 25 -
financed through Bank funds. FFI disbursements to CFP were conservatively
projected to rise slowly from Col$284 million in 1978 to Col$517 million
in 1982, implying a slight reduction in real terms. The PROEXPO lending
growth, although seemingly faster than FFI's, actually represents only a
gradual return to 1977 nominal levels by 1982. It is estimated that the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan will account for almost 30% of CFP's total
Col$6,400 million (about US$120 million equivalent) lending for 1980-82.
Total foreign resources (from the Bank, KfW, and USAID) will rise to 64% of
CFP's accumulated net borrowings by 1982, as compared with 30% in 1978.
3.33      Under Loan 1451-CO, the Bank restricted CFP's portfolio of short-
term loans, defined as loans for one year or less, to two times equity in
order to ensure that CFP continued its emphasis on medium- and long-term
lending. This restriction was placed in order to check a possible rapid
growth in short-term lending; however, CFP has since reemphasized its role as
a term lending institution, and CFP's PROEXPO lending fell by over 50% from
1977 to 1979. Accordingly, the ceiling on short-term loans is not considered
necessary any longer and would not be continued under the proposed loan.
3.34      Projected results.  Assuming that the lending growth mentioned in
para. 3.32 can be achieved, the nominal growth rate in lending will imply an
asset growth rate of 30% p.a., from Col$1,948 million in 1978 to Col$5,662
million in 1982. Sixty-five percent of the asset growth would be financed by
external sources of credit (60% from the Bank alone), 22% from local credit
lines, 9% from increases in net worth, and the remaining 4% from increases in
other liabilities. The debt:equity ratio of CFP is projected to increase
gradually from 2.6:1 to 5.5:1, which is the debt:equity ceiling agreed between
the Bank and CFP since 1977. To allow some flexibility, and as a result of
the increasing proportion of long-term borrowing by CFP at attractive interest
rates, this ceiling would be raised to 6:1 under the proposed loan.
3.35      The Col$40 million profit after taxes for 1979 represents a 7%
return on equity. This is the highest profit level ever achieved and almost
five times the 1978 results. However, after 1979 the rate of profit increase
should slow as CFP's debt:equity ratio, and hence its average cost of funds,
gradually rises, affecting likely savings from increased efficiency. Also, in
line with profit increases in 1979, CFP plans to increase its technical
assistance expenditures. Overall, income should grow by 36% p.a. from 1978-82,
financial expenses at 40% p.a., and administrative expenses at 25% p.a.
Profits after taxes are projected to continue at about 5-6% of average equity,
adequate in light of CFP's objectives and plans to spend any potential profits
above this level on technical assistance to SSI.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Experience under Previous Bank Loans
4.01      Bank lending to support the Colombian industrial sector has been
well diversified, encompassing seven loans totalling US$342.5 million to
finance medium and large industry through private development finance companies,



- 26 -
two loans totalling US$20.5 million to support SSI, a loan component of
US$19.0 million for agroindustry, a loan of US$15.0 million for an export
processing zone in Cartagena, and a loan component of US$2.0 million for very
small enterprises in target areas of the Intermediate Cities Urban Project.
The loans have helped to finance a balanced industrial development strategy
for Colombia, including assistance to smaller, labor-intensive enterprises in
areas where Colombia's traditionally abundant, low-cost labor gives these
enterprises a competitive edge, as well as to more capital-intensive enter-
prises in product lines with significant economies of scale. Past Ban
support to SSI, while still small in comparison to total industrial lending,
has become a significant factor in the development of SSI in Colombia.
4.02      Loan 1071-CO, approved in January 1975, for US$5.5 million equiva-
lent, was the Bank's first SSI operation in Latin America; the second, Loan
1451-CO, for US$15 million equivalent, was approved in June 1977. Annex 1
contains a comparison of project features among the previous and proposed SSI
loans, and Annex 2 contains a detailed analysis of subborrowers and subprojects
under Loan 1451-CO. A Project Completion Report (PCR) for Loan 1071-CO was
issued on January 29, 1979, and a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on
August 30, 1979. The proposed project has been designed taking advantage of
the experience gained under the previous projects. The principal findings of
the PPAR were that: (a) Bank funds were allocated within the target group;
(b) employment generation was in line with expectations, with the cost per job
substantially less in the smaller firms; (c) the focus on smaller industry was
justified and should be pursued; (d) the technical assistance to SSI had
little success and needs upgrading; (e) CFP's organization and procedures
improved significantly; and (f) the Bank's discussions with the government
focussed on CFP's resource position and pre-empted a general review of SSI
policies.
4.03      Particularly in light of the experimental nature of the first two
SSI projects, their results in terms of the objectives established during
the appraisals have been good. Due to the scarcity of local financing for
fixed asset purchases and Colombia's satisfactory economic growth rates in
recent years, demand for subloans has been strong. Also, CFP has shown itself
capable of appraising and processing subloan requests quite rapidly and
efficiently. Due to the normally short implementation periods of SSI invest-
ment projects, CFP will disburse the two loans in an average of three years
each as compared to a six-year average disbursement period for typical DFC
lending operations. The average subloan size has been US$22,000, with only
about 20 out of more than 800 subloans approved through December 31, 1979,
being for more than US$100,000. Almost three-fourths of subloans have been
for 5 years or less, indicating not only the reluctance of clients to incur
long-term debt, but also at times a tendency on the part of CFP to underesti-
mate project payback periods. Of the subloan recipients, about two-thirds had
total assets below US$85,000 equivalent and employed less than 25 workers.
The geographic and sectoral dispersion of subloans has been good, with 60% of
loans and 40% of loan amounts going to recipients located outside the three
major departments of Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and Valle. In total, 850-900
firms should have received Bank subloans under the two SSI projects by
mid-1980, representing almost 10% of the projects' target groups.



- 27 -
4.04      The average subproject cost has been about US$55,000 equivalent,
with the Bank financing about 39% of the otal on average. CFP has contri-
buted 6%, other credit sources 21%, and subborrowers 34%. This financing
pattern resulted in the Bank's participation being roughly equal to the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the subprojects. A relativ-'1 high 32%
(by cost) of machinery financed under the projects come from local manufac-
turers, thus supporting the budding capital goods industry in Colombia. Due
to the lack of financing for construction of industrial buildings for small
enterprises, about 16% of total project resources and 33% of Bank funds have
financed such construction. The total cost per direct job created under the
projects has been about US$9,000 (in 1976 prices), with smaller firms having a
sharply lower cost per job. This is less than half the cost per job expe-
rienced under Bank loans for larger industry as part of the financiera projects.
One-half of subborrowers were family-owned enterprises, and in only 5% of the
cases was the manager not a major owner/shareholder.
4.05      Under the first loan, CFP used less than US$100,000 of the initial
technical assistance allocation of US$500,000, most of the remainder of which
was eventually reallocated to the lending program. Given this experience, only
a US$100,000 technical assistance allocation was made under the second loan.
This has now been fully committed and at CFP's request the Bank approved
an additional US$100,000 for these purposes. Utilization of the funds had
been slow, as many firms were reluctant to borrow to pay for technical assis-
tance. Also, at times CFP did little promotion of the line because subloan
amounts were small compared to the work involved. Recent increases in utili-
zation of the funds, however, reflect CFP's renewed emphasis on technical
assistance. As part of the second loan, CFP signed cooperation agreements
with IIT and SENA. The former had rather minor impact due to IIT's limited
ability to offer its technical services to SSI (para. 2.17), while the latter
facilitated cooperation at the national level and fostered a recognition of
the interdependence of CFP credit and SENA technical assistance programs.
4.06      In addition to satisfactory onlending performance, CFP made various
institutional improvements during the previous loans (see Chapter III). It
has substantially upgraded its management information and control systems,
and is now in the process of computerizing its accounting and statistical
reporting. Regional offices, particularly those in the smaller cities,
have improved their effectiveness and efficiency quite rapidly over the past
three years, to the point that CFP's services probably have the greatest
coverage and relative impact on regional SSI in and around the medium-size
cities. Reflecting some of these improvements, CFP was able to reduce its
administrative costs since 1976 much faster than the Bank expected.
4.07      The SSI projects have been less successful in achieving sectoral
objectives. Specifically, the Bank had hoped to (i) assist CFP to diver-
sify substantially its sources of local financing, and (ii) encourage the
government to establish an SSI policy council. However, the government's
efforts to control inflation, as well as reluctance prior to 1979 in the
Ministry of Economic Development to initiate a SSI policy dialogue, precluded
significant progress in both these areas. The incremental local financing
contribution to be obtained by CFP in connection with Loan 1451-CO (para. 3.14)
was made only with great delays, and continuing anti-inflationary policies
have made obtaining any other local resources difficult for the time being.



- 28 -
B.   Project Objectives
4.08      The main objectives of the third SSI project are to:
(i)  improve SSI's access to credit by providing funds on reasonable
conditions for the establishment, expansion, or relocation of
privately controlled small industrial firms;
(ii)  assist CFP in building up a sounder resource base for its operations
through 1982;
(iii) build up further CFP's technical and operational capability
for efficiently allocating scarce development funds and for
coordinating technical assistance to SSI;
(iv)  continue to support, through a wide distribution of CFP's onlending,
the government's industrial diversification and regional development
policies; and
(v)  help promote government policies that are responsive to SSI's
financial and technical assistance needs.
4.09      The Bank considers (ii) above vital for realizing CFP's long-term
potential, and assurances on timely availability of local resources for CFP
were obtained at negotiations (para. 3.17). CFP has made substantial institu-
tional progress since its early contacts with the Bank in 1973. CFP's manage-
ment, with the assistance of UNIDO technical experts (para. 3.08) and some
private consultants, is now competent to continue CFP's internal institutional
development with less direct involvement of the Bank. Rather, the Bank can
now focus efforts more on CFP's role in formulating SSI policy and acting as
a spokesman for the SSI sector. In this regard, CFP will need to build up
its capability to undertake policy oriented research, and to strengthen its
cooperative arrangements with entities such as SENA that provide technical
assistance to SSI (para 1.15). These efforts are intended to assist CFP in
exercising the role of a mature SSI development bank in influencing and/or
shaping policy and coordinating activities in its area of interest.
C.   Project Cost and Financing
4.10      Based on probable demand for CFP lending related to Bank-financed
subloans over the-1980-82 period, the estimated total project cost would
amount to US$83 million equivalent (at projected exchange rates for 1980-82).
The proposed US$32 million Bank loan (para 4.12) would contribute 39% of this
amount, covering the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project. Table
4.1 below presents the sources and uses of funds for the project. The Col$450
million government contribution to the project (para. 3.17) would finance
about 10% of costs, other local lending sources (including suppliers' credit)
would finance on average 23%, and individual subborrowers 29%, usually through
new equity or internal cash generation of the enterprise. With this project
financing structure, the Bank would be providing the term financing necessary
to make most subprojects financially feasible, while attracting the major
portion (61%) of funds from local sources.

a!   Estimated foreign exchange cost of project is US$32 million.
4.11      The fact that 13% of total project cost is expected to finance
construction indicates the high demand for new facilities to permit growth of
SSI firms, although this is proportionately less construction than under the
previous SSI projects, as CFP plans to place some limitations upon this financing
(para. 3.25). Few SSIs import machinery directly, reflecting the generally
small purchases they make. Therefore, it is estimated that only 2% of project
costs would be for directly imported machinery, while imported machinery
purchased locally would account for 24% of project costs.  Finally, locally
produced machinery would amount to 11% of total project cost. The low capital
intensity of SSI, and consequent high materials and labor component in the
cost of goods sold, accounts for the fact that almost one-half of project costs
would be represented by working capital related to permanent increases in
inventory.
D.   The Proposed Loan
4.12      Based on forecasts of CFP's operational capacity and on demand for
financing of the SSI sector through 1982, a US$32 million Bank loan is proposed
to finance a third SSI project in Colombia. The loan would be made to BR with
the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia, for relending to CFP. The loan
would consist of (i) a US$31.4 million credit component to assist CFP in
financing the foreign exchange requirements of its subloans mainly to SSI, and
(ii) a US$0.6 million technical assistance component designed to finance
consulting services for CFP or its clients. As the expected large number of



- 30 -
subloans would make a composite amortization schedule impractical, the loan
would be repaid in equal instalments over a fixed 17-year term, including a
4-year grace period. These terms would permit CFP to build up term resources
for lending to SSI through CFP's retention of the rollover as under the first
two SSI loans. The prevailing Bank interest rate of 8.25% p.a. and commitment
fee of 0.75t on undisbursed balances would apply.
4.13      Credit component.  The US$31.4 million lending component would be
used to finance a wide range of small manufacturing firms. Bank assistance
would finance (i) purchases of machinery, equipment, and related services,
(ii) construction of industrial facilities, and (iii) permanent working
capital. The lending component funds would be allocated as follows:
Category I
US$k3.2 million for lending to firms with less than US$650,000
equivalent in total assets, with up to US$2 million of this
amount available to finance permanent working capital.
Category II
US$13.2 million for lending to firms with less than US$300,000
equivalent in total assets, with up to US$2 million of this amount
available to finance permanent working capital.
Category III
US$5 million for lending (largely permanent working capital) to
firms located outside the Bogota, Cali, and Medellin areas of
influence and with less than US$100,000 equivalent in total assets.
Under Categories I and II, the working capital portion of any subloan would
have to be associated with fixed assets financing and could not exceed 30% of
the total subloan amount, while the working capital portion of any subloan
under Category III could range up to 100% of the subloan. The special alloca-
tions for working capital financing are made in response to very strong demand
for these funds (paras. 1.11-1.12); however, working capital financing would
be limited to a US$9 million aggregate allocation in order that the Bank would
continue to finance mainly fixed assets, for which the Bank funds are the only
source for SSI in Colombia. Category III would help CFP to build up rapidly
its Special Artisan Credit line (para. 3.23).
4.14      Under the credit component BR would carry the foreign exchange risk
against a 12.5%-13.0% margin and relend Bank funds to CFP in pesos at 20.75%
or 21.25% p.a., depending on the location of the ultimate beneficiaries. The
higher rate would apply to the Bogota, Medellin, and Cali areas of influence,
as defined by FFI. CFP would onlend to ultimate beneficiaries in local
currency at a nominal 26% p.a. rate which, according to Bank projections,
should be substantially above the average inflation rate during the commitment
period of the loan. 1/ Furthermore, at negotiations BR agreed to review the
i    Since CFP (like the other financieras) charges interest quarterly in
advance, the effective interest rate is somewhat higher.



- 31 -
interest rate semi-annually with the objective of maintaining a rate that is
compatible with other local term lending interest rates and positive in real
terms. BR would promptly (within eight days) notify the Bank of its position,
and the Bank would have thirty days to respond. Should the Bank object to
the proposed interest rate, and agreement with BR and the government on a new
rate not be reached within sixty days, the Bank could refuse to make further
subloan commitments at the interest rate so objected. In essence, this gives
the Bank the right during the commitment period of the loan to insist upon
interest rates that are positive in real terms. The average nominal spread to
CFP on subloans would be about 5%. Based on experience under the previous
loans, and the fact that less costs are normally required to make working
capital loans, this spread is adequate to cover the higher administrative
expenses related to making SSI subloans, provide for portfolio losses, and
generate small profits.
4.15      Subloans that include fixed assets financing would be granted for
4-10 year periods including 1-3 years of grace, while subloans entirely for
working capital under Category III would carry 3-5 year periods including 1-3
years of grace. CFP would perform a cash flow analysis for all subloans
above Col$0.5 million to determine the appropriate loan and grace periods. As
under the second SSI loan, the limit for subloans not requiring the Bank's
prior review and approval (the "free limit") would be US$100,000, which would
result in the Bank reviewing an estimated 40 subloans or 15% of the subloans
by amount.
4.16      Technical assistance component.  Under the first two SSI loans,
demand for technical assistance subloans has been modest. While CFP's greater
emphasis on technical assistance under the third project is expected to
increase demand, no more than 10% of subborrowers are likely to request
these subloans. Therefore, US$500,000 should be sufficient to finance tech-
nical assistance of about 250 man/months by private consultants to some 100 SSI.
However, should demand for technical assistance subloans prove greater than
expected, the Bank could allocate additional funds for this purpose. In
recognition of the partial subsidy necessary to encourage SSI to take advantage
of beneficial technical assistance services, these subloans would carry a
nominal 15% p.a. peso interest rate to subborrowers. CFP would receive the
funds from BR at a 12% p.a. interest rate, implying a narrow 3% margin for CFP
and only 3.75% for BR's administrative costs and foreign exchange risk coverage.
Technical assistance subloans would be made for 4-10 year periods including
1-3 years of grace, similar to the investment subloans. A free limit of
US$20,000 for technical assistance subloans would also be established. CFP
has also requested an allocation of US$100,000 to help finance: (i) consulting
services related to institutional development, mainly in support of the
ongoing UNIDO project (para. 3.08); and (ii) continuation of the computeriza-
tion of information systems that began under Loan 1451-CO. As all the specific
services needed are not yet identified, the Bank would review and approve in
advance any contracts to be financed under the proposed loan for consulting
services for CFP.
4.17      Procurement.  Local suppliers of imported machinery and equipment
are adequately represented in Colombia, competition among them is keen,
and their services are reasonable; only in special cases would SSI find it
cheaper to procure machinery directly from abroad. Effective protection is



- 32 -
generally low for the locally manufactured machinery suitable for financing
under the proposed loan. The construction industry in Colombia is also quite
efficient and competitive, and small industrialists make great efforts to
obtain the lowest prices possible. The survival of small firms is heavily
dependent on their ability to purchase materials at the lowest possible
prices; procurement of raw materials can thus be expected to be efficient.
Technical assistance would be supplied by local consultants, who can offer
high quality services at reasonable prices. CFP would satisfy itself in all
cases that goods and services procured are competitive in quality and price
and adequately meet the needs of ultimate beneficiaries.
4.18      Disbursement.  As under the first two SSI loans, disbursements of
Bank funds would be made for up to 100% of CFP's subloan amount, but could
not exceed 90% of expenditures for specific items (equipment, machinery,
industrial construction, raw materials, and services)--or 100% of direct
foreign expenditures for goods and services--and 100% of expenditures for
consultants' technical assistance services or 70% of the purchase price of
finished industrial buildings at Rionegro. Raw materials financing, i.e.,
working capital, would be limited to incremental amounts necessary for a new
enterprise or a permanent addition to materials inventories by an existing
enterprise. Although in principle Bank funds could finance as much as 90% of
the cost of an individual subproject, CFP rarely lends more than 60% of
subproject cost and has financed on average 39% of subproject costs under Loan
1451-CO.
4.19      Due to the large number of subloan requests, CFP submits subprojects
below the free limit for Bank authorization on a monthly basis, while subloans
above the free limit are submitted individually for Bank review and approval.
To speed up processing, CFP, acting on behalf of BR's Department of Development
Credit, would continue to submit disbursement requests directly to the Bank
with a copy to BR. CFP's own resources would cover the average of US$2 million
that is likely to be tied up by pending reimbursement requests. All disburse-
ments except those for direct foreign expenditures would be made against a
certified statement of expenditure. Detailed documentation for subproject
expenditures would be retained by CFP for inspection by Bank supervision
missions.  Full documentation on direct foreign expenditures would be submitted
to the Bank. Commitment of the loan should take until year-end 1982, and full
disbursement is expected by the closing date of June 30, 1983 (Annex 4).
4.20      While the Bank normally reimburses for subproject expenditures
made less than 90 days prior to the receipt of the subloan request, this limit
was raised to 180 days under the first project to compensate for the typical
lack of financial and investment planning by SSI which frequently leads to
submission of subloans at a very late stage. A review of subprojects led to
a lowering of the limit under the second loan to 135 days from the date CFP
approves the subloan. This limit is appropriate and would be maintained for
the third loan.
E.   Benefits and Risks
4.21      Most significantly, the project would provide credit to a group that
has generally had inadequate access to term financing, help develop local
management capacity, and contribute to the broadening of business ownership



- 33 -
in Colombia. Given the expected wide geographical distribution of subloan
recipients, the project would also support the government's policies to achieve
a more balanced regional development and decentralize industrial growth, with
an estimated 70% of subloans by number and 50% by amount going to borrowers
outside the three major cities. While calculation by CFP of internal rates of
return of subloans is not justified, due to their small size, judging by the
results achieved unc,r the first two loans, the typical subproject's financial
rate of return would be satisfactory, with most falling in the 15-20% range.
In view of SSI's heavy reliance on labor and on local raw materials, the
project's economic rate of return would likely be higher than its financial
rate of return.
4.22      With SSI requiring less total capital investment per job than
large industry and employing a large share of job entrants in industry, the
project would actively support local efforts to induce a more balanced regional
development and generate employment. An estimated 1,500 small enterprises
are expected to benefit from the proposed loan, or about 15% of the project's
target group. Based on the achievements under the first two loans, Bank
financing would help foster 6,000-7,500 direct job opportunities, with another
2,000 created indirectly through forward and backward linkages. The average
cost per job under the project is expected to be a relatively low US$11,000
(1976 prices), roughly comparable in real terms to the cost per job under
Loan 1451-CO. 1/ This figure is about half of the estimated marginal cost
per job for the industrial sector as a whole.  A wide variety of industries
would benefit from the project, with none of the ten major industrial subsec-
tors likely to receive more than 20% of the subloans. Although most subpro-
jects would be for capacity expansion and mainly produce for local markets, it
is expected that up to 10% would involve some exports and an equal number the
establishment of new enterprises. Expected modernization of production facil-
ities and techniques would help upgrade skills of trained and untrained labor.
Since the revenues generated by the project would accrue mostly to unskilled
workers; small owner-operators and the government, its income distribution
impact should be beneficial.
4.23      The project would also give scope for further institution building
within CFP, the main financial institution for the SSI sector. Continuing
with the progress achieved in that field under the first loan, it would assist
CFP in strengthening its resource mix, completing an internal information
system and SSI data bank, and reorganizing its technical assistance and
research activities. In addition, it should have a catalytic impact in foster--
ing coordination and cooperation among the various public and private institu-
tions that focus upon SSI, and help the government to develop SSI strategy.
4.24      The main project risks are that (i) CFP could suffer resource
shortages if the local contributions to the project were delayed, or (ii)
excessively frequent changes of CFP management could hinder its institutional
development. To reduce risk (i), the Bank and government have agreed in
1/   This estimate assumes that effects on the cost-per-job calculation of the
recent trend by SSI towards greater capital intensity will be balanced
out under the project by working capital lending, which usually creates
more employment at a lower cost than fixed asset lending because it takes
advantage of existing productive capacity.



- 34 -
advance on the specific terms and conditions of the local funds. CFP managers,
on the other hand, may continue to change relatively often, but efforts over
the past several years to institutionalize lending policies and procedures
should help to minimize the impact of these changes. Thus it is not very
likely that either of these two factors could significantly impede attainment
of the project's objectives.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points with:
BR, CFP, and the Government on
(a) allocation and relending terms and conditions of the
proposed loan (para. 4.12-4.20); and
(b)  the terms, conditions, and timing of Col$450 million in incre-
mental financing for CFP during the period 1980-82 (para. 3.17).
CFP on
(a)  target levels for CFP's administrative expenses (para. 3.19);
(b)  increase of CFP's debt:equity limit to 6:1 (para. 3.34);
(c)  CFP's policy statement would not be modified in a way that
would adversely affect its operations or financial condition
(para. 3.01); and
(d)  preparation of annual technical assistance plans by CFP and their
review with the Bank (para. 3.30).
5.02      In addition, prior to loan effectiveness CFP's board would approve
a policy acceptable to the Bank for the financing of industrial building
(para 3.25), and approve revised credit regulations and procedures (para.
3.09).
5.03      The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$32 million to BR, as outlined in Chapter IV, for a term of 17 years
including 4 years grace.

COLOMBIA
CFP - THIRD SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
Analysis of the Characteristics of Subborrowers
and Subprojects under Loan 1451-CO
Objectives and Conclusions
1.        This study has a threefold objective:  (i) analyze the typical
salient characteristics of SSI; (ii) understand some features of Bank
subborrowers; and (iii) investigate impact of Bank subprojects on the
growth and viability of the client industries in particular and on the
Colombian industrial sector in general. The study is similar although
broader in scope to one reported in Annex 5 of the appraisal report for
Loan 1451-CO (Report No. 1512b-CO). It is hoped that the results, in addition
to delineating CFP's activities and contributions and suggesting future poli-
cies and programs in this respect, shall also prove useful as a reference
for prospective studies on the role and development of SSIs.
2.        In our analysis of the impact of subprojects we have focused on the
marginal cost of employment generation in the SSI sector.  Current literature
on the subject overwhelmingly suggests that investment cost per new job
increases with industry scale. Although the data used in this study refer
only to the SSI sector (to which CFP lends almost exclusively), the results
support the literature, i.e., the study found that even within the SSI sector,
investment cost per job has a strong relationship to firm size, with the
average cost per job much higher in larger firms (Table 4C). 1/ As measures
of efficiency such as profitability and value added per peso invested seem
either weakly or inversely correlated with firm size, it appears that for
the cases studied the additional employment created by smaller firms is not
counterbalanced, as is sometimes supposed, by a reduction in efficient use of
capital. Finally, the study .found that the asset size criterion is a "better"
measure of the size of a firm (in terms of its ability to discriminate other
characteristics) than other criteria such as employment, a result which
justifies the continued use of asset size to identify the target group for
Bank SSI projects in Colombia.
Methodology
3.        The data for this study were obtained from questionnaries corres-
ponding to the first set of applications approved by the Bank to 274 SSIs
for subloans under Loan 1451-CO. About 125 data items considered pertinent
1/   The caveat should be added here that a strong relationship between two
variables does not necessarily imply cause and effect; a third variable
may actually be the causal factor.

ANNEX 2
to the study's purposes were selected for analysis; descriptive statistics
on some of these data are presented in Table 1. In addition, a set of
variables expressing relevant ratios were computed from this data base.
Descriptive statistics on the computed variables are presented in Table 2.
All computations were done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS).
4.        The confidence level in the data base has been helped by applying
several screening methods and tests at various stages of this exercise. All
questionnaires were scrutinized for consistency in reporting, with those
not conforming to rather strict standards excluded. Various Bank missions to
Colombia have worked with CFP to improve the accuracy of data on existing
enterprises. In general, CFP and Bank staff feel that these data are reason-
ably accurate, with the caveat that a slight downward bias in asset size likely
exists due to Colombia's rapid inflation in recent years and probable lags
in revaluation of assets by SSI. In regard to projected data, a follow-up
on Loan 1071-CO subborrowers found that subproject cost data were generally
accurate, while sales, assets, and employment projections often varied sub-
stantially from realization in individual cases. However, no systematic
biases were found in the projections, so it can be assumed that the averages
for various categories of firms contained in the following tables are reasonably
valid (i.e., while projections on individual subprojects have low confidence
factors, averages for sufficiently large groups should have much greater
validity).
Summary of Findings
5.        Descriptive statistics.  General descriptive statistics are presented
in Tables 1 and 2, the former on collected data items and the latter on com-
puted variables. The average CFP subborrower, as reflected in the tables,
had pre-project assets of over Col$4 million. The skewness of the distribu-
tion of assets indicates, however, that a large proportion of firms had less
than average assets. The average firm employs 22 workers (man-years), so pre-
project assets per worker in.the average firm were approximately Col$219,000
(about US$5,500). The average investment (after depreciation) in machinery
and equipment per worker was US$2,200, a surprisingly low figure and indica-
tive of the labor intensity of CFP clients. Total subproject cost for an
average firm was slightly over Col$3 million (US$70,000) with more than two-
thirds of total subprojects of smaller outlay. CFP financed over 48% of
subproject cost for an average firm, while nearly 40% of it was financed by
own resources of the client. Furthermore, the average firm used nearly 40%
of subproject funds on machinery and equipment, 36% for working capital, and
22% for construction.

6.        Four additional jobs were created directly by the subproject in the
average firm. The investment cost per new job for the average firm was
Col$826,000, equivalent to US$11,000 at 1976 prices and exchange rates;
for an average firm an increase in assets of Col$708,000 was required to
create a new job. The fact that the latter figure is almost three times the
asset/worker ratio of the existing firm is explained by the fact that assets
per worker seem to increase very rapidly with increases in asset size of the
firm, plus the fact that a few very large construction or renovation subprojects
created little employment. At the aggregate, a total of 1,098 employment
opportunities were created directly by the subproject's total outlay of
Col$837 million. The average cost per job under Loan 1451-CO is about 50%
higher in real peso terms than under Loan 1071-CO, with the difference due to
the fact that SSI in Colombia seems to be increasing its capital intensity in
response to some rather recent labor shortages and rapidly increasing demand.
The incremental asset/value added ratio, a proxy for the incremental capital/
output ratio (ICOR), was a low 1.0, likely due to breaking of production
bottlenecks by many of the subprojects.
7.        Analysis by industrial activity.  Descriptive statistics for some
important variables are presented in Table 3 for eight industrial classifica-
tions. Although the industrial classification is broad and in a few cases the
number of firms in a group is small, some general comments concerning Colombian
SSI across industrial classification can be made. First, an average firm in
the chemical sector tends to be relatively larger than in other sectors, and
the investment cost of creating a new job in the chemical sector also tends to
be highest. Secondly, industries in the food sector, though relatively small
in size, seem to have the highest assets/labor ratio. Existing assets/labor
ratios provide only a rough indication of total investment required to create
a new job in different industrial sectors.
Industry and Subproject Characteristics by Firm Size
8.        Firm size can be measured by assets, equity, employment level,
output or investment per worker. All of these indices seem to have their
relative merits and deficiencies, which are discussed extensively in SSI
literature. In the case of Colombia, CFP lends mainly to firms with
total assets below Col$35 million. On the other hand, the official index
for similar industry is based upon the level of employment between 5 and
99 workers. The analysis here was carried out using both assets and labor
employed. Table 4 presents results according to firm size measured by
assets and Table 5 by labor employed. There is clearly a trend in fixed
assets as a percentage of total assets to decline with firm size (see
both Tables 4 and 5), largely reflecting the ability of larger firms to
maintain a greater proportion of working capital. This argument is sup-
ported by other calculations (not presented here) that indicate increases
of working capital in the percentage of total subproject cost as firm size
increases.

9.        Another interesting result is the breakduwn of assets per worke.
by firm size. Surprisingly, there appears to be a negative correlation
between assets per worker and firm size when the latter is measured by labor
employed and a positive correlation when firm size is measured by assets.
Larger firms (if firm size is measured by assets) can be construed as being
more capital intensive, and on the contrary, less capital intensive if firm
size is measured by labor employed. For the purposes of Bank projects, this
finding supports arguments in favor of the use of asset size rather than
employment as a means of defining the projects' target groups.
10.       Regarding average subproject characteristics, the subproject cost
for an average firm was over 85% of its pre-project assets. Among the
alternative sources of credit CFP surely plays a dominant role in all sub-
projects. While CFP funds a larger proportion of subproject costs of smaller
firms, credit from commercial and other banks seems to be more easily avail-
able (and in greater amounts) to larger enterprises. One can thus reasonably
argue that in the absence of CFP the brunt of any credit tightening in
Colombia will fall disproportionately on smaller SSI.
11.       Investment cost per new job increases significantly with firm size
as measured by both assets and labor employed, viz., the cost per job in the
largest category is 8-10 times that of the smallest category. This positive
relationship between the cost of job generation and firm size is supported by
a similar correlation between projected increase in assets per new job created
and firm size. Moreover, smaller firms not only expect higher percentage
increases in assets due to subprojects but also a greater rate of return on
projected assets.  The profit projection data may have an upward bias in order
to make the subproject appear more lucrative, but there is no a priori reason
to believe that this bias reduces with firm size. While a much more elaborate
analysis would be necessary to judge accurately factor efficiency, the avail-
able data do suggest that the smaller enterprises create more employment per
peso invested and may even be more efficient than larger enterprises.
12.       The value of correlation coefficients for sales, investment cost
per job and value-added per worker are greater in the case when assets are
used as a measure of firm size. In the case where firm size is measured by
labor employed, the value-added/assets ratio does not decline as the size
of the firm increases. Moreover, the correlation coefficient for average
wage rate and firm size is negative when firm size is measured by employment
level. This is contrary to other evidence that indicates existence of higher
wages in larger firms, quite likely due to the inadequacy of employment as a
composite measure of size.

ANNEX 2
Estimators of Investment Cost per Job
13.       In an attempt to refine the search for a good predictor of total
investment cos. per job, average firm and subproject characteristics were
compared with eight ascending levels of investment cost per job (Table 6).
Lowest investment cost per job generated (as indicated in Table 6) is asso-
ciated with relatively small SSI--those with average assets below Col$3 million
and employment level around 10-15 workers. These firms, on the average,
use nearly one-half of subproject funds for machinery and equipment, expect
a net return on assets of about 15%, and their value added is slightly over
40% of sales. While firm size as measured by both assets and labor employed
increases along with total investment required to create a new job, the
correlation between investment cost per job and assets is stronger than
between the former and labor employed. (The Pearson correlation coefficient
in case of assets is 0.425 compared to 0.333 in that of labor employed.)
Surprisingly, the study did not find existing assets per worker of the firm
to be a good predictor of investment cost per job generated for the project.
Characteristics of Subborowers
14.       The questionnaires also collected some interesting data on the
characteristics of subborrowers, as described below. The purpose was to test
some generalizations that are frequently made concerning the ownership, manage-
ment and organization of small industries. The results are presented here
in summary style, leaving sketching of inferences and formation of conclusions
to the reader's judgement.
Organizational Features
Percentage of SSI
Family-owned firms                                          51.3
Firms with manager as a shareholder                         94.3
Firms with formal organization                              60.7
Firms maintaining accounts procedures
and policies                                              79.8
Firms renting premises                                      44.4
15.       The first interesting finding is that comparatively more large-sized
SSI (63.6%) are family-owned than smaller enterprises (43.5%). Secondly, in
the bulk of cases (94.3%) the manager is a shareholder. Thirdly, about 40%
of the SSI in our sample do not have a formal organizational structure.
Surprisingly, even a few large SSIs lack a formal structure. In spite of
the absence of a formal structure, however, some firms maintain financial
accounts. While 44% of subborrowers rent their premises, the majority of
firms in the food, wood and furniture, nonmetallic minerals, and metal pro-
ducts and machinery sectors operate on self-owned premises, and the majority
of firms in the clothing and textiles, paper products, and chemicals sectors
rent premises.

16.       The typical manager of a subborrower is also the owner and is
between 31 and 40 years of age. He has finished high school but did not
attend university. He has, however, nearly eleven years of association
(direct or indirect) with the sector in which he operates and has acquired
his administrative abilities in similar industries before joining the present
firm. In a majority of the cases (75%) where the manager is also the owner,
he founded the firm; in 5% of the cases the manager/owner inherited the firm;
and in 20% of the cases he purchased it.
17.       Four out of every five SSI's in our sample maintain formal accounts.
Evidently all industries above Col$3.5 million in asset size maintain accounts,
while 30% of smaller firms do not. The manager/owner does the accounting
himself in only 7% of the cases, while in 81% of the cases an accountant is
responsible. The frequency of financial statements varies from case to case,
reflecting a preference for preparation of monthly financial statements by
larger SSIs. The data on frequency of financial statements are broken down by
three categories of firm size within SSI.

18.       The number of clients of an industry depends largely on its size,
nature of product, location, and need for intermediaries. For the 274 SSIs
in our sample, one-half have.less than 30 clients, 34% have more than
50 clients, and 11% have less than 5 clients. The type of clientele is as
follows:
Type of Clientele                    Mean (%)
Final Consumers                             41.9

This information is further disaggregated by industrial activity.

19.       The above information, at best, provides only a rough indication of
industrial linkages. First, the number of other manufacturing firms as clients
of a particular SSI is low, indicating that industrial subcontracting is not
strong in Colombia. Secondly, there is no one-to-one correspondence between
percentage of clients and percentage of total sales made to them. To the
extent that this differs, estimation of linkage from the above information
would be misleading. Besides knowledge about the nature of clientele, the
geographical location of clients is important as it provides insights, inter
alia, into the degree of integration of the SSI-sector with the economy. The
following.table presents data across the three firm sizes defined as in the
preceding tables. As expected, the geographical markets of larger SSI are
much more likely to be nationwide.
Firm-Size of SSI
Percentage of firms serving in:              Small   Medium   Large
----------% -----------
City of location only                               56       36        23
Department of location only                         34       27         6
All over Colombia                                   10       37        71
It is more appropriate, however, to analyze geographical location of clients
by industrial activity. Over 92% of the firms in the chemicals sector serve
markets all over Colombia, while nearly one-half of the firms in food, clothing
and textile, wood and furniture, and metal products and machinery do so. About
54% of the firms in the paper products and 40% of firms in the food sectors
sell products only in their city of location.

20.       According to the findings, Colombian SSI in each sector compete
largely with their counterparts rather than larger industries. Similarly,
large SSIs feel less competition from smaller industries than from those their
own size or larger. In less than 5% of the cases, the SSIs mentioned local sub-
sidiaries of foreign enterprises or imports as a primary source of competition.
Competition among SSI is primarily based on price and product quality. Inte-
restingly, however, sales credit terms and conditions are regarded by about
13% of the SSIs in our sample as the chief source of competition. For another
13% of the cases, marketing and promotion appear to be the dominant aspects
of competition. Materials supply problems have proved to be a much more
significant constraint on growth than product demand, probably because
monopolies exist in several key intermediate goods sectors, while the recent
strong economic growth of Colombia has kept demand high.
SSI Sectors                       Major Source of Competition
Food                               Product quality and price
Clothing & Textiles                Price and credit conditions
Wood & Furniture                   Price and distribution channels
Paper Products                     Price and Promotion/Publicity
Chemicals                          Price and distribution channels

21.       It is generally recognized that as firm size increases, value added
per unit of capital falls but value added per worker rises. 1/  The results
presented below corroborate this affirmation. As far as capacity utilization
is concerned, little variation by size was found. The average utilization
rate of 71% is surprisingly low, especially since all firms in the study
were applying for loans to purchase fixed assets at the time. Apparently,
SSI have difficulty in balancing machinery properly in order to utilize fully
all productive capacity.

22.       More than 20% of the SSIs in the survey recently purchased second-
hand plant and equipment.  Interestingly, 43% of these firms belonged to the
paper products sector while all the firms in the chemicals sector purchased
new equipment.

increase for both SMI and large industry over 1970-75, i.e. that indicated for the
factory sector by the national accounts.   These rates are not
consistent with those presented in the national accounts, whfich sh0r an avera-e
annual growth of factory output of 7.5% over the five year period. The
national accounts estimates are lower than these in absolute terms, for
two reasons: (a) certain purchased inputs not subtracted out by DANE in
arriving at its value added figures are (correctly) subtracted in the
calculations for the national accounts; (b) the national accounts figures
do not include estimates of output for plants not recorded in DANE's data,
nor upward adjustments for underreporting. For 1970, the estimates shown here
assume underreporting of 6.3% of total SMI value added by plants included in
DANE's figures and 19.4% for plants not included in DANE's statistics. For
1975, they assume underreporting for reporting plants was twice as
serious as in 1970, based on the expectation that the tax reform of
1974-75 encouraged its aggravation. In both years, however, the main
component of our upward adjustment to the DANE figures involved the inclusion
of unreported plants.
It is presumed that the true annual growth rate of factory
manufacturing is above the 4% estimated here but below the 7.5% appearing in
the national accounts. For comparisons between SMI and large industry,
the above figures appear to be adequate.

be incorrect. The growth figures by industry over 1956-66 are much too
high, and are presented only to give some feel for relative growth rates.

5/  Our best estimate, based on the figures cited in notes 1/ and 2/ is 3.5.
5/  Repair activities appear to have been included more frequently in earlier years

Notes on Tables 1-6
Suggestions for improving the information base on SMI:
From a policy perspective, information on SMI and other types
of productive units (large industry and cottage shop) is needed for two
somewhat distinct reasons: (a) to judge the relative performance of groups
of producers like those classified here as SMI, or subgroups of them, and
(b) to ascertain what types of policies can improve performance of such
groups. The first purpose requires organized data on inputs and outputs
of firms or plants whose relative performance it is desired to judge. DANE
data has permitted considerable progress to be made along these lines;
several improvements to this data base could, however, be effected.
1.   More detailed presentation of data on the composition of the
labor force (white collar, blue collar, etc.) and of wage
payments by size of establishment and by three digit industry.
2.   Organization of data by firms rather than by plants.  From
an economic point of view, the firm may be the more important
unit.
3.,  Simultaneous presentation of data on installed horsepower,
energy consumed and value of fixed assets. This would permit
more adequate analysis of capital productivity.
4.   Small but intensive surveys designed to judge the degree of
underreporting suffered by the major variables included in the
Annual Manufacturing Survey. For smaller plants this is presumed
to be substantial, but there is no good guide to its degree.
Possibly another entity (such as Fedesarrollo) could carry out
such a survey in collaboration with DANE.
Other problems of the information base may or may not be best attacked by
DANE. They include:
1.   A lack of information on the financial characteristics
of producing units, with the exception of the Sociedades
Anonimas, for which some data is available from the Superin-
tendencia de Sociedades Anonimas. This gap in information is
relevant also in judging credit needs of different producers,
as well as the total capital used by producers.
2.   Lack of information on the matrix of purchases and sales
among different groups of producers.  Of particular interest
is that between SMI, large industry, and cottage shop. DANE
could deal with this issue, at least partially, by adding
a question or so to its questionaire, but it might be better
dealt with in other ways (e.g. selective small in depth surveys).
