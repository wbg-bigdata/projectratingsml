PAKISTAN
RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower            : Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries       : Azad Jamu & Kashmir (AJK)
: Province of Sindh
: Province of Balochistan
Amount              : SDR 96.4 million (US$136.7 million equivalent)
Terms               : Standard, with 35 years maturity.
On-Lending Terms    : From the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to the Governments
of Azad Jammu & Kashmir (GOAJK), Balochistan (GOB) and
Sindh (GOS), on the same terms and conditions under
which the Credit is received.
Progect Pescription : The proposed project would, over a nine yeat period,
finance an investment program in AJK, Balochistan and
Sindh comprising the rehabilitation of existing, and the
construction of new, community-managed, rural water
supply and sanitation, supported by a program of
institutional strengthening, policy reform and
innovative resource mobilization measures whereby, in
both project and non-project financed schemes,
beneficiary communities would assume responsibility for
system management, operations and maintenance. The
project would comprise the following components: (a)
construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing,
water supply and waste water drainage schemes providing
piped supplies to designated points using low cost
technology at a basic service level; (b) institutional
strengthening and training to enhance agency and
community implementation and operations and maintenance
(O&M) capacity; (c) latrine construction materials with
related health education and promotion; (d) water
resources and sanitation studies, and future investment
program preparation; and (e) a program of progressively
establishing private sector support including training
of small contractors, pilot support to women's income
generating activities, and technical guidance to
handpump manufacturers. Due to low rural income levels,
there would be no recovery of capital costs. O&M cost
recovery would be accomplished by transferring system
management and recurrent cost financing to beneficiary
communities, levying direct charges in Balochistan
townships, and levying indirect charges in Sindh through
enhancing the land and sugar-cane cesses and paddy and
cotton fees, thereby introducing a degree of income
distribution in favor of landless beneficiaries.



v ii -
Benefits             : The principal quantifiable benefits would be the value
of rural women's time savings on account of the improved
access to water. Benefits would also accrue, principally
to women and children, from the improvements in rural
health and productivity of the rural population. Other
significant Project benefits would be the improvements
in rural quality of life, the reAources mobilized at
village level for O&M, and the provision, without
imposing a recurrent financial burden on the public
sector, of sustained services to meet basic needs. 'fhe
internal economic rate of return (IERR) oE the Project
is about 14X, based on a conservative valuation of the
incremental time savings.
Risks                . The main Project risks are: (a) that the requirement for
the communities to accept responsibility for the
operations and maintenance (06f) of schemes may be slow
to materialize--such a policy is already well
established and effective in AJK; (b) the limited
experience of Government line agencies in working
directly with villagers; (c) possible slow release of
funds by the governments due to the dispersed nature of
investments; (d) the shortage of qualified government
staff to implement an expanded RWSS program; and (e) the
limited ability of the respective acencies to achieve
cost recovery targets. The project addresses these
risks by providing: (a) emphasis on management,
technical support and training for all implementing
agencies; (b) training for politicians, community
leaders and scheme personnel; (c) community relations
cells within the executing agencies; (d) hygiene
education programs; (e) advance consultancy services for
priority designs, materials specifications and
documentation; (f) assistance to agencies in procurement
procedures; (g) financial management support; and (h)
use of community agreements, which are to be in place
before implementing schemes.

PAKISTAN
RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
A. Country Background
The Rural Econemy and Ouality of Life
1.01 About 70% of the country's population of some 106 million currently
lives in rural areas. Agriculture is the main source of income and employment
for almost two-thirds of the rural population. The transformation over the
past two decades of the agricultural sector has enabled Pakistan to attain
self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and cotton, and become a leading exporter of
raw cotton. This progress has not been accompanied by corresponding
improvements in social infrastructure and human resource development.
1.02 The quality and availability of physical infrastructure, essential for
an adequate quality of life and well-being, has remained low in rural areas.
Less than 40% of the rural population have access to clean drinking water and
less than 5% have means of safe sanitation. Only 30% of rural households--
mainly the wealthier--have access to electricity compared to 70% of urban
households. The rural poor pey more for many essential goods and services
than their urban counterparts because of the remoteness of villages and the
consequent higher transportation costs. Access to cultivable land remains
inequitable, despite the attempts under the land reform efforts in 1959, 1972
and 1977 to redistribute productive assets to the landless. An estimated 42%
of rural households are landless; the majority of the rural landless work as
permanent laborers on other people's land, own some livestock or live in
poverty-stricken unemployment.
1.03 Poor.y endowed human resources are also a major constraint to increasing
the employment opportunities and improving the productivity of the rural
population. Education coverage and quality io poor, participation rates are
low, and illiteracy and drop-out rates are high. Although under-investment in
educdtion has affected Pakistan's entire population, the rural inhabitants,
and rural women in particular, have suffered the most. Less than 30Z of the
adult population is literate, with female literacy rates in rural areas only
some 4%. In FY86, primary school participation rates for boys and girls W;ere
71% and 38% respectively. Gender and rural/urban disparities are even higher
for secondary education; in 1985, about 50% of the urban boys aged 10 to 14
were in school, compared with 3% of rural girls in the same age group.
1.04 Health coverage in rural areas is very inadequate. At present, there is
only one basic health unit for about 38,000 people and one rural health clinic
for 208,000 people, with coverage being particularly poor in rural Sindh and
Balochistan. In these two provinces, the average patient has to travel about
14 kms to reach the nearest basic health unit. Even in areas served by health



facilities, utilization rates remain low because of the poor quality of
service which in itself is a consequence of the shortage of resources c'using
inadequate staffing and supply of medicine and equipment. The consequent low
morale of doctors in rural areas, where living conditions are severe,
exacerbates the overall poor quality of service. The rapidly growing
population, which is increasing at an average annual rate of about 3X, among
the highest in the world, and severely limited opportunities to become a
landowner, are causing an increasing proportion of the rural population to
attempt to make a living away from the land, thereby accelerating rural
migration to urban areas.
1.05 The socio-economic condition of the rural population, and especially
women, in Pakistan is appalling, pArticularly for a country entering the last
decade of the 20th Century and otherwise recording a satisfactory growth rate.
Social indicators reveal a situation which is worse than in many other
countries in a comparable stage of development.
1.06 The task of improving existing social services and infrastructure, and
making provision for the rapidly growing population has to be carried out in
the context of the prevailing fiscal deficit, reductions in which would
require curtailments in per capita public expenditure, one of the key policy
requirements of the medium-term adjustment program adopted by Government of
Pakistan (GOP) in FY89. Notwithstanding this requirement, GOP, in keeping
with its basic development objective of alleviating poverty and raising the
standard of living of the country's population, has given high priority in the
Seventh Plan (FY89-93) to the rural water supply, education, health and
related sectors that are the basic needs for equal participation in the
economy. The achieved Annual Development Plan (ADP) sectoral allocations for
rural water supply are currently about 80% of the Seventh Plan level due to
macro-resource constraints, and are unlikely to grow in real terms for the
next several years.
1.07 The proposed Project is designed to assist GOP in achieving its
objectives for sustainable resource mobilization, and for promoting socio-
economic development and reducing rural-urban inequities, through the
provision of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS).
B. Water Resources
1.08 Although the volume of water required for drinking purposes is small,
particularly when compared to agricultural use, there is considerable
variation in both the availability and in the per capita supply cost of
potable water. Average annual rainfall is 1,500 mm in the northern Himalayan
foothills and 500 mm in the northern Punjab, while Balochistan and Sindh have
a desert climate with under 300mm rainfall. The Indus river and its
tributaries are the main sources of potable surface water and groundwater. In
many areas the surface and groundwater is highly mineralized with
concentrations of dissolved salts above the level tolerable for drinking (in
the range 1500-2000 milLigrams per liter). Shallow, fresh groundwater is



available in the southwest (f Sindh and Pur'ib; overall, about 80X of the
population have access to this water, whilte 20% live in areas of intolerably
saline water. Here, expensive treatment of surface water is necessary. In
the mountainous northern areaR, freshwater is generally available through
mountain springs and streams, which only requires careful distributior, to
villages to avoid becoming polluted during conveyance. In the desert areas of
Balochistan and Sindh (such as Kohistan and Thar), potable groundwater: is
available only at considerable depths (over 750 feet deep ini cases). In North
West Frontier Province (NWFP), the depth of groundwater is lesz but d-ie to
dispersed location of sources, piped systels conveying water many kilometers
are nevertheless often necessary.
C. Service and Investment Levels
Existing Sector Coverage
1.09 About 30 million people, or 401 of the rural population of Pakistan,
have access to safe drinking water, with varying service levels. For example
in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Balochistan and Sindh coverages are 411, 22%
and 46X respectively. Sanitation facilities, providing some 2-4X coverage,
are extremely inadequate due to: the high cost of inappropriately designed
latrines; traditional defecation practices; the lack of felt need; and weak
government promotion of the health benefits associated with hygienic
practices. Drainage of sullage water is a problem, especially in the flatter
southern part of the country; coverage in rural areas is very low (around 5X).
Maintenance is commonly neglected with resulting health hazards due to insects
and malodors. There are no effective hygiene education programs of a
significant size in Pakistan, although a number of initiatives are underway.
Although there is consensus that women should be the primary target gr'.up for
hygiene education, appropriate intervention is difficult due to cultural and
social constraints.
Health  nd SanitatLo
1.10 Despite recent improvements in health service delivery, health
indicators in Pakistan compare poorly with those of countries of similar per
capita income.  Incidence of diarrheas and skin diseases is closely linked
with poor sanitation, inadequate and polluted water for drinking and washing,
and insanitary hygiene practices. Handpumps which are not sealed, permitting
infiltration of contaminated surface water, water storage pots which are not
clean, low pressure in water pipes, permitting infiltration of polluted
drainage water, and unhygienic human waste and sullage disposal all contribute
to conditions increasing the risk of diarrhea. The debilitating cycle of
exereta-related disease causing malnutrition, low infant birth weight and high
infant mortality is a major obstacle to social improvement and economic
development. Improved access and quality of RWSS services combined with the
ado,tion of hygienic practices are essential for the betterment of rural
health, living conditions and development.
1.11 Although preventative health services have broad outreach, and there is
a basic health unit in most Union Council headquarters, there are no hygiene
education programs at village level. Female health workers do not generally



- 4 -
move outside their own vill"ges, while traditional birth attendants (dais)
have many other duties. The local custom of not permitting dialogue with
members of the opposite sex outside the family group blocke channels normally
used for information flow, delaying behavior change and development,
particularly as regards RWSS attitudes and practices.
D. Sector Oraanization
Federal Organization
1.1? Under the Pakistan federal constitution, the provincial and state
governments have responsibility for water, sanitation, health and local
government affairs. However, the Federal government has considerable
influence over the planning process. Five-Year Development Plans are prepared
by the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Planning and Development
(APD) which acts as a Secretariat of the Planning Commission. The Physical
Planning and Housing Section of the Planning Commission is responsible for                  I
processing water supply and sanitation investments as part of the ADS. Health
and hygiene education affairs are dealt with by the Health Section. The
functions of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD)
include coordination among the provinces and states, and the Rural Development
Wing is responsible for Rural Works programs in cooperation with the
provincial/state line agencies.
Provincial and State Organization
1.13 At the Provincial/State level, sector activities are coordinated by the
Planning and Development (P&D) Departments responsible for planning and
coordinating development activities in the provinces/states, including: the
ADP's foreign aid components; provincial development priorities, and project
monitoring. The Public Health Engineering Departments (PHED)1I are the main
sector implementing agencies at the provincial/state level, being set up
initially to provide services in urban areas, and working more recently in the
rural areas with a primary focus on medium and larger settlements. The PHEDs
have adequate staffing for conventional technologies; however, watzer supply
development has been emphasized with little attention to sanitation and
drainage, and community involvement has not been a feature in development
programs. However, the PHEDs which handle large provincial ADP investments
and have implemented expanding work programs over recent years are now
beginning to implement lower-cost technology options to extend services to
more remote villages. As a consequence their operations and maintenance (O&M)
burden has increased since local bodies have hitherto been generally unwilling
to assume these responsibilities. Despite commendable achievements, the PHEDs
need strengthening in cost recovery, operation and maintenance, monitoring,
evaluation and community outreach capability.
I/    In the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir the agency is the Public Health
Engineering Circle.



5-
1.14 The Local Government and Rural Development Departments (LGRDDs)II are
community-oriented and responsible for supervision and coordination of tale
functions of District and Union Councils, including basic services such as
water supply, community health, drainage, and education. LGRDD staff work
through the community at the village level but are few in number; generally
lack technical skills; and are requireC to provide multi-discipline
infrastructure services. The iARDDs, union and district councils and the
communities make inputs to drainage works implemented by PHEDs.
1.15 District Councils have the responsibility for: disbursement of ADP
grant funds and their own resources for projects; promotion of excreta
disposal and pubiic health; infectious disease control; and water supply and
drainage works. Many are long established but have limited capacity to
undertake larger-scale developments. The Union Council is the lowest level in
the two-tier local government with each council covering some 10-18 villages
(14,000-21,000 people). Their sector responsibilities include sanitatiorn,
water supply, and solid waste; they have limited financial and administrative
capacity. (See Annex 3 for full sector agency details).
Sustainability
1.16 Public sector water supply programs have in the past focussed on
expanding reported coverage statistics, paying little attention to operation
and maintenance (O&) andl the need for community participation. As a result,
many water schemes are inefficient investments, are not supported by the
communities, and deteriorate despite political pressure on government to
assume an ever expanding 0&M responsibility.  Cost recovery is generally poor
due to lack of political will and weak institutional mechanisms.  The limited
Funds reco'-ared are often not used for O&M.  AJK is a notable exception; the
community implements construction, finances a significant proportion of
capital costs, manages the supply and undertakes O0M successfully.
Donor Assistance
1.17 There has been limited donor assistance to rural water supply,
sanitation ane hygiene education programs in Pakistan. For example assistance
to AJK, Balochistan and Sindh totals about US$45 million since 1983. Major
contributions have been made by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) and Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA). Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ),
Kreditanstalt fur Weiderafbau (KfW), United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and Ovorseas Development Administration (ODA) have also
provided assistance in the four provinces of Balochistan, Punjab, North West
Frontier and Sindh.
1/    In Sindh there are two Departments:  Rural Development (RDD) and Local
Government.

Private Sector and Non-Governmental Organizationsg NGOs)
1.18 The public sector has provided an estimated 50 of existing water
supplies. Apart from the traditional contractor and consultant role, the
private sector plays an important role providing rural services at the
household level, including tubewell sinking, latrine construction, handpump
manufac'..ure and installation, and financing and maintaining these facilities.
Much of the maintenance of publicly-provided systems is contracted out.
Community-based organizations (CBOs) exist throughout the rural sector with
the potential to take active and responsible roles in project ' ?lementation
and system O&H. In both Balochistan and Sindh, there are many registered
NGOs; they are mostly urban-based, and since very few are active in the RWSS
sector their impact has been minimal.
E. Demand and Investment Targets
1.19 There is a strong national commitment in Pakistan to provide potable
drinking water. Following the return to civilian government in 1985,
development finance allocations for rural water supply increased substantially
(by about 70%) in recognition of the high level of demand by the electorate.
This high priority is also embodied in the on-going Seventh Five Year Plan, in
which national and provincial objectives are to achieve 75X rural water supply
and 30% drainage coverage by 1993.
1.20  Analysis of recent experience (para. 2.01) indicates that these sector
objectives cannot be met by 1993, but may be achievable by 1998 if an
alternative implementation strategy were adopted. While itln implementing
agencies like the PHEDs habie begun major excpansions of RWSS iitvestments, there
have been implementation delays. Unit costs have incrsased, and excessive
emphasis is placed on expansion to the detriment of ens.tring efficient
operations of existing investments. Many schemes are consequently working
below design capacity, and beneficiary involvement in management and recurrent
financing is marginal.
1.21 In addition, the public sector has (except in AJK) assumed O&M
responsibility; this presents serious financial and logistical difficulties.
There are currently insufficient financial and manpower resources to maintain
the existing inadequate facilities. The scattered nature of rural communities
gives rise to high maintenance costs if undertaken by the public sector. If
RWSS coverage were to increase, the forecast maintenance costs would exceed
existing capital budgets withi-, 5 years, causing an unacceptable burden on
public sector finances since there is currently no cost recovery.
Strategic Investment Plans (SXPg) for the Sectog
1.22 To address the service deficits and ahortcomingn of the present method
of service provision, the Government has prepared, with CIDA assistance, SIPs
for each Province/S:ate. The SIPs envisage nationwide investment from 1991-
1998 of about US$1 22 billion at 1989 constant prices, which with the
projected levels of domestic resource availability and international donor
assistance, would achieve an estimated 751 coverage of rural water supply,
providing for an additional 30 million people, or a total of 62 million
people. The SlPs have two phases. Activities during the first phase would
(a) strengthen the institutional capacity and develop human resources in the



sector; (b) rehabilitate existing schemes; (c) devolve management and O&M
responsibility to the community, and establish O&M cost recovery mechanisms;
and (d) build in delivery mechanisms which ensure system sustainability in the
future, while generally ma-ntaining the rate of investment at unchanged
levels. During the second phase, the rate of investment would increase,
expanding coverage as fast as resources permit, achieving 751 coverage of
rural water supply by the end of 1998 (the terminal year of the Eighth Five
Year Plan).
1.23 Basic service levels of water supplu, hygiene education, household
sanitation, and drainage would be adopted.  Resultant sector investments
through the GOP Seventh Five-Year Plan (1993) and Eighth Plan Periods (1998)
have been studied in the SIP and are estimated respectively to cost about
Rs. 6800 million (US$324 million) and Rs. 19,000 million (US$905 million)
nationally at constant 1989 prices, including costs financed by Government and
external agencies. This investment would be equivalent to about 4X cf
national ADP.
1.24 The demand for drainage fac! ities (the disposal of sullage or grey
water) is mainly limited to the sweet-water (non-saline) zone of the flat,
irrigated areas, where it is caused by the surplus from mechanized household
handpumps installed on tubewells. Due to inadequate delivery mechanisms and
macro resource constrai.ts, the current GOP target of 301 coverage by 1993
does not appear to be attainable. The newly proposed strategy of integrating
drainage investments with water supply schemes in large settlements in the
sweet-water area would lead to an overall coverage of 151 by 1998.
1.25 Demand for adequate excreta disposal is dictated by the people's felt
need and willingness to pay for latrines. In this respect, effective demand
is much lower than needs. Field surveys indicate a significant interest in
the installation of latrines in areas with returned migrants and in larger,
more densely populated settlements close to urban centers. The SIPs propose
that hygiene education and latrine promotion, coupled with village level
training and development of low cost options, could increase the exereta
disposal coverage from under 5 to 0l by 1998.
1.26 In the most poorly served provinces, the resulting SIPs for the period
FY1990-98 would cost an estimated Rs 785 million in AJK, Rs 2530 million in
Balochistan and Rs 2915 million in Sindh (in 1989 prices). Consistent with
the overall investment strategy, expenditure on software (institutional
development, human resources development, training, and hygie*ae education) is
expected to be concentrated in the first three years, accounting for over 621
of the _.tal outlay on these components in the SIPs. Expenditure on works
(83X of SIP outlays) would peak after 1993, and during the Eighth Plan period,
over two thirds of the investment would be made. The SIPs would constitute
about 111 of the total state/provincial capital expenditure during the period
in AJK, and about 161 in Sindh and Balochistan. The increase in relation to
historical shares of the sector is about 5 to 6 percentage points in Sindh and
AJK and 4 percentage points in Balochistan. Therefore, allocation of
resources for the SIP would require changes in inter-sectoral priorities by
the Provincial/State governments in the project area. Given the size of the
SIPs and projected domestic availability of funds for the sector, the



-8-
additional resources required are estimated at about 42% of the plan in AJK,
25% in Balochistan and 401 in Sindh. This represents the gap requiring
external financing to meet coverage targets for these three entities.
F. Bank Groups Role in the Water and Sanitation Sector and
Experience with Past Lending
1.27 The International Development Association (IDA) has provided finance for
seven projects in the urban water and sanitation sector in Pakistan, four in
the Punjab and three in Karachi. The first two projects in Lahore were the
Lahore Water and Sewerapv Project (Credit 106-PAK, US$2.11 million equivalent,
1967) and the Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project (Credit 630-
PAK, US$26.6 million equivalent, 1976).  The objectives of these two projects
were to assist the development of a financially sound water and sewerage
agency for metropolitan Lahore, improve service levels, and help prepare an
urban project. The Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) was established
in 1977. Though initial financial performance was disappointing, the projects
were successfully completed (Project Completion Report (PCR) Nos. 0400 and
6204). The third operation, the US$16.0 milion equivalent Lahore Urban
Development project which became effective in 1984, finances among other
investments, water, sewerage and stormwater drainage primary and secondary
infrastructure in the Lahore Walled City (upgrading) and in a large sites and
services scheme in North East Lahore.  Implementation has been delayed due to
land acquisition difficulties, but will be completed satisfactorily in late
1992.  The fourth operation in Lahore is the water supply and sewerage
component of the Punjab Urban Development Project (Credit 189,' 2AK, US$90.0                I
million equivalent).  It was approved by IDA April 12, 1988 and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.28  Three projects are on-going in Karachi.  The first, the Karachi Water
Supply Project (Credit 1374-PAK, US$25.0 million equivalent, 1983) which
financed improvements to Karachi's bulk water supply, and the formation of the
semi-autonomous Karachi Water Supply and Sewerage Board (KWSB) is nearing
completion satisfactorily. The KWSB now serves some 7 million people daily in
Karachi, with increasing financial and technical efficiency. The second
comprised a US$56.3 million urban water supply and sewerage component of the
Karachi Special Development Project (Credit 1652-PAK, US$70.0 million
equivalent, 1986). Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The third
project, the Second Karachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Credit 1987-
PAK - US$125 million equivalentV), approved by IDA on 28 February, 1989, and
financing major improvements to bulk water supply, treatment and distribution,
sanitation, and institutional strengthening of KWSB, is progressing well.
1.29 Our dialogue with GOS, concentrating on resource mobilization,
institutional improvements and economic efficiency, has improved progressively
over the past decade. The proposed project would build on this experience.
1.30 The first Bank Group operation in the State of Azad Jammu & Kashmir was
the Hill Farming Technical Development Project (IDA Credit 751-PAK of US$3.0
million equivalent of projec: costs of US$4.0 million) financed applied
agricultural research and strengthening of implementation capacity.  The
1/    Cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank.



- 9 -
project was satisfactorily implemented, achieving most objectives (PCR No.
6577). The Integrated Hill Farming Development Project in the State of Azad
Jammu & Kashmir (Credit 1461-PAK - US$26.5 million equivalent) was the second
Bank Group activity in AJK. It provides support for farm fodder production,
tree planting, feeder roads and livestock improvement. Project implementation
is proceeding well and consideration is being given to a second operation.
Government and sector agency performance during preparation of the proposed
RWSS project has been productive.
1.31 Bank Group involvement to date in Balochistan has been mainly in the
agriculture, energy and highway sectors, in some cases through Federal
agencies. Government and agency performance has generally been satisfactory.
1.32 The Bank's urban water supply irvestments have been productive for
Pakistan, and our related policy dialogue has been effective in resource
mobilization. This wou'd be the first operation in the rural water sector,
although the lessons or our urban experience are reflected in the Project's
design. In particular, attention has been given to O&M management and
financing; and to strengthening the project management and community
orientation of line departments through sustained technical assistance and
training. Our dialogue during project preparation has been productive, the
authorities adopting sound policies for community management and cost
recovery. However, implementing these policies over large areas with limited
physical resources will pose a major challenge. Our first involvement in the
urban sector was sixteen years ago and performance has steadily improved.
Similar results could be achieved in the rural sector but only in the longer
term.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Oritin
2.01 GOP requested IDA and CIDA to assist develop the RWSS sector in mid-
1987 with a view to improving the quality of rural life. Following a joint
sector review in late 1987 (Report No. 7060-PAK), the World Bank organized a
CIDA-financed national Workshop and Policy Conference in April 1988, to enable
sector agencies to share experience, and present lessons learned from
innovative projects in Pakistan which had tested new approaches.Y The
resultant RWSS policy stated that in future: (a) the beneficiary community1
participates at all stages of scheme implementation; (b) an integrated
development approach be adopted providing a balanced triad of improvements to
J/   World Bank Technical Paper No.105 "Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in
Pakistan: Lessons from Experience", 1989 cites examples of successful
community participation in RWSS programs.
21    The community could be a cluster of dwellings, family groups and/or
settlements or villages supplied with water from a common source, and
represented by an agreed and recognizable entity (such as a village
development committee, a local leader, a headman, or an elected
official).



- 10 -
water supply, sanitation and hygiene practices; and (c) the community be fully
responsible for and pay all costs of management, operations and maintenance of
RWSS scheDas.
B. Ob1ggtlves
2.02 The project objective is to improve rural productivity and health,
particularly of women and children, and reduce poverty and deprivation in
rural AJK, Balochistan and Sindh, by increasing coverage and service levels of
RWSS. The proposed project would support an integrated, community-based RWSS
strategy, phasing in a sustainable, financially viable approach to community-
based management and O&M, and would progressively moderate the level of
provincial recurrent budgetary support required.
C. Description
2.03 Over a period of nine years (FY92-FY2000) the proposed project would
finance a RWSS investment program in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and
the Provinces of Balochistan and Sindh providing a basic level of service.V
The project would comprise three components:  (a) infrastructure development;
(b) institutional development; and (c) policy reform and resource
mobilization.
Infrastructure Development
2.04 This component would comprise the following:
For Azad Jammu and Kashmir
LGRDD - executed
(a) construction of about 1,600 new, rehabilitated and augmented water
supply schemes, including provision of cattle troughs and community
bathing as appropriate, in the five districts to serve approximately
an additional 630,000 people living in about 500 villages; and
(b) construction, integrally with the water supply program, of about
3,200 demonstration latrines, and the provision of essential
materials for approximately 9,700 latrines to be constructed by
householders.
For the Province of Balochistan
PHED - executed
(a) Construction of about 6 new water supply and drainage schemes in
rural townships to provide improved service to about 140,000 people;
1/    Public standpipes and communal tanks, wells or handpumps.



- 11 .
(b) rehabilitation of about 70 water supply schemes including
renovations, upgrading, extensions and completions to provide
improved service to about 350,000 people in rural communities; and
(c) construction of about 160 tubewells in rural communities in the four
PHED administrative circles;
LGRDD - executed
(d) construction, integrally with the water supply program, of about 80
demonstration latrines, and provision of essential materials for
about 11,200 latrines constructed by householders.
For the Province of Sindh
PHED - executed
(a) construction of about 300 new mechanized water supply schemes in the
six PHED Circles in villages generally under 2,500 population;
(b) construction of about 40 drainage schemes in the sweetwater zone and
60 drainage schemes in the barrage area for villages which have
drainage problems;
(c) rehabilitation of about 480 water supply and drainage schemes
including renovations, upgrading, extensions and completions;
(d) construction, integrally with the water supply program, of about
3,000 demonstratier. latrines, and provision of essential materials
for about 17,500 latrinez constructed by householders;
(e) rehabilitation and construction in the Arid Zones of some 730 hand
dug wells (450 in the Sandy Desert and 280 in the Hilly Desert) and
of about 110 existing and new small check dams;
LGRDD - executed
(f) construction of water supplies generally using handpumps to supply
about 1,800 villages and about 135 small on-site sullage drainage
schemes in the two worst-served Districts, Sukkur and Larkana;
(g) construction, integrally with the water supply program, of about
3,500 demonstration latrines, and provision of essential materials
for about 10,000 latrines constructed by householders.
Institutional Development
2.05 This component would comprise: sector institution strengthening to
provide cost effective managerial and technical guidance to rural communities;
detailed design and supervision; hygiene education and promotion programs;
training and community-based program orientation for politicians, sector
agency personnel and community leaders; a phased program of private sector



- 12 -
support including flexible, pilot women's income generating activities
(comprising training, technical assistance, and information dissemination
within communities), mistri (small scale contractor) training, and technical
guidance in improved handpump and latrine component manufacturing and
marketing; finance, cost recovery and management systems improvements;
management information systems for improved RWSS planning; improvements in
water resources data bases, and RWSS design methodology and scheme selection
criteria; preparation of District Development Plans in selected districts
(Balochistan); and preparation of future investments and pilot projects.
Policy Reform and Resource Mobilization
2.06 The provincial and state governments would implement complementary
policy and resource mobilization measures by: (a) introducing a sustainable
and viable modality whereby the communities would pay for OM costs and be
fully responsible for the RWSS services; (b) increasing local resource
mobilization through enhanced land cess (in the Sindh) and water service
charges (GOB townships); and promoting private sector involvement (see paras.
4.03-4.09 and Annex 6 for further details of resource mobilization).
2.07 A detailed description of each component is given in Annex 1 which also
describes the associated institutional and financial improvements and training
support.
D. Pxgiect Costs
2.08 The total cost of the proposed project, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at Re 4,530 million (US$194.2 million equivalent),
of which taxes and duties amount to Rs 507 million (US$21.6 million
equivalent). Summary estimates are given in Table 2.1 and detailed estimates
are given in Annex 2. Full details are contained in the project file. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at Rs 939 million (US$40.9 million
equivalent) or 21% of total project costs.
2.09 The base cost estimates of the project components reflect price levels
prevailing in June, 1990. The estimates have been based on preliminary and in
some cases final designs, and generally on the market costs of recent similar
works carried out in AJK, Balochistan and Sindh. In some cases, the
Government Schedules of Rates have been used and updated with appropriate
allowable premiums to reflect recent tender experience. Estimates for
materials, equipment and vehicles were based on recent quotations from
suppliers and market surveys of manufacturers. Physical contingencies of 10%
on civil works and 5% on equipment, materials and technical assistance have
been allowed.
2.10 Price contingencies and foreign exchange conversions have been
calculated in accordance with Bank guidelines, using World Bank estimates
prevailing at the time of appraisal. Foreign inflation rates are estimated at
+7.2%, +6.5%, and +5.0% for years FY90 through FY92, respectively, and +4.5%
annually thereafter. Domestic inflation is estimated at +10%, +8%, and +7%
for years FY90 through FY92, respectiv&ly, and +6.5% annually thereafter.
Price contingencies amount to 23.8% of the total estimated project rupee cost.
Updated Bank inflation estimates would marginally reduce the price
contingencies. The rates used at appraisal have been retained, and have also
been used by GOP for project processing.

E. Financing Plan
2.11 The proposed IDA credit of US$136.7 million equivalent would finance
about 70X of project costs, covering 1001 of foreign exchange and 62X of local
currency requirements. Provincial and State Government contributions of
US$47.4 million equivalent would finance 251 of project costs; beneficiary
contributions in kind valued at US$10.1 million equivalent (51 of total) would
finance land, and civil works in AJK. The project financing plan is
summarized in Table 2.2 below.

2.12  The proposed flow of funds is shown in Annex 5.  The IDA credit would be
made available to GOP on standard terms; at negotiations GOP confirmed that
the credit would be passed on by GOP to GOAJK, GOB and GOS on the same terms
and conditions under which it is received, and the. -redit proceeds and
counterpart funds would be made available to the implementing agencies through
budgetary allocations using existing procedures which operate satisfactorily.
The governments of AJK, Balochistan and Sindh would bear the foreign exchange
risk under these arrangements. GOAJK, GOB and GOS would respectively receive
US$28.0 million, US$37.8 million and US$70.9 million equivalent.
F. Futuxe Donor Agencv .ector Suncot
2.13 Several donor agencies have agreed that their future assistance in the
sector would support the SIPs and be implemented consistently with the agreed
policy framework under which the Bank would also lend. KfW and GTZ are
assisting NWFP and are likely to continue to do so.  The Asian Development                  -
Bank (ADB) and ODA are likely to assist in Punjab, and the Netherlands in
Balochistan and NWFP; CIDA may assist in Sindh at a later date.  A donor has                |
yet to be identified for Northern Areas. The Policy Investment Review
Committee and support cell (PIRC - para. 3.04) was established in July 1990,
to assist coordination and the achievement of consistent RWSS policy.

3.01 The project would be implemented in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK),
Balochistan and Sindh by the following agencies:

Handpumped Water Supplies and Sullage Drainage Schemes          RDD
Latrine Program, Hygiene Education, Vehicles and Materials    RDD
3.02 The agencies would be strengthened under the project by the: (i)
provision of financial, management and technical support; (ii) recruitment of
additional personnel; (iii) upgrading and expansion of activity cells to
address specific project components; and (iv) training and human resources
skills development. This expertise would be provided by consortia of local
and international consultants, since local consultants do not have all of the
specialized personnel required. Appointment, subject to credit effectiveness,
of the main technical assistance Advisory Consultants would be a condition of
credit effectiveness (para. 6.03). The detailed engineering, bid document
preparation, procurement and project supervision would be done by the agencies
with assistance mainly from local consultants with limited inputs from
international expertise for the procurement of specialized equipment. During



- 16 -
negotiations GOP confirmed that project executing agencies would remain
adequately staffed throughout implementation. Project agencies are reviewed
in detail in Annex 3.
Operational Action Plan
3.03 The timetable for implementation of the project's physical and policy
measures would be contained in an Operational Action Plan (OAP) in a form
suitable for monitoring progress. GOP confirmed at negotiations that project
implementation would be carried out in accordance with the Operational Action
Plan (OAP) satisfactory to IDA, which would be reviewed annually and updated
in consultation with IDA; the objectives and timing of actions in the OAP were
confirmed, and the agreed OAP was attacbed to the minutes of negotiations.
Policy Consistency 3nd Federal Coordination
3.04 Policy guidance and coordination would be provided at the Federal level
by MLGRD. GOP confirmed at negotiations that in order to enhance inter-
governmental coordination and long term sector development, a PIRC had been
created within MLGRD, and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and UNICEF
funding was being obtained to support it. The PIRC would be assisted by a
support cell. The Committee would play a central role in sector policy
consolidation and would guide implementation, promote sustainability, and act
as a catalyst for information exchange and policy dialogue.
Status of Proiect PreDaratio'
3.05 Final designs and bid documents for civil works and materials for the
first two years of the program would be complete by April 1991, through local
consultants using standardized designs developed during project preparation.
Terms of Reference for major institutional strengthening consultancy
assignments are finalized and short-listing is complete. Details of the pilot
income generating support program will be developed during the first two years
of implementation.
Implementation Program
3.06 The key for successful project implementation is the development of a
methodology for sustained collaboration between the provincial sector agencies
and the local communities to put in place the community-based approach and
system "ownership" as part of civil works construction. Implementation is
expected to be substantially complete in eight years with the final completion
of all components before the end of the ninth year. Implementation schedules
are shown in Annex 4. The proposed project would be completed by June 30,
1999. This would be the first Bank lending operation in the RWSS sector to
Pakistan; the schedule is considered achievable based on recent lending
experience in other sectors dealing with rural investments. The Project
Concept Document (PC-1) required for GOP processing has been prepared by MLGRD
as a program supported by the three contributing PC-ls from GOAJK, GOB and
GOS.  It was agreed at negotiations that approval of the project PC-1
documents by the Eyecutive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC)
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA operation (para.
6.03).

B. Community Mobilization
3.07 Rural Pakistanis have traditionally provided drinking water and
maintained supplies for themselves, either at the household or community level
by the installation of handpumps, the construction of open dug wells, or from
irrigation systems like the karez (underground canal system) in Balochistan.
In recent years, however, public sector provision of improved water supplies
at all stages in construction, maintenance and financing, has tended to
supplant this role. The implementation strategy of the RWSS project is to
develop a delivery mechanism whereby rural communities would again provide,
operate and maintain the service for themselves to the extent possible.
3.08 At the National Policy Conference (para 2.01), notable examples of
successful community-managed RWSS and other rural development programs in
Pakistan were cited. The UNICEF-assisted RWSS programs in AJK, NWFP, Sindh
and Balochistan and the IDA-assisted Punjab Irrigation Project have developed
an approach to sustained delivery systems. In contrast, larger programs
implemented by technically-driven line departments have been characterized by
lack of involvement of beneficiaries, resulting in problems of implementation
and sustainability.
3.09 A number of significant benefits from community involvement have already
been identified. First, capital costs have been reduced through community
inputs in kind %land and labor) and by more intensive supervision of
construction work. Second, beneficiary participation at the planning, design
and execution stages has ensured that schemes better reflect community needs
and preferences, and created the sense of ownership required for the
subsequent assumption of the O&M responsibilities. Third, the burden to the
public exchequer has been reduced by community financing of O&M. These
findings are supported by recent IDA experience working with grass roots NGOs
in rural development projects.
3.10 There is significant scope for large scale community involvement in the
sector. In small villages, this is enhanced by the high degree of homogeneity
and social interaction among households. Larger villages have greater socio-
economic differentiation but are more likely to possess leadership and
technical skills. A high proportion of villages in the project area have
informal, self-help groups already engaged in small improvement works such as
repairs to wells, and construction of drains and link roads. These grass-
roots NGOs would be strengthened and developed through recognition,
motivation, training and support to undertake RWSS management and O&M.
3.11 The proposed community management strategy would require community
development expertise and awareness in the line departments like PHED which
have hitherto had strong engineering orientation, and strengthening
institutional capabilities of the Rural Development Department (RDD), LGRDD
and health departments which are already working with the communities. To
facilitate inter-departmental co-ordination in the field, the task of
preparing communities to take over and manage schemes would be the
responsibility of each line department. To assist this process, Community
Development Units would be formed in the PHEDs in Sindh and Balochistan, in
the RDD in Sindh and in LGRDD in AJK. The units would be staffed with



- 18 -
community development facilitators (extension workers) and sanitation
promoters (at taluka or sub-district level in Sindh, district level in
Balochistan and subdivision level in AJK). Multidisciplinary Project
Implementation Teams (PITs) consisting of a facilitator, a health educator and
a sub-engineer would be formed drawing on existing line department staff and
newly appointed staff. Technical assistance consultancies would train local
staff, assist in developing promotional and hygiene education materials and
programs, and help to make operational the methodology of working with the
communities and facilitating community management.
3.12 Community mobilization would proceed in six phases, as described in
Figure 3.1, with the central feature that, supported by continued training,
there would be a staged handing over of responsibility to the community
arranged to achieve sustained and self-financing O&M of a completed scheme.
There would be variations in the approach among the agencies. In AJK which
already has a high level of communitcy involvement, efforts would be
concentrated on introducing an integrated package of water supply, hygiene
education and sanitation. In Sindh, greater reliance would initially be
placed on union councils, with the intent of gradually handing over functions
to community based organizations. In Balochistan, the existing power
structure will imply the need to work more through the tribal leadership.
3.13   The rural local councils would in the first phase be involved in
village prioritization and establishing initial contact with the community.
Village or scheme selection criteria to be adopted are shown in Annex 9. In
the second phase, the PIT would, following a needs assessment, prepare the
community by motivation and training. At this stage, the community would be
required to have agreed upon a representative organization, body or
individual; the various technology and service level-options would also be
presented for choice.
3.14 In the third phase, an assessment would be undertaken of the state of
community 'readiness' after which a mutual commitment would be made by the
line department and the community-based organization by the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Adopting the procedure of using MOUs was
agreed at negotiations. By signing a MOU, the community would undertake to:
(a) establish a user association representing the majority of the target
beneficiaries; (b) for electrically-driven mechanized schemes, contract
directly with the power distribution authority and pay connection charges in
advance; (c) ensure participation of women; (d) provide land for the scheme,
and (e) assume responsibility for O&M management and payments. Similarly, the
executing agency would undertake to: (a) provide grant finance for a
proportion of the capital costs of a basic service level of water supply and
in some cases drainage; (b) implement the agreed scheme in consultation with
the community; (c) involve the community in design of the scheme; (d) arrange
construction by private contractor;11 (e) undertake O0M for a limited period
prior to handing over the scheme, employing the scheme contractor for
In AJK, construction except of major structures would be by the
community using pipe materials financed through the project and supplied
by GOAJK.

this purpose; (f) accept responsibility for major repairs on an exception
basis or in cases of extreme hardship; (g) train and assist the community in
system O&M, management and financing; and (h) provide assistance for extension
of the scheme.
3.15  Foll wfing the signing of the MOU, the fourth phase would comprise
technical work on design and procurement. While procurement and construction
management would be the responsibility of the line department, during the
fifth phase community liaison with and concurrence of the community based
organization would be sought and provided continuously during the
construction, supervision and certification of completion of work phases.
Following training on the technical, managerial and financial functions, the
scheme would in the sixth phase be handed over to the community for O&M. The
community would be responsible for cost recovery, and use the revenues
generated for financing recurrent expenditures.
C. Procurement
3.16 Procurement of goods and works would be carried out in accordance with
the IDA Procurement Guidelines. Contracts of about US$87.1 million equivalent
would be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures while
contracts for about US$32.6 equivalent million would be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Procurement arrangements are
summarized in Table 3.1 below.

Civil Works
3.17 The estimated cost of civil works is US$95.3 million equivalent
inclusive of contingencies, duties and taxes, with contracts generally under
US$2.0 million equivalent. The small, scattered nature of the work would
limit the interest of foreign bidders. Civil works would therefore generally
be procured through LCB procedures which do not preclude international
participation. Existing LCB bidding procedures of the implementing agencies
have been reviewed. While the review showed that the procedures generally
ensured adequate competition, encouraged economy and efficiency and did not
preclude foreign bidders from participating in locally advertised bidding,
other aspects of the procedures require strengthening. Time for bid
submission, evaluation criteria to ensure that the lowest evaluated responsive
bid wins and not necessarily that bid with the lowest price, and public bid
opening arrangements would need to be made co.isistent with IDA guidelines.
GOP confirmed at negotiations that LCB procurement would be in accordance with
IDA Guidelines.
3.18 Civil works for new and rehabilitation works would generally be bid as
complete schemes. Small schemes would generally be grouped into packages of
at least US$250,000 equivalent (Rs5.O million) to attract large, experienced
local contractors, and avoid the burden of administering numerous small
contracts. Pre-qualification of contractors would be carried out for
contracts in excess of US$250,000 equivalent (Rs5.0 million). There would be
about 150 main civil works contracts.
3.19 Very small-scale project-financed civil works, in total not exceeding
US$3.0 million equivalent, would be procured through direct labor and/or
supply contracts with the community in accordance with local procedures. The
minor civil works to be fully undertaken by the community in AJK (principally
pipelaying, system rehabilitation and construction of storage tanks) as part
of their contribution and financed from local community resources, would
either be undertaken directly through the community-based organizations or
using local procedures. In AJK, pipe and pumping plant materials would, in
accordance with the MOU, be financed through the project.
Vehicles. Materials and Equigment
3.20 The estimated cost of goods, materials, vehicles and equipment is
US$53.3 million inclusive of contingencies, duties and taxes. Procurement of
specialized vehicles, materials and equipment would generally be carried out
under ICB procedures. Of this amount, equipment costing about US$32.6 million
(excluding duties and taxes) would be procured through ICB, principally for
pipe materials, drilling equipment, specialized vehicles and spare parts. A
margin of preference of 151 of CIF value of imported goods or the applicable
customs duty and import taxes to non-exempt importers, whichever is lower,
would be extended to domestic manufacturers in bid evaluation. Minor items
including office furniture and machinery, pumping plant, laboratory equipment,
vehicles and items in relatively small quantities which would not attract the
interest of foreign suppliers, would be procured through local shopping
obtaining price quotations from not less than three suppliers, in contracts
not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, and not exceeding US$10.0 million
equivalent in aggregate (including duties and taxes).



- 22 -
Design. Supervision. Training. and Technical Assistance
3.21 Consulting services and technical assistance would be procured in
accordance with IDA Guidelines from firms and individuals with qualifications
acceptable to IDA and in accordance with agreed terms of reference;
consultants shortlists and terms of reference would be subject to prior review
by IDA. The cost of consulting services, design and supervision, planning
studies, management and financial strengthening, sanitation and hygiene
aducation, future investment preparation, training and management information
systems is estimated at US$35.0 equivalent million inclusive of contingencies
(excluding duties and taxes). This includes about 2600 local and 950
international man-months of direct technical assistance, and consultants
(locai or local with international collaboration) undertaking design and
supervision to be locally procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines. US$6.0
million equivalent would be provided for the full costs of project-related
incremental staff for in-house design and supervision. The majority of these
staff woul. be contracted for employment during the term of the project only.
Contract Rea'.ew
3.22 All agencies have agreed that bid documentation would be based on the
World Bank SAmple Bidding Documents; bid document quality would be improved
and standardized. To ensure compliance with Bank Procurement Guidelines, the
following documentation for goods and works would be subject to prior IDA
review: (a) model bid documents for goods and works; (b) the first set of
prequalification documents and evaluation report for works contracts; and (c)
bid documents prior to bid invitation, and bid evaluation reports prior to
contract award for: (i) all ICB goods and equipment contracts; and (ii) civil
works contracts of Rs 21 million and above (US$1.0 million equivalent). In
addition, contracts would be grouped to obtain maximum bidder interest, and to
enhance project management efficiency. Thus, some 85 contract-c. representing
about 60X of the total estimated contract value would be subject to the Bank's
prior review. Post review would be undertaken of the remainder.
D. Land Acquisition
3.23 Only small areas of land would be required in remote locations for the
construction of new treatment works, tubewells, reservoirs, storage tanks and
pump stations. Land for augmentation and rehabilitation schemes is already in
the ownership of the implementing agencies or the community. Most schemes
would be constructed on land provided by the communities. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, to acquire
the land required for the first two year's construction program would be
completed by end March 1992. Land acquisition would not present relocation
issues in view of the scattered nature of the habitation patterns in the
project areas. The cost of land to be provided or acquired has been estimated
at US$4.0 million equivalent.
E. Management. Operations & Maintenance, and Cost Recovery
3.24 The Governments' future RWSS sector policy would be that government
would provide a proportion of capital costs of communal facilities only as a
grant but the community would be responsible for management, O&M of all
schemes and the financing of O&M; technical advice and support would be
provided by the sector agencies. Government may assist in financing O&M only
in cases of extreme hardship or technical complexity. These policies would be
applied sector wide, irrespective of the source of financing, and would be

implemented through the project and the on-going ADP. An assurance was
obtained at negotiations that the Governments had already initiated such a
policy, satisfactory to IDA, which would be fully effective from July 1, 1991.
3.25 The proposed means of collection and payment of operations and
maintenance costs would vary by province, and satisfactory arrangements would
be as set out in detail in paras 4.03-4.09 and Annex 6.
F. Disbursements and Special Accounts
Disbursements
3.26 On the basis of the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 4 and para.
3.06), disbursements would continue for nine years. This is consistent with
the country social sector disbursement profile. The proceeds of the Credit
would be disbursed net of taxes and duties as indicated in Table 3.2 below.
3.27 It was agreed at negotiations that disbursements would be fully
documented except for those on civil works contracts less than Rs 6.3 million
(US$300,000) and locally procured items of equipment costing less than Rs 3.15
million (US$150,000). Such disbursements would be made against St. tements of
Expenditures (SOEs), the documentation for which would not be submitted to the
Bank but ret&ined and made available during the course of project supervision.
It is estimated that about US$23 million equivalent would be disbursed through
SOEs. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 7.

3.28 Retroactive financing of less than 10% of the Credit amount would be
provided to cover eligible foreign and local expenditures on civil works,
materials, incremental staff, vehicles and equipment, consultancy services and
training up to Rs 235 million (US$11.2 million equivalent), incurred after the
commencement of appraisal on December 1, 1989. Financing would be available
for AJK, Balochistan and Sindh of US$1.5m, US$4.Om and US$5.7m equivalent
(Rs32m, Rs84m and Rsl2Om) respectively.
Special Accounts
3.29 To assist timely project implementation, the Government would open and
maintain in US dollars Special Accounts with the National Bank of Pakistan for
the use of each executing agency. It was agreed at negotiations that the
opening and management of the Accounts would be done in accordance with
procedures and on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Most IDA financed
expenditures would be made through the Special Accounts. Initial deposits
would represent the IDA share of four months' expenditures. Replenishments
providing four months' expenditures would be made on the basis of withdrawal
statements.
3.30 Most procurement and payment would be through the district-level field
offices, generally by the Assistant Engineer or equivalent, using district
level procedures. Efficient project management would necessitate continuation
of this decentralized approach. Existing legal agreements between GOP and the
World Bank on the operation of Special Accounts on other projects prohibit the
establishment of sub-accounts, therefore the Special Account funds cannot be
made directly available for use by field offices. Confirmation was obtained
at negotiations that project expenditures incurred by district-level field
offices would be paid for with Government funds from project Personal Ledger
Accounts, for subsequent reimbursement from the Special Account.
G. Accounts and Audit
3.31 Each project entity would maintain accounts in a manner which would
permit reporting of all receipts and payments in respect of the project,
including SOEs and any special account. Confirmation was obtained at
negotiations that basic accounting procedures acceptable to IDA would be
established and become operational prior to any project expenditure being
incurred. The accounts would: (a) record the progressive and the annual cost
of the project by component; (b) account for all project funds (including
IDA's) by category of expenditure; (c) provide the basis for disbursements of
funds (including IDA's); and (d) illustrate the extent of compliance with loan
agreements. Each project entity would maintain accounts showing its overall
financial status and performance. Confirmation was obtained at negotiations
that the executing agencies would prepare and submit to IDA within nine months
after the close of each fiscal year fully audited accounts, undertaken by
auditors satisfactory to IDA, including an auditor's opinion and report for
the project, SOEs, Special Accounts and the agency covering all operations.
3.32 Accounting procedures would be strengthened as part of the project, in
particular development expenditure costing would be established in LGRDD (AJK)
and RDD (Balochistan and Sindh). In the Balochistan PHED, central accounting
would be improved and financial management strengthened in order to manage new
billing and collection responsibilities. Departmental Accounts Officers would
be appointed in LGRDD, AJK; PHED, Balochistan; and RDD Sindh. Project
accounting training would be provided project-wide at the initial stages of



- 25 -
implementation. All financial management improvements would be closely
coordinated with the Province/State Accountant General and the Director
General of Audit.
H. Monitoring. Supervision and Evaluation
3.33 GOP confirmed at negotiations that each government would prepare bi-
annual reports covering physical progress, costs, disbursements,
administrative and financial aspects, training, technical assistance and other
pertinent information, identifying constraints and proposed remedies and
submit these to IDA every six months. Monitoring indicators are shown in
Annex 12. Project supervision coefficients are expected to be double the
Regional average of 12 staff-weeks for water and sanitation projects. The
project is expected to require about 25 staff-weeks per year supervision, or
about 225 staff-weeks over the 9-year project implementation period. This
figure reflects that: (i) this is the first IDA-assisted RWSS operation in
Pakistan; (ii) the project would finance dispersed investments with consequent
logistL.;al challenges; (iii) the executing agencies would be dealing with IDA
procedures and community mobilization for the first time; and (iv) important
and politically sensitive sector policy changes would be implemented in
Balochistan and Sindh. Supervision effort would be concentrated more heavily
during the first four years, thereby necessitating a corresponding allocation
of resources.
3.34 GOP confirmed at negotiations that: (a) three years after credit
effectiveness, a mid-term project review, highlighting achievements and
shortcomings, would be carried out by IDA, the Federal Government and the
three provincial/state governments which would provide an opportunity for any
change of emphasis and policy improvements; and (b) a PCR of the scope and
detail as IDA shall reasonably request would be prepared by the respective
Provincial and State agencies, coordinated by MLGRD and furnished to the Bank
within six months of the Credit closing date.
IV. FINANCES
A. Past Financial Performance
4.01 Capital costs of RWSS schemes are presently wholly met by Government
through the state and provincial ADPV; there is no recovery of capital costs
from beneficiaries. The ADP is funded either by grant-in aid or by loans,
which are eventually repaid from general revenue. This policy, combined with
high design standards, the political imperative of starting additional new
schemes, and limited investment resources (compared to the scale of
unsatisfied demand) has resulted in a fragmented investment program with
chronic underfunding, leading to excessively long construction periods and
many incomplete schemes. Nevertheless, the sector has received a significant
and steady proportion of total State and Province Government investment (4X in
AJK, 12% in Balochistan and 10% in Sindh), reflecting the continued high
political priority for RWSS, compared to many other social sector investments.
1/    In AJK, for the past 15 years, RWSS schemes have been constructed by the
community with materials provided by the government; the community has
i r for management and O&M.



* 26 -
4.02 O&M costs are also paid by the provinces due to the lack of financial
and technical capacity of many of the local councils charged with this
responsibility. Councils are empowered to collect water tariffs, but
collection is ineffective (estimated to be less than 5X of operating costs in
Balochistan) and revenues are low; this is partly due to the lack of community
involvement in the investment process, resulting in the perception that
schemes belong to government and the expectation that government should
therefore operate and maintain them. The poor quality of service further
diminishes willingness to pay externally imposed water tariffs. Provincial
budgets are constrained and unable to finance the full burden of O&M costs, as
demonstrated by cuts in maintenance budgets, and outstanding water supply and
drainage PHED electricity arrears in Balochistan and Sindh.
B. New Cost Recovery Policy and Propgsals
4.03 The above unsat!.sfactory situation, the growing financial limitations on
prov.icial expenditures and the need for system sustaiaability have led to the
adoption of a community-based policy for financing and implementing RWSS
(para. 2.01). Communities, having been fully involved in the selection of the
quality of service to be provided, would agree from the outset to be
responsible for system management and O&M, and on this understanding the
government would provide infrastructure for a basic level of service. Under
the project, agreement would be reached that this policy, which is critical
for the sustained and enlarged provision of these key social services, would
be applied to all new sector investments. V The detailed modalities for
implementation of the policy would reflect (a) local experience of cost
recovery and the nature of existing cost recovery policies; (b) local socio-
cultural characteristics; (c) the proposed type of RWSS scheme and expected
O&M costs; and (d) affordability.
4.04 Azad Jammu & Kashmir. In AJK, a policy of direct community payment for
RWSS management and O&M is already in place and would be sustained through
project support for policy analysis and institutional strengthening. The
project would also finance technical assistance to strengthen tariff
collections in township water and sanitation schemes, reducing disparities
between urban and rural areas and hence reducing pressures to dilute
enforcement of the existing rural policy of direct community payment.
4.05 Balochistan. GOB would establish separate modalities for O&M financing,
one for villages and another for rural townships. These would be applied as
the uniform policy for Government schemes.
4.06 In villages, GOB would implement a policy of direct community payment
for O&M. This would apply from inception to all new schemes. The transfer to
the community of O&M responsibilities for existing schemes would be phased
over three years, at least 25X being transferred by 1 July 1992, 50X by 1 July
1993 and the balance by 1 July 1994. GOP confirmed at negotiations that
instructions have been given to the departments for the above, and that
arrangements have been made to pay all PHED's outstanding dues in respect of
electricity for water supply schemes, and to avoid public sector RWSS power
liabilities in future.
j/    Existing schemes would be transferred to the new arrangements according



- 27 -
4.07 In rural townships, where scheme size and technical complexity dictate
that PHED remains directly involved, O&M costs would be recovered through
monthly water tariffs. GOP confirmed at negotiations that arrangements have
been made to increase all Balochistan township scheme water tariffs to Rs 50
per month for standard house connections and Rs 250 per month for
commercial/industrial connections effective July 1, 199.0; and agreement given
to revise such tariffs at least triennially by an amount at least equivalent
to an annual real increase of 5X. PHED would be responsible for operation,
maintenance and collection of revenue for township schemes (including the few
schemes presently with local government). Collection of revenue would be
contracted to the private sector in about 25X of townships for a trial period,
and this would be extended to other townships if successful. Tariff revenues
would be used to finance PHED operation and maintenance costs. Financial
forecasts (Annex 3) show that revenues would exceed O&M expenditures by the
end of the project. To achieve this target the project would strengthen
financial management in PHED through technical assistance.
4.08 Sindh. In Sindh, O&M costs would be the community's responsibility in
all newly constructed, rehabilitated and augmented schemes from July 1, 1991.
On existing schemes, the Government confirmed at negotiations that it would
transfer responsibility for payment of water supply schemes' electricity bills
to 50X of communities by 1 July, 1991 and to 10OZ of communities by I July,
1992; and presented an acceptable timetable for the transfer to communities of
all other O&M costs for existing schemes.  GOP also confirmed at negotiations
that instructions have been given to line departments for the above, that all
PHED's outstanding dues in respect of electricity for water supply schemes had
been paid, and arrangements made to avoid public sector RWSS power liabilities
in future.
4.09 Full political endorsement of Sindh's cost recovery arrangements has
been giver.; GOS will support the direct community payments mechanism with
earmarked revenue from enhanced land and sugar-cane cesses and increased paddy
and cotton fees, to be levied and collected with the existing fees and cesses
and paid to eligible community organizations applying acceptable O&M
practices, thereby introducing a degree of income distribution in favor of the
landless beneficiaries. The cesses would be paid by landowners and farmers at
standard rates per acre and per kg of produce. GOP confirmed at negotiations
that arrangements have been made for levying, effective 29 November 1990, an
incremental annual cess on cultivated land of Rs. 1.50 per acre for non-
irrigated land, Rs. 3.00 per acre for land with non-perennial irrigation and
Rs. 6.40 per acre for land with perennial irrigation, and levying, the
following agriculture surcharges: (a) surcharge on the Cotton Fee of an
additional Rs 4.00 per 100 kgs effectiva 17 February 1.991; (b) surcharge on
the Paddy Development Fee of an additional Rs 0.50 per 100 kgs effective 25
February 1991; and (c) surcharge on the Sugar-Cane Development Cess of an
additional Rs 0.15 per 40 kgs effective 25 February 1991. The amounts raised
by these surcharges would be credited to a separate account, and applied to
RWSS O&M costs. The rate of fees and cesses, which would be revised at least
triennially, would be set to recover all estimated O&M power, maintenance and
repairs costs.
4.10 Tne yield from the cess would be applied as follows: (a) the component
of the agricultural cess would be for power consumption and be paid directly
to the power distribution authority as a contribution fixed in respect of each
scheme; (b) the balance of funds would flow to the community agency
responsible for O&M (Union Council/village organization) subject to adequate
financial controls and accounting arrangements being in place. Communities

4.11  Imnlementation of Financial Arrangements.  The policy leaves flexibility
to organize community management and O&M financing according to circumstances
such as the size and complexity of schemes, and institutional capacity.
During implementation, community organizations would receive technical
assistance to put in place appropriate management and financial arrangements,
including training in basic budgeting, accounting, and cash collection and
management. Department supervisors would monitor the financial management
performance of community-based schemes.
4.12 The policy would introduce an element of self-selection into the
criteria for allocating investment between communities. Eligible communities
which feel they do not want to, or cannot, meet these and other criteria in
the MOU (Annex 9) would not qualify for Government-sponsored schemes.
Communities prepared to provide land, or in the case of AJK labor, would
receive priority.
C. Provincal Investment Levels and Affordabilit!
4.13 To meet the planned coverage targets, an increase in capital investment
in the RWSS sector equivalent to 4 to 6 percentage points of total State/
Provincial Government FY90 capital investment would be required. The Bank
would finance between 25X and 50X of the ADP sectoral allocation. GOAJK, GOB
and GOS have each confirmed that this scale of sector investment reflects
their priorities, and that they would make the required reallocations of ADP.
Although the plan clearly represents a significant transfer of resources into
the sector, on the basis of this commitment the si;.e of the program is
considered to be financially realistic. This is shown in Table 4.1 below.

4.14  The largest relative increase in sector investment occurs in AJK, where
the average rate of investment during FY91-FY98 would more than double the
rate achieveL. between FY85-FY90. However, the capacity of LGRDD, the
responsible agency, is already high as a result of many years' experiencs of
community-based investments in RWSS and rural roads, and would be further
2/    Figures include an average 201 contribution by recipient communities.



- 29 -
strengthened through project-financed institutional deve-opment components to
achieve its planned target of a 50X increase in annual capital investment
(including the road program). In the case of both Balochistan and Sindh, the
rate of investment growth would be phased and be achieved with support from
project-financed institutional development. Strengthetned investment planning
policies would replace the present fragmented investment with budgets for
funding complete schemes, thereby further enhancing implementation capacity
and effectiveness.
4.15 The costs of total debt service arising from the RWSS sector investments
during the project period could be met by an average annual real increase in
Government revenue of 0.3X, 0.6X and under 0.2X for GOAJK, GOB and GOS
respectivelyl/. The debt service costs are considered affordable, especially
as Government finances would be strengthened by devolving the financial
responsibility for O&M to the community.
D. Beneficlary Affordability
4.16 Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Rural communities in AJK currently finance a
substantial proportion (over 50X in cases) of RWSS capital costs, and are
responsible for system management and all O&M costs. This reflects a high
demonstrated ability and willingness to pay for water. Two thirds of the
incremental coverage would be from piped gravity schemes which have
demonstrated acceptable construction costs and low O&M costs. It is concluded
that the proposed project would be affordable in AJK.
4.17 Balochistan. The initial monthly tariff for the rural townships would
be Rs 50 per house connection, with subsequent enhancement equivalent to 5X
annually in real terms. It is estimated that the proposed improvements would
be affordable to about 731 of households in FY91, assuming a projected 21 real
annual income growth, an income distribution similar to urban areas of the
province, and an affordability level for water of up to 31 of income (Annex
8). This is greater than the proportion of households projected to install
individual house connections (551), and is therefore considered affordable.
With the continued real growth in tariff levels che proportion would decline
to about 59% by FY98, remaining affordable.
4.18 Rural scheme technology is expected to be based primarily (921) on
tubewells with monthly O&K costs of about Rs 33 per household. Assuming a 21
real income growth, a water charge at Rs 33 would be affordable by over 901 of
the rural households at the 41 of income affordability level which is
reasonable to assume in the dry Balochistan conditions (Annex 8).
4.19 Sindh. The monthly household O&M costs of rural water supply schemes
are estimated to range from Rs 20 to Rs 40 for two thirds of the coverage
proposed in the project and under Rs 20 for the bulk of the remainder. For the
proposed drainage schemes, O&M costs are estimated to be about Rs 20 per month
per household. If the strategy of integrating water supply and drainage
investmentr is adopted, the total monthly household O&H cost would be Rs 40 to
Rs 60 for a large proportion of the investment. This would exceed the
affordability level of poorer rural households (only 451 of rural households
can afford Rs 60 per month at 3% of income-Annex 8).
j,/   The respective increases due to the IDA financing are 0.21, 0.11 and
utnder 0.1% respectively.



- 30 -
4.20 The direct community payment mechanism for meeting O&N costs would
therefore be supported by indirect cost recovery in the firm of enhanced land
and produce cesses and fees (para. 4.09). The required levels of fee and cess
enhancement would amount to less than 1X of estimated crop values and would be
paid by land-owning households which constitute the upper half of the rural
income distribution and which have an affordability level (at a maximum of 4X
of income) in excess of Rs 75 per month. With the assistance of this indirect
mechanism, communities would only pay for the marginal cost of providing an
above basic level of service; this is within their ability. The proposed
water supply and drainage improvements are thus considered affordable (Table
8.3, Annex 8).
4.21 Project wide. It is concluded that the proposed project would be
affordable to the majority of the beneficiary households; there would also be
opr-rtunities for the poorest households to contribute to the extent of their
ability through participating in the community-based organizations.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
5.01 RWSS service coverage is low and resources to enhance coverage are
limited. Therefore, the project has been designed to alleviate poverty and
improve the quality of rural life pai .icularly for women by undertaking
environmentally sound physical investments, enhancing rural productivity and
village-level resource mobilization in an economically sound and sustainable
policy framework.
A. Imnact on omen
5.02 Improved water supply access and quality and adequate sanitation would
have a positive and direct impact on the quality of life and productivity of
rural women. Health education and promotion programs implemented integrally
with the RWSS improvements would enable effective user participation and
service sustainability. Benefits include time and energy savings, and time
and productivity gains due to health improvements; these have a high value
irrespective of the pricing of the uses to which they are put by the
community. Complementary economic development benefits would be derived from
improved community organization, reduced disparity between rich and poor, and
the enhanced status of women and strengthened private sector capability.
5.03 Providing water for the family is generally the responsibility of women
in Pakistan. Water sources are usually far from dwellings and, in mountainous
terrain such as AJK at considerable heights. Women have to walk carrying
containers, in their hands or balanced on their heads, often carrying children
at the same time. Women report spending more than 5 person-hours a day
fetching water (see Annex 10). Bringing water nearer to the homes would save
women's energy, enable them to devote more time to child care, improve the
environment around the home, and enable their involvement in income generating
activities (particularly important for impoverished women). It would also
reduce the malnutrition and water-related disease morbidity of women and their
children, in particular young girls who suffer most in the social environment.
5.04 Increased water supply and easier access would allow women to provide a
cleaner environment in their homes, to wash their children more often, to wash
their own and their children's hands after defecation and to keep the food
areas clean. Greater availability of water would allow women to raise their
own level of personal hygiene and self esteem. Presently women keep water use
to a minimum, aiming to minimize the number of trips necessary to fetch it.
They often do this by using a minimum of water for themselves, avoiding
regular baths and not washing their clothes.



- 31 -
5.05 It is: believed that many miscarriages and premature births are due to
the high level of exhaustion common among women. Women's health is generally
poor, and deteriorates due to frequent pregnancies. Women are unable to rest
sufficiently (luring and after pregnaincy as they must continue to fetch water.
From an early age of four or five vdars, girls also assume the responsibility
for hauling water. They are thus perceived as being needed to help their
mother in her daily routitne of hauling water, and therefore do not attend
school. Improved water supply would enable more of young girls' time to be
spent in schooling and improve the educational status of rural women. In the
villages of Muzaffarabad, Mirpur and Kotli in AJK, which have adequate water
supplies, headmasters and teachers report that the enrollment of girls
increased after installation of water schemes as compared to before. Increases
of up to 75% enrolment were evident from student registers. Girls are no
longer required to assist in supplying water from distant sources nor to look
after younger children while their mothers are away, and thus have more time
and energy to devote to education.
5.06 The comfort, privacy, convenience, and security brought about by
improved sanitation and drainage would principally benefit women and older
girls. The long term health benefits of these improvements would also impact
principally on women and children. Benefits to women due to the hygiene
education and sanitation programmes include:
-     improved sanitation facilities offer more privacy to women
restricted by purdah;
-    reduction in restrictions on bowel/bladder movements by women;
-     integration of female employees (Traditional Birth Attendants
(TBAs), Community Health Workers, Health Educators) provides
valuable role models and raises women's aspirations;
-    existence of posts filled by women within government civil service
(Extension Workers etc.) provides employment opportunities; and
raising status and knowledge level of TBAs ensures that more women
will enter the profession and that they will provide improved
service.
5.07 There are many additional benefits to women which are difficult to
quantify, the most significant of which are the ability to provide better
motherhood due to having more energy and time, the raising of women's
confidence by involvement in community organization, and in the long term, the
reduction of number of pregnancies due to reduced child mortality. Project
preparation activities found that women lacked time and energy to relax, share
in planning the future of their children, meet with other women in the
extended family and the community and enjoy personal private time.
5.08 Improved water supplies may also yield disadvantages for women in
Pakistan. The trips to fetch water are some of the few opportunities
available to womer. to leave their homes and meet other women. Given the.
choice, women may choose a communal water supply system rather than in-1house
or yard connections so that this time spent with other women would not be
jeopardized. However, the basic service level of the project is communal
standposts; house connections would be installed only if selected by the
community and after payment by the individual householder, and women would
participate in this decision-making process.

B. Poverty Impact
5.09 The project would have a significant and positive impact on poverty
alleviation in the short and long term. Targeting of investments for maximum
impact on poverty relief has been a determining factor in the locational
choices of the project. First, the project is rural in character. Of the four
million poor households in Pakistan with calorie intake below minimum levels,
70% are in the rural areas. Second, the project area consists of the provinces
of Balochistan and Sindh and the state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. These are
relatively underdeveloped areas of Pakistan with higher incidence of rural
poverty, ranging from 25 to 30% of the population. Third, within these
regions, pricrity is attached to the provision of drinking water and
sanitation in the arid, barani (rainfed) and brackish zones, where
agricultural productivity is relatively low. Fourth, a high proportion of the
water supply and drainage schemes are proposed for small and medium sized
villages which generally have the lowest level of services (see Annex 11).
5.10 Design elements in the project incorporate additional poverty
considerations. Only a basic level of water supply service is being provided.
The objective is to spread the benefits of the investments more widely.
Simple, low cost technologies including installation of hand pumps and
rehabilitation of open, dug wells, which are affordable and manageable by the
poor are preferred wherever feasible. The extent of cost recovery and
financing mechanisms adopted are limited by affordability considerations; it
is proposed that only O&M costs would be recovered, and that generally the
capital cost for the basic level of service be provided by the gcvernment.
Further, in cases where O&E costs are high, as in the case of mechanized
schemes in Sindh, an indirect mechanism in the form of higher land taxation is
being resorted to. This will reduce the burden of financing the on-going
provision of the service on the rural poor, who are predominantly landless.
5.11 The project would thus have a significant impact on alleviation of rural
poverty in Pakistan. The resulting time savings accruing to women from
reduced cartage of water, especially in poor households, could permit greater
labor inputs in cottage industry or in agricultural activities during seasonal
peaks (planting and harvest times) for which there appears to be a strong
demand. This participation in market activities supported through the
project-financed flexible pilot income generating component could serve as a
significant cash income supplement.
5.12 Improvement in health status arising in particular from the reduction in
intestinal disease morbidity, would help in breaking the vicious cycle of
disease and malnutrition experienced by the poor, lessening the trauma and
loss of high infant mortality prevalent in rural areas, and contribute to
higher labor productivity in agriculture. In addition, significant employment
would be generated by the project both at the construction and operation
stages. This could benefit poorer households, in particular, whose
involvement in the construction and services sectors of the rural economy has
traditionally been greater. These households also depend on livestock for
power, transport and food.  A water supply project is therefore particularly
valuable because it caters for both human and animal consumption.
5.13 RWSS improvements reduce the disparity in access to services between
rich and poor. In many villages, water of the wealthy is collected by
servants, purchased from vendors or pumped from a private well. Communal
wells are usually located close to the influential households or on their
property. By having handpumps or standposts distributed throughout the
C  iarity is raduced.  Landlords with open wells on their land



- 33 -
are able to exert control over the landless. Although ostensibly "permitting"
all villagers equal access to the well, control is very commonly exerted when
the landless are in conflict with the landlord. A water distribution system
or several new wells would reduce this feudal type of control and enhance the
beneficiaries' self-esteem.
C. Environmental Impac!;
5.14 The project would contribute significantly to improving the environment,
and is rated under category 'B' of the Bank's Environmental Assessment
Operational Guidelines.
5.15 Following the approval of the Pakistan Environmental Protection
Ordinance in 1983, GOP established the Environmental and Urban Affairs
Division in the Ministry of Housing and Works. Similar provincial agencies
have been established in Punjab and Sindh, and steps are currently being taken
to establish one in Balochistan. Despite this progress, actions need to be
initiated to address the prevailing environmental problems. Therefore, under
the RWSS Project, GOP would, through the PIRC and the provincial governments,
monitor ongoing environmental impact. During implementation, practices
consistent with World Bank guidelines would be followed.
5.16 The project components include institutional strengthening, new and
rehabilitated water supp:y and drainage schemes in rural communities,
sanitation and hygiene education and the provision of equipment and
institutional facilities to enable the respective sector agencies to carry out
their mandates more effectively. Th.: project components would generally
contribute a substantial positive environmental impact.
5.17  The construction to be financed under the project would not employ any
processes, materials or procedures which would be damaging to the environment.
The main materials to be incorporated into the works would be concrete (cement
manufactured in Pakistan, local river sand and stone) cast iron, and
galvanized mild steel piping. The volume of materials required would be small,
and their production would not have a significant indirect negative
environmental impact. No toxic or hazardous materials would be used or
involved, and there would be no significant residuals. Construction work
would not entail major earthworks nor cause risk or damage to ecological,
archeological or natural resource assets. This is of particular relevance in
the Sindh desert areas and the Himalayan regions of AJK. Site restoration
would principally require limited excavation reinstatement. The water supply
catchments and aquifers would be protected wherever possible as part of the
project.
5.18 Operations and maintenance would not cause environmental damage. The
principal inputs would be electricity for pumping (low horsepower
requirements) and small quantities of chlorine gas for water disinfection.
Training would be given in the sale and handling of chlorine gas. Treatment
processes would only yield small quantities of inert silt.
5.19 The water supply component would contribute to reducing contamination of
ground water by improved handpump, tubewell and water seal designs. Surface
and ground water resources would be exploited through the project. The
volumes abstracted would be very small particularly when compared to volumes
used for agricultural purposes. There would be a limited risk to water
resource integrity. This would be addressed in AJK (possible damage to spring
-_                      -                     I     resource data



- 34 -
management, and in the arid areas of Balochistan and Sindh by correct pump
sizinig and hydro-geological investigations. In addition in the Barrage areas
of the Sindh, the risk of saline intrusion in sweet aquifers would be reduced
by a program of small-scale scavenger well construction. Covering of open
wells, supporting handpump improvements, incorporating technically designed
drainage aprons at all water drawing points,and related user education
programs on water collection, storage and disposal guidelines would have a
positive environmental impact.
5.20 Drainage facilities will have a positive environmental impact by
providing proper disposal of sullage water and thereby reducing the incidence
of insect borne disease and the likelihood of groundwater contamination.
Environmental problems associated with flash flooding would be addressed
through drainage fecilities in the Balochistan townships component. Random
disposal of faecal material and other solid wastes would also be controlled.
The hygiene education and latrine component would have positive environmental
impact by reducing the health hazard of indiscriminate defecation in open
areas and within domestic households. The risk of local contamination of
groundwater through concentrated underground disposal of excreta in latrine
pits, particularly in Sindh, would be addressed by careful citing of latrines
and new water supplies.
D. Economic Rate of Return
5.21 Economic analysis has been undertaken for components of the project with
quantifiable benefits. These primarily include the water supply and
institutional strengthening components, representing about 85X of project
costs.
5.22 The quantifiable benefits of improved water supplies are derived
primarily from the net time savings in the daily fetching of water by
beneficiaries. Data from field surveys show that conservatively about two
hours are saved per day in Balochistan, over three hours in Sindh, and about
five hours in the hilly areas of AJK on average for a beneficiary household.
Since these benefits accrue primarily to women, they have been valued in terms
of the wage rate that women could command in the labor market in agriculture
or cottage industry activities, and by estimating the likely proportion of the
time saved which would be devoted to such activities (less than 30X of time
savings valued at the market wage rate and the remainder at one third this
rate). Conservative estimates of the value of time range from Rsl.50 to
Rsl.75 per hour.
5.23 Benefits arising from institutional strengthening of the executing
agenUies of the project include a faster rate of implementation, greater cost
effectiveness and increased sustainability of both existing and new schemes
through better design, management and supervision. Some rural employment
generation may also accrue from private sedtor construction of water supply
and sanitation facilities.
5.24 Capital and operating costs of the project have been converted into
economic costs by excluding indirect taxes and import duties on materials and
equipment, by valuing land for the schemes as having zero opportunity cost and
by taking a shadow wage rate for unskilled labor at 601 of the market payments
to allow for unemployment in the project areas. It is assumed that no
significant distortions exist in the wage rates for skilled labor and in the
rate of foreign exchange for the Pakistani currency. Physical contingencies
have been included while price contingencies. have been excluded from the



- 35 -
5.25 The overall IERR of the components with quantifiable benefits is 14X.
It is 171 in Sindh, 131 in Balochistan and 11 in AJK (see Annex 10). This is
high not only in relation to other projects in the sector; it also compares
favorably with returns from other investments i. rural social and physical
infrastructure. If account is taken of the non-quantifiable benefits, it
would further strengthen the justification for the project. In particular,
sizeable benefits would arise from improvements in the health status of adults
and children through integration of the water supply component with
complementary investments in drainage, hygiene education and sanitation.
5.26 The economic rate of return from the project is not very sensitive to
changes in the benefits or costs. A 201 increase in costs reduces the overall
IERR from 141 to 101, while a 201 fall in the expected benefits decreases the
IERR to about 91. The probability of either a cost increase or reduced
benefits on this scale is deemed to be low because of the simple nature of the
physical investments and the extensive community involvement in the Project.
5.27 RWSS improvements would have major impact on communities with a marginal
existence. The lack of a reliable potable water supply is commonly the
principal reason for relocation of a community. A reliable supply would
enable such marginal communities to exist and allow the exploitation of rain-
fed agricultural land which would otherwise have fallen into disuse. It is in
these areas (the project areas in Balochistan and the Arid Zone in the Sindh)
that benefits accruing to women and the poor, and consequently their families,
are at their maximum.
E. Risks
5.28 The technical aspects of the project are straightforward and do not
present significant risk. The main project risks are: (a) :hat the
requirement for communities to accept responsibility for and finance the O&M
of schemes may be slow to materialize, although such a policy is well
established and effective in AJK; (b) the limited experience of Government
line agencies in working directly with villagers and the need for continual
community orientation; (c) the possible slow release of funds by the
governments due to the dispersed nature of tne investments; (d) the shortage
of qualified government staff to undertake work on the individual projects to
implement an expanded RWSS program; and (e) the limited ability of the
respective agencies to achieve cost res.overy targets. In addition, the
project would be the Bank Group's first lending operation with the concerned
agencies, implying possible start-up delays.
5.29 The project has been designed to address these risks by providing the
following measures and resources: (a) emphasis on management, technical
support and training for all implementing agencies; (b) training for
politicians, community leaders and scheme personnel; (c) community relations
cells within the executing agencies; (d) hygiene educatLon programs; (e)
advance consultancy services for priority designs, materials specifications
and documentation to maintain project momentum; (f) assistance to agencies in
procurement procedures; (g) financial management support; and (h) use of
community agreements, which are to be in place before implementing schemes.
5.30 Provision of and improvements to RWSS is one of GOP's main priorities.
During project preparation, the respective Chief Ministers were kept fully
briefed. They gave IDA assurances of their full support, and confirmed they
would ensure the establishment of sound modalities for community participation



- 36 -
and cost recovery. Land cess enhancement in Sindh presents a challenge; the
political risk of levying increased water tariffs in Balochistan is not
considered to be as high.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01 During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOP, and the
Governments of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh that:
(a)   AJK would maintain a policy, and Sindh and Balochistan would each,

passing on of funds would be acceptable to IDA, and counterpart
funds would be available (paras. 2.12 and 3.30);
(f)   land acquisition procedures are underway to meet the first two
years' requirements under the project (para. 3.23); and
(g)   standard requirements would be met for:  project executing
agencies to remain adequately staffed throughout project

- 37 -
6.02 During negotiations, it was confirmed with GOP, and the Governments of
Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh that, pursuant to the policy
referred to in para. 6.01 (a) above:
(a)   instructions have been given to line departments that (except in
the case of Balochistan rural township schemes) responsibilities
for O&M would be transferred to, or remain with, scheme
beneficiaries, according to a timetable set out in the OAP (paras.
4.04, 4.06, 4.08 and Annex 6);
(b)   arrangements have been made: (i) to pay all PHED's outstanding
dues in respect of electricity for water supply schemes
(Balochistan and Sindh); and (ii) to avoid public sector RWSS
power liabilities in future (paras. 4.06, 4.08 and Annex 6);
(c)   for the Province of Balochistan, arrangements have been made to
increase all rural township water tariffs to Rs. 50 per month for
standard house connections and Rs. 250 per month for
commercial/industrial connections effective July 1, 1990; and to
revise such tariffs at least triennially by an amount equivalent
to at least an annual real increase of 5X. (para. 4.07); and
(d)   for the Province of Sindh, arrangements have been made to levy an
incremental annual cess on cultivated land of Rs. 1.50 per acre
for non-irrigated land, Rs. 3.00 per acre for land with non-
perennial irrigation and Rs. 6.40 for land with perennial
irrigation, effective 29 November, 1990 and to increase from late
February, 1991 the sugar-cane cess and paddy and cotton fees; and

were: (i) approval by ECNEC of the project PC-l documents; and (ii)
appointment, subject to credit effectiveness, of the main technical assistance
Advisory Consultants.
6.04 On the basis of the project justification, and having obtained the above
confirmations from and reached the above agreements with GOP, GOAJK, GOB and
GOS, the proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
SDR 96.4 million (US$136.7 million equivalent) on standard terms with 35 years
maturity. The borrower would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

PAKISTAN
RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Detailed Proiect DescriRtion
1.       Introduction.  The project components comprising water supply,
drainage, sanitation and hygiene education, institutional strengthening and
training, are described below. Costs shown exclude design and supervision
costs, and physical and price contingencies, unless indicated.
A. Azad Jammu and Kashmir
2.       Background.   The 1988 population of the semi-autonomous State of
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) was estimated at 2.1 million (90 rural), with
an annual growth rate of 2.1X. AJK is highly mountainous, with an area of
about 13,300 square kilometers, comprising 5,232 settlements. The northern
parts of AJK are generally at an elevation of over 2000 meters and comprise
steep and in parts wooded mountain terrain with an average annual rainfall of
1500 mm. The area geology is mainly extensively folded and faulted sandstones,
limestones shales and slates; hence it is rich in perennial springs used
extensively for gravity-fed domestic water supplies. In the south the terrain
is flatter, falling to an elevation of 300 meters and the geology also
includes alluviums. Arnual rainfall averages about 1450mm and domestic water
supplies are obtained from reliable aquifers between 2 to 20 meters deep using
mechanized tube wells and hand pumps.
3.       The Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD) is
responsible for the development, promotion and support of rural water supply
and sanitation (RWSS) in AJK. It has over the past 15 years successfully
promoted a community-based approach to RWSS, enabling communities to adopt a
variety of technologies to provide a basic level of service for animal and
household consumption. LGRDD supplies the pipe materials and limited technical
guidance; implementation, operations and maintenance is the responsibility of
the community. The project would build on and strengthen this proven approach.
4.       In LGRDD, physical plant, management systems and staff levels have
suffered from shortages of funding. In particular management and technical
skills and practices have been unable to grow to meet service obligations.
The project would finance an investment package designed integrally with the
physical investment program to address these deficiencies.
5.       The rural sanitation coverage in AJK is estimated at less than 21.
The present program supported by UNICEF is to provide demonstration latrines
in key rural institutions at the markaz headquarters, schools and health
units. One markaz covering about 32 villages is selected every two years.
Training to facilitate correct latrine use and construction is given through

hygiene promoters during the installation of the demonstration latrines.
Householders are given incentives to purchase latrine pans (not locally
manufactured in AJK) as a precondition for application for water supply
schemes. This program has not been particularly successful because: (i)
householder's priority need is for a water supply, thus latrines are often not
installed; and (ii) there have been long delays in the delivery of latrine
pipes and pans by LGRDD. Nevertheless, the role of hygiene promoters in the
UNICEF program during the past four years provides a basis for launching a
larger state-wide sanitation program.
6.       The project would be implemented within the ongoing Local Government
and Rural Development Department (LGRDD) Annual Development Program (ADP),
increasing the overall statewide water supply coverage as a result of the IDA
assistance and the other ADP investments, from the present 42X to an estimated
77% coverage by the project completion in 1998.
7.       Water Supply - LGRDD (Cost US$28.7 million equivalent).  The
component would build, rehabilitate and augment water supply schemes for very               e
small (pop 250), small (pop 500), medium (pop 1000), and large (pop 2500)
villages in the five districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).  For new                    i
schemes various technologies would be employed: (i) gravity from springs for
very small, small and medium villages; (ii) pumping from spring sources for
small and medium villages; (iii) pumping from dug wells for small, medium and
large villages; and (iv) pumping from boreholes for small, medium and large
villages. Some schemes would involve handpumps and dug wells without
pumping.
8.       A total of about 1600 schemes would be included in the five districts
of AJK: Muzaffarabad (about 700); Bagh (about 260); Poonch (about 190); Kotli
(about 320); and Mirpur (about 130); to serve about 630,000 people living in
some 500 villages (there could be more than one scheme serving a village).
The proposed level of service would provide a water supply of 10 gpcd (45 lcd)
delivered through public standposts. Where a community wishes to have
provision for house connections, designs would be based on 20 gpcd (90 lcd)
but the recipients of this higher level of service would be required to fund
the incremental cost of the system. Schemes would be designed for a 10 year
planning horizon based on the existing population and allowing for a 3% per
annum growth over the 10 year period. Of the present 1500 villages on the
revenue record some 1000 will benefit from the RWSS investments by the
completion of the project.
9.       Sanitation and Hygiene Education-DOH (Cost US$0.32 million
equivalent). The health education component would focus primarily on
strengthening the Health Education Unit within the Department of Health. This
unit would provide support to project activities including: (i) ascertaining
hygiene beliefs and behavior; (ii) reviewing hygiene-education materials;
(iii) implementing health education workshops; (iv) field testing of messages;
(v) production of training materials; (vi) support for inclusion of hygiene
education in primary school curriculum; and (vii) training of trainers to
deliver hygiene education messages to the rural communities. Some 630,000
people would benefit from this component.

ANNEX 
Page 3 of 13
10.      Latrine Demonstration Program - LGRDD (Cost US$0.23 million
equivalent). The latrine program would be implemented at those locations
benefitting from improved water supplies and health education; the component
would provide for the construction of demonstration pour flush double pit
latrines. Two demonstration latrines per village and one unit at each school
would be constructed in the project communities. The domestic latrines would
be for private usage and ownership but for public demonstration. About 3200
demonstration latrines would be constructed, half with kacha superstructures,
the remainder without, enabling recipient families to build the superstructure
at their own preference and cosr.
11.      Latrine Incentive Program - L&RDD (Cost USSO.39 million).   Essential
latrine materials (pour flush pan, trap, connecting pipework and 1 No. bag of
cement) would be provided for about 10X of the population benefitting from
improved water supplies (estimated at between 600,000 and 700,000) as an
incentive for beneficiaries to construct and use household latrines. Materials
would be provided on a grant basis for about 9,700 units.
12.      Technical Assistance Support and SRecialist Equigment -- LGRDD (Cost
US$6.81 million equivalent).   The component would comprise institutional
strengthening, training and the provision of specialist equipment as follows:
(a)   Consultancy services to assist LGRDD through: (i) a technical
advisory unit; (ii) implementation of a water resources study;
(iii) training of LGRDD staff, village members and local
artisans; (iv) a review of LGRDD accounting practices and PHEC
0&M cost recovery; (v) establishment of a monitoring and
evaluation unit; (vi) technical assistance to the Health
Education Unit; and      (vii) private sector development in
hygiene education, training of masons and drillers;
(b)   The provision of LGRDD incremental staff totalling about 7,900
man months including Health Educators; Accounts Officer;
Extension Workers; Draftsmen; Drivers; Attendants and District
Extension Officers would be supported under the project;
(c)   Consultancy services to assist LGRDD to (i) undertake detailed
design and procurement; and (ii) establish a water resources
study program throughout AJK; and
(d)   Consultancy services to LGRDD for provision of mapping;
feasibility and design studies and management of pilot
projects; studies and preparation activities for future project
preparation.
13.      Institutional DeveloRment - LGRDD (US$0.16 million equivalent).  This
component would provide essential office accommodation, furnishings and
facilities at about 35 central, markaz and district level locations.

ANN1EI
Page 4 of 13
14.      Eguigment. Spares and Vehicles - LGRDD (US$0.71 million equivalent).
Operational vehicles, materials and various equipment items would be provided
for LGRDD. This equipment would, in conjunction with the technical assistance
and training support provided elsewhere under the project, improve the
operational and management efficiency of the LGRDD.
B. Balochistan
15.      Background.  Balochistan is an arid region covering about 347,000
square kilometers with an estimated population around 5.5 million of which
about 4.5 million (82X) live in rural communities. With respect to rural
water supplies, Balochistan faces problems due to: &esert-like climate; low
income and poor infrastructure; small dispersed population; and scarce water
resources. Over recent years the Government of Balochistan (GOB) has placed
increasing emphasis on the provision of water supplies to rural areas and over
400 schemes have been completed by the Public Health Engineering Department
(PHED) and many other smaller schemes by the private sector and with bilateral
and unilateral support. UNICEF, KFW and others have been actively supporting
various programs throughout the province.  The estimated rural water supply
coverage is presently around 30X. This figures is targeted to reach about 75X
by year 1998.
16.      No reliable data exists for the percentage of rural population using .
latrines. Recent field surveys indicate that only about 2-3X of the rural
population have access to satisfactory means of excreta disposal. Pour flush
latrines have recently been introduced by foreign donor assisted projects. As
these facilities require water for flushing, they have generally been
installed in villages with water services and sometimes in schools.
17.      The following water supply, drainage, sanitation and hygiene
education, technical assistance and training components would be implemented
in Balochistan.
18.      New Water SunDlY Schemes - PHED (Cost US$13.43 million equivalent)
The component would provide water supply schemes for about six townships
including Hub; Ziarat; Mastung; Kuchlak; Nok Kundi; and Kharan. Populations
in these townships range between 5,000 at Ziarat and 44,000 at Mastung with a
total of some 140,000 persons expected to benefit from the improved water
services proposed in this component. Complete schemes including source works
(tubewells or canal intakes), treatment, transmission, storage and
reticulation systems would be provided for each township except Nok Kundi
where project involvement would be limited to the reticulation system since
GOB is implementing source and transmission works under a separate program.
Detailed engineering designs have been completed for the water supply schemes
at Kuchlak and Ziarat and preliminary design studies have been done for Hub,
Mastung, Nok Kundi and Kharan. Detail designs and tender documents for Hub
and Mastung schemes are being executed by local consultants already appointed
under the initial consultancy service agreement. rTe designs incorporate two
planning horizons; Phase I - year 2000; and Phase II - year 2015. Phase I
assumes a 50/50 ratio of house connections (HC)/standpost (SP) and Phase II a



- 42 -
Page 5 of 13
90/10 ratio of HC/SP. Water demands for Phase I are 135 lcd for HC's and 75
lcd for SP's including non-domestic demand and unaccounted for water. Phase
II water demands are 187.5 lcd for HC's and 75 led for SP's including non-
domestic demand and unaccounted for water. Phase I componints would be
implemented under this project, but would also include system components
required for Phase II when justified on the basis of cost efficiency and other
design considerations.
19.      Rehabilitation of Rural Water SuDDYl Schemes - PHED (US$2.86 million
equivalent). The component would provide for rehabilitation and augmentation
of about 70 rural water supplies mainly in Quetta, Kalat, Zhob, Sibi,
Nasirabad and Mekran Districts, implomented during FY92-98 at about 8-10
schemes per year. Rehabilitation would primarily involve the development of
new water sources to replace failed tubewells and replacement of mechanical
and electrical components. Augmentation would address the storage facilities
and improve the reticulation system for the present and future population
within a 10 year population growth period. The adopted technologies would
reflect the strengthening of PHED resulting from the sustained technical
assistance support during the first two years of the project. The component
would provide bulk water supply to meet population growth and improve service
levels and water quality for about 350,000 people.
20.      New Drainage Schemes - PHED (US$ .41 million equivalent).  The
component would provide for drainage sch-aes at about seven rural townships
(Hub, Ziarat, Mastung, Kuchlak, Nok Kur L, Kharan and Gwadar). The proposed
drainage schemes would be implemented at townships benefitting from improved
water supply services under this project and other GOB programs (in the case
of Gwadar); design would be based on the sullage water disposal requirement
plus stormwater run-off. Where appropriate the works will be phased,
initially comprising the main drains requlred to carry the year 2015 sullage
flow and stormwater component and will normally be restricted to the center of
the townships. Except for certain main collectors, piped systems are not
proposed and the technology choice will be generally restricted to open drains
(covered where required), paved areas around open drains in heavily trafficked
areas and free discharges to natural drainage channels. The component would
reduce the disruption caused by stormwater flow and provide increased health
benefits for 'che township communities by disposal of sullage water flows.
Some 180,000 people would benefit from the improved drainage facilities.
Preliminary designs have been completed and detailed engineering and bid
documents would be prepared progressively. The first two schemes are being
detailed under the initial consultancy which would be financed retroactively.
21.      Latrine Demonstration Program -- LGRDD. The latrine program would be
implemented in the rural townships, constructing 80 demonstration pour flush
double pit latrines (ten per township). The latrines would be for private
usage and ownership but for public demonstration. About 501 would be
constructed with kacha superstructures, the remainder without, enabling
recipient families to build the superstructure at their own preference and
cost.

22.      Latrine Incentive PrograM - LGRDD.   Essential latrine materials
(pour flush pan, trap, connecting pipework and 1 No. bag of cement) would be
provided for about 15X of the population benefitting from improved water
supplies and drainage (estimated at between 400,000 and 500,000) as an
incentive for beneficiaries to construct and use household latrines. Materials
would be provided on a grant basis for about 11,200 units.
23.      Institutional Development - PHED (US$3.26 million equivalent).  This
component would provide essential office accommodation, furnishings and
laboratory facilities at about 35 PHED central, circle, district level and
zonal locations.
24.      Eauigment. Spares and VeiLcles - PEED (US$9.41 million equivalent).
Drilling equipment, spare parts for existing drilling rigs, mobile workshops,
specialized and operational vehicles, materials and various equipment items
including borehole logging equipment would be provided for PHED. This
equipment would, in conjunction with the technical assistance and training
support provided elsewhere under the project, improve the operational and
management efficiency of the PHED. Equipment would be provided for
construction of about 160 tubewells in rural townships and villages.
25.      Vehicles and Equigment - LGRDD (US$0.84 million equivalent). The
LGRDD would receive support for (i) institutional strengthening through the
provision of vehicles for operational use; and (ii) purchase of latrine
materials in conjunction with the sanitation and hygiene education component
of the project which would be executed by LGRDD.
26.      Technical Assistance. Specialized Eauigment and Trasning   PHED
(US$7.75 million equivalent) and LGRDD (US$2.04 million equivalent).  In PHiD
and LGRDD the physical plant and many aspects of management systems have
suffered from shortages of funding. In particular, financial allocations for
operations and maintenance have not kept pace with requirements over the years
and many of the assets are badly deteriorated. Management and technical
skills, and commercial practices have been unable to grow to meet service
obligations. The project would finance an investment package designed
integrally with the above capital works and equipment program focusing on
institutional strengthening and the provision of specialized equipment. The
institutional strengthening would comprise:
(a)   consultancy services to PHED  (Initial Design Consultancy)
preparing detailed designs, cost estimates and procurement
documents for equipment, civil works and related activities
for: (i) ICB for priority procurement packages; (ii) local
shopping for motor vehicles; (iii) construction of Ziarat
Drainage, and Mastung Water Supply and Drainage; (iv) central
office construction and rehabilitation; and (v) consultancy to
develop privatization of water tariff collection. This
consultancy commenced February, 1990 and would be eligible for
retroactive financing;

(b)   consultancy services to PHED preparing detailed designs, cost
estimates, bid documents and supervision of the new rural
township water supply and drainage schemes for Hub, Kuchlak,
Gwadar, Mastung, Kharan and Nok Kundi (excluding (a) above);
(c)   consultancy Services to PHED providing Technical Assistance,
Training and Project Management for the: (i) preparation of
detailed designs, cost estimates and procurement documents for
rehabilitation of rural water supply schemes; (ii) preparation
of ICB, LCB and local shopping procurement documents for
equipment for tubewells, drilling rig and spares, mobile
workshops and monitoring and evaluation equipment; (iii)
preparation of detailed designs, cost estimates and tender
documents for PHED offices; and (iv) improvement of PHED
capabilities in RWSS coverage monitoring, collection and
management of sector data, and coordination of government and
non-government sector activities;
(d)   consultancy services to Planning & Development Department (P&D)
for the preparation of District Development Plans through: (i)
improving the capabilities to plan future development and
monitor the status of existing water supply and sanitation
projects; (ii) improving the quality of data collected by
sector agencies and centralizing the assembly and analysis of
data; and (iii) the preparation of 5 district development plans
for the RWSS sector;
(e)   consultancy services to LGRDD for sanitation through: (i) the
provision of sanitation, sociology, health education and
training specialists; an-I (ii) the construction of
demonstration latrines, establishment of sanitation reference
centers, training of artisans and the provision of key latrine
construction materials;
(f)   consultancy services to PHED for provision of mapping;
feasibility and design studies and management of pilot
projects; studies and activities for future project
preparatior.; and
(g)   Incremental Staff for PHED and LGRDD  and related costs would
be financed under the project.
27.      Training and Human Resource Develogment.  The above technical
assistance would strengthen PHED. Training programs would be developed to
support the restructuring including; (i) forming a Design and Planning Branch;
(ii) expanding the Electrical and Mechanical Division; (iii) increasing design
capability; (iv) providing operator training for maintenance; and (v)
improving the efficiency and capability of the .oundwater drilling teams.
About 40 officers and 330 other grades of staff would be recruited by PHED
during the project period in order to address the present institutional
deficiencies (see Figure A 3.1). The proposed organization structure of PHED
is shown at Figure A3.1. Training would comprise the following:



- 45 -
Page 8 of 13
(a)   Electrical and Mechanical Professional Staff training including
advanced training for mechanical engineers, hydrogeologists,
geologists and supervisors. Foreign fellowships are proposed
for hydrogeologists. Courses would focus on tubewell design;
investigation and development; monitoring and evaluation, and
rehabilitation;
(b)   Drilling Crews would receive on-the-job training to improve
quality, increase efficiency and ensure proper use of new
equipment;
(c)   Technical Design Staff training would focus on cost effective
water supply schemes, new technologies (low cost options), and
sanitation/drainage, including training in the analysis of
alternative distribution networks and service standards. Also,
PHED requires more expertise for water treatment facilities for
surface water supplies. This would be important for increasing
rural coverage in Kachhi and Nasirabad areas.
(d)   Planning and Community Relations Staff - The newly created
Planning Branch would administer scheme investigation,
selection, processing and monitoring. Technical scrutiny of
schemes would be provided by the Technical Design branch. The
Planning branch would have Community Relations Officers to
prepare feasibility reports on nei: schemes, liaise with
Community officials, and negotiate with the Communities with
regard to operating and maintenance responsibilities of
schemes. This would be an integral component of cost recovery
measures (eg. tariffs for township house connections or direct
community operation/financing of schemes). On-the-job training
would enable the viability of new procedures to be assessed and
modified where necessary;
(e)   Operator Training would be provided through a "train the
trainer" program for new staff (mechanical and electrical sub-
engineers) who would then train new operators and upgrade
skills of existing operators. Sub Divisional Officers(SDOs)
and sub-engineers would be trained how to monitor water supply
systems; to collect data on the operating performance of
schemes at regular intervals; to inspect schemes for
preventative maintenance and to identify problems before they
result in major breakdowns;
(f)   Laboratory Staff would receive "On-the-job" training to learn
specific requirements for water quality testing. This training
would be coordinated with water sample procedures and
collection for PHED field staff;

Page 9 of 13
(g)   Administrative Staff - PHED's administrative staffing
capabilities are weak and not well suited for revenue
collection and cost recovery measures. The proposed training
programme would focus on the accounts, auditing and general
administration duties; and
(h)   Human Resource Development  - Long term training requirements
are important and therefore providing in-house training
capabilities to PHED is essential. Human resource capabilities
would be assessed to determine requirements and training
programs developed.
C. Sindh
28.      Background.  Sindh covers an area of about 141,000 square kilometers
(17.7X of Pakistan) and has an estimated population of 24.4 millionl1. Sindh
is characterized by a large number of relatively small settlements with some
70X of the rural population living in settlements of less than 500
inhabitants.
29.      The Government of Sindh (GOS) has been undertaking an ambitious
program to improve water supplies, sanitation and drainage throughout the
province with a targeted water supply coverage of 75X by the end of the
Seventh Five Year Plan (1993). Although this target is unlikely to be
achieved due to economic difficulties, substantial progress is being achieved
with the present water supply coverage estimated around 47X.
30.      Arising from the improved water services, there is a growing need in
rural communities for the provision of drainage facilities for the safe
removal of sullage water. This is most urgent in villages which have piped
supplies with house connections. In order to address this issue, GOS is
undertaking a program of drainage schemes with some 120 schemes completed,
although a number of such schemes are reportedly in need of rehabilitation. A
further 240 drainage schemes are under construction. Very few households in
rural Sindh have access to satisfactory facilities for the disposal of human
waste. About 4X of households are reported to have latrines. The majority of
these are pit latrines, but a number of pour flush latrines are reported in
use. There is no province-wide hygiene education program.
31.      New  sechanized Water Supply Schemes - PHED (US$29.61 million
equivalent). The component would provide for about 80 new large village
(design population 2500) and about 220 new medium village (design population
1000) water supply schemes. Both medium and large village schemes would be
constructed in the districts of: Sukkar, Tharparker, Sanghar, Dadu, Larkana,
Khairpur, Jacobabad, Hyderabad, Karachi, and Thatta. All the schemes would be
mechanized, sourced either from canals or tubewells with single or double
pumping as necessary.  Supply to consumers would be based on community tanks
with consumers financing the incremental cost of house connections if they
desire a higher level of service. The component would provide a water supply
to meet present and future growth thus benefitting about 420,000 rural people.

32.      Now Non-Mechgnized Water Supply-Schemes   RDD (US$2.95 million
equivalent). The component would provide for about 1800 non-mechanized, non-
piped schemes focused on the brackish water zones of Sukkur and Larkana
districts. The source will be either thin sweet water lenses associated with
the irrigation canals which can be extracted using shallow hand pumps or hand
dug wells, or water abstracted from irrigation canals and passed through a
filtration system. Scavenger hand pumps would be used where appropriate. The
component would provide a source of safe drinking water to many small
communities not presently covered.
33.      New Non-Mechanized Water Supplv Sghemes - PHED (US$1.93 million
equivalent). The component would provide for about 730 non-mechanized, non-
piped water supply schemes for small villages in the Arid Zones including 450
in the Sandy Desert and 280 in the Hilly Desert. The work includes
rehabilitation and construction of about 100 check dams. The component would
focus on hand dug wells, and check dam construction. The component would
provide a source of safe drinking water to small communities not presently
served and would be executed in close coordination with the Sindh Arid Zone
Development Authority (SAZDA).
34.      Rehabilitation of Water Supply and Drainage Schemes - PHED (US$5.59
million equivalent). The piped water supply component would provide for the
rehabilitation of about 480 water supply schemes to large, medium and small
villages. Minor, moderate and major rehabilitation, extensions and upgrading
works would be included in addition to the refurbishing of slow sand filters
to some 20 canal source schemes. The drainage component would provide for
minor, moderate and major rehabilitation to villages with existing drainage
facilities with extensions included as appropriate. The component would
improve the health and hygiene conditions in the villages.
35.      Pilot Water Supply Program - PHED (US$0.48 million equivalent).  This
component would be utilized for the development of scavenger wells as
alternative water sources.
36.      Land for Water Supply and Drainage Schemes - PHED (US$1.90 million
equivalent). The component would provide for the acquisition of land for the
construction and rehabilitation of water supply and drainage schemes,
including oxidation ponds and pump stations.
37.      New Drainage Schemes - PHED (US$7.13 million equivalent).  The
component would provide drainage schemes for 60 new large village systems
(design population 2500) having piped water supply and 40 large villages with
mechanized private wells. The drainage schemes associated with piped water
systems would be in the districts of Sukkur, Sanghar, Larkana, Khairpur,
Jacobabad and Hyderabad with the private well drainage schemes in the
districts of Nawabshab and Shikarpur. The schemes would be based on open

drains designed to cater for sullage water only with treatment in oxidation
ponds before disposal to appropriate discharge locations. Allowances have
been made for schemes requiring double and single pumping to suit the
topographical features expected. The schemes would greatly enhance the
environment of the villages and improve health and hygiene conditions for some
250,000 rural people.
38.      Latrine Demonstration Program - PHED (US$0.24 million equivalent).
The component would provide in villages with new water supply and drainage
schemes for the construction of about 3000 double pit pour flush or other
technically appropriate demonstration latrines associated with schemes of
large and medium water supplies (1270); villages with drainage schemes and
mechanized wells (200); Arid Zone water supply schemes (1530).
39.      Latrine Materials Incentive Program - PHED (Cost US$0.27 million
equivalent). Essential latrine materials (pour flush pan, trap, connecting
pipework and 1 No. bag of cement) would be provided for about 10% of the
population benefitting from improved water supplies (estimated at between 1.0
and l.lm) as an incentive for beneficiaries to construct and use household
latrines. Materials would be provided on a grant basis for about 17,501 units.
40.      Latrine Demonstration Program - RDD (US$0.52 million equivalent).

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATIQN PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Implementing Agencies
A. Introduction
1.     Introduction  The implementing agencies responsible for execution of
the proposed project in the Provinces of Balochistan and Sindh and the State
of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are described in this Annex. The
concerned agencies are: (i) the Planning and Development Departments of AJK,
GOB and GOS; (ii) the Local Government and Rural Development Department
(LGRDD) in AJK; and (iii) Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) and
LGRDD in Balochistan and (iv) the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED)
and the Rural Development Department (RDD) in Sindh Province.
B. Azad Jammu and Kashmir
2.    Background.   Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a  semi-autonomous state
created in 1947 under the India Independence Act (1947) and the Partition Plan
(June 1947) as part of the termination of British rule in the region.It was
established with the assistance of the United Nations Commission on India and
Pakistan (UNCIP), at the conclusion of a war between Pakistan and India which
ended October 24, 1947.
3.    The AJK government (GOAJK) functions under the Azad Jammu and Kashmir
Interim Constitution, Act, 1974 (together with 8 amendments) providing for a
parliamentary system of government. The Government of Pakistan has approved
the Interim Constitution. Administrative and legislative systems with rules
of business, courts and laws codes were established in 1952.
4.     The Legislative Assembly consisting of 40 elected members plus 8 co-
opted members, is headed by an elected Prime Minister. It has authority to
rule on all matters other than defense, security, currency, external affairs
and foreign aid which have been designated by UNCIP to GOP.  The President,.
who is elected by the joint sitting of the Assembly and the elected members of
the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, is the constitutional head of GOAJK. The
government consists of the Prime Minister who is the Chief Executive of GOAJK
and the Ministers of GOAJK, exercising their authority in the name of the
President. AJK has five administrative districts (Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Poonch,
Kotli and Mirpur).

5.     State Finances.  GOAJK relies mainly on external sources of finance for
its revenue. Of total recurrent revenue, the State's revenue from local taxes
and charges amounts to 28X. The balance of recurrert revenue and all capital
revenue is financed by GOP. In total, the State's own revenue was equivalent
to 14X of total expenditure in FY88, a slightly lower proportion than in FY85
(16X). Recurrent expenditure has averaged about 50X of total expenditure
since FY85, with debt service accounting for some 20X and capital expenditure
for some 301. The State is incurring increasingly large annual deficits,
which are being financed by short term borrowing from its Ways and Means
account with GOP. The deficit is due to an imbalance in the State's current
account, pointing to a need to restrain recurrent expenditure and increase
current income. Increased debt service arising from deficit financing adds to
the effort required to achieve financial equilibrium. Details of past
expenditure are shown in Table A3-1.

12.    Two LGRDD operating wings support local government.  The Local
Government wing provides assistance to the urban and rural local bodies, in
the form of grants-in-aid and by appointment of officers for administration,
taxation and finance, and municipal engineering. The Rural Development wing
is responsible under a Directorate for executing all rural development
activities and for providing technical assistance to the councils.
13.    The LGRDD administration is organized at five levels (Secretariat,
Directorate, District, Markaz and Union Council). In addition, under the 1987
Local Government Ordinance, the AJK government can appoint an Election
Commissioner to organize, conduct and supervise elections. The executive and
judiciary of the state are expected to assist the Commissioner in the
discharge of these functions.
14.    LGRDD-Organization and Staffing.  LGRDD has some 620 staff, distributed
at all levels of government comprising 19 Senior staff at headquarters, 90
Assistant Directors, Engineers and Project Managers at District and Markaz
level, 281 Union Council Secretaries and some 230 other staff. Figure 3.1
shows the organizational structure.
15.    The LGRDD Directorate has limited administrative, financial and
technical staff. Each of the five districts has an Assistant Director,
Assistant Engineer and an Accountant. The Assistant Director is responsible
for examination of council budgets, processing of appointments and projects.
The Assistant Engineer prepares project feasibilities, does site inspection
and gives certification of payment. At the Markaz level, the staffing
comprises a Project Manager, a Sub-Engineer,a supervisor and a Senior Accounts
Clerk. The Supervisor oversees the working of the Secretaries of the Union
Councils within the markaz. Execution of rural development projects is
primarily at the markaz level with the responsibility for this resting with
the Project Manager. The Union Council Secretary is responsible for the
administration and finance of the council.
16.    The extensive multi-level network with markaz-level Project Managers
enables LGRDD to assist organize community involvement and execute projects at
village level, including an expanded RWSS program. However, while LGRDD has
substantial field staff, all technical design is supervised by one engineer
seconded to the department from PHEC. The small nature of the schemes means
that the designs are not sent for approval by central government. Due to

funding fluctuations all schemes for the year are designed within a short
period of time, limiting the ability of the department to adequately check
them. This has affected the overall quality of RWSS project design and
supervision. Institutional strengthening and training would be required for
effective implementation of a larger program.
17.    Other RWSS Programs.  A UNICEF-supported  Water and Sanitation Cell
within LGRDD leads LGRDD's RWSS program. Promoters work at village level
through three village committees (water supply and sanitation, schools, and
the women's committees which has a health focus). The water supply schemes are
mainly small, community-managed, gravity-fed schemes; the sanitation programs
mainly consist of demonstration latrines at key rural institutions and follow-
up promotion. The use of mainly female promoters has been part of the LGRDD
program for over four years, and will provide a base for launching a larger
human waste disposal program throughout the state integrated with water supply
and hygiene education.
18.    LGRDD-DeRartmental Finances.  These are shown in Table A3-2.  The
Department receives its finances as budgetary allocation through the regular
State budgetary process. Its expenditures therefore reflect State priorities
and fiscal capacity, and also the Department's capacity to implement the
budgets allocated. A review of past recurrent expenditure shows substantial
growth in recent years, but this mainly reflects the reclassification of staff
from the development account, rather than growth in the Department. Staff and
administration costs represent about 97X of non-development expenditure,
largely due to AJK's policy of community responsibility for O&M which obviates
the need for a Departmental O&M budget. RWSS has represented about 30X of
LGRDD's annual investment between FY85 and FY88, and this proportion will rise
during project implementation to an estimated 66X. As a result of the
increased investment in the sector, total annual capital investment by LGRDD
is expected to increase by 601 at its peak during project implementation, and
the project includes policy and institutional development components to build
the necessary capacity for this growth, including incremental staff which are
assumed mostly to move to assignments outside the Department at the conclusion
of the project.
19.    Public Health Engineering Circle (PHEC)-Sectoral Role.   The PHEC, part
of the Public Works Department (PWD), is responsible for the provision,
operations and maintenance (including billing and collection) of water
supply, sewerage and drainage to the cities and towns of AJK with urban
councils. Technical staff comprises three Divisional Engineers (at
Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Mirpur) and ten Assistant Engineers. It executes
schemes in the larger towns, tahsil headquarters and urban settlements down to
5,000 population, and has no responsibility for services in the rural areas.
20.    Other Departments.  The Department of Health (DOH) places emphasis on
the importance of its curative services in urban as well as rural communities.
rreventive services have been limited but have been particularly successful in
immunization and distribution of oral rehydration salts. Rural health
facilities are not currently fully staffed, in particular lacking out-reach
facilities and female h&ealth workers (only 50 in post) for the rural areas.
DOH presently has a staff of about 3700, including 2440 district health

21.    About 93X of Union Councils have a basic health unit or rural health
center, serving an average of 12,800 persons per health center. DOH
coordinates with and manages a number of outreach programmes addressing
Traditional Birth Attendants' training, school health and health education
programme; and works through LGRDD for various health programmes in rural
areas and health and hygiene for female agricultural extension workers. A
recent community health worker program has been launched at district level
focussing upon improved health and hygiene including RWSS.
22.    The Health Education Unit of DOH was established in 1979, but has a
staff of only seven. It has broad health education and promotion
responsibilities, but is not able to be effective due to staff and budget
limitations.
23.    The Department of Education would be one of the main channels for
communicating program promotion and health education. In AJK, education
enrollments have increased rapidly in recent years. The primary school
enrollment increased by 96X for boys and 80X for girls between 1983-84 and
1987-88. A total of 470,000 pupils attend 4,400 schools, with some 17,000
teachers.
C. The Province of Balochistan
24.    Backaround   Balochistan is one of the four Provinces in the Federal
structure; it is the least populous, with an estimated rural population (1988)
of 4.5 million (82Z of total) which is growing at about 3.11 annually. The
most important Departments w4ch respect to the RWSS sector are the Planning
and Development Department (P&D), the Public Health Engineering Department
(PHED) and the Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD).The
province has 6 administrative divisions which in rural areas contain 20
districts, each administered by a District Council; each district has from
six to thirty union councils each serving 10,000-15,000 people. There are 315
union councils covering a vast geographic area. The mausa is the electoral
unit within the union council, comprising several villages 'V. Urban
development and service provision is undertaken by 20 Town and 10 Municipal
committees, the Quetta M'tnicipal Corporation and the Quetta Cantonement Board.
25.    Provincial Finances.  GOB relies mainly on external sources for
recurrent and development finance. Only 71 of FY90 budget current revenue is
raised from Provincial sources, the balance coming from Federal tax-sharing
(611) and grants (32X). Capital expenditure is financed wholly by development
grants and loans from GOP. Recurrent expenditure has averaged 451 of total
expenditure si,ice FY85, with debt service accounting for some 301 and capital
expenditure for 251. The Government's current account is in imbalance, and
has been in deficit since FY86. This deficit has been partially offset, in
most years, by surplus on the capital account, although this has not prevented
A village is a settlement with a population less than 5000. Larger
settlements are designated as towns, and have the right to form town

substantial overall deficits in three out of four years. The deficit on the
consolidated fund has been financed to a varying extent by drawing on
reserves, and by employing advances and deposits made to the Public Account.
Nevertheless the underlying imbalance in the current account cannot be
sustained by capital account surplus based on long term borrowing without
serious consequences for creditworthiness. Thus there is an urgent need to
limit recurrent expenditure and increase current account income. Details of
Province finances are shown in Table A3-3/4.

26.    Planning and Development Degartment (P&D).  The P&D, headed by an
Additional Chief Secretary (Development) is the provincial counterpart of the
Federal Planning and Development Division. Its functions include the preparing
the ADP, coordinating line department development activities, being
secretariat of the Provincial Development Working Party, monitoring the
execution and performance of provincial development activities, and liaising
with donor agencies. Sector projects are processed through the Water Section
or the Local Government Section of P&D Department. P&D requires strengthening
in management informational systems (MIS) and district-level planning.
27.    Public Health Engineering Department (PHED)- Functions and Powers.  The
PHED was formed as a full status line department, headed by a Secretary in
1987, with the mandate to design and construct safe water supply schemes in
urban and rural areas, and to provide drainage for sullage and storm water in
the medium and small settlements. At present PHED undertakes O&M of these
schemes because the local bodies have not taken on this responsibility. Since
formation, PHED has completed 80 projects, has 205 projects ongoing and 160
schemes proposed, (the majority rural) and is responsible for O&M of 285
existing projects implemented by the Irrigation Department. PHED received the
largest share of the provincial FY90 ADP, totalling Rs. 210 million; O&M
expenditures are met from the recurrent budget.
28.    In the short time since formation, PHED has, with limited resources,
done commendable work to meet the water needs in Balochistan. As of June
1989, the total water supply coverage in the province (rural and urban) is
45X.  However, PHED has so far concentrated on towns or larger villages; rural
coverage is under 251.
29.    PHED-Oreanization and Staffing.  PHED has limited professional staff,
transport facilities, equipment, and office resources, which are located in
four administrative circles. Priority has to date been given to employing
essential professional staff, mainly civil engineers, and to investing in
drilling rigs. Total staffing is 2400, including professionals (numbering
56), officers, clerks, operators, peons, drivers and chowkidars. The number
of PHED-implemented schemes has risen dramatically but staffing levels have
not kept pace. The organization chart of PHED is shown in Figure A3.2. The
department has no structured training program and staff members lack the
opportunity to expand their knowledge and keep pace with changing sector
needs. At the senior level, most of the time is spent on administrative
duties to implement schemes rather than on planning and design. These
deficiencies need to be addressed if sector coverage is to improve. Figure
3.2 shows the organizational structure.
30.    PHED-Departmental Finances.   PHED finances all expenditures through
provincial budget allocations. Tariffs are collected from township schemes,
but provide for less than 5X of O& expenditure, receipts flowing into the
Provincial consolidated fund rather than financing incremental O&M
expenditure. The financial position of PHED is poor, costs far exceeding
revenues as shown in Table A3-5. To avoid this burden on public sector
finance requires a strategic change, whereby PHED would gradually increase
revenue collections from rural townships, applying income directly to finance
O&K costs, to the point that 0&M costs would be fully financed from revenues.
To                               as a uniform policy throughout the province

(a) regularly increase tariff levels;
(b) extend its charging base by encouraging household connections
through reduced connection fees;
(c) increase collection efficiency, including contracting collection
to the private sector in 25X of schemes for a trial period; and
(d) establish a clear relationship between local O&ff expenditure and
local tariff yields.   06M expenditure in villages would become
the responsibility of the community through the adoption of a
direct community payment policy. Implementation of these policies
would require support through institutional development. PHED
could manage capital expenditure increases of over 30X in rea'.
terms during the next decade if this was accompanied by
institutional strengthening.

31.    Local Government and Rural Develooment Degartment (LCRDD)-Functions and
Powers. LGRDD functions under the Balochistan Local Government Ordinance
1980, and follows procedures laid down in the Manual of Instructions for Rural
Development. It is responsible for organizing communities, and for basic
services in the field of public works, drinking water supply, infectious
disease control including vaccination enforcement, drainage and waste disposal
and education. LGRDD is a community-focussed organization, dealing at
community, union and the district levels and has three branches. The Rural
Development Wing is responsible for administration and management of field
staff, allocation of development funds to local councils, and development
project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The Local Government Board
acts as a personnel department of local bodies to supervise and coordinate
rural. and urban councils in the formulation of budget and taxation proposals,
disbursement of funds and grants-in-aid (over 50X of local councils are in
deficit). The Election Cell is responsible for administering the Provincial
Elections Authority and dealing with the local bodies elections. The
organization chart of LGRDD is shown in Figure A3.3.
32.   LGRDD-Departmental Finances.  Development scheme funding sources
include: (1) regular rural development funds; (2) accelerated development
funds which includes funds outside the ADP such as the funds for Members of
the Provincial/National Assemblies and rapid development funds; (3) Marla and
Katchi Abadi funds; (4) special development ft.nds; and (5) dovetailed funds
for the projects of education, health, social welfare, revenue and other
Government Departments. Regular rural development funds are compulsorily
allocated to the local government institutions whereas the involvement of
LGRDD institutions in scheme implementation under the other funding sources is
optional depending on the wishes of the concerned government agency.   The ADP
allocation to the district and union councils in the ADP under the rural
development program is currently between Rs. 50 to 60 million, distributed on
a population basis. Some 25% of the ADP is allocated for water supply, health
and sanitation projects amounting to about  Rs. 15 million annually for the
rural areas. The actual ADP expenditures on water supply have been less                     ;
because the disbursement of funds is at the discretion of district and union
councils. ADP-financed irrigation schemes which emphasize income generation
also provide drinking water through dug wells, water tanks, Karez
improvements, and the development of springs and water channels. LGRDD has
demonstrated capacity to implement RWSS programs of over Rs. 20 million
annually. The impact of the LGRDD ADP is not significant as it is spread over
115 Union Councils and 20 District Councils.
33.    LGRDD-Organization and Staffing.  LGRDD staffing consists of one
Director located at Quetta; six Joint Directors at each of the 6 Divisional
Headquarters; 20 Assistant Directors; 20 Assistant Engineers and 20 Chief
Officers at the District Headquarters; 47 Development Officers, 47 supervisors
and 47 sub-engineers at the sub-divisional headquarters and 315 Secretaries of
Union Councils (village workers). LGRDD provides institutional links at the
grass roots village level where field staffing is insufficient and all male.
Field activities are restricted due to numerous office administrative tasks
and lack of mobility and incentives, reducing development effectiveness. LGRDD
has an adequate number of technical staff but given their broad mandate it is
difficult for them to meet all demands.

34.    Training activity is limited to courses for newly elected councillors
nd LGRDD officials from the administrative wing of local government. Training
facilities and equipment are inadequate, the only facility being the LGRDD-
operated Rural Development Academy in Quetta which has poorly equipped
temporary facilities. New facilities for the Academy are being constructed on
the outskirts of Quetta and completion is scheduled for late 1990. To meet
sector needs cost-effectively, staff skills need strengthening and updating
especially in pianning, management, and current technology.
D. The Province of Sindh
35.    Background. Sindh is one of the four Provinces in the Federal
structure; it is the second most populous, with an estimated rural population
of 12.8 million (1988), in some 68,000 settlements. The rural population is
estimated to reach some 16.8 million by year 1998. The rural population is
56X of the total; this would be 841 if the Karachi conurbation was excluded.
36.    Provincial Finances.  GOS plans that 21X of FY90 current revenue should
come from Provincial taxes and charges, compared with 29Z in FY85. The
balance of Provincial current finances comes from Federal tax-sharing (501)
and grants (291). Deveiopment expenditure is wholly financed by grants and
loans from GOP. In the FY90 budget, grants for development expenditure are
lower in nominal terms than previously, while financing from long term
borrowing is planned to increase to more than twice the average of the past
five years.
37.    Budgeted recurrent expenditure, including debt service, amounts to some
851 of total in FY90, approximately the same proportion as in FY85. Since
FY85, debt service has generally totalled 25X to 30X of non-development
revenue, although sustained borrowing at the FY90 level would lead to
increased debt service costs. Capital expenditure has remained a fairly
constant proportion of total expenditure, just less than 201.
38.    The current account of GOS is in deficit, and this deficit has worsened
since FY85. One root cause of this is the relatively poor performance of
local revenues, which have increased by an annual average of 91 since FY85,
compared with an annual 171 growth in recurrent expenditure. Although FY89
and FY90 deficits appear less than previous years, these are estimated rather
than actual figures, and GOS's estimates may significantly overstate non-
development grants. Thus final accounts may show a worse outcome than
expected. Although the current account deficit has been offset by regular
capital account surpluses, as capital financing is increasingly arising from
long term borrowing this does not represent a sustainable option. Hence there
is a need for GOS to limit recurrent expenditure and increase current
revenues. Details of Province finances are shown in Table A3-6.
39.    Planning and Development Denartment(P&D)-Functions and Powers.  The P&D
was created in 1970 to facilitate public sector development programmes. The
functions of the Department include (a) planning development programs and
formulation of policy; (b) coordination of foreign aid and technical
assistance; (c) processing of development schemes, programs and proposals
submitted by other departments and making recommendations to Government
thereon; and (d) monitoring and evaluation. Project approval authorizations in
Sindh are similar to Azad Jammu & Kashmir.

40.    Public Health Engineering Department(PHEM-Functions and Powers.  PHED
is a department of the Houslng and Town Planning, Local Government and Rural
Development Department, is headquartered in Hyderabad, and is responsible for
the development, design and supervision of construction of rural and urban
water supply and drainage (sullage water disposal) in Cindh. For operations
and maintenance (OEM), completed schemes were in the past handed over to the
local authorities - Union Councils in the case of rural schemes and Town
Committees for urban schemes. However, most rural schemes have been handed
back to the PHED for 0&M because the Union Councils lack the capabillity to
take on the responsibility.                                                                -
41.    About 80X of the PHED water supply schemes are based on a canal source
and the balance are based on tubewells. The drainage schemes consist of
collector drains leading to a pumping station which discharges the waste water
to an oxidation pond and then to a water course or a SCARP drain. PHED has to
date completed 225 rural water supply schemes and 116 rural drainage schemes.
There are about 300 rural water supply schemes and 240 rural drainage schemes
in various states of construction.
42.    PHED would as part of the project be responsible for implementation,
but would divest itself of all O&K responsibilities, and would be available to
provide an advisory service to the Union Councils and village based committees
on the technical aspects of operating and maintaining RWSS and drainage
schemes.
43.    PHED-Organization and Staffing.  PHED is headed by a Chief Engineer
with central design, procurement and administrative staff. !ne Province is
divided into 6 Circles each staffed by a Superintending Er.gineer with
supporting technical and administrative staff. Circles are sub-divided into
Divisions headed by an Executive Engineer, with Assistant Engineers at Taluka
level corresponding approximately to the administrative Districts. There are
19 PHED Divisional offices in Sindh. Figure 3.4 shows the organizational
structure.
44.    Staffing is shown below:
Senior Engineering & Administrative Staff         28
Assistant and Sub Engineers                      100
Mid Level Technical & Support Staff              315
Artisans                                         264
Other Categories                                 601
Total        1308
(Plus Temporary Staff incl O&M at District level)
45.    Some 95X of staff are in the operating Circles, three of which are
based in Hydei.abad. Staffing levels are 92X of sanctioned posts; however, a
number of Assistant Engineers and Sub-Engineers are on temporary status and
all of the scheme operators are on work charge status, and financed through
the ADP as part of project costs.

46.    The PHED has adequate levels of technical manpower for project
implementation. However, their engineering and design skills are out of date
in many cases; expertise and experience in implementing a community-based
approach is lacking and the hydrogeological capability, financial management,
accountability and personnel management, and management information and
accounting systems need substantial improvement. Planning , monitoring and
evaluation are weak, and there is .ao formal training program. These deficits
would require to be addressed if coverage is to be increased, including
forming units for: training; planning, monitoring and evaluation;
hydrogeology and O&M support.
47.    PHED-Departmental Finances.  Details of the Department's finances are
shown in Table A3-7. Past years' recurrent expenditure data show the growing
burden of O&M expenditure. (A fivefold real increase is estimated to result
from the continued investment in the sector during the project period,
although these costs would be transferred to communities through the
application of the direct community payment policy.) The capital account
demonstrates the increased emphasis on RWSS since FY85, both in terms of the
Department's and the Provinces' total investment.
48.    The financial projections illustrate that PHED's annual investment
capacity is required to increase by 60X at the peak of project investment.
The transfer of O&M responsibility to communities would enable PHED to focus
more on its development responsibilities, and the adoption of new investment
planning policies to avoid under-funded and fragmented development would
further enhance PHED's investment capacity. These policies, together with
project financed institutional development components, are considered adequate
to achieve the strengthening required.
49.    Rural Development DeDartment (RDD)-Functions and Powers.  RDD is
responsible for providing budgetary management and technical support to town
committees, municipal committees and union councils, but not district
councils. RDD responsibilities include: a) coordination and preparation of the
local body ADP; b) distribution, approvals and progressing of block grant in
aid to local bodies; c) technical assistance to the local bodies in the
execution of ADP works; and d) execution of development works. RDD supports
and in some cases executes a broad range of rural development works including
schools, rural health centers and clinics, handpump water supplies, drainage
and roads. The bulk of the local government ADP currently goes direct to the
local bodies, except for special programs like water supply and sanitation.
50.    RDD works closely with the Local Government Department (LCD), as part
of the same Sindh Government department. LGD is charged with supervision,
coordination and staffing of the local district and union councils, Town
committees and Municipal Corporations. It administers grant-in-aid development
funds for district councils; it is a non-technical ministry.

51.    RDD-Organizztion and Staffing.  RDD is headed by a Karachi-based
Director General with small support staff, and has two operacional wings, a
Development Wing and a Technical Wing. The Development wing is organized into
three divisions and thirteen districts with back-up staff. The Technical wing
has engineering staff at district level where an Assistant Engineer generally
has responsibility for developments in two or three talukas (Figure A3.5 shows
the RDD organization chart). The staffing is shown below:
Senior Engineering & Administrative Staff        17
Assistant and Sub Engineers                      36
Mid-Level Technical & Support Staff              13
Artisans and Others                              86
Total      152
52.    The Technical Wing has about 20X positions vacant. Though fully
staffed, the Development Wing personnel are fully committed to existing work,
and the essential positions of Assistant Engineers are not on the permanent
establishment. LGD has an establishment of 302, mostly filled.
53.   RDD is poorly equipped with physical resources. Offices are generally
rented and ill-equipped, mobility is constr%ined by lack of transport, and
staff training is inadequate. The departmenzal responsibilities cannot be
increased without substantial institutional strengthening, training and
improvement of facilities; this would have to be done as part of the project.
The Local Government and Rural Development Academy at Tando Jam is the main
local body training center in Sindh. It has an extensive campus and
administration, training, and accommodation facilities; the staff has
experience in training local authority personnel, communities, private sector
contractors, artisans and training of trainers. To address these
shortcomings, it is agreed cells would be required for: training coordination;
planning, monitoring and evaluation; handpump improvement and maintenance; and
sanitation technology. Offices would be improved and training given on
technical, financial and administrative matters, preferably at Tando Jam
Academy.
54.    RDD-DeRartmental Finances.  Analysis of past expenditure data reflects
limited capacity of RDD to implement development schemes. In response to
this, the project is more than half devoted to building RDD's institutional
capacity to be capable of supporting a threefold increase in RWSS capital
investment compared with present levels. (No regular O&M expenditure is
forecast as this is to be a community responsibility.) The financial forecast
assumes that at the completion of the project the incremental operating costs
being funded through the project would be absorbed into RDD's non-development
budget, to continue to support its development focus as it turns to other
areas of the Province.   The financial position of the Department is shown in
the Table A3-8.

Cost Recovery Strategy Summary
Payment of Operations and Maintenange (O&M) Costs
Azad Jammu and Kasl.mir
1.       The Government of AJK (GOAJK) has confirmed that AJK RWSS policy is
that full O&M costs are paid directly by the community and that government
does not, and in future would not, accept responsibility for these costs. The
Government also undertook to ensure that line departments would not undermine
the existing RWSS program by adopting conflicting policies.
Balochis-tan
2.       The Government of Balochistan (GOB) has agreed that for all rural
community schemes, from lst July 1991, the following uniform policy and
modality would be adopted sector-wide :
(a)      The allocation of new build and rehabilitation schemes would
be determined by community demand. To qualify for a scheme,
a village must have.
(i)   established an acceptable village organization;
(ii) agreed and signed an acceptable Memorandum of
Understanding with the Government of Balochistan under
which the community assumes responsibility for system
management, operations and maintenance; and
(iii) contracted directly with the power distribution
authority for payment of connection charges in advance
and for the payment of electricity bills based on
actual consumption (for electrically-driven mechanized
schemes only). (Government would assume no
responsibility for payment for RWSS power supply.)
(b)      Responsibility for payment for power, system management,
operations and maintenance of existing rural schemes would
be transferred to communities over three years, at least 25X
being transferred by July 1, 1992, 50X by July 1, 1993 and
the balance by July 1, 1994.

(c)      Outstanding amounts owed to WAPDA in respect of Public
Health Engineering Department (PHED) RWSS schemes would be
cleared and arrangements made to avoid public sector RWSS
power liabilities in the future.
3.       For Balochistan rural township schemes (these townships generally
have a population of under 25,000), where scheme size and complexity dictate
that government remains directly involved in O&M and where consumer charges
are levied for household connections, GOB has agreed to the following:
(a)      A uniform policy would be established for all such schemes
throughout the province from 1 July 1991;
(b)      A new monthly tariff of Rs 50 per standard domestic
connection, and Rs 250 per commercial connection, would take
effect from 1 July, 1990; thereafter tariffs would be
increas.^d at least triennially with a tariff increase of at
least tie domestic inflation rate plus 5X per annum;
*c)      Domestic connections would be encouraged, the present
connection fee of Rs 500 would be reduced, and PHED would
take measures to regularize illegal connections;
(d)      PHED would be responsible for operation, maintenance and
collection of revenue for township schemes and would take
over the few schemes remaining with local government
according to a timetable to be agreed. The necessary
administrative orders would be issued to this effect;
(e)      PHED would for a trial period contract out to the private
sector the responsibility for collection of revenue in about
251 of townships, based on competitive bids for guaranteed
yields and this would be extended to other townships if
successful;
(f)      Revenues generated from tariffs would be applied towards
PHED operation and maintenance costs on a self-financing
basis; and|
(g)      Outstanding amounts owed to WAPDA in respect of PHED schemes
would be cleared prior to Credit Negotiations.

Sindh
4.       The Government of Sindh  (GOS) has agreed to implement the cost
recovery policy, and proposed to adopt a direct nayment strategy, so that the
full costs of O&M be met by direct community payments. GOS proposed that the
following modality be adopted:
(a)      The allocation of schemes would be determined by community
demand. To qualify for a new scheme, rehabilitation or
augmentation a village must have:
(i)   established a village xrganization;
(ii) agreed and signed an acceptable Memorandum of
Understanding with GOS; and
(iii) contracted directly with the power distribution
authority for payment of connection charges in advance
and electricity bills based on actual consumption
(mechanized schemes only).
sb)      For a three-month period following commissioning, new and
augmented mechanized schemes would be cperated by the works
contractor. (The cost of this would be included in the
construction contract.) The scheme would then be handed over
to the community. At no time would any Government agency be
involved I     rations or maintenance. PHED may guide and
advise the   anunity on how to arrange the power supply
contract; but would offer no financial assistance or
guarantees. PHED and the Rural Development Department (RDD)
would offer technical assistance as described in the
Memorandum of Understanding.
5.        GOS intends to support the direct community payment with the yield
from an enhanced land cess, to be levied and collected with the existing local
rate on land and with surcharges on the Cotton Fee, Paddy Development Fee and
Sugar-Cane Development Cess, to be levied and collected with these fees and
cess. The net yield of these fees and cesses would be allocated only to
eligible villages ie. those with a government scheme and applying acceptable
O&M practices, cn the following basis:
(a)      For mechanized schemes, the componen' of the cess for power
consumption would be paid directly to the power distribution
authority as a contribution fixed in respect of each scheme.
The balance of funds would flow to the community agency
responsible for O&M (union council/village organization)
subject to adequate financial controls and accounting
arrangements being in place. Communities would be directly
responsible for raising any further funding.

(b)      For non-mechanized schemes, the yield  would be allocated to
the community agency responsible for O&M (union
council/village organization) subject to adequate financial
controls and accounting arrangements being in place.
Communities would be directly responsible for raising any
further funding.
6.       GOS would implement the above policy by:
(a)      applying the policy sector-wide from 1st July 1991 to all
existing and newly constructed, augmented and rehabilitated
schemes;
(b)      transferring responsibility for payment of water supply
electricity bills on existing schemes to 501 of communities
by July 1, 1991 and to 100l of communities by July 1, 1992;
and transferring all O&M responsibilities on existing
schemes to direct community payment according to a timetable
accepttable to IDA;
(c)      arranging for, and assisting communities to put in place,
mechanisms for them to make direct payments;
(d)      levying, effective 29 November, 1990, an incremental annual
cess on cultivated land of Rs. 1.50 per acre for non-
irrigated land, Rs. 3.00 per acre for land with non-
perennial irrigation and Rs. 6.40 per acre for land with
perennial irrigation, and levying, the following agriculture
surcharges: (a) surcharge on the Cotton Fee of an
additional Rs 4.00 per 100 kgs effective 17 February 1991;
(b) surcharge on the Paddy Development Fee of an additional
Rs 0.50 per 100 kgs effective 25 February, 1991; and (c)
surcharge on the Sugar-Cane Development Cess of an
additional Rs 0.15 per 40 kgs effective 25 February 1991; to
credit the amounts raised by these surcharges to a separate
account; and to apply these amounts to RWSS O01 costs. The
rate of fees and cesses, which would be revised at least
triennially, would be set to recover all estimated O&0
power, maintenance and repairs costs; and
(e)      settling the outstanding WAPDA arrears with 2HED for rural
schemes and avoiding public sector RWSS power liabilities in
future.
Exceptions
7. Government may agree to assist finance the O&M costs, but this would be
only in exceptional cases of extreme hardship or technical complexity.

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Selection Criteria and Memorandum of Understandinsi
Introduction
1.    This  annex  sets  out  the  selection  criteria  established  for  the
implementation of new and rehabilitated water supply, drainage and sanitation
schemes in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh. Further details are
given in the Documents on Project File (see Annex 14).
Azad Jammu Kashmir - Village Selection
2.    Because the present practice of splintering funds among numerous tiny
schemes absorbs massive amounts of LGRDD time and energy, village selection for
sector projects would proceed within the framework of a District Water Plan.
District Water Plans will be prepared allocating funds among the markaz on the
same basis as allocations among the dist'ricts. Villages will then be selected
annually on the basis of the planned - number of schemes, population to be served
and budget ceilings for each markaz. Individual village selection will be based
on a prioritization of the villages which have submitted formal requests to
LGRDD. The prioritization will be based primarily on need, as defined by the
distance and quality of the present water source and on a field assessment of
the per capita cost of the scheme, technical feasibility and evidence of previous
community work. Eligibility of schemes for consideration would be limited to
whole communities (no partial schemes) and to cost-effective schemes, e.g.
maximum of Rs. 1000 per capita at 1990 prices. In addition, approximately 2/3
of the funds will be allocated to new schemes, and the rest to
rehabilitation/completion of existing schemes. Or. the other hand, the technology
and setrlement size splits for each district have been predicted but do not
constitute budget allocations, therefore the technology per se is not a selection
criteria. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be used in AJK is shown in
Attachment 1.
Balochistan - Village Selection
3.    Villages will be selected on the basis of their willingness and capacity
to enter into the Memorandum of Understanding (Attachment 2); their need, based
upon an assessment of the quality of current access to services (with priority
to the worst first); and the financial feasibility of the technical solution,
in terms of both construction and O&M cost.
4.    The location of the township water supply and sanitation schemes has been
already determined following feasibility studies.

ANNER 9
Page 2 of 2
Sindh - Villages Selection
5.    Village selection for that part of the OS investment program financed by
the IDA would be based on the criteria set out in the Memorandum of Understanding
(Attachment 3). The villages included would be drawn from the following sources:
(a)   PHED mechanized schemes            1986/87 Human Rural Settlements Survey
(HRS) of villages with populations over
500
(b)   PHED rehabilitation schemes        PHED surveyed list
(c)   PHED Arid Zone schemes             HRS survey (under 1000 population)
(non mechanized)
(d) PHED drainage schemes                PHED surveyed list of larger villages
in the sweet water zone where private
tubewells installed
(e) RDD schemes (non mechanized)         HRS survey (under 500 population)
6.    It must also be remembered that there will be a certain amount of self
selection by villages to the schemes. Those communities who feel they do not
want to meet the criteria stipulated on the MOU, or those who cannot, for any
reason, adequately meet the criteria, will be automatically excluded from the
schemes.

targets are to be realized. The RWSS implementacion strategy would: (a) utilize
beneficiaries to identify, implement, monitor and maintain projects in rural
water supply, sanitation and hygiene: (b) strengthen the management and technical
capacity of government line agencies involved in the sector, supplement their
technical resources, and assist them in mobilizing the beneficiaries and their
resources: and, (c) utilize the private sector and NGOs in technical fields and
social organization to facil6Late joint implementation by governmeuat and organize
beneficiaries.
2.    IDA financing of RWSS investments in AJK, Balochistan and Sindh would be
undertaken in this innovative policy framework. The strategic investment plan
(SIP) is sectorwide, and policy changes would be applied not only to the IDA
assisted investments but to all RWSS sector investments by GOAJK, GOB and GOS.
IDA assistance would provide a much needed catalyst for changes required if
serious financial and economic difficulties inherent in the previously adopted
implementation strategies are to be avoided.
B. Project Justification for Azad Jammu and Kashmir
3.   Project Outguts.  The proposed project outputs for AJK include community
based systems for rural water supply and sanitation development and operations
and maintenance. Project villages would be assisted to arrange the 0 & M and
financial management of the schemes and sector institutions would be strengthened
to provide cost-effective managerial and technical support. An improved water
resources data base and design methodology criteria would be developed for AJK.
An up-to-date data management information system would be developed to provide
a basis for improving the financing of urban water and sewerage systems. A large
training component is also part of the project.
4.    Rationale for Investment.   The system of water supply development and
management in AJK is unique in the level of community financing of capital costs
and the assumption of a major share of the responsibility for the operations and
management of schemes after implementation by the community. In AJK, rural water
scheme are not reliant on continued government subsidies. However, there are
many weaknesses in the existing execution methods, which result in the

inefficient use of sector resources and minimize impact in an area where the
potential for both social and economic benefits is high. IDA assistance to this
sector in AJK would be used to improve the current implementation practices and
help develop a model of community participation which provides key lessons to
the resc of the country.
5.    Impact on Beneficiaries.  The current water supply coverage in AJK is 42X
and sanitation coverage is only 2X. For AJK as a whole, 101 of the additional
coverage achieved during the project would be in large settlements, medium-
sized settlements would receive over 50X of the additional coverage and the
remainder 40X would be in small villages. In Muzzaffarabad and Bagh Districts,
the bulk of the coverage would be in small and medium sized settlements whereas
in Mirpur, about 25X would be in Large settlements.   The overall level of
coverage is expected to reach 751 by the end of the eight year implementation
period. It is expected that sanitation coverage would be 6.8X by the end of the
eight year implementation period.
6.    Quantifiable and Non-Ouantifi.able Benefits.   The project contains both
quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits.   The only benefits which were
quantified for the project in AJK were from water supply schemes. It is expected
that the benefits from the strengthening of sector institutions would lead to
better implementation of schemes, cost-effectiveness and longer life, but these
benefits were not quantified. The benefits from the sanitation component were
not quantified either.   It is expected that the water supply and sanitation
program would have a substantial impact on the health status of the women and
children in the village. It is expected that the integrated package of water,
sanitation and hygiene can reduce the infant mortality by 30 to 50. S
7.    The benefits from the increased number of water supply schemes were
quantified by following two alternate methodologies. The first method was an
estimation of the time savings from the provision of the new schemes and the
second was from an estimation of willingness to pay for the schemes. Two surveys
were conducted to gather these data. Estimates of time savings from the current
schemes varied from 9.74 hours to 5 hours per house hold per day. However, in
the economic analysis the more conservative estimate of 5 hours of average
savings per household per day was used. Variants of this measure were used in
the sensitivity analysis. The average level of willingness to pay revealed by
the surveys is Rs. 30 per month per household.
8.    Rate of Return.   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the
investment in AJK is 10.51. This analysis includes the capital and O&M costs
of the water supply schemes and the cost of the institutional development
component. The benefits which were used in this analysis were the conservative
I,    "A Time for Change" (Project File Ref. 40) states that substantial health
benefits are lost if implementation is of water supply alone.

estimate of time savings of 5 hours per household per day from water supply
schemes. The costs and benefits of the sanitation component are not included
in this benefits were not separately quantified or incl-.;ed in this analysis.
As such, the analysis understates the benefits. The methodology used for valuing
time savings and the economic yield of the project is the same as that used in
Sindh (paras. 28-30).
9.    Sensitivity Analysis.  A 20X increase in the costs of the relevant project
components reduces the rate of return from 10.51 to 6.61 while a 20X decrease
in the expected benefit stream decreases the IERR to 5.81.
C. Project Justification for Balochstgan
10.   Project Outputs.  The specific targets of the project in Balochistan are
the construction of water supply, sanitation and drainage schemes for urban
townships, institutional strengthening, rehabilitation and extension of existing
water supply schemes, hygiene education programmes, development of user-managed
operation and maintuenance systems and support to the private sector.
11. Rationale for Investment. The Public Health 'ngi.itering Department (PHED)
was created in Balochistan in 1987.   It is primarily responsible for the
implementation of water supply, sanitation and dr&'inage schemes in the province.
The department has weak institutional support Locilities which considerably
reduce its efficiency and the quality of its water supply schemes. About 29Z
of the PHED schemes are either not functioning or in need of rehabilitation.
The number of schemes that PHED would construct each year is expected to grow
for two reasons; (i) the ADP allocation for the sector is expected to increase
and (ii) the average size of village to be served has declined because the
largest villages have been served first.   PHED lacks the equipment and the
management capacity to execute this growing number of schemes.   A small
investment in rehabilitation would also have an immediate impact on a significant
proportion of the population. The government's political priority is to extend
basic coverage to the maximum number of people and is therefore unlikely to
invest in the badly needted institutional strengthening or in the rehabilitation
of existing schemes unless it has external assistance.
12.   Despite the increase in development funds,  PHED has a very limited
recurring budget.   The revenue gen.ration capacity of the sector has been
limited.  The current tariff collection is less than 51 of the total   0 & m
costs.   The government is expected to bear the increasing burden of the
operations an3 maintenance cost. A major policy change in the tariff charges
and collection procedures is required. The IDA investment can be used to bring
about a major change in the tariff policy for the province.
13.   ImJjact on Beneficiaries.   Balochistan has a rural population of 4.5
million. About 221 of this population currently has access to basic water supply
facilities.   It is expected that by the end of the Eighth Plan period, the
project coverage would extend to an additional 215,000 through its rehabilitation
programme, 400,000 through the tubewell development programme, 240,000 through

institutional development. The rural township schemes are expected to provide
services to 140,000 people. The project would also strengthen PHED capacity to
undertake investments funded from the ADP. By the end of the project in 1988,
a basic service level in water supply would be provided to 62Z of the total rural
population.
14.   Ouantifiable and Non-Quantifiable Benefits.  The Project includes both
quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits. An attempt has been made to quantify
some of the benefits from institutional strengthening, rehabilitation and the
construction of new water supply schemes in the rural townships. The major non-
quantifiable benefits are expected to be the health impact from improved water
supply schemes and the benefits from improved sanitation and drainage facilities.
The sanitation and drainage components would have a significant impact on the
health status of women and children in rural Balochistan, reducing the high
incidence of water-borne and excreta-related diseases causing high rates of
morbidity in women and children, and abnormally high infant mortality.
15.   Due to the difficulty in .asuring benefits, a number of techniques were
used to estimate the quantifiable benefits, assessing: (i) actual payments
currently made for the purchase of water in villages where there is a market for
water; (ii) estimated time saved by the installation of water supply schemes
(iii) estimated capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the
community for the schemes implemented in the past as a measure of verceived
benefits and (iv) a general survey on willingness to pay.
16.   The average time savings in rural Balochistan was estimated from a survey
in 27 villages. The results of this survey indicated an average savings of 1.80
hours per day per household. A willingness to pay survey was conducted in the
townships of Hub and Mastung. The results of this survey indicated an average
willingness to pay of Rs. 44 per month per household in Mastung and Rs 29.7 in
Hub. These results were used in quantifying the benefits.
17.   Institutional strengthening is expected to contribute to cost-effectiveness
and the increased sustainability of schemes. The benefits from institutional
strengthening which could be quantified were classified into five main
categories. These include benefits from: (i) increasing the number of tubewell
schemes completed per drilling rig each year; (ii) reducing the capital and
maintenance costs as a result of improved designs and better management of
schemes; (iii) reducing staff costs for operations and maintenance; (iv).
increasing the working life of new water supply schemes; and (v) reducing annual
operations and maintenance costs as a result of using community handpumps.
18.   The major benefits  from the rehabilitation of schemes and tubewell
development have been quantified in terms of the time savings to the user
households in the rural areas. The benefits of new water supply schemes in the
urban townships have been quantified using a willingness to pay survey conducted
in the urban townships of Hub and Mustang. For the townships, the willingness
to pay criterion was thought to capture the increased benefits much more
accurately than the time savings criterion as the former might also incorporate
the additional health benefits of water supply schemes and the demand for an
increased level of service in the urban areas.

19.   Rate of Return.  The IERR for the Project in BalochLstan is 13.12.   This
calculation includes the cost of institutional strengthening, the rehabilitation
component and the water supply schemes for Hub and Mustang for which cost and
benefit data was available.   The IERR does not include the sanitation and
drainage component and the water supply schemes in the other townships. The
methodology for valuing time savings and economic costs of the project is the
same as that used in Sindh (paras. 28-30).
20.   S%nsLtLXLtYA-Jis.  A 202 increase in the cost of the relevant project
components reduces the rate of return from 13.1X to 9.41 while a 20X decrease
in the expected stream of benefits reduces the IERR to 8.7X
D. Project Justification for Sindh
21.   Pro1ect Qutputs.  The outputs of the project in Sindh are expected to be
community based systems for rural water supply and sanitation development and
operations and maintenance and strengthened sector institutions providing cost-
effective managerial and technical support to rural communities.
22.   Rationale for Investment.   Government investment in this sector has
achieved a very low level of coverage and has been unable to satisfy the growing
demand for basic services at the village level.   The low level of annual
allocation for rehabilitation of existing schemes, the lac': of skilled staff,
the inability to invite community participation in scheme implementation and
maintenance has led to a rapid deterioration of existing schemes.   It is
estimated that at least 451 percent of the schemes implemented by PHED in Sindh
require minor repairs, 13X medium works and 181 major works. The increase in
Lncomes in rural households is increasing demand for other basic services at the
village level. The improvements in the water supply and sanitation sector have
not kept pace with this growing demand due to the poor delivery capacity of
Government line agencies involved in this sector and because of the
underdeveloped nature of the private sector.  The overall coverage of water
supply in the sector in Sindh is only 461. Private sector investments in the
rural water supply and sanitation sector and its impact on coverage, service
levels, have been modest due to the low level of development of entrepreneurs.
23.   IDA assistance would enable the Government to achieve its targets, to help
line agencies consolidate past investments, to meet the growing level of demand,
to assist in the development of the private sector and to helt; in the
institutional reorganization both of the line agencies and the beneficiacies.
Without this investment, vital changes which need to be affected in the sector
for the long term sustainability of schemes would not be achieved.   The
reliability and efficiency of Government implemented schemes would remain at a
low level and people's lack of willingness to pay for the low level of service
provided by the Government would force an additional burden on the Government.
The overall efficiency of the schemes in this sector would, as a result, continue
to decline.

24.   Impact on Beneficiaries.  It is estimated that 46X of the rural population
in Sindh has basic water supply coverage, though a large portion of this coverage
does not meet the minimum standards of water quality and reasonable access. The
project would, together with the planned other ADP investments raise the water
supply coverage with a basic level of service and acceptable water quality to
about 75X of the population by 1998.
25.   Ouantifiable and Non-Ouantifiable Benefits.  The project in Sindh includes
both quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits.   The benefits which have
primarily been quantified are the time savings which have resulted from the
provision of more accessible water. The benefits from institutional development,
drainage and sanit tion have not quantified.
26.   A field survey with a sample of 150 households was conducted in 23 villages
to investigate the pattern of time allocation by rural women. The survey showed
an average time savings of 3.3 hours per day per household due to the provision
of improved water supplies. The average time saved in different physiographic
zones of Sindh varied form 1.5 hours in the sweet water areas to 5.8 hours in
the sandy desert zones. The survey results showed that the opportunity cost of
women's time in rural Sindh is Rs. 1.76 per hour. Another study of rural Sindh
women found that women earned Rs 1.4 an hour from embroidery and that the average
daily wage of female farm workers in Sindh was Rs. 9.20 1'.
27.   Rate of Return. The IERR for the investment in water supply schemes and
institutional development in Sindh is 17.1X. In quantifying benefits from water
supply schemes, the field survey data of average time savings of 3.3 hours per
household was used. The survey also indicated that about 27X of this time would
be devoted to cottage industry or agricultural activities. This is valued at
the market wage rate of Rs. 1.76 per hour. The remainder of the times is likely
to be consumed in household activities and increased leisure. As a conservative
measure, this time has been valued at one third of the market wage.
28.   Standard techniques for converting financial costs to economic costs were
used. All taxes and duties were excluded. Land was assumed to have a zero
opportunity cost as the water supply schemas are likely to be constructed on
idle land with no real alternate use. The shadow wage rate for unskilled labor
was assumed to be 602 of the market wage rate to reflect the unemployment and
underemployment in the Project area.
29.   The floating of the Rupee and the introduction of the Foreign Exchange
Bearer Certificates has effectively removed the restrictions on foreign exchange.
On the assumption that the exchange rate is likely to be very close to the shadow
price of exchange, imported materials have also been evaluated at market prices

net of all indirect taxes.  Annual costs and benefits of the project were
calculated for the entire investment, assuming an 20 year asset life. Physical
contingencies have been included in the economic analysis but price contingencies
excluded. Prices are expressed in terms of 1989 constant Rupees.
30.   Sensitivitv Analysis.  A 20X increase in the cost of the relevant project
components reduces the IERR from 17.1X to 13.2X while a 201 decrease in the
stream of benefits reduces the IERR to 12.41.
E. Overall Rate of Return of Proiect
31.   The overall IERR of the components with quantifiaole benefits is 14.3X.
It is 10.51 in AJK, 13.11 in Balochistan and 17.11 in Sindh.    The meaningful
qjantification of benefits and the IERR of investments in RWSS projects is
difficult. The IERR for the recent Bank-assisted Rural Electrification Project
in Pakistan was 9.81; the Punjab Urban Development Project (IDA Credit 1895-
Pak) in Lahore estimated the IERR on the incremental water and sewerage
investments to be 111. The IERRs for the projects in Sindh, Balochistan and
AJK are comparable and in some cases higher.  Altogether, the IERR for the
project as a whole is estimated at 14.3X as shown in Table 1.

extensive particularly during peak seasons (e.g. harvest time) and is

positively related to poverty. A recent survey of low-income households in
several rural districts showed an average of 50X of women aged 15 or older
involved in some form of market oriented work.
It is interesting to note that the participation rate in the secondary
labor force of women in inversely correlated with poverty. 161 for the bottom

Therefore, a very high proportion of the households in the lower quintiles do
not own land.
6.    Greater DeRendence of Poor Farm Families on Livestock Implying Greater
Need for Water
Livestock is often as important a productive asset as land among poor
households, providing power for farm operations like tilling and for
transportation of farm produce, and food (milk, meat() for the households.
Among farm households in Pakistan, some evidence exists that ownership of
livestock per acre decreases as farm size increases, reflecting the greater
dependence of small farms on livestock for their livelihood.
