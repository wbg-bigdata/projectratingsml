MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A RURAL RATER SUPPIU AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
*         credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 96.4 (US$136.7 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
International Development Association (IDA) terms, with 35 years maturity, and
help the Governments of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh finance the
provision of drinking water and sanitation for rural communities.
2.          Background. About 70X of Pakistan's population, currently estimated
at 106 million, lives in rural areas. The rural population in general, and rural
women in particular, are poor and deprived. Less than 40% have reasonable access
to clean drinking water, and less than 51 have safe means of sanitation; diarrhea
is the cause of death of over 300,000 children each year. Some 50X of rural
drinking water is obtained through individual private means, ,nostly handpumps;
the other half is from public sources. There is virtually no .,odern sanitation.
3.          Access  to  other  physical  and  social  infrastructure  remains
disproportionately low for the rural population. Rural housing quality is poor,
with people and animals crowded together in primitive conditions. Only 301 of
the rural compared to 701 of the urban population has access to electricity.
Coverage of health and education facAlities in rural areas is inadequate, and
illiteracy rates, particularly for females, are high. Even in areas served by
health facilities, utilization rates remain low because of the p.:'or quality of
service which in itself is a consequence of the shortage of funds.
4.          The task of improving basic social and infrastructure services for
the increased demand created by the rapidly growing population (currently about
2.51 p.a. in rural areas) is difficult and costly. The social sector agenda in
the Seventh Five-Year Plan calls for accelerating the pace of socio-economic
development and reducing rural/urban inequities, among other things through
improving rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS); this would serve as a
catalyst for improving the productivity and quality of life of the rural
population.   Government's determination to improve social conditions and in
particular RWSS is reflected in the level of resources allocated to the sector;
between 1983-84 and 1987-88, annual investment funding increased from 1.8X to
3.31 of the national Annual Development Program (ADP). Allocations are unlikely
to grow beyond this level due to resource constraints, and a revised strategy
involving greater self financing is required to meet the minimum targets for
basic services in rural areas.
5.          The recent Bank sector review (Report No. 7060-PAK) carried out
jointly with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) concluded that
for sustained RWSS development, sector policy would require that (a) the



beneficiary communityl/ participate at all stages of scheme implementation; (b)
an integrated development approach be adopted providing a balanced triad of
improvements to water supply, sanitation and hygiene practices; and (c) the
community be fully responsible for all costs of management, operations and
maintenance (06K) of RWSS schemes. The Federal and Provincial governments have
decided to adopt this policy, and have with CIDA assistance prepared province-
wide Strategic Investment Plans (SIPs) consistaing of investment programs and
specific mechanisms for implementing these policies.   The SIPs envisage
nationwide investment from 1991-1998 of about US$1.22 billion at constant 1989
prices which include the projected levels of domestic resource availability and
international donor assistance and would achieve an estimated 75X coverage of
rural water supply, providing for an additional 30 million people. Sanitation
coverage would increase from under 5X to about 10.
6.         Rationale for IDA Involvement.  During the past 15 years, IDA has
been a major source of support for Pakistan's urban infrastructure programs.
IDA has not supported RUSS to date, but our sector work has been instrumental
in defining the problems of providing rural water and sanitation services and
identifying a basic policy framework for improvement. During formulation of the
SIPs, IDA assisted government agencies in investment project preparation, and
in mobilizing funls from other donors. GOP has requested IDA assistance to
finance RWSS investments in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Balochistan and Sindh,
as these have the lower service levels and IDA support to these would generate
complementary donor support to the other provinces.  IDA's financial and
technical support for the project and continmed participation in a policy
dialogue are important, particularly in the formative years, to enable the
adoption of innovative and sustainable strategies.
7.          groject Objective. The proposed project is designed to improve rural
productivity and health, particularly of women and children, and reduce poverty
and deprivation in AJK, and the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh, by increasing
RUSS coverage and service levels.  The proposed project would suppol' an
integrated, community-based strategy for RUSS, phasing in a sustainable,
financially viable approach to community management and O&l, and progressively
moderate the required level of provincial recurrent budgetary support.
8.         Prolect Descriution. The proposed project would, over a nine year
period, finance an investment program in AJK, Balochistan and Sindh comprising
rehabilitation of existing and construction of new, cosmunity-managed, RUSS,
supported by a program of institutional strengthening, policy reform and
innovative resource mobilization measures whereby, in both project and non-
project financed schemes, beneficiary commnities would assume responsibility
for system management, Oil. The project would comprise the following components:
(a) construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, water supply and waste
water drainage schemes providing piped supplies to desiawnated points using low
cost technology at a basic service level; (b) institut1.onal strengthening and
The community could be a cluster of dwellings, family groups, settlements
or villages sapplied with water from a common source, and represented by
an agreed and recognizable entity, such as a village development committee,
a local leader, a headman, or an elected official.

training to enhance agency and community implementation and 0GM capacity; (c)
latrine construction materials with related health education and promotion; (d)
water resources and sanitation studies, and future investment program
preparation; and (e) a phased program of private sector support includirg
training of small contractors, pilot and flexible support to woluen's income
generating activities (comprising training, technical assistance and information
dissemination within communities), and technical guidance to handpump
manufacturers. Due to low rural income levels, there would be no recovery of
capital costs. OGM cost recovery would be accomplished by transferring system
management and recurrent cost financing to beneficiary communities, levying
direct charges in Balochistan townships, and levying earmarked indirect charges
in Sindh through land and sugar-cane cess enhancements, and surcharges on cotton
and paddy fees. This would introduce a degree of income distribution in favor
of landless beneficiaries. In AJK, the long-standing policy of community-based
O0M for RWSS would be maintained. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$194.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$40.9
million equivalent (211).   To expedite project start-up, US$11.2 million
equivalent (8% of the Credit amount) will be provided in the proposed Credit for
the retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for civil works, materials,
incremental staff, vehicles, equipment, consultancy services and training
incurred after appraisal and before Credit effectiveness. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 8345-PAK dated April 4, 1991 is attached.
9.         Agreed Actions.  GOP and the Governments of AJK, Balochistan and
Sindh have agreed to the following actions: (a) AJK would maintain a policy, and
Sindh and Balochistan would each, with effect from July 1, 1991, apply a policy,
satisfactory to IDA, of (i) providing grants from government resources to finance
a proportion of the capital cost of communal facilities only under RWSS schemes,
and (ii) requiring management and financial responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of completed RWSS schemes to be assumed by the communities served
by such schemes; (b) project implementation would be carried out in accordance
with an Operational Action Plan (OAP) satisfactory to IDA, which would be
reviewed anrually and updated in consultation with IDA; (c) a memorandum of
understanding would be entered into for agreement between each community and the
concerned sector agency whereby for a basic level of service the community agrees
to undertake and pay for management and &M, and the Provincial/State government
agrees to provide: (i) construction materials (AJK); (ii) the system
(Balochistan); and (iii) the system and a contribution of cess and fee revenues
to cover 0&M costs (Sindh); (d) in order to enhance inter-governmental
coordination and long term sector development, a Policy Investment Review
Committee (PIRC) has been created within the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development (MILGRD); (e) terms and conditions of funds flow, counterpart
financing, and the passing on of funds would be acceptable to IDA, and
counterpart funds would be available; (f) land acquisition procedures are
underway; and (g) standard requirements would be met for: project executing
agencies to remain adequately staffed throughout project implementation; progress
reports on the project; satisfactory basic accounting arrangements to be in place
and arrangements for annual audits; administration of the Special Accounts; use



- 4 .
of Statements of Expenditure; preparation of a mid-term review; preparation of
a Projbct Completion Report; and the use of IDA Procurement Guidelines and
satisfactory Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures.
10.   GOP and the Governments of AJK, Balochistan and Sindh have completed the
following, pursuant to the policy referred to in para. 9(a) above: (a)
instructions have been given to line departments that (except in the case of
Balochistan rural township schemes discussed below) OH responsibilities would
be transferred to, or remain with, scheme beneficiaries, according t-; a timetable
set out in the OAP; (b) arrangements have been made: (i) to pay all Public Health
Engineering Department's (PHED's) outstanding dues in respect of electricity for
water supply schemes (Balochistan .-nd Sindh); and (ii) to avoid public sector
RWSS power liabilities in future; (c) for the province of Balochistan,
arrangements have been made to increase all township water tariffs to Rs. 50 per
month for standard house connections and Rs. 250 per month for commercial/
industrial connections effective July 1, 1990, and to revise such tariffs at
least triennially by an amount equivalent to at least an ennual real increase
of 5%; and (d) for the Province of Sindh, arrangements have been made to levy
an incremental annual cess on cultivated land of Rs. 1.50 per acre for non-
irrigated land, Rs. 3.00 per acre for land with non-perennial irrigation and
Rs. 6.40 per acre for land with perennial irrigation, effective November 29,
1990, to incree-e from late February 1991 the sugar-cane cess and paddy and
cotton fees, an to revise such cess and fee rates at least triennially and to
set them to recover all estimated O&K costs for a basic level of service. The
proposed arrangements have been tailored to the specific affordability
constraints of the beneficiaries.
11.         The agreed conditions of effectiveness of the IDA Credit are: (i)
approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) of
the project PC-1 documents; and (ii) appointment, subject to credit
effectivtness, of the main technical assistance Advisory Consultants.
12.         Benefits.  The prine   1 beneficiaries would be rural women and
children.  The quantifiable benef    of the proposed project would be the value
of time savings arising from better access to improved water supplies. Time and
energy saved in water collecti.-  would be spent on productive activities
including improved child care. By improving hygiene practices and sanitation,
the project would also yield substantial health benefits, reducing disease and
infant mortality. Benefits which ar-. not quantifiable would be derived from the
overall improvements in rural productivity and the quality of life. The internal
economic rate of return of the proposed Project is about 14X p.a. based on a
conservative valuation of the incremental time savings.
13.         links. The technical aspects of the project are straightforward and
do not present significant risk.  The main project risks are: (a) that the
requirement for the communities to accept responsibility for and finance the
O&M of schemes may be slow to materialize; (b) the limited experience of
Government line agencies in working directly with villagers, and the need for
continual community orientation; (c) the possible slow release of funcs by the
governments due to the dispersed nature of the investments; (d) the shortage of
qualified government staff to undertake work on individual projects to implement
an expanded RWSS program; and (e) the limited ability of the respective agencies



to achieve cost recovery targets. In addition, the project would be the Bank
Group's first lending operation with the concerned agencies, implying possible
start-up delays as agencies become familiar with Bank lending procedures. The
project addresses these risks by providing the following measures and resources:
(a) emphasis on management, technical support and training for all implementing
agencies; (b) training for politicians, community leaders and scheme personnel;
(c) community relations cells within the executing agencies; (ct) hygiene
education programs; (e) advance consultancy services for priority designs,
materials specifications and documentation to maintain project momentum; (f)
assistance to agencies in procurement procedures; (g) financial management
support; and (h) use of community agreements, which are to be in place before
implementing schemes. Further, that the community-based policy for O&M is firmly
established and effective in AJK, demonstrates that with appropriate monitoring,
guidance and political will, the adoption of the proposed O&M policies under the
project does not pose an unreasonable risk.
14.         Part of the proposed project (less than 25X in total) would be
carried out in AJK, an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute
since 1947. By including finance for this component in the proposed Credit, IDA
does not intend thereby to prejudice the determination of the claims of the
parties.
15.         Recommendatlon. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
