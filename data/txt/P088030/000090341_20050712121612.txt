A.       STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.       Country and Sector Issues

In 2000 Guyana embarked on a major and comprehensive reform program for the water and
sanitation sector. Reforms were initiated by the Government with the assistance of the donor
community under the leadership of DfID and IDA, with the goal of providing sustainable
universal access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana.                      Reforms
implemented to date have facilitated a complete reorganization of the water and sanitation
sector around three key principles: (i)       a modem, efficient and customer-oriented utility; (ii)
long-term financial sustainability; and (iii)a govemance and institutional framework
characterized by independent regulatory functions and a clear division of responsibilities.

Key achievements of the reform program to date include: (i)            a modem legal, regulatory and
institutional framework under the Water and Sewerage Act of 2002; (ii)the creation of
Guyana Water Inc (GWI) inMay 2002 through the merger of the two water utilities, GS&WC
and GUYWA; (iii)the award of a performance-based management contract (MC) for five
years to an international operator, which started operations in January 2003; and (iv) the
elaboration of a ten year investment program. Sevem Trent Water International (STWI) i s
currently managing GWI and working to implement the investment program that will deliver
the coverage and quality targets outlined in the MC. However, despite the significant
achievements of the Govemment's reforms to date, the full benefits of the measures
undertaken and the efficiency gains derived from the management contract will take some
time to be achieved. The sector still faces major challenges towards improvingperformance:

Financial Sustainabilitv:       A key goal for the reform process is to achieve financial
sustainability in the medium-term through the implementation of a tariff review mechanism to
set tariffs at cost recovery levels and eliminate operating subsidies from the Government. A
study undertaken by KPMG in 2000 concluded that this would be achievable by 2004.
However, in 2004 the utility was still far from achieving recovery of O&M costs with annual'
operating income o f US$ 10.6 million and operating expenses - excluding depreciation - of
US$ 11.6 million. The Government has therefore had to extend the operating subsidies,
transferring to GWI over US$7.5 million in the last 2 years. From a cash-flow perspective,
the current gap between collected revenues and operating payments is approximately US$4.7
million. The achievement of cost recovery i s been negatively affected by a combination of
the following:

     Electricity costs: The significant rise in electricity prices since 2003 (approximately
     16%) - which had not been factored into the KPMG work - has had an impact of
     approximately US$ 1million extra cost. Electricity costs accounted in 2004 for around
     65% of GWI's total operating expenditures. Total revenue collected in 2004 - around
     US$ 6.3 million    -  was not enough to pay the electricity bill o f US$ 7.5 million. The
     current cost o f electricity in Guyana of US$ 0.25/kWh is double the typical world
     averages and it constitutes a real challenge for further costs savings to transpire in
     improvements o f the financial situation o f GWI.

     Insuficient tariff levels: After a March 2003 increase of around 40%, there has been no
     increasein tariff levels during 2004 and 2005 due to Govemment affordability and social
     acceptability concerns and the desire to accompany tariff adjustments with significant
     improvements in the levels of service. As a result, the second 40% part of the 2-stage

  datedMay 2005, available in the Project Files.


                                                      1

    80% tariff increase recommended by KPMG in 2002 was never implemented, which has
    had an impact of aroundUS$2.5 millioninreducedrevenues.

    Modest revenue growth: In the first year of the MC, GWI has shown a slower than
    anticipated rate of improvement in billings and collections due to an inherited
    malfunctioning billing system, low metering rates causedby delays in funding, household
    rateable value problems and low sewerage tariffs. These factors have prevented all the
    revenuesprojectedby KMPG from being realized - the estimated difference being around
    US$0.5 million.

A combinedplan to increase GWI revenues and reducecosts is being implemented. First,the
Govemment has committed to GWI preparing a Tariff & Revenue Study for submission to
the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)' in 2005 which is now underway. The study will
develop a series o f options combining targeted subsidies to the sector and review of current
tariff structure for consideration of the PUC and the Govemment. The objective i s to enable
coverage of GWI's operations & maintenance costs by end 2005, and operations, maintenance
& depreciation costs by end 2006. Ifas a result billings increase by 30%, income would rise
by some US$ 1.8 million at current collection rates. Second, collection performance is
expected to improve in line with the achievement of the contract target. Preliminary figures
on collection rates for 2004 seem to indicate that the 2004 target of 76% would have been
met. Inmoving towards the 2007 target of 90% collection rate, an improvement of about 5%
per year i s required. In real terms this means an increased collection of about US$ 0.5
million/year3.    m,the         reduction in non-revenue water figures by 10% i s expected to save
GWI US$ 1.5 million in 2005. As NRW comes down in line with the contract targets very
significant savings can be envisaged - around US$3 million.This i s the key area to close the
gap between revenue and costs. However, it will require time and investment in the repair
and rehabilitation o f the distribution network. In the meantime, the Government will have to
extend its commitments of transfers to the sector. The analysis shows that the subsidies could
be completely eliminated by the end of 2006 if a tariff restructuring takes place and the
leakage reduction strategy and energy managementplan are implemented.

Low coverage rates and Door service levels: The quality and coverage of water supply
services in Guyana are poor. Major problems with the safety, continuity and reliability of
supply persist both along the coastal strip and in the severely under-serviced Hinterland
region. Source water treatment in some GWI areas is non-existent resulting in a high risk of
bacteriological contamination. Most parts of the serviced areas - both in Georgetown and
outside the capital     - experience low water pressure and intermittent supply. In spite of an
increase in coverage figures in recent years - with a near doubling of households connected to
piped water between 2000 and 20034         - coverage    levels remain deficient. Approximately 45.1
percent of the population had access to treated water in2003. There is also a needto continue
with ongoing improvements in the operations, management and levels of service. At the end
of 2004, continuity of acceptable service was estimated on a composite basis as 4.3 hours of
service per day, non-revenue water was estimated at a 50% of total water production in 2004,
and metering coverage was recorded at 24 percent.

High investment needs and limited funding: GWI, under STWI management, has developed
a Ten Year Investment Program (TYDP) as part of the May 2005 GWI Strategic Plan. The
TYDP builds upon the original ten year investment program developed in 2000 by KPMG.
The current TYDP reflects changes in the sequencing and content of sub-programs based on

  The commencementof this study was arequirementfor effectiveness of the IDB loan.
  This representsonly about 11%of the current shortfall andthe balancewill have to be foundfrom other sources.
  However, increased collections as it approaches 90% will be an increasingly important component of the
  solution to the cost recovery issue.

capital investment, the changing operational context, available assumptions and predictions
andmostrecent knowledgeof GWI.

The GWI TYDP outlines a comprehensive investment program required to substantially
improveaccess to safe and reliable water. GWI's planned investmentprogram (2005-2014)5
amounts to over US$ 170 million, of which US$ 52 million have been secured from the
internationalcommunity. In the immediate3-year period2005-2007, the investmentprogram
i s estimated at US$ 74 million of which the US$& millionhas been secured when including
this proposed IDA Grant. GWI is currently engaged with other donors to secure a further
US$ 18 million in investments during this periodleavingan estimatedfinancing gap of US$
11million,or approximately 15%of the medium-terminvestmentprogram.

Ensuring continued and consistent funding for the capital expenditure program and working
capital will be essentialfor GWI to enhance operational efficiency and meet License targets.
Despite initial delays in accessing donor resources, progress has been made. The IDB
GeorgetownProgramI1hasbegundisbursementsandGWIandthe Governmentare exploring
the possibility of obtaining further investment resources from the global EU Water Facility
andthe CDB as well as throughbilateralarrangements.

Management Contract: The 5-year performance-basedManagement Contract (MC) for GWI
initiated in January 2003 is a centerpiece of the Government's sector strategy to improve
service levels, increase efficiency and achieve financial sustainability. Although GWI
performancehas beenbelow targeted levels under the MC in 2004, considerableprogresshas
been made against the performance targets for non-revenuewater and collectionefficiency,
and there is now in place a well defined strategy to improve customer relation and
commercial services and maximize revenues through improvedbilling and collections. The
improvement in GWI's performance has been slower than expected also due to: (i) mixed
 initialperformanceby the managementcontractor, in part due to perceived security problems
 during the first year of operations; and (ii) a need for improvement of the governance
 framework for GWIto establishclear divisionof responsibilitiesbetweenthe Board andGWI
 management - which has been addressed through the recent review of Board policies and
 procedures. These issues were, in particular during the first year of the MC, a source of
 friction betweenthe Government, GWIBoardandthe privateoperator.

 InDecember2004, the Govemment invitedSTWI to holda series of meetingunderthe theme
 "GWI- Moving Forward" to gain a better mutual understanding of contract issues. The
 Govemment, the Board of GWI, STWI and the donor community participated in these
 discussions where the commitment of both the Government and the operator to making the
 MC a success was clearly stated. The main outcome was the signature of a memorandumof
 understanding with a concrete set of actions to be implemented during 2005 to deliver
 immediateimprovements in the performanceof GWI. The agreedupon Action Plan focused
 on 10 key issues and was incorporated in a Roadmap to Success document which has been
 updated in April to reflect progress to date and outstandingactions. The Roadmapprovides
 an important and promising framework for collaboration in the sector amongst all
 stakeholders. The Roadmapprocesshasresultedinfive principalachievements:

      Production of RevisedFinal Strategic Plan for GWf, outlining GWI's corporate strategy
      for 2005 to 2008, and within that, setting out the path to financial sustainability and
      improved levels of service. The Strategic Plan sets out GWI's vision, the business
      objectives and outlines the actions, resources, finance and planningactions required to
      achieveGWIstrategic goals andobjectivesfor 2005-2008.

A series of outstanding measureswill berequiredto consolidate these advances inthe ensuing
months. The Govemment anticipates that, with continuing commitment to agreements in the
Roadmap, significant improvements in performance of the water sector will be possible
within a six monthperiod. See Annex 1for further details on the Action Plan included in the
Roadmap to Success document.

Institutional and Regulatorv Framework: Considerable progress has already been made
towards implementing key institutional and regulatory reforms associated with the program.
In the short-term the Govemment will nonetheless need to focus attention on a few key
pending institutional reform issues. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) established as an
independent regulatory body for the sector requires capacity strengthening to perform its
functions, and the Govemment is behind schedule in implementing the 2004 tariff review as
specified in the reform program. The National Water Council i s yet to be operational. DfID
i s supporting a capacity building program for the PUC which i s currently being implemented
with Technical assistance from the consulting firm Castalia. Castalia has been working with
the PUC for the last year towards achieving a sustainable regulatory framework in Guyana
and helpingthe PUC to become an independent and strong regulator.

Based upon the success o f the recently completed IDA-financed Water Supply and
Rehabilitation Project, its impact on poverty alleviation, the need for further financing, and
the effective dialogue IDA has had in sector policy in recent years, there is a unique
opportunity for a follow-up water investment operation that will support the Govemment in
consolidating the reforms undertaken. The proposed IDA Grant would play an important role
in helping Guyana achieve the Millennium Development Goals, while ensuring that the
reforms undertaken to date are continued. In this respect, the proposed operation, although
limited, i s both timely and sound and its impact will be maximized through complementing
available funding from GWI's internally generated resources, the Govemment, and from
other donors, to achieve a financially sustainable sector for the long term.

2.       EmergencyComponent

Beginning in late December 2004, unusually heavy rainfall in Guyana resulted in severe
flooding within the coastal administrative regions of West DemeraraEssequibo Islands,
Demeraraahaica, and MahaicaNest Berbice.                   These areas comprise 75 percent of
Guyana's population and include the capital city, Georgetown. Flooding was severe in the
onset and resulted from the saturation of upper watershed soils and the poor performance of
the national drainage systems distributed within the coastal irrigation districts.     Serious
flooding began on January 15 reaching its peak around January 17, corresponding with'the
January spring (lunar high) tide. Rains continued until the first week of February 2005,
causing floodwaters to reach a height of four to five feet in villages near the East Demerara
conservancy. As of January 25, the Govemment of Guyana's Joint Operations Center
(GOG/JOC) reported close to 200,000 residents directly affected by the floods.

Regardingthe Water Sector, the flooding along the coast, between the Demeraraand Mahaica
rivers, has seriously inhibitedGWI's ability to supply potable water (approximately 164,000
people affected) and to dispose of wastewater in the affected areas. The principal water


                                                   4

treatment plant in Georgetown i s now operational, but due to breakdowns the plant is not run
at full efficiency. The overall impact has been minimized due to an efficient response by
GWI. Emergency arrangements to provide drinking water to the affected population were
well managed and effective. In coordination with the military, drinking water in bags was
effectively distributed to affected areas only accessible by boats. Tanks with safe water were
set up in places accessible by road and a large team from GWI was sent out to the affected
areas to monitor the distribution o f water and assist the community.

The floods have caused some damage to water distribution infrastructure in the affected areas
on the East Coast, in particular to service connections - of which thousands are in need of
replacement - water treatment plants and pumping stations. The floods have also damaged
the wastewater pumping stations that are required to enable GWI to provide wastewater
disposal service to approximately 11,500 customers in Georgetown. At present 15 of the 24
wastewater stations are in operation. However, it should be noted that immediately following
the main flooding event, only one o f the 24 stations remained operational and emergency
repairs using spare parts from stores have beenundertaken to rectify this situation. Since then,
further breakdowns have occurred, at a rate of 9 per month on average, and more than 50
repairs have been executed.

The situation has exposed vulnerabilities in GWI's emergency responsecapability. Although
on this occasion GWI's responsehas been effective and well managed, ithas had to rely upon
the borrowing or hiring of tanks and equipment, particularly transport, from other public
entities and the private sector. There is a need to strengthen GWI's response capacity if the
utility i s to be as effective in future emergency events.

Immediately after the flooding occurred, IDA responded by sending a team specialized in
disaster management to conduct a preliminary needs assessment in February 2005. At the
request of the Government of Guyana, IDA is responding to these events through the
incorporation of an emergency recovery component to the proposed Water Sector
Consolidation Project in the amount of US$1.1million.

3.         Rationale for IDA Involvement

Linkage to the PRSP. CAS and ongoing sector dialogue:                  The Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlines a reform agenda stemming out of an extensive
consultative process which involved discussions at the local, regional and national levels. The
PRSP consultations identified increasing access to safe water and sanitation services to the
poor and improvingthe institutional framework in the sector as key priorities. Consequently,
 sector reform and the needed investments in infrastructure to support better services and
 increased access to safe water and sanitation were included as core goals in the PRSP seven
 pillar approach to reducing poverty. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) focused IDA'S
 assistance to Guyana for FY03 4 3 0 5 on the implementation o f the PRSP reform agenda
 through a series of planned Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), accompanied by a
 Public Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC).

 In 2000, the Government initiated a major and comprehensive reform program for the water
 and sanitation sector. At the time of the preparation of the 2002 CAS, IDA was actively
 engaged in the reform process and policy dialogue through the restructuring of its Water
 Supply TA and Rehabilitation Project Cr. 2559-GUA' and its participation as a member of
                                            -
 'T h i s Project was closed in March 2004. The ICR for this project was completed in September 2004
 and has beenrated as exemplary by OED. The outcome of the Project was rated as satisfactoryand the
 institutional development as substantial. The component for squatter areas has been considered
 particularly successful in the ICR. This component, executed in coordination with DFID (which
 financed the design in coordination with IDA-financing of works), has brought piped water supply to

the GovemmenVDonors Steering Group (now Water Thematic Group). In 2004, in
conjunction with the sector policy support provided by IDA under the three planned PRSCs,
the Government requested the resumption of investment support to fund its long term
investment program to achieve universal and sustainable access to safe water for the
population o f Guyana. The proposed operation would support the consolidation of progress
and reforms made to-date, contribute to fillin the existing funding gap to address sector needs
and increase access to safe water for the poor. The proposed Grant will play an important role
in helping Guyana achieve the Millennium Development Goals outlined in the PRSP. In this
respect, the proposed operation, although limited, i s both timely and sound and its impact will
be maximized through complementing available funding from GWI's intemally generated
resources, the Government, and from other donors, to achieve a financially sustainable sector
for the long term.

IDA's technical leadership: IDA's broad international experience in private sector
participation in the water and sanitation sector and in the design o f institutional regimes for
infrastructure service provision will enable it to respond quickly to the Government's need for
advisory support to facilitate the successful development o f the Management Contract.

Response to the Januarv 2005 Emergencv:                 Lastly, in the aftermath of the emergency
situation, IDA responded to the Govemment's request for IDA's assistance by mobilizing a
specialized team to conduct a preliminary needs assessment. Following this assessment, it
was concluded that addressing the needs in the water sector through the proposed Project is
the most timely and effective manner for IDA to support the Government in its reconstruction
efforts. The proposed operation is funded with IDA 14 resources and does not involve
diversion of resourcesfrom other operations.

4.       Higher Level Project Objectives

 The Project will contribute to the following three key higher-levelobjectives:

 Achievement of MDG and PRSP targets: The Project will support the Government of
 Guyana in reaching the MDG goals and its Poverty Reduction Strategy targets by extending
 access to safe' water to 48,000 people.

 Health and environmental improvements: The Project i s expected to bring health benefits to
 over 48,000 people by a reduction in morbidity and mortality related to water quality through
 the proper treatment of drinking water and management of wastewater. Immediate health
 improvements (which would especially benefit children who are often particularly susceptible
 to water-bome diseases) would include reductions in gastrointestinal illnesses, cholera,
 typhoid andhepatitis, among others.

 Povem Reduction:         The Project would positively impact poor households that are now
 boiling or purchasing water from vendors (amongst other coping strategies). The percentage
 of people in Guyana living below the poverty threshold i s currently 33.1%'           The Project
 targets largely rural and peri-urban communities with a disproportionate number of poor
 residents.

  approximately 20 squatter lots (26,000 people). This component also resulted in a change in
 Government policy reducing connections fees to dramatically improve the access to the services for
  poorer communities. In addition, the Project supported the rehabilitationof the Eccles and Bartica
  water systems and the start up of GWI's operations.

B.       PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.       LendingInstrument

The proposed operation would be structured as a Specific Investment Grant. The Grant will
finance three well-defined investment operations in three different areas of the country (a pre-
identified numberof urban and peri-urban areas inDivisions 1,2 and4 of GWIcorresponding
with regions 2, 3 and 5 of Guyana) that have been assessed during Project Preparation. The
investments will be accompanied by a design, uroiect management and supervision
component for the effective execution and supervision o f Project implementation and
monitoring of performance indicators and an institutional strengthening component aimed at
building the necessary capacity within GWI. Lastly, the Grant will finance an emergency
component to support the Govemment in its reconstruction efforts after the January 2005
floods.


2.        ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandKey Indicators

The Project development objective is to support the achievement of sustainable universal
access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially the poor. This
Project will also help to consolidate the water sector modernization and reform process
undertaken by the Govemment with support from IDA and other donors in recent years.
Specifically, the Project will:

     Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of
     treatment facilities" in the coastal water supply systems in divisions 1,2 and 4.
     Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already connected
     to the service.
     Provide the technical assistance needed to enable the modernization and financial
     sustainability of GWI and allow for the sustainable development of water resources in
     Guyana.
     Through the emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after the
     January 2005 floods.

          ProjectComponents

 Project components. The Project will support the Government's Program through a Specific
 Investment Grant to be implemented by GWI." The Grant will finance a capital investment
 component for the construction and rehabilitation of three water supply infrastructure
 subprojects, each within an operating division o f GWI, and the corresponding design, project
 management and supervision activities.           The Project will also finance an institutional
 strengthening component and an emergency component to support reconstruction needs after
 the January 21305 floods.

 GWI will have overall technical responsibility for project implementation (including
 procurement).      Table 1 below summarizes the four components included in the overall

        million, includingUS$3.3 million of IDA financing).
   .    Parika Areal3Water Supply System in Division 2 of GWI (Region 3) (US$ 3.7 million,
        including US$ 3.3 million of IDA financing).
        Rosignol Areal4 Water Supply System in Division 4 (Region 5) of GWI (US$ 2.8
        million, includingUS$2.5 million of IDA financing).

Inall three cases, the Project will finance the following infrastructure works:

        Upgrading of raw water source works to secure supplies from the groundwater aquifer;
        Installation o f water treatment facilities for the reduction of iron content in the water
        delivered into the supply systems, thus enabling the effective operation of the
        associated disinfection systems and the delivery of safe water to customer beneficiaries;
        Upgrading of the water transmission system to enable continuous supply to customers
        at minimum 10psi (7m) pressure;
        Rehabilitation o f the distribution systems, with targeted pipeline and service connection
        replacement and installation of 100%customer metering; and
        Purchaseo f necessary spare parts for mechanical and electrical equipment.

Each of the three subprojects relate to predominantly peri-urban and rural areas of the coastal
strip. A detailed feasibility study has beencompleted by GWIfor each of these subprojects to
ensure their soundness from an engineering and design standpoint and the least cost solution
adopted among different alternative options. These feasibility studies can be found in the
Project files.

Sanitation Facilities: With regards to sanitation arrangements, the three subproject areas
rely on on-site sanitation facilities - pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site facilities are an
appropriate means o f sanitation in these less densely populated areas, if they are properly
constructed, operated and maintained, and conclusions reached by the analytical work
undertaken so far indicate that it would not be cost effective or affordable to put in full
sewerage systems in these areas.15 Existing data would confirm that there i s no risk to the
groundwater from the use of pit latrines and improvements to these would be the most cost
effective way forward.I6 Funding to carry out these improvements is contemplated under the
line "Sanitation Improvements" of DflD's overall sector investment program. Further details
on existing sanitation and wastewater facilities can be found in Annex 4.

Component 2: Design, Proiect Management. and Supervision (US$ 0.9 million including
US$ 0.8 million of IDA financing): The component will finance staff, consultant services
and equipment to strengthen the capacity of GWI and its Asset Development Team to
execute, supervise and monitor the results of the Project. Activities to be financed under this
Component include:

             Specialized consultants and staff to work on the Asset Development Team underthe
             integrated management of GWI;
     .       Detailedproject design and construction supervision through independent supervision
             consultants;
             Information technology equipment:
             Technical assistance and trainingto the ADT and GWIfor Project implementation,
             monitoring and financial management;
             Other operating expenses for the ADT includingoffice supplies, etc.; and
             A baseline and after- Project analysis will becarriedout to measureimprovements in
             levels of service, customer satisfaction, health and other benefits to be derived from the
             investments.

 Component 3: Institutional Strenathenina Component (US$ 0.30 million including US$
 0.27 million of IDA financing): The component will finance a technical assistance
 architecture around the Management Contract to bring the needed specialized skills and
 expertise to support GWI and its Board to turn GWIinto a modem and efficient utility." This
 component would finance activities to strengthen and bring the utility to reasonable levels of
 management, operational efficiency and financial viability, banking on the private operator's
 experience to achieve these. Capacity building will be provided through targeted technical
 assistanceby consultants hiredby GWI for specific tasks not envisaged at the inceptionof the
 M C but which are very much needed for the effective transfer of know-how from the private
 operator to GWI and the efficient operation o f the company (training for Board members and
 GWI staff, tariff studies, energy management specialists, IT specialists, etc.). Consulting
 firms or individual consultants will be hired by GWI to support the provision of these
 technical assistance inputs. Given the potential for energy savings in Guyana discussed in

Comnonent 4: Emereency Comnonent (US$ 1.1 million, 100% IDA financed given the
emergency nature of the intervention). In January 2005, flooding along the East Coast and
West Coast of Demerara and in Georgetown seriously affected GWI's ability to supply
potable water to approximately 164,000 affected consumers and to dispose of wastewater in
affectedareas. Some of the water treatment plants, pumpingstations (water and wastewater),
and distributionsystems were damagedand are in need of rehabilitation to recover to normal
operation status. Under this Component, the Project will also finance minor capital works
targeted at the distribution systems and small equipment repairs and replacements, household
connection replacements, and other minor investments. A more detailed description of this
component canbe found inAnnex 4.

4.       Community Consultations

Community consultations in the proposed project areas were conducted during Project
preparation to assess levels of satisfaction and demand for the Project amongst potential
beneficiaries. Focus group discussions in the Parika,Rosignoland Anna Reginaproject areas
were first conducted inFebruary 2004 andlater complementedby a rapidsample survey of 63
potential beneficiary households in February and March 2005.                       These consultations
demonstrateda high level of demandfor improvedquality and enhancedregularity of service.
Consumers confirmed that they lacked access to safe water, noting that water quality from
existing pipedconnections was sub-standard, rusty and unsuitable for domestic consumption.
Consequently, a large percentage of consumers supplementedpiped water supply by storing
rainwaterandpurchasingsafe water inbottlesor from tankers.

Consumers also observed that water supply remained highly irregular with an approximate
average of daily water supply at less than 12 hours with poor pressure and frequent
interruptions. Few consumers rated the quality of GWI water supply services as good or
standard and a significant number suggest that GWI service i s poor. During community
consultations a vast majority of consumers maintained that they were willing to pay for
improved and regular access to safe drinking water. The Project aims to integrate these
findings into the overall design by supporting integrated investments into discrete systems
that would improvethe quality and regularity of water supply services.

5.       Lessons Learned

Project design incorporates the lessons learnt from the implementation of the recently
completed IDA project in the country, the Guyana Water Supply Technical Assistance &
RehabilitationProjectIgand IDA'Sregional and global experience with the preparationand
implementation of urban and rural water supply projects that involve private sector
participationin politicized andeconomicallystressedenvironments. Additionally, the Project
design reflects consumer demand and preferences as assessed through a series of community
consultations and informal survey conducted in 2004 and 2005. The Project also reflects
important lessons from Output-to-PurposeReviews (OPR) conducted by DfID in November
2003 and2004. The following are the most relevantlessonslearnedthat havebeen applied in
the preparationof this Project:

.Capacity Building. The ability to effectively implement proposed investments under the
 Project will depend considerably upon the overall management capacity of GWI. An
 Asset Development Team (ADT) has been established within GWI to lead medium-term
 investment planning and the execution o f an integrated investment program. It i s critical
 to build the appropriate capacity within the ADT - including proper staffing, systems and
 training. An emphasis on staffing ADT with competent professionals that are trained and
 retained over time i s essential given recent pattems of high staff turnover within GWI.
.The proposed operation will support the strengthening and staffing o f the ADT.

 Adecluate technolow and need for amrouriate design standards. Past projects in the
 sector have often failed to achieve a balance between optimal and context-specific
 appropriate technical solutions. As a result, projects supported excessive automation and
 the use o f sophisticated equipment that may not have been the most appropriate solution
 for the level o f capacity in the country.      IDA has learned that, given the existing
 environment in Guyana, future operations must emphasize more cost-effective and easier
 to maintain treatment solutions. Additionally, overestimation and over-dimensioning of
 investments can result in cost overruns for projects.         The proposed operation has
 developed minimum cost and adequate technology designs while ensuring that
 environmental protections are in place. This approach will likely enable the Govemment
.to meet project objectives and minimize the risk of over-design in the proposedproject.

 Flexibility in Proiect design and apmopriate conditionalities and targets. Recent donor
 programs in Guyana have experienced long delays in initiation and implementationdue to
 the design o f complex project conditionalities, objectives and indicators that fail to reflect
 real and changing sector conditions. It is critical that future initiatives employ realistic
 and achievable targets and requirements that are in harmony with existing arrangements
 in the sector. The proposed IDA Grant builds on these lessons and to a large degree
 replicates the targets and indicators established under the M C to enable a convergence
.around core sector goals.

 Donor Coordination. The need for donor coordination has proven particularly important
 in Guyana where GWI's investment program would almost entirely be financed by a
 multi-donor program. During the restructuring of the last IDA project it was noted that
 the lack of donor coordination was having an adverse impact on sector performance due
 to uncoordinated standards, overlapping investments and a lack of coherent strategy. The
 Donor/Govemment Steering Group was subsequently established to facilitate greater
  donor coordination. The group later evolved into the Water Thematic Group (WTG),
  which i s being used by the Govemment as a model for coordination in other sectors.
 DuringProject preparation IDA participated actively in the regular WTG meetings and
  worked closely with other donors to avoid the development of stand-alone, isolated
  projects and ensure that all sector financing fits within a framework that enhances
  efficiency. A key achievement during project preparation has been donor agreement on
  common financial management, reporting and monitoring procedures and the use of the
  ADT inGWIto implement all donor-financed projects so as to avoid the use of individual
  project implementation units.

  Consumer Responsiveness and Education. A broad body o f knowledge in the water and
  sanitation sector clearly demonstrates the importance o f closely monitoring levels of
  consumer satisfaction with service provision as a means to better target investments and
  focus rehabilitation efforts. Additionally, it i s also well established that involving and
  educating consumers on the management of water and sanitation services should be a
  critical component of any utility's demand management strategy. The proposed project
  will support a before and after impact assessment, and activities to cover the ongoing
  assessments o f consumer satisfaction and an information and education service in target
  communities.

6.        AlternativesConsideredand Reasonsfor Rejection

The need for capital investments in the water and sanitation sector in Guyana is extensive. In
consultation with the Government, it was agreed that potential investment alternatives would
be evaluated with respect to the following criteria: (a) increase in access to safe water for the
poor and middle-income consumers; (b) sustainability; (c) reduction in operating costs; (d)
linkages to complementary and future investments; and (e) readiness to implement. The
proposed project design was selected after a careful consideration of a range of altemative
investment approaches for the IDA intervention. The selected intervention targets densely
populated low and middle-income coastal settlements currently without access to safe water.
It i s also anticipated that these areas are due to grow considerably in the ensuing years as
further low and middle-income housing settlements are planned along the proposed
distribution network.        The Project - through new investments in treatment facilities,
transmission mains, metering and the rehabilitation of the distribution system - will
considerably reduce total GWIoperating costs.

Altematives considered included:

0)     The provision of water and sanitation services in squatter and informal settlements
       would meet a source of existing demand and target a high concentration of poor
       residents. In order to intervene in these settlements, however, it was determined that a
       series of complementary infrastructure and basic services would be required including
       flood protection, sanitation, connection to sewerage systems, roads, drainage and basic
        social services. While viable, this investment option was rejected considering the
       limited envelope for IDA financing. Additionally, the Ministry of Housing and Water
        i s developing a low-housing development program that partially meets the demand for
        integrated housing and complementary infrastructure service provision for these
        settlements.

 (ii)AllocatinginvestmentresourcestorehabilitatedistributionsystemsthroughouttheGWI
        network would have the effect of marginally improving the quality and regularity of
        service for a large number o f consumers. However, this investment would not have the
        important benefit o f increasing access to safe water.               Additionally, system wide
        rehabilitation also would not strengthen critically important demand management
        capacity.     The Project will, nonetheless, support critical system wide rehabilitation
        efforts.

 (iii)Investing in suecific water suuplv and sanitation infrastructure for Hinterland
        communities was a third investment option under consideration.               Access to water and
        sanitation in the Hinterlandi s critically needed and would effectively target the poor.
        This altemative was rejected for the proposed IDA operation, however, because of a
        parallel commitment by DfID to support the Hinterland component of GWI's
        investment program.

 C.        IMPLEMENTATION

 1.        PartnershipArrangements

 Although the proposed SIC would be entirely financed by IDA, several aspects of Project
 implementation will be executed in close coordination with other donors active in the country,
 in particular DfJD and the IDB.20 During project preparation IDA was able to coordinate
 closely with other donors through the WTG. The Group, coordinated by DfID, has met


 2o Other donors like theEC and the CDB have announced their willingness to launch new operations in the sector
 but these are notexpected until at least fiscal year 2006.

quarterly over the past two years and has been a key tool in achieving effective donor
coordination. Key donor stakeholders rate the WTG as a success and the Govemment has
used it as a model for donor coordination in other sectors.           Key advances from the
  .
coordination have included:

      Shared Asset Development Team (ADT) for the implementation of all investment
      projects - the ADT within GWI will be in charge o f implementing GWI's 10-year
      investment program financed through the donor programs;
      Harmonized procedures for financial management, monitoring and reporting
      requirements; and
  1   Coordination in the responseto the emergency situation.

2.       InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The Project will be implemented by GWI and coordinated through the utility's recently
established Asset Development Team (ADT). The ADT assumes responsibility within GWI
for coordinating the planning and implementation of capital projects supported through
intemational assistance. The ADT i s integrated into GWI management structure with strong
links to operational and financial management teams. The ADT builds upon GWI's recent
successful performance in the implementation of capital investment programs and reflects a
commitment within GWI and its Board to develop a more sustainable, integrated and
operationally driven approach to capital investment.

ADT Obiectives: GWI's strategic objective is to have the ADT function as a medium- and
long-term capital planning department within the utility with the ability to effectively match
capital expenditure management with operational targets. More specifically, the objectives of
the ADT are two-fold: (i)developing assets that are fully integrated at the technical level into
the production, distribution and customer service functions of GWI; and (ii)   developing assets
that fully enable the achievement o f GWI's businessplan, License andM C targets.

ADT Roles, Responsibilities and Structure: The ADT will manage a comprehensive process
that will include: (i)strategic business and asset management planning based on a rolling
analysis of consumer demand, progress towards target coverage levels and operational
parameters; (ii) project preparation and presentation to donors based on overarching strategic
priorities; (iii)detailed project design in close coordination with operational units; (iv)
supervision of project execution; (v) transfer of physical assets to operational units.

GWI and the international donors supporting the Government's water sector reform program
have made a strong commitment to developing a coordinated approach to supporting the
ADT. Donors and GWIhave agreed to jointly support a pool of mid- andjunior-level ADT
technical and support staff that will be mobilized strategically by GWI management to meet
the evolving and cyclical project implementation needs of donor-financed investment
programs. A core group of senior project managers will be dedicated to coordinate each
donor-supported program. The objective i s to avoid past practice of each donor program
supporting discrete project units that operate in silos with limited coordination and
interaction. The GoG, DfID,IDB and IDA are committed to supporting the ADT inthe short-
term while other donors will provide fundingas new projects become effective.

The ADT i s being led by an internationally experienced engineer with extensive exposure to
the entire asset development process. The Team Leader participates as a key member of GWI
senior management team and i s being supported by a Head o f Asset Development and
ProgramManagers for each of the active donor-financed programs. Reporting to the Head o f
Asset Development will be a core support unit with technical and administrative staff. A
Project Accountant based in the Finance Department andsupported by a technical assistant in
the ADT will be responsible for the financial management aspects of all donor-financed


                                                13

programs. The remainder of the ADT structure includes technical staff pooled into a flexible
group to be mobilized according to periodic needsfor implementation and supervision.

Further details on implementation arrangements, roles and responsibilities with the ADT and
organizational chart are included in Annex 6.

Role of GWI Board: The Board of GWI will provide strategic guidance to the utility during
the process of project implementation by reviewing progress periodically.         Beyond the
Project, the Board will review and endorse the strategic investment priorities being identified
by GWI senior management and the ADT.

3.       Monitoring & Evaluation

Monitoring and reporting requirements have been, to the extent possible, harmonized with
other donor requirements and procedures for reporting on financial management,
implementation progress and monitoring of key outcome indicators. Key monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms that have been put inplace are the following:


1    Regular monitoring of uerformance indicators and consumer satisfaction:         The core
     performance indicators that will be monitored regularly are21:

     .
     -
     9   Number o f beneficiaries receiving safe water;
         Total population which obtained access to and/or benefitedfrom improved continuity;
         Totalpopulation which obtained access to and/or benefitedfrom improved pressure;
     1   Number of connections metered; and
         Operational efficiency and management performance (using non-revenue water as a
         proxy).

     Additionally, the Project will aim to periodically monitor consumer perceptions of service
     quality in the Project area through focus group discussions and rapid satisfaction surveys
     to be conducted by the ADT. This consumer feedback on service quality will be used to
     better focus the implementation process, rapidly identify service problems and target
     necessary rehabilitation work.

     FinancialMonitoringReuorting and Audits: Subsequent to project negotiations, IDA has
     coordinated with the GoG and IDB to develop a single set o f Financial Monitoring
     Reports (FMR) that would satisfy all donor requirements. The common FMR framework
     has been agreed upon and will be expected to provide information for monitoring the
     financial, implementation and procurement progress of the Project. Similarly, in the spirit
     harmonization, IDA and the IDB have agreed to utilize a common terms of reference for
     the external auditing requirement. These terms of reference would also be discussed and
     coordinated with other donors to ensure compatibility with additional requirements to the
     extent feasible. See Annex 7 for further detail on the harmonization and content of the
     financial management monitoringand reportingrequirements.

 m   Proiect Baseline and Impact Assessments: The Project will finance as part of component
     two a project baseline and impact assessment. The assessments will enable GWI to
     accurately measure the impact of the Project in terms of improvements in service levels,
     customer satisfaction and improved health outcomes.                 The impact evaluation
     methodology will aim to identify a control group within the population for which data is
     already being collected on service levels against which the observed changes in key
     performance indicators can be empirically compared.

    Independent Supervision:         Monitoring of subproject costs, design, and technical
    effectiveness through a contract with an independent supervisor.

Given the presence of a number of donors in the sector in Guyana and the ongoing
Management Contract, the Project has additional "built-in" monitoring and evaluation tools:

e   Yearly Review of M C targets: To a large extent, Project performance indicators are
    consistent with those set in the management contract. Thus, the yearly review o f M C
    targets achievement by an independentparty envisaged under the contract arrangements
    will provide a useful monitoring and evaluating tool.

    Water Thematic Group: The quarterly WTG meeting will provide a regular supervision
    mechanism on the overall performance of the sector and the utility, including progress on
    the achievability of the M C targets (and Project indicators).

a   Monitoring of Govemments commitment to financial sustainability: Fulfillment of the
    Govemments commitment to sector cost recovery (see section 4 below) will be monitored
    through both the PRPMO (formerly known as PRSC 11) and the ongoing dialogue with
    the authorities as part o f the proposed project implementation.

4.      Sustainability

The mainfactors affecting the sustainability of the Project are:

Management Contract: The success or failure of the ongoing Management Contract will
affect Project sustainability. A successful M C would foster support for the broad reform
agenda and institutional reforms. Conversely, a failing M C due to either a non-performing
management contractor or the lack of Govemment support would imperil the reform process
and make it difficult to meet Project objectives. Progress under the Management Contract has
been slow for reasons including a lack of clarity in the govemance framework for GWI. The
relationship between the GWI Board and management has been strained since the inception of
the M C largely due to conflicting perceptions of the appropriate division of responsibilities
between the two entities.        GWI management asserts that a greater degree of financial
delegation and human resource management autonomy would facilitate further performance
improvements.

As described in section A.l and in Annex 1, recent measuresundertaken by the Govemment,
STWI, GWI Board and other stakeholders to ensure a successful implementation of the M C
include agreement on a concrete Action Plan (included in the Roadmap to SuccessDocument)
to deliver immediate and long-term improvements in the performance of GWI. The Action
Plan developed contains ten key deliverables under the responsibility o f the different parties.
Progress against the agreed actions will be monitored closely. The commitment o f both the
Govemment and the operator to making the M C a success has thus been clearly stated by both
parties and momentum for a successful transformation can be built. The knowledge transfer
from the private contractor to GWI staff that i s expected to occur will reinforce the long-term
impact of the reformprocess. Lastly, the proposed Project will contribute to the success of the
M C by supporting the achievement of the contract targets (addressing 4 of the 8 performance
targets and the water quality target established in GWI's operating license).

Financial Sustainabilitv: Cost recovery i s critical to long-term sustainability of the sector and,
therefore, for achieving Project development objectives. The key issue to enhancing the
sustainability of water and sanitation service provision in Guyana i s to move towards greater
cost recovery while maintaining affordability for users, especially the most poor. Cabinet has
been reluctant to review tariffs in 2004 given social affordability concems and the wish to
accompany any tariff review with tangible improvements in levels of services. While


                                                  15

recognizing the complexity of any tariff increases in areas where the services have not
improved, establishing an equitable, manageable and sustainable tariff structure i s a key
priority for the sector. GWIhas initiated a Tariff and Revenue Study that will analyze current
tariff structure, level and subsidy mechanism and identify the existing funding gap to achieve
full cost recovery.22 Following the review of the study by the PUC, the Government will
commit to sector financial sustainability through (i)implementing the new tariff structure
and/or level approved by the PUC; and (ii)         outlining a clear proposal for subsidy policy for
the sector for 2005 and its phasing out going forward. This discussion has been incorporated
in the negotiations of the new water sector operation and in preparation of the Guyana
Poverty Reduction and Public Management Operation (PRPMO), formerly known as the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit I1(PRSC 11).

Investment Sustainabilitv: Appropriate maintenance of the investments will also affect
sustainability. The technical solution chosen, which is appropriate for Guyana and sufficiently
simple given current capacity, maximizes likelihood of sound maintenance and sustainability
of investments. Additionally, the management contractor has put in place a maintenance
framework basedon their international experience, as well as other measures and mechanisms
for the proper functioning of operations. These include the Leakage Inspection Teams, which
ensure repairs in a timely fashion, and the establishment of DMAs for adequate monitoring
and control.23

Implementation Capacity:           Ensuring that the new ADT has the capacity to effectively
implement the Project, the overarching investment program and meet performance targets i s
critical for sustainability. An effective ADT will help to mobilize further funding which is
critical for the overall success of the reform process and the achievement of Government
goals for the sector. The funding of the necessary equipment and staff under component two
of this Project and the commitment of other donors to do the same will minimize the risk of
low implementationcapacity.

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.      Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analvsis: The Project i s economically viable as demonstrated by the detailed
economic and distributive analyses carried out for each of the three subprojects. As shown in
Annex 9, these analyses were complemented by appropriate sensitivity and risk assessments.
Each of the subprojects shows important net economic benefits above US$ 4 million and
intemal rates of retum higher than 30%. The Project will generate significant economic
benefits, including intangible and more difficult to measure environmental and health
benefits. Other benefits that will be derived from the Project are the following:

       Improvedreliability and consumer efficiency will reduce the level of illegal tampering
       and so reduce the cost of distribution maintenance;
       Reduction of iron deposits within the distribution system will reduce maintenance costs
       and allow the meters to work;
       Reduction o f water borne illnesses (incidence rate of 5% in Division 1where rainwater
       harvesting i s very common) and also workdays lost to illness; and
       Reduction in need for overhead storage due to 24hr supply

Sensitivity and Risk assessments confirm the robustness of the Project. The risk assessment
of the economic analysis shows that the likelihood o f a positive outcome i s 100%. The
distributive analysis shows the customers as the stakeholder most benefited by the Project
with benefits of about US$21 million.

More details on the economic and financial anaIysis can be found in Annexes 9 and I1.

2.       Technical

Detailed feasibility studies have been prepared by a multidisciplinary team of engineers,
process specialists and economists within GWI as part of project preparation. The sector
experience of Sevem Trent Water Intemational provides confidence as to the technical
soundness of the proposed investments to be financed under the Grant. The feasibility studies
were prepared to ensure that the subprojects are sound from an engineering and design
 standpoint and that a least cost solution has been adopted amongst the different alternative
options to achieve the Project objectives. DuringProject preparation, IDA'SProject Engineer
 reviewed the feasibility studies prepared by GWI to confirm the technical viability and
 appropriateness of the proposed solutions. Recommendations were used to refine the overall
 Project objectives, scope and approach, as well as the specific criteria used in subprojects
 design. The detailed feasibility study reports for the three projects are available in the Project
 files.

3.       Fiduciary

The Finance and Administration Department within GWIwill be responsible for the financial
management activities of the Project. The initial financial management assessment of GWI at
the beginning o f project preparation indicated several structural gaps in its financial
management system. The 2003 audit report prepared by the Office of the Auditor General
(OAG) also revealed severe internal control problems relating to contract management and
oversight, poor accounting of customer payments, and poor employee time recording.
However, GWI's financial management system is undergoing considerable financial
strengthening under the terms of the MC. Among the principal financial management related
actions already undertaken are: (i)installation of the new financial accounting system; (ii)
preparation of a Financial Policies and Procedures Manual and an Administration Manual;
and (iii)Updating o f the Fixed Asset Register. Significant actions planned by the end of the
2005 include the development of GWI's customer data base and the installation of a customer
accounting and billing system.

The proceeds of the IDA Grant would be disbursed into a US Dollar denominated special
account managed by GWI. The special account would be opened at the Bank of Guyana,
Guyana's Central Bank, under terms satisfactory to the IDA. Since the Grant would be
financing approximately 90% of the Project, GWI would open a project account at a
commercial bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the IDA, in which the
Government counterpart funds would be deposited. The Finance and Administration
Department would be responsible for preparing the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on
a quarterly basis to be submitted to the IDA. Subsequent to negotiations, efforts were made
to reach an agreement with the other donors and the Government for GWI to prepare a single
set o f FMRs which would be submitted to GWI's Management, the Government and the other
donors. Presently GWI's accounts are audited by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) of
Guyana. The OAG would continue to be GWI's external auditor under this project. The audits
would be carried out in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the IDA. It has been
agreedthat the IDA and the IDB would utilize a common Terms of Reference for the external
audit and a single audit report would be prepared for all donors.

Annex 7 provides more detail on financial management aspects and Annex 8 includes a
description of the Procurement Capacity Assessment undertaken and procurement related
issues.

4.       Social

The Project will have a strongly positive impact in providing access to safe water to over
48,000 inhabitants (mainly poor) and its associated health benefits by reduction in morbidity
and mortality related to water quality through the proper treatment o f drinking water.
Immediate health improvements (which would especially benefit children who are often
particularly susceptible to water-borne diseases) would include reductions in gastrointestinal
illnesses, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis, among others.

During Project Preparation, field visits were conducted to allow for consultations for the
benefited populations in the Project areas. For all of the locations visited, apart from Eccles,
which is a site funded from the pre-existing IDA intervention, water i s pumped directly into
supply from boreholes without any treatment or chlorination. Consequently, water delivered
to GWI clients i s generally o f poor quality, with high levels of iron and significant risk of
bacteriological contamination o f water supplies.      Generally low pressures or even long
periods of water outage were also evident in most areas visited. Nearly all GWI clients
consulted with reported low levels of satisfaction with GWI service provision. High levels of
wastage were also evident partly due to the runningto waste of iron laden water. There was
significant evidence o f


                                                19

        Installation o f rainwater collection systems to provide more reliable and cleaner water
    .   than that delivered by GWI. In some cases, it was apparent that self sufficiency of
        water supply had been achieved in this respector was targeted:
        Breaking o f service connections to enable buckets to be filled duringperiodof
        particularly low pressure;
    ..  Bypassing of customer water meters, where these were perceived to be reducing
        pressureeven more than would otherwise be the case:
        Some seizing up of customer water meters due to the poor quality of water delivered;
        General dissatisfaction with customer billing and collection activities; and
        Where customer water meters were installed, these were not linkedto billing against
        metered water delivered.

  5.      Environment

  The proposed operation has been rated by QAT as category B for IDA processing purposes.
  Project activities are not expected to face any unusual environmental risks and would
  generally constitute a substantial positive environmental impact. The Project would support
  the Govemment's implementation of the 1996 Environmental Protection Act. As part of
  project preparation, GWI and the Govemment have developed Environmental Guidelines for
  Construction Projects and Corporate Environmental and Social Guidelines. These Guidelines
  have been reviewed, commented on and signed off by the EPA (Environmental and Protection
  Agency) of Guyana and can be found inthe Project files.

  The construction works to be financed will require compliance with guidelines and
  contractors will be asked to develop Environmental Management Plans (EMP) to the
  satisfaction of GWI guidelines. All water supply facilities will complement the operating
  manuals with corresponding site specific EMP. Under these conditions the Project would not
  cause environmental damage, would strengthen EPA efforts to implement the Environmental
  Act, and create a culture of environmental awareness and actions to complement good
  managementpractices promoted by the Project.

7.      Policy Exceptionsand Readiness

Under IDA 14, Guyana is eligible to receive its IDA allocation in the form of 100% grants.
The proposed grant is being submitted to IDA'SExecutive Directors for approval, such
approvalto be conditionalupon adequate donor resourcesbeing made available as described
in Section I1of the Memorandumto the Executive Directors on Transition from IDA13 to
IDA14 approved on March 10, 2005. Signing of the DevelopmentGrant Agreement will be
made conditional upon the availability of adequate commitment authority for the making of
this Grant. Prior to signing, IDA would satisfy itself that the Recipient remains eligible to
receive the Grant, and that no change has occurred in the situation of the Recipient which
would significantly and adversely affect the basis on which the approval by the Executive
Directorsof the Grant was made.

At the request of the Government, a Project Preparation Facility of US$ 550,000 was
approved and signed in May 18,2005. The purpose of the Advance was to finance some of
the repairs and mitigation works resulting from the January 2005 floods and advance on
Projectdesign andother preparation activities.

The operationcomplies with all applicableIDA policies.

                         Annex 1: Country and Sector Background
                Government Water and Sanitation Sector Reform Program

In 1999 the Govemment initiated a comprehensive analysis o f the water and sanitation sector
through a study conducted by a consortium of firms led by KPMG and financed by DfID.
The comprehensive review emerged from the recognition by the Govemment that the water
sector was under-performing due to an incoherent institutional and regulatory framework,
fragmentation in sector management and the lack of a comprehensive sector strategy and
investment program. The review produced a National Water Policy (Nwp)outlining clear
objectives for the sector and a new institutional and regulatory framework. The review also
analyzed the benefits of merging the Georgetown Sewage and Water Commissioners
(GS&WC) and the Guyana Water Authority (GUYWA), provided a 10-year investment
program and a mechanism for tariff review. The review also made a series of overarching
recommendations regarding the sustainable management of potable water sources, water
quality and treatment methods, priority capital investments, service standards, financial
sustainability and pricing, private sector involvement in utility management and required
legislation.24

In 2000 the Govemment initiated a comprehensive water and sanitation sector reform
program including many of the actions recommended in the sector assessment.                      Key
achievements of the reform program to date include: (i)     a new modern legal, regulatory and
institutional framework under the Water and Sewerage Act; (ii)           the formation of Guyana
Water Inc (GWI) through the merger of the two water utilities, GS&WC and GUYWA; (iii)
the elaboration of a ten year investment and financing program; (iv) the award of a
performance-based management contract (MC) for five years to an intemational operator,
Sevem Trent Water International, which started operations in January 2003; and (v) the
implementation of tariff adjustments to achieve full cost recovery and eliminate operating
subsidies.

Reformed Legal and Regulatory Framework: InMay 2002 the Govemment passed the Water
and Sewerage Act which provided a clear legal framework for sector reform. The Act helped
to specify roles in the sector, clarify expectations of sector participants and establish
mechanisms for accountability. A National Water Council (NWC) was identified to provide
strategic guidance to the sector on policy implementation and inter-agency coordination. The
Act approved the merger of GS&WC and GUYWA and a Water License setting out the
Govemment's performance expectations from the merged entity was granted to Guyana
Water Inc. (GWI).      National water quality standards were also specified under the Act to
ensure for more consistency in sector investment planning and regulation. Lastly, the ambit
of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) was expanded to include a regulatory and tariff
settingresponsibilities.

Formation of GWI: In May 2002 GS&WC and GUYWA were merged and GWIwas formed
as a single utility under the Companies Act. Prior to the merger GS&WC was responsible for
service provision in Georgetown while GUYWA had responsibility for the rest of the country.
A primary objective of the merger was to achieve operational and scale efficiencies. The
Govemment also concluded that a single utility would be easier to govem, regulate and
monitor. The creation o f GWI also provides greater strategic flexibility for'the sector
particularly with respect to tariff harmonization, coordination o f investment priorities and
cross-subsidization. The ability to attract private sector participation was greater with the
larger GWI customer base and the merger increased the likelihood that urban and rural areas
outside of Georgetown will benefit from efficiency and service gains associated with aprivate
operator.

Ten-Year Investment Promam:             An initial and comprehensive investment program was
outlined in the 2000 KMPG study. The investment strategy focused on all key areas of the
water supply and sanitation systems including groundwater, production and water treatment,
distribution, sanitation and wastewater management. In developing the program five distinct
investment strategies were examined before deciding upon an approach that improved water
distribution systems while also emphasizing demand management. The preferred investment
strategy included a rationalized system of larger water processing plants and delivering water
through a system of interconnected trunk and distribution infrastructure. The approach has
the benefit o f scale economies through fewer and larger treatment sites, increased likelihood
of standard service quality and a prioritization towards distribution to ensure that the utility
can increase coverage and revenues.

The KPMGinvestment program was reviewed and approved by the GWIBoard and a version
of the plan was included in the License and the Management Contract as indicative of the
funding available to support the achievement of the License and M C targets.      GWI, under
STWI management, has subsequently reviewed the original investment program and as part
of the May 2005 GWI Strategic Plan developed the Ten Year Development Plan (TYDP).
This investment program reflects changes in the sequencing and content of sub-programs
based on the strategic and technical recommendations of STWI, availability of donor
financing for capital investment, the changing operational context, available assumptions and
predictions and most recent knowledge of GWI. The TYDP i s organized around the
following key medium-term objectives:

*    provide access for 90% of the Coastal population to safe water;
1    reduce `non-revenue water' to 25% of total water produced along the Coastal strip;
     provide Georgetown and the Coastal Strip with 24/7 water supply service;
1    reduce sewage pump downtime in Georgetown below 2%;
a
.    increase revenue meter coverage to 85%; and
     provide 80% of Hinterland households with access to safe water.

The sector currently requires approximately US$ 75 million from 2004-2008 based on the
TYDP which i s subject-to ongoing review by the authorities. A summary of the TYDP
capital investment program i s provided in the table below:

Performance-Based Management Contract:                 A 5-year performance-based Management
Contract (MC) for GWI was awarded in October 2002 as a centerpiece of the Government's
sector strategy to improve service levels, increase efficiency and achieve financial
sustainability.   Sevem Trent Water International (STWI) was awarded the contract and in
January 2003 began managing GWI and working to implement the investment program and
deliver the coverage and quality targets outlined in the MC. The M C is structured around
seven specific sector performance targets including: (i)         non-revenue water; (ii)continuity of
service; (iii)collection efficiency; (iv) metering coverage; (v) disposal efficiency; (vi)
customer service; and (vii) Hinterland coverage. A baseline year data report against in each of
these performance areas was finalized by an independent entity and a series of annual
performance targets for years 2-5 were agreed upon by the private operator and GWI Board in
2004. Further detail on the M C targets is provided inAnnex 12.

Tariff Review: The Govemment agreed to a new cost recovery scheme and tariff review
mechanism as part of the reformprogram. The tariff schedule prior to the reform process was
far below cost-recovery thresholds and insufficient to cover O&M costs. A comprehensive
tariff review with specific recommendations on appropriate tariff adjustments was carried out
as part of the sector assessment completed in 2000. Based on this review, tariffs were
increased by an average o f 37% in 2003 to enable the private operator to improve the
financial position of GWI. Nonetheless, tariffs remain low and insufficient for cost-recovery.
The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has been conferred responsibility for conducting
periodic tariff reviews upon the request o f the Operator. However, the scheduled tariff
restructuring for 2004 has been postponed amidst concems over insufficient service
improvements. Whilst recognizing the complexity of any tariff increases in areas where the
services have not improved, establishing an equitable, manageable and sustainable tariff
structure is a key priority for the sector. As part of the discussions with the Government
duringproject preparation and other agreements with the donor community, the Government
has agreed to GWI conducting a Tariff and Revenue Study to analyze current tariff structure,
 level and subsidy mechanism and the existing funding gap to achieve cost recovery. This
 study was also a condition for disbursement of the IDB Georgetown I1loan. Following the
 review of the study by the PUC, the Government andGWI are committed to achieving sector
 financial sustainability through (i)improved billings and collections; (ii)reduced costs
 through operational efficiencies; (iii)   tariff restructuring and implementationof the new tariff
 structure and/or level recommended by the PUC; and (iv) outlining a clear subsidy policy for
 the sector for 2005 and its phasing out going forward. This discussion has been incorporated
 and will be supported under the Guyana Poverty Reduction and Public Management
 Operation -PRPMO (formerly known as PRSC 11).

 Sector Issues

 Advances in the reform program to date have yet to make a significant impact in terms of
 efficiency and performance. The benefits o f policy reforms and the Management Contract
 will likely emerge in the ensuing years as the investment program i s implemented and the
 efficiency-enhancing management reforms implemented by the Operator take root. However,
 the sector continues to face major challenges in implementing the program and improving
 levels o f service.

 Financial Sustainabilitv: As described in detailed in section A.l, a key goal for the reform
 process i s to achieve financial sustainability in the medium-term through the implementation
 of a tariff review mechanism to set tariffs at cost recovery levels and eliminate operating
 subsidies from the Govemment. A combined plan to increase GWIrevenuesand reduce costs
 i s being implemented. First, the Govemment has committed to GWI preparing a Tariff &
 Revenue Study for submission to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)2sin 2005 which is

now underway. The study will develop a series of options combining targeted subsidies to
the sector and review of current tariff structure for consideration of the PUC and the
Government. The objective is to enable coverage of GWI's operations & maintenance costs
by end 2005, and operations, maintenance & depreciation costs by end 2006. If as a result
billings increase by 30%, income would rise by some US$ 1.8 million at current collection
rates. Second, collection performance is expected to improve in line with the achievement of
the contract target. Preliminary figures on collection rates for 2004 seem to indicate that the
2004 target of 76% would have been met. In moving towards the 2007 target of 90%
collection rate, an improvement of about 5% per year is required. In real terms this means an
increased collection o f about US$ 0.5 million/yearZ6.             m,the       reduction in non-revenue
water figures by 10% i s expected to save GWI US$ 1.5 million in 2005. As NRW comes
down in line with the contract targets very significant savings can be envisaged- around US$
3 million. This is the key area to close the gap between revenue and costs. However, it will
require time and investment in the repair and rehabilitation of the distribution network. Inthe
meantime, the Government will have to extend its commitments o f transfers to the sector.
The analysis shows that the subsidies could be completely eliminated by the end of 2006 if a
tariff restructuring takes place and the leakage reduction strategy and energy management
plan are implemented.

Low coverage rates and Door service levels: The quality and coverage of water supply
services in Guyana are poor. Major problems with the safety, continuity and reliability of
supply persist both along the coastal strip and in the severely under-serviced Hinterland
region. Source water treatment in some GWI areas is non-existent resulting in a high risk of
bacteriological contamination. Most parts of the serviced areas - both in Georgetown and
outside the capital - experience low water pressure and intermittent supply. In spite of an
increase in coverage figures in recent years - with a near doubling of households connected to
pipedwater between2000 and 200327- coverage levels remain deficient. Approximately 45.1
percent of the population had access to treated water in 2003. There i s also a need to continue
with ongoing improvements in the operations, management and levels o f service. At the end
o f 2004, continuity o f acceptable service was estimated on a composite basis as 4.3 hours of
service per day, non-revenue water at a 50% of total water production, and metering coverage
was recorded at 24% percent.

High investment needs and limited funding;: The GWI TYDP outlines a comprehensive
investment program required to substantially im rove access to safe and reliable water.
GWI's planned investment program (2005-2014)f                8  amounts to over US$ 170 million, of
which US$52 million have been secured from the international community. In the immediate
3-year period 2005-2007, the investment program is estimated at US$74 million of which the
US$44 million has been secured when including this proposed IDA Grant. GWI is currently
engaged with other donors to secure a further US$ 18 million in investments during this
period.leaving an estimated financing gap of US$ 11 million, or approximately 15% of the
medium-terminvestmentprogram.

Ensuring continued and consistent funding for the capital expenditure program and working
capital will be essential for GWI to enhance operational efficiency and meet License targets.
Despite initial delays in accessing donor resources, progress has been made. The IDB
 Georgetown Program I1has begun disbursements and GWIand the Government are exploring
 the possibility of obtaining further investment resources from the global EU Water Facility
 and the CDB as well as through bilateral arrangements:

Management Contract: The 5-year performance-based Management Contract (MC) for GWI
initiated in January 2003 is a centerpiece of the Government's sector strategy to improve
service levels, increase efficiency and achieve financial sustainability.      Although GWI
performance has been below targeted levels under the MC in 2004, considerable progress has
been made against the performance targets for non-revenue water and collection efficiency,
and there i s now in place a well defined strategy to improve customer relation and
commercial services and maximize revenues through improved billing and collections. The
improvement in GWI's performance has been slower than expected also due to: (i)           mixed
initial performance by the management contractor, in part due to perceived security problems
during the first year o f operations; and (ii)a need for improvement of the govemance
framework for GWIto establish clear divisionof responsibilities between the Board and GWI
management - which has been addressed through the recent review of Board policies and
procedures. These issues were, in particular during the first year of the MC, a source of
friction between the Govemment, GWIBoard and the private operator.

InDecember 2004, the Government invitedSTWI to hold a seriesof meeting under the theme
"GWI- Moving Forward" to gain a better mutual understanding of contract issues. The
Government, the Board of GWI, STWI and the donor community participated in these
discussions where the commitment of both the Government and the operator to making the
M C a success was clearly stated. The main outcome was the signature of a memorandum of
understanding with a concrete set o f actions to be implemented during 2005 to deliver
immediate improvements in the performance of GWI. The agreed upon Action Plan focused
on 10key issues affecting the performanceof the MC:

1. Performanceagainst Targets: Activities agreeduponunder this issueincluded:
         A self assessmentand audit of the Board's performance supported by verifiable data
         such as Board meetingand sub-committee attendance records
         A self assessmentagainst the Year 2 targets of the M C to be undertakenby STWI
         (which will be independently reviewed with fundingfrom the IDB)
         Undertaking the strategic planningprocess to provide the prioritization and common
         focus on the goals of the water sector reforms, with consultation and participation
         occurs of all key stakeholders in the sector. As agreedin the Memorandum of
         Understanding, the strategy must describe how each of the seven targets set out in the
         M C will be progressed from the baseline position established in the Halcrow report of
         June 2004 to meet the ManagementContract targets (see Annex 12for more detail)
         Agreement of GWIto undertake an improved reporting system to report on the
         utility's status and progress towards the achievement of the targets and key
         performance indicators that can be communicated to all stakeholdersregularly

 2. Strategic Vision for GWI: This involves completing the GWI Strategic Plan and the
     holding of different workshops to get Board involvement in the strategic planning process
     and to reach agreement on the improved reporting system described in the first issue, as
     well as producing the 2005 Annual Budget for GWI. There has been great progress in
     these actions at the time of writing this PAD and GWI has now got a Revised Final
     Strategic Plan dated May 2005 (available in Project Files).

 3. BoardManagement Interactions: It was agreed that the Board will begin
     implementation of the recently enacted Board Policies and Procedures immediately. The
     Board and GWI also committed to deepening the development of the new govemance
     arrangementsto allow:
         More effective use of sub-committees
         Prioritize main Board time
         Speed-up the decision making process for the Board

        Agree a format for the preparation of various types of Boardpapers
        Provide reasons andjustification for decisions, and
        Ensure effective follow up and implementation of decisions

4. Management Team: The most significant progress made under this issue has been the
   appointment of a new Managing Director for GWI with the required operational,
   managerial and financial skills. Other activities included under this issue are:

        Re-institute regular one-on-one meetings between the MDand Chairman o f Board
        Identify technical inputs likely to be required to support MDthroughout 2005
        As part of the wider GWIperformance management process, MDtargets for 2005 to
   .    be agreed (this will only be possible when Strategic Plan, and supporting documents,
        are complete)
        Determine method to assess progress against performance targets (including self-
        assessment)

5. Short-TermInputs: It was agreedthat STWI would make a proposal for short-term
   inputs as specified in the M C that can be provided in the future. Progresshas been made
   on this and there is now agreement on the short term inputs to be provided by STWI for
   the remainingyears of the MC.

6. InvestmentProgram: The following activities were agreedunder this issue to facilitate
   the implementation o f the capital expenditure program o f GWI:
   ..   Asset Development Team to be fully staffed
        Asset Development Team understands donor procedures, inparticular procurement
        procedures. T h i s will be addressedby the training to be provided under the
        implementation of the proposed Grant
        Elaboration o f an Asset Development Plan showing the different programs and
        investments (please see above)
        Promote the knowledge and understanding of the Ten Year Asset Development Plan
        by all key stakeholders (including donors)

7. Finances: The most important agreement under this issue is for GWI to develop a
   Revenue and Tariff Studyltariff proposal for submission to the PUC. T h i s study will
   develop different finance scenarios for the company covering all financial aspects. The
    scenarios will be based on a detailed financial model that allows the combination of
    different values for tariffs, Government subsidy, capital expenditures, targets, etc. Other
    agreements include the Government to provide information on the supply o f predictable
    subsidy to GWI and GWIto prepare the 2005 budget.


8. Data: Agreement was reachedon the following:
        GWI would develop an approach to distribution and communication of key
        information and data including the role o f the Halcrow audit as annual confirmation
        of target status and the role o f the Enhanced Accountability Framework
         (comprehensive reporting systemincluding operational and financial indicators) as
         monthly update of key progress indicators
    .   ExplainEnhanced Accountability Framework to all key stakeholders, and gain
         consensus on presentation and quality of data contained within
         UseEnhanced Accountability Framework as inputto Boardmeetings, thematic
         Groups, and other important forums for discussion of GWIperformance
         Review data requirements for all key stakeholders, and expand Enhanced
         Accountability Framework as necessary

        Present data in a well thought through format to ensure ready understanding by key
        stakeholders and the general public

9. Human Resources: It was agreed that the new Managing Director would undertake
    immediately the necessary actions to review GWI's organization structure and identify all
    key outstanding staff positions, finalize staffing the ADT and any other outstanding
    positions. STWI also agreed to propose a plan to frontload the time allocated for
    Operations Director and Customer Services Director under the MC.                  Other key
    agreements inthis area are:
        Having identifiedstaffing and recruitment requirements, STWI will propose a plan to
        use the remaining inputs under the ManagementContract
        To the extent possible, it will be requiredthat employees are recruitedeither on
        contract or on permanent employment terms
        GWIto determine a suitable staffing structure for the organization under the
        supervision of the MD
        As part of the Management SuccessionPlan, the current managersagreedto
        undertake the necessary actions to develop existing human resources and ensure the
        effective transfer of knowledge to take place, e.g. through the provision o f targeted
        on-the-job training. This plan will also develop arrangements for the transition once
        the M C term is over

    In order to accomplish the Roadmap goals under this issue, GWI will need significant
    inputs of technical assistance funding from the donor community. Under the proposed
    operation, this technical assistance will be provided for under the Institutional
    Strengthening and Training component.

10. Alignment of License and Management Contract: It was agreed that an exercise to
    determine inconsistencies between GWI's License and the Management Contract would
    be undertaken where recommendations could be driven from. Action to address
    inconsistencies was agreed as a longer term action (secondhalf o f 2005).


The Action Plan and was incorporated in a Roadmap to Success document prepared by the
consulting firm Castalia with DfID funding. The Roadmap establishes an important and
promising framework for collaboration in the sector amongst all stakeholders. I t provides an
overview of the main agreements, responsible parties and the timeframes for the agreed
activities taking place. Failure to achieve any o f the "checkpoints" of the Roadmap would
indicate a significant risk to the overall process. The Roadmap process has resulted in five
principal achievements:

    Production of Revised Final Strategic Plan for GWI, outlining GWI's corporate strategy
    for 2005 to 2008, and within that, setting out the path to financial sustainability and
    improved levels of service. The Strategic Plan sets out GWI's vision, the business
    objectives and outlines the actions, resources, finance and planning actions required to
    achieve GWI strategic goals and objectives for 2005-2008

Institutional and Regulatorv Framework:      Considerable progress has already been made
toward implementing key institutional and regulatory reforms associated with the program.
In the short-term the Government will nonetheless need to focus attention on a few key
pending institutional reform issues. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) establishedas an
independent regulatory body for the sector requires capacity strengthening to perform its
functions and the Government i s behind schedule in implementing the 2004 tariff review as
specified in the reform program. The National Water Council is yet to be operational. DfID
i s supporting a capacity building program for the PUC which i s currently being implemented
with Technical assistancefrom the consulting firm Castalia. Castalia has been working with
the PUC for the last year towards achieving a sustainable regulatory framework in Guyana
and helpingthe PUC to become an independent and strong regulator.

                             Guyana: Water Sector ConsolidationProject

The Project will support the Government's Program through a Specific Investment Grant to be
implementedby GWI through the Asset Development Team. The Grant will finance four project
components: (i)a capital investment for water supply infrastructure each within an operating
Division of Guyana Water Incorporated (GWI); (ii)a design, project management and
                                                                     ,
supervision component; (iii) institutional strenrrthening component; and (iv) an emergency
                                   an
recovery component to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure resulting from the January 2005
floods. Table 1summarizes the components included in the overall Project.

1.1.      Objectivesand Existing Situation

The objectives of the intervention are to provide, for each household within the areas of supply, a
continuous supply of water at a minimum pressure of 7m, to reduce leakage to 25% of supply,
and to meet the following water quality objectives; namely, iron c 0.5 mg/l, color e 15 Hazens,
turbidity c 5 NTU and zero coliforms at the point of use.              A collection rate of at least 90%
should be met within each project area34.

Currently, piped borehole water inthe targeted areas fails to meet WHO quality guidelines and is
pumped, typically, for less than 12 hours per day. The water pressure for the majority of
households is below the minimumacceptable level of 7m, with a significant proportion actually
below 3m. Water losses are more than 55% inall areas.

As described inAnnex 1, with regards to sanitation arrangements, the three areas that the Project
relate to rely on on-site sanitation facilities - pit latrines and septic tanks.

 1.2.     Scope of the Feasibility Studies

Detailed feasibility studies have been completedby GWIas part of project preparation. These can
be found in the Project Files. As part of the feasibility studies, GWI has investigated the
following subject areas:

     Populationestimates and growth rates to the design year of 2024;
     Demand projections based on the design year population estimates and on per capita demand
     estimates developed by KPMGinits report published in2000;

 34The feasibilitystudies have assumed a minimumbilling rate of 90%. However, it is expectedthat all efforts will be
 placedinachieving 100%billing inthe project areas.

    Groundwater availability and raw water quality based on previous studies and current
    sampling and asset records;
    Water treatment plant requirements to achieve the treated water quality objectives based on
    water sampling / bench testing and performance of existing plants;
    Service pumping, transmission and distribution system upgradingbased on asset records, site
    inspections and hydraulic modeling;
    Managementof leakage usingthe establishment of DMAs and universal customer metering;
    Development of unit rates from recent construction contracts / operational experience and of
    capital and operating cost estimatesbasedupon these rates;
    Cost benefit analyses based primarily on the balance of additional operating costs arising
    from new treatment plants against savings made from reduced levels of leakage;
    Overview of the environmental issues arising from the projects;
    Development of an outline procurement plan; and
    Development of an outline risk register for the projects.

1.3.    Conclusions

The feasibility studies' conclusions and recommendations for each project area are essentially the
same. Firstly, it is technically feasible to meet the stated objectives within each project area.
Secondly, the increase in operating costs required to treat and distribute the water can be
recouped provided leakage reduction targets are met.

1.4.    Recommendations

....
The feasibility studies make the following recommendationcommon to each project area:

    In order to meet the water quality objectives, borehole water is to be aerated, pH adjusted,
    oxidized, filtered and disinfected within a dedicated treatment plant for each project area;
    Each treatment plant should be fed by two boreholes, one existing and the other newly
    constructed;
    New transmission mains should be laid, although in some instances portions of existing pipe
    lines can be used;
    District Meter Areas (DMAs) should be established across each targeted area, and every
    household supplied with a domestic revenue meter in an effort to manage leakage and
     demand.

1.5.     Costs

The combined c o d 5 of the three projects i s US$ 11 million, equivalent to US$ 224 for each
person covered by the interventi~n~~.Operating costs per cubic meter consumed would be GY$
32, an increase of G Y $ 4 based on 2004 costs. However, due to the planned reduction in demand
through the installation of meters the estimated total power consumption across all the targeted

Finally, it i s fair to say this intervention will succeed or fail based on GWI's ability, willingness
and commitment to monitor and reduce NRW within each target area. Without a reduction in

A detailed analysis and final results of the 2002 Census data has yet to be published. However,
some points were raised in the Preliminary Report which are relevant to this study:


0  the total population increased-between 1991 and 2002 by 3.29% (23,635 people), having
   previously fallen by 5.26% between 1980and 1991;
0  the population in Region 4 shifted internally away from Georgetown City (14,663 people) to
   the arteries of the East Coast and East Bank and presumably, to a lesser extent, the West Bank
   Demerara and East BankEssequibo;
0  all regions except Region 6 showed an increase in population, with Regions 3 and 5 actually
   reversinga declining population trend; and
0  Region 6 population dropped by 18,655 fuelling growth within other Regions.


The 2002 census was characterized by a reverse in the previous population decline, a
redistribution of the population between Regions, and a movement away from urban to rural
areas. Significant population growth in the Project areas i s expected as a result of these trends.

1.8.     Summary Project Details

Anna Regina Area Water Supply Infrastructure Development Componentin Division 1 of GWZ

The Project area extends from Walton Hall to Dageraad inclusive of both villages, taking in the
primary population center of Anna Regina. The projected 2024 population covered by the
intervention i s 18,717, generating an average water demand of 3.37 Mld. The total estimated
cost, including the provision for scope, price and process variation and project design,
management and supervision costs, is US$3.88m.

The objectives of the Project are to provide continuous supply, with a minimum pressure of 7m
(10 psi) at the extremities of the distribution system, to reduce leakage to 25% of supply, and
meet the national WHO-based water quality standards; namely, iron e 0.5 mg/l, color < 15
Hazens, turbidity e 5 NTUand zero coliforms at the point of use (a consequenceof havingboth a
free chlorine residual of 0.2-0.4 mgA at the point of transmission and an integral distribution
system).

Based on a 20-year design life (2004-2024), the proposed project comprises the following
elements:


0   two boreholes should supply a direct filtration treatment plant at Lima, one being the existing
    Lima borehole and the second being a newly constructed borehole at Lima;



                                                 42

   the existing Lima borehole should first be test-pumped to ensure it can meet the maximum
   design flow;
   a direct filtration treatment plant should be installed at Lima, comprising aeration, pH
   adjustment, oxidation, filtration anddisinfection;
   process guarantees should be sought from filter manufacturers regarding filter run times to
   ensure excess operating costs are not incurredinby GWI;.
   a 1,614m3nominal capacity ground level storage tank should be constructed;
   two service pumps should be installed, rated at 35 Us against a head of 45m;
   although not part of this project, provision should be made in the design of the plant for the
   eventual construction of a low-level elevated storage tank once night-time flows drop below
   service pumps' cut-off point of 17.5 Us, i.e. leakage has been controlled towards the targets
   within the management contract;
   construction of an 18.2km long 200mm diameter transmission main;
   rehabilitation of the existing distribution system should be undertaken in order to reduce
   leakage to 25%;
   district meter areas (DMAs) should be implemented in order to control usage and identify
   leakage and wastage, coupled with the installation of domestic flow meters to monitor and
   control demand; and
   increase billing coverage to at least 90% and collection rates from current levels of 85% to
   90%.

3.        Component 3 Institutional Strengthening Component
                           -
T h i s component will fund technical assistance architecture around the M C to bring the needed
specialized skills and expertise to support GWI and its Board to tum GWI into a modem and
efficient            This component will finance activities to strengthen and bring the utility to
reasonable levels of management, operational efficiency and financial viability, banking on the
private operator's experience to achieve these. Capacity buildingwithin GWI would be provided
through targeted technical assistance by consultants hired by GWI for specific tasks not
envisaged at the inception of the Management Contract but which are very much needed for the
effective transfer of know-how from the private operator to GWI and the efficient operation of
the company (tariff studies, energy management specialists, training specialists, IT specialists,
etc.). This component will include training activities for the GWI Board. Consulting firms or
individual consultants will be hired by GWIto support the provision of these technical assistance
inputs. The total cost of this component is US$ 300,000. Given the big potential for energy
savings in the operation of the systems, this component also includes a provision for fundingthe
eventual preparation and co-financing of an energy efficiency project for funding by the GEF.
The preparation of a Project Concept Note (PCN) is currently underway with funding from the
President's Contingency Funds. Subject to a successful PCN review and decision to include it in

InJanuary 2005, flooding along the East Coast andWest Coast of Demerara and inGeorgetown
 seriously affected GWI's ability to supply potable water (approximately 164,000 people affected)
 andto dispose of wastewater in the affected areas. Some of the water treatment plants, pumping
 stations (water and wastewater), and distribution systems have been damaged and are in need of
rehabilitation to recover to normal operation status. Preliminary needs assessment for the sector
prepared in the field totaled US$ 546,000. This figure did not include damages caused to the
distribution systems. A further US$ 520,000 will go to finance minor capital works targeted at

 5.       Descriptionof Wastewater and SanitationArrangements

Georgetown

 GWI operates a piped sewerage system which serves part of Georgetown, the only area of the
 country that is sewered. The foul sewer system is limited to the central Georgetown area and
 comprises a series of gravity sewers feeding 24 pumpingstations. The pumpingstations deliver
 into a common discharge main that ultimately delivers to the existing cast iron outfall at Fort
 Groyne. A second GRP outfall at the same site has failed and needs repair. The majority of
 collected waste is discharged untreated to the Demerara River via the outfall at Fort Groyne,
 although small non-functioning treatment facilities exist at Tucville and the University of
 Guyana, discharging untreated sewage into nearby drainage channels. Although bylaws exist to
 regulate construction and operation of on-site facilities, in many cases such bylaws are out-dated
 and poorly policed. Significant pollution of the urban watercourses and drainage channels i s
 occurring as a result of effluent from the facilities being piped directly to drainage channels,
 infrequent emptying of septic tanks resulting in low retention periods, inundation of facilities
 duringrainfall events anddisposal of solid waste from the facilities directly to drainage channels.

 It is anticipated that the Urban Development Programme (UDP) and the Georgetown I1
 Programme supported by the Inter-American Development Bank that has just started
 implementation, will address the existing problems in Georgetown. The UDP includes sectoral
 reform aimed at placing municipal services on a sustainable basis and a program of infrastructure
 investment. With respect to upgrading sanitation, the UDP includes preparation of best practise
 standard designs for on-site sanitation solutions, drafting a set of comprehensive bylaws and a
 structured programme of demonstration projects targeted particularly at the squatter areas. It is
 envisaged that this work will be undertaken inparallel with a hygiene promotion campaign.

 The Georgetown 11Project aims to improve the sanitary conditions of the population of
 Georgetown and reduce the current level of environmental degradation by addressing
 problems associated with the piped sewerage system in the capital, in particular continued
 rehabilitation of the pumping stations and provision of a sludge pre-treatment facility.

 The Project has two main objectives:


                                                  46

1. To improve the service leveland operational efficiency of the existing sewerage system.
2. To consolidate and further improvethe performance of GWI.

These objectives will be achieved by:

0    The rehabilitation of the existing sewage collection networks and the major refurbishment of
     the existing sewage pumpingstations and river outfall.
0    The addition of a sewage sludge pre-treatment facility to receive the discharge from the
     tanker trucks used to remove sludge from septic tanks of dwellings and businesses outside of
     the Georgetown Sewerage System service area.

Sanitation Arrangements in Coastal Strip and Project Sites


under the proposed Grant will be constructed - people rely on on-site sanitation facilities - pit
Outside central Georgetown and along the coastal strip - where the three subproject financed

latrines and septic tanks. On-site facilities are an appropriate means of sanitation in these less
densely populated areas, when they are properly constructed, operated and maintained. In
addition, the conclusions reached by the analytical work undertaken so far indicates that it would
not be cost effective or affordable to put infull sewerage systems in these areas.

Existing data39would confirm that there i s no risk to the groundwater from the use of pit latrines
and improvements to these would be the most cost effective way forward. Fundingto carry out
these improvements is contemplatedunder the line "Sanitation Improvements" of DfID's overall
sector investment program. The Sanitation Committee created one year ago i s defining a long-
term strategy for sanitation improvements albeit it i s recognised that a significant move away
from on-site facilities is not a short or mediumterm objective and any such move must be based
on sound economic and environmental principles.

Below is a description of the sanitation conditions in the three project sites:

 Lubproject     Villages covered    Iescription of Sanitation Arrangements


 Iivision 1     Walton Hall to        T h i s area includes the township of Anna Regina, with a total
                Dageraad              population of about 18,727 people, and a water demand of 3.37
                                      Mld. Within the township of Anna Regina, about 30% of the
                                      population have septic tanks, and 90% of these households retain
                                      their pit latrine.

                                      Overall, about 26% of the population have access to septic tanks
                                      with a water flush system, while 74% have only traditional pit
                                      latrines. As in Anna Regina, most septic tank owners would still
                                      have their original pit latrine on their premises, usually at the back
                                      of the yard, for use by visitors.

Division 2                    Overall about 51% of the population have access to septic tanks
(cont)                        with a water flush system, while 49% rely on the traditional pit
                              latrines. This figure is gradually changing as there is a general
                              desire to install septic tanks.

                              Septictank owners usually also retain their pit latrinesfor use
                              whenever they have a public function, with the septic tank being
                              kept for personaluse, and around 13% have both. When a yard
                              toilet i s built, usually on top of the septic tank housing, the pit
                              latrine is then filled in and the superstructure dismantled.

                           Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
                         Guyana: Water Sector ConsolidationProject

The Project will be implemented by GWI and coordinated through the utility's recently
established Asset Development Team (ADT). The ADT assumes responsibility within GWI for
coordinating the planningand implementation of capital projects supported through international
assistance.   The ADT is integrated into GWI management structure with strong links to
operational and financial management teams. The ADT builds upon GWI's recent successful
performance in the implementation of capital investment programs and reflects a commitment
within GWI and its Board to develop a more sustainable, integrated and operationally driven
approach to capital investment.

ADT Objectives: GWI's strategic objective is to have the ADT function as a medium- and long-
term capital planning department within the utility with the ability to effectively match capital
expenditure management with operational targets. More specifically, the objectives of the ADT
are two-fold: (i)  developing assets that are fully integrated at the technical level into the
production, distribution and customer service functions of GWI; and (ii)    developing assets that
fully enable the achievement of GWIsbusiness plan, License and M C targets.

h                     e                     : The ADT will manage a comprehensive process that
will include: (i)strategic business and asset management planningbased on a rolling analysis of
consumer demand, progress towards target coverage levels and operational parameters; (ii)
project preparation and presentation to donors based on overarching strategic priorities; (iii)
detailed project design in close coordination with operational units; (iv) supervision of project
execution; (v) transfer of physical assets to operational units.

GWIand the internationaldonors supportingthe Government's water sector reformprogramhave
made a strong commitment to developing a coordinated approach to supporting the ADT. Donors
and GWI have agreed to jointly support a pool of mid- and junior-level ADT technical and
support staff that will be mobilized strategically by GWI management to meet the evolving and
cyclical project implementation needs of donor-financed investment programs. A core group of
senior project managers will be dedicated to coordinate each donor-supported program. The
objective i s to avoid past practice of each donor program supporting discrete project units that
operate in silos with limited coordination and interaction. The GoG, DfID, IDB and IDA are
committed to supporting the ADT in the short-term while other donors will provide funding as
new projects become effective. The organizational chart attached below summarizes the ADT
structure.

The ADT i s being led by an internationally experienced engineer with extensive exposure to the
entire asset development process. The Team Leader participates as a key member of GWIsenior
management team and i s being supported by a Head of Asset Development and Program
Managers for each of the active donor-financed programs. Reporting to the Head of Asset
Development will be a core support unit with technical and administrative staff. A Project
Accountant based in the Finance Department and supported by a technical assistant in the ADT
will be responsible for the financial management aspects of all donor-financed programs. The
remainder of the ADT structure will include two senior engineers, a program officer, technical
and administrative support staff and project-specific social, environmental, M&E and related
specialists. These staff will be pooled, as described above, into a flexible group to be mobilized
according to periodic needs for implementation and supervision.

Further details on implementation arrangements for monitoring and reporting can be found in
Annex 7.

Role of GWI Board: The Board of GWI will provide strategic guidance to the utility during the
process of project implementation by reviewing progress periodically. Beyond the Project, the
Board will review and endorse the strategic investment priorities being identified by GWI senior
management and the ADT.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursement Arrangements
                          Guyana: Water Sector Consolidation Project


A preparation mission visited Guyana inFebruary, 2004 to conduct the initial assessment of the
financial management capacity of the Guyana Water Incorporated (GWI) to implement the Water
Sector Consolidation Project. The findings of the mission were modified to incorporate the
recommendations of the 2003 audit report and to reflect the actions being taken since that date to
strengthen the financial management arrangementsat GWI. Details-arecontained in the Financial
Management Assessment which can be found in the Project Files.

1.       Summary and Conclusions of Financial Management Assessment and Recent
         Developments

On the basis of the assessment performed and findings of the 2003 audit report, the overall
conclusions of the assessment are:

0)       GWI was found to have several structural gaps in its financial management system such
         as: (a) lack of a Financial Procedures Manual; (b) lack of an Administrative Manual; (c)
         lack of an up-to-date Fixed Asset Register; and (d) lack of a functioning customer
         accounting system (i.e. billings and collections system).

(ii) TheFinanceDepartmentwasstaffedwithrelativelyinexperiencedstaffanditlackeda
         functioning financial management information system. It currently has 2 fully qualified
         accountants - The Director and the Financial Accountant. The Finance Director has a
         private sector background and the experience and qualifications required. The staffing
         levels and skill mix of the Finance Department is satisfactory. Furthermorethe ACCPAC
         financial accounting software will be installed by July 31, 2005.

(iii) The2003 auditreportpreparedbytheOfficeoftheAuditorGeneral(OAG)indicated
         that GWI confronted at the time severe internal control problems, relating to contract
         management and oversight, poor accounting of customer payments and poor employee
         time recording which could possibly lead to a distorted wage bill.

With the advent of the management contract, it is expected that GWI financial management
systems would undergo considerable strengthening. The Fixed Asset Register has been updated
as of May 31, 2005. With the assistance of DfID, GWI i s in the process of acquiring a new
customer billing system. The timely implementation of these financial management
improvements has substantially addressedthe existing gaps in Financial Management at GWI

2.       Flow of Funds

The proceeds of the IDA Grant would be disbursed into a US Dollar denominated special account
 managed by GWI. The special account would be opened at the Bank of Guyana, Guyana's
Central Bank, under terms satisfactory to the IDA. The amount of the special account will be
based on the implementation progress of the Project. GWI will also operate a local currency
 Special Account to finance expenditures in local currency, where funds from the main US Dollar
 denominated Special Account will be periodically transferred (funds sufficient to cover no more
 than 30 days worth of expenditures) and will be operated in accordance with the procedures and
 guidelines set forth in IDA'SDisbursement Handbook. Since the Grant would be financing


                                                  53

approximately 90% of the total project costs, GWI would open a project account at a commercial
bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the IDA, to which the Govemment counterpart
funds would be deposited. Following the effectiveness of the Grant, the initial deposit shall be
limited to an amount equivalent to US$500,000 until the Association determines, based on the
amounts and frequency of withdrawal applications, that a higher balance i s necessary.All project
expenditures, both local and foreign incurred by GWI which fall below US$ 20,000 will be
financed out of GWI Special Account, which will be periodically replenished on the basis of
statement of expenditures (SOEs). For payments for eligible expenditures subject to IDA'Sprior
review and above US$50,000, the Finance Department would submit its withdrawal requests for
the use of the Grant proceeds to IDA, which will make direct payment to contractors, suppliers or
consultants.

3.      Accounting and Reporting

The Finance and Administration Department would be responsible for producing the Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on a quarterly basis to be submitted to the IDA. The format of the
WRs would be adapted to also meet the needs of other donors providingfundingto GWI. Given
that GWIi s a revenue generating entity, the content of the FMR would be expanded to include an
Executive Summary which would be consistent with periodic reports sent to GWI's Board. The
Executive Summary would also include data on billings, collections, coverage of operating and
maintenance costs, including depreciation and key operational data. The financial statements to
accompany the FMRs would include a balance sheet, an income statement and a cash flow
statement all prepared on an accrual basis. The specific content and format of the FMRs was
discussed and agreed duringnegotiations. The content of the FMRs would be different from the
standard FMRs in the Guidelines because GWI i s revenue generating entity. Subsequent to the
negotiations, efforts were made to reach an agreement with the donors and Government for GWI
to prepare a single set of FMRs which would be submitted GWI Management, the Government
and the donors. In accordance with IDA (and other donors') guidelines, the FMRs would be
expected to provide information for monitoring the financial, implementation and procurement
progress of the Project. The FMRs would also provide information about GWI's periodic
expenditures by disbursement categories, both by reporting period and cumulatively. They would
also include supporting schedules comparing planned versus actual expenditures as well as
schedules relating to receivables, creditors and debtors. These financial reports would also
provide the basis for preparing the schedules on the Project that would be included in GWI's
annual audit reports.

4.       Budgeting

 GWI's budgetingprocess is driven by active donor projects inthe sector. The ExecutiveDirector
 of Finance liaises with the Ministry of Housing and Water, the Ministry of Finance anddonors to
 ensure funds availability for on-going and planned capital projects. The level of the
 Government's contribution to GWI's budget is determined by its obligations resulting from the
 donors' assistance programs, its own investment priorities in the sector, and GWI's operating
 costs for the budget year. The respective Departments prepare their plans for the following year
 around September and the Management Accountant coordinates the integration of these
 individual departmental plans into a consolidated annual GWI-wide operating andcapital budget.
 Funds are drawn from the separate bank accounts linked to each donor to implement that
 particular donor's project.

5.      Auditingarrangements

Presently GWI's accounts are audited by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) of Guyana.
The OAG would continue to be GWI's external auditor under this project. The audits would be
carried out in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the IDA. It has been agreed that
the IDA and the IDB would utilize common Terms of Reference for the extemal audit. The
Terms of Reference would be discussed with other donors so that the audit report to be prepared
by the OAG would satisfy, to the extent feasible, the extemal audit requirements of all the donors
providing funds to GWI. The Terms of Reference would be expected to address the issues
identified by recent audit reports prepared by the OAG. The audit report would include the
following statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Sources and Uses
of Funds and Statement of Expenditures (SOE). It would also include specific schedules (e.g.
Aging of Accounts Receivable, ListTop Twenty Debtors, List of Top Twenty Creditors, etc.) that
would contain information on critical aspects of GWI's operations. GWI's annual audit report
will be required to be submitted to the IDA no later than 4 months following the end of GWI's
fiscal year (January -December).

6.      DisbursementArrangements.

Disbursements under the Project would be transaction based. Disbursements will be made on the
basis of full documentation, provided in advance, for all expenditures above the prior review
threshold. For all other eligible expenditures, goods costing less than US$lOO,OOO contracts for
consulting firms costing less than US$lOO,OOO and contracts for individual consultants costing
less than US$50,000 disbursement would be on the basis of SOEs. All direct contracting for
goods and single source selection for consultants would be subject to prior review regardless of
amount. The authorized allocation would be deposited into the Special Account; the authorized
allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to US$500,000 until the Association
determines, based on the amounts and frequencies of withdrawal applications, that a higher
balance i s necessary.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by GWI and coordinated through GWI's newly
established Asset Development Team (ADT). With regards to procurement aspects, the ADT is
being built on existing institutional capacity and current GWI staff who are already responsible
for coordinating and implementing capital projects supported by international assistance.

An assessment of the capacity of GWI as implementing agency to execute procurement actions
for the Project was camed out in the course of several missions to Guyana in 2004. The
assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementingthe Project and agreed on an
action plan with GWI. Most of the activities have been implemented during project preparation
andoutstanding activities are described below.

The Government has undertaken a reform of procurement aspects at a national level including the
passing of a new Procurement law. Further aspects of procurement reform - which are being
supported by the ongoing PSTAC - have been agreed upon by the Government and a
reassessment of the overall system will be made during project implementation. In light of these
initial reforms undertaken, the creation of the ADT, the experience of their staff in procurement
and the corrective measures which have been agreed with GWI (see Action Plan below), the
overall project risk for procurement is AVERAGE.

Action Plan

Inorder to mitigate the procurementimplementation risks, the following action planis proposed:

     ADT to be properly staffedfor the expresspurpose of managingand delivering GWI's capital
     expenditure plan, includingIDA-fundedintervention. Contracting of the Project Manager is
     underway.
     Preliminary training in procurement to be provided by IDA to the ADT and other GWI staff
     related to procurement activities, by effectiveness. Seminar on procurement to cover
     consulting services, shopping and NCB. This preliminary training session has been scheduled
     for 14-15 July 2005. Further training sessionswill be provided duringthe lSfyear as required.
     Preparation by the ADT of an Operations Manual with a specific chapter on procurement,
     detailing all the procedures and channels of responsibilities and flow of documentation, and
     including as annexes copies of draft standard bidding documents. Due for review and no
     objection by IDA as a condition of disbursement of categories (1) and (2) of the Project,
     corresponding to goods and works.
     Establishment of a procurement filing system, to be subsequently submitted for IDA'Sno
     objection, to be discussed duringthe July mission.

 C. Procurement Plan

The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Recipient
and the Project Team on May 17-18 and i s available at GWI's offices in Georgetown. It will also
be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan
will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual
 status of project implementation.




                                                 59

D. Frequencyof Procurement Supervision

In addition to the prior review to be camed out from Bankoffices, atraining and orientation IDA
mission has been scheduled for July 2005. Supervision missions, including a post review of
procurement actions, will be carried out annually after the start of implementation but may take
place more frequently during the first year, if deemed necessary following the July training and
orientation sessions.

                            Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                           Guyana: Water Sector Consolidation Project


The proposed Water Sector Consolidation Project i s economically feasible, according to a
detailed economic analysis practiced on each one of its components, and enhanced by elaborate
sensitivity and risk analyses.

1.        Objectives

The objective of the Water Sector Consolidation Project i s to support the achievement of
sustainable universal access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially
the poor. The Project objective i s basically improving the water quality and the reliability of
water supply inthe Project areas. On the basis of this objective, the cost benefit analysis was used
to determine the economic viability of the investment projects that will be partially financed by
IDA.

2.        Methodology

The cost benefit analysis is appraised from three perspectives: financial, economic, and
distributive analysis. To determine the net incremental costs and benefits, "with" and "without"
project scenarios were constructed. The "with" project situation assumedthat all targets expected
within the investment project would be met.                The "without" project situation assumed that
performance and indicators of GWI would continuedunchanged. On the basis of these scenarios,
the incremental financial benefits and costs of the proposed investment programs were assessed.
The stream of financial flows is then adjusted for the impact of taxes and subsidies to arrive at the
economic flows of costs and benefits.

3.        Project Components

The Project consists of four basic components: (i) investment for the construction and
                                                             capital
rehabilitation of three water infrastructure subprojects, each within an operating division of GWI;
(ii)design project management and supervision; (iii)institutional strengthening; and (iv)
emergency component.

The cost benefit analysis was done for each subproject (including the cost of infrastructure,
design, project management and supervision under component 1 and 2) in the three regions of
Guyana corresponding to the operating divisions of GWI: Division 1 (Anna Regina), Division 2

components - including the minor works under the emergency component - was added to each
(Parika), and Division 4 (Rosignol), and for the whole project. The cost of the remaining

subproject according to the number of beneficiaries. The investment costs are as follows:

4.       Scenarios

To identify the incremental costs and benefits resulting from each subproject, "with" and
"without" project scenarios were built for each of them. The "with" project scenario considered
the proposed investment plan and its associated targets.          The "without" project scenario
considered the service would continue unchanged, that is, current performance, coverage, NRW
levels and other operational indicators.

5.       Assumptions

Investment Costs. Include final designs, project preparation, physical contingencies and
supervision. "With" and "without" project scenarios included connection costs generated from
population growth, but only the "with" project scenario included the connection costs generated
from larger coverage, when applicable. The "with" project scenario also included all project
costs plus replacement costs of meters andelectromechanical equipment.

Operation and maintenance (ObM): Includes the cost of labor, chemicals, power, and all
administrative costs. O&M costs for the "without" project scenario were based on current unit
costs. O&M costs for the "with" project scenario included all the operating costs generated with
the Project and efficiency gains that were expected to be achieved. Labor costs were calculated
as the number of employees per 1,000 water connections (labor productivity) times the number of
connections times the average cost per employee. Chemical and energy costs were calculated
based on projected volume of water produced and unit costs. Other costs were calculated as
percentage of direct costs.

Theopportunity costs of raw water were assumedequal to zero.

Per capita water consumption is calculated as the weighted average of the current consumption of
metered and non-metered households. GWI estimated the consumption for each division in the
"without" and "with" project situation. In Division 1 the consumption per capita per day was 59
liters in the "without" project, and 120 l/cap/d in the "with" project situation. In Division 2 and4
the consumptionwas estimated as 120l/cap/day inboth situations.

 Water billed for metered customers is calculated as the volume of water billed times the tariffs.
For non-metered customers it i s calculated as number of connections times the flat fee charged to
 these customers. Current tariff for metered customers i s G$ 37 (US$ 0.20/m3), and for non-
 metered customers the monthly fixed bill is G$428 (US$2.39).

 Collected Revenue equals billed revenue times billing rate, times collection of billing rate. The
 targets to be reached in each subproject are: billingrate of at least 90% (up from current 60% in
 Division 1, and 68% inDivision 4) and collection of billing rate 90% (up from 85% inDivision 1,
 35% in Division 2, and 73% in Division 4).

 Non-revenue water, defined as volume of water not billed over volume of water supplied is
 projected accordingto targets on the Project. NRW was projected to reach 25% in all areas of the
 Project, from current values of around 59%.

6.       IncrementalCostsandBenefits

Costs andbenefits associated with the "with" and "without" project scenarios are projected for 30
years, that is, during the implementation period and until the full impact of the Projects i s
obtained. The cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12 percent which is estimated
to be a proxy of Guyana's opportunity cost of capital. Benefits from the water supply projects
include the reduction or elimination of intermittent water supply, water quality improvement, and
service coverage increase.

7.       Evaluation

The Project i s evaluated from three different perspectives. The$nancial viability of each of the
projects i s appraised measuring its flows of costs and benefits in market prices, which focus the
evaluation on the subgroup of the population directly affected by the Project. Under a financial
perspective, benefits are assumed equal to the estimated flow o f financial revenues. That is,
financial benefits are defined as equal to tariffs times estimated consumption, times collection
rate. The economic viability is appraised measuring the flows of costs and benefits in economic
prices, which corresponded to stream of financial flows adjusted for the impact of taxes and
subsidies. Under an economic perspective, benefits are measured through the savings the           .
population will have by not having to treat the water and by having continuity of water supply.
The distributive analysis identifies winners and losers among the different groups in society with
interests and stakes in the Project: the Government, the water company and their customers,
suppliers, and the inhabitants of the Project areas in general. Finally, the sensitivity and risk
analysis enhances the accuracy of financial and economic analyses by incorporating uncertainties
of the real world into the analyses.

8.        FinancialAnalysis

The financial analysis of each subproject measured the flow of costs and benefits for each
subproject in market prices. Financial benefits were calculated as: (i)       the increase in revenues
generated in better collection rates and higher volume of water billed, and (ii)      the reduction in
operating costs due to decrease of NRW. The financial analysis was done under different tariff
scenarios and subsidies schemes. The following table shows the results for three scenarios, two of
them for extreme situations: (i)  with current tariffs and no subsidy on investment; (ii) current
                                                                                          with
tariffs and investment with 100% of subsidy. The last one which will be the base case scenario
included the same tariffs scheme used for the financial projections, which considers an increase
of 47% in tariffs.

The results of these scenarios show that if there i s no increase in tariffs and no subsidy is granted,
there will be a financial loss of US$6.3 million in the whole period. On the other hand if there i s
no increase in tariffs and 100% of investment cost is granted there will be a financial profit of
US$ 2 million. If there i s an increase o f 47% in tariffs as it i s currently planned by GWI, and
there i s no subsidy, there will still be losses of US$5 million which would have to be covered by
the operator or the Government. This implies that in order to make the Project financially viable
there will be needed an additional increase in tariffs or a grant to partially finance investment.
The break-even point is reached when tariffs are increased by 47% as planned and there i s a
subsidy from the Govemment of 53% of investments.

   9.        Economic Analysis

   The economic viability of each project i s appraised measuring the flows of costs and benefits in
   economic prices, which corresponded to stream of financial flows adjusted for the impact of taxes
   and subsidies. Under an economic perspective, benefits were measured through the population's
   savings generatedby not treating the water and having continuity of water supply.

   Estimation of Economic Benefits

   The Project will have the following benefits: (i) quality improvement. At present, no
                                                               water
   customers receive treated water. Within the target area, GWI delivers the water without treatment
   or disinfection, which forces customers to boil or bleach water; (ii)       continuity, it is expected that
   consumers will be provided a 24-hour service at their taps and at adequate flow. Currently
   customers receive the service less than 12 hours a day depending on the area. To avoid problems
   caused by intermittent water, customers look for alternative sources of water such as installation
   of rainwater collection systems, and purchase water from vendors; (iii) reduction of operating
   costs, the operating cost will decrease due to lower volume of water produced due to decrease of
   NRW; and (iv) health improvement, project implementation is expected to lead to a reduction in
   water-borne diseases.

   Economic benefits are assumed equal to the savings the population will have once the Project is
   implemented. GWI estimated the savings as follows: (i)cost of boiling water at G$42 per
   household per day; (ii)cost of purchasingbottle water at G$ 79 per household per day4', and the
   cost of installation and maintenance of rainwater collection systems at G$ 19,000.


   41 Assuming a personal consumption figure of 2.5 Ycapld and an occupancy rate of 4, the average cost of
   boiling water is estimated to be G$ 42 per household. Bottled water current costs G$ 300 per 5-gallon
   container, giving an annual cost of G$ 28,800 assuming each household uses two bottles per week. The
   estimated costs for installing a rainwater harvesting system is G$ 19,000, to which the cost of boiling the
   collected water must still be added.


                                                        65

The economic benefits of the Project for each household are represented by the area under the
demand curve defined for the range between the consumption level "with" and "without" the
Project, and the resource savings that consumers will have as a result of the Project for
substitutingthe use of more expensive sources.

The estimation of economic benefits is considered conservative as the impact on health was found
difficult to quantify, thus conservatively was not included in the analysis. Other benefits such as
possible impact on the local economy via increased industrialltourism opportunities were also
excluded from the analysis.

The results of the economic analysis show that all components of the Project are economically
feasible and so they will have a positive impact in the economy.

10.      Distributive Analysis

The distribution of positive extemalities, the difference between the economic and financial cash
flows, i s analyzed to determine who benefits from and who pays the cost of the Project. Under the
financial scenario in which customers pay tariffs as projected by GWI with the increase of 47%,
they will be the big winners, with estimated benefits of US$ 21 million. The Govemment will
collect taxes from project investment of about US$1million. As stated above, under this scenario
a subsidy on investment of about US$ 5 million is needed to avoid losses for GWI, and in this
case the Govemment would have a net cost of US$4 million.

11.       Sensitivityand Risk Analysis

This analysis is done to confirm the robustness of the economic and financial benefits of the
Project. The scenario taken for the financial analysis was the one with increases in tariffs
accordingto the financial projections (47%) and Govemment subsidy of 53% of investment costs.


 Semitivim Analysis. Based on a series of sensitivity analyses, some variables were identified as
 those conveying major risks to the expected outcome of the different subprojects.                     These
 variables include possible overruns in investment costs, overrun in operating and maintenance
 costs, lower improvement of collection rate and non-revenue water, lower increase in tariffs,



                                                   66

variation of the monthly expense of boiling water, and variation of the monthly expense of
avoiding water rationing. The impact and risk significance of the risk variables is summarized in
the following table.

  Risk Variables and their Impact and Risk Signijicance
 Risk                           Impact and Significance

 InvestmentCost Overrun         Direct impact on investmentcosts. Largely under GWI control. Conveys a low risk
                                to the economic results. With project cost overrunof more than 300% the economic
                                result would be negative. When financial results are analyzed, the situation i s more
                                 sensitive, given that an increasein 20% of investment costs would imply an increase
                                inGovemment subsidy of US$0.4 millionto makethe Projectfinancially viable.
 O&M Cost Overrun                Direct impact on operationcost. Largely under GWI control. Conveys a low risk to
                                the economic results. O&M costs could increase 300% and still the Project would
                                 have positive results. Regarding financial results, an increase in 20% of operating
                                 costs would imply an increase of Govemmentsubsidy of US$0.3 million
 Collection Rate                Direct impact on financial revenues. If collection rate remains at its current values,
                                 the Government subsidy will have to increaseby at least US$ 1.1 million to make the
                                 Projectfinancially viable.
 Non revenue water               Direct impact on costs.       If non-revenue water remains at current levels, the
                                 Government subsidy has to increase by at least US$0.9 million to make the Project
                                 financially viable. Regardingeconomic results, non-revenue water could remain at
                                 current values andthe Project would still have positive results.
 Tariff increase                 Iftariffs remain at current values, the increase of Government subsidy would be of
                                 about US$ 1.2 million.
 Monthly expenses of boiling     Direct impact on benefits. Basedon actual cost paid for boiling water. This variable
 water                           conveys a low risk. This variable needs to be reducedby 200% to tum negative the
                                 economic NPV retumof the Project
 Monthly expenseof avoiding Direct impact on benefits. Based on actual costs paid to avoid problems with
 water rationing                 continuity. Even with decrease of loo%, the Projectwould have apositiveoutcome.

Risk Analysis. To enhance the accuracy of the economic analysis, the uncertainties of the real
world were approximated through the use of Monte Carlo simulation using the Crystal Ball
software, This software measures the extent of various risks and their impact on the Project, by
modeling a likely distribution for each risk variable and the resulting outcome. Based on a
simulation of 1,000 trials, the model recalculated the results of the economic analysis by
 simultaneously changing each of the selected risk variables.                     The assumed distribution of
probabilities and their respective specifications for each variable are presented as follows.

                          Guyana: Water Sector ConsolidationProject


1. Introduction
The proposed operation has been rated by QAT as category B for IDA processing purposes. The
Project would continue to support the GoG implementation of the 1996Environmental Protection
Act. Project activities are not expected to face any unusual environmental risks.

As part of Project preparation, GWI has developed an internal procedure, in compliance with
IDA'S safeguards, to assess the environmental impact of water supply system expansions,
renovations and operations. The procedure includes: (i)   the development of a screening tool and
the Environmental Guidelines for Construction Projects; (ii) application of the screening tool
                                                              the
to the three investment subprojects to produce the investment subprojects Environmental
Assessments; and (iii) definition of Corporate Environmentaland Social Guidelines, including
                        the
a corporate environmental statement. All of these documents can be found inthe Project files.

This Annex presents the environmental assessment of one of three water supply expansion sites
investigated (all three environmental assessments are in the Project files) It exemplifies the
application of the screening tool developed. The Environmental Guidelines for Construction
Projects provide recommendations to avoid mitigate and ameliorate negative environmental
impacts through the development and implementation of Environmental Management Plans
(EMP) to be approvedby GWI, and revisitedby IDA.

Community consultation is incorporated in developed procedures as well as disclosure of the
environmental assessmentresults. GWIwill, once the EMPis developed andapproved andbefore
construction work starts, introduce the contractor to the community, explain the expected impacts
and the mitigation measures incorporated in the EMP designed by the contractor, introduce the
contractor's community liaison and contact person in GWI to attend community inquiries and
seek prompt resolution.

Below is a summary of the Action Plan for social and environmental issues agreed upon with
GWI.

3.1      SummaryofProject

The Project area extends from Walton Hall to Queenstown inclusive of both villages, taking in
the primary population centre of Anna Regina. The projected population in 2024 covered by the
intervention i s 18,727, generating an average water demand of 3.37 Mld. The proposed project
comprises of the following components:

e the drilling of one new well at Lima;
e the construction of a gravity-type treatment plant at Lima including aeration, pH adjustment,
    oxidation, filtration anddisinfection;
e the construction of a nominal capacity 1,650 m3ground level storage reservoir at Lima;
e the construction of a booster pump station, chemical storage, electrical panels and installation
    of stand-by generator;
e installation of gate, check and air valves throughout the system in appropriate locations;
e construction of an 18.2   kmlong200 mmdiameter transmission main;
e rehabilitation of existing distribution network;
e installation of flow-meters at appropriate locations to monitor consumption; and
e   provision of domestic flow meters for all customers within project area;

3.2      ProjectEnvironmentalSummary

The main potential negative impacts of the Project that require careful management are as
follows:
  -    disposal of chlorinated water used to initially shock chlorinate the new transmission mains;
  a    storage, handling and use of chlorine for on-site disinfection will have to comply with the
       highest safety regulations to both mitigate against the likelihood of a leak occurring, and
       minimize the impact of a leak if one did occur;
  -
  1    traffic congestion, air quality problems and noise pollution duringconstruction;
       construction material storage and transportation;
       disposal of water treatment sludge in such away as to avoid clogging of drainage channels

   .   and waterways;

   -   The key positive environmental impacts are:

       water demand within the target area will be managed and reduced, lesseningthe stress
       placedupon Guyana's groundwater resources;
       water of a higher safety and aesthetic standard will be delivered to residents within the
       target area.

                            Annex 11: FinancialAssessmentof GWI
                          Guyana: Water Sector ConsolidationProject


I.Objectives

A general financial assessment of the Guyana Water Inc (GWI) was carried out to analyze the
company's operational efficiency, and financial sustainability prospects with and without
compliance of the targets of the Management Contract. The assessment was done on the basis of
historical financial statements for 2003 and 2004, and the management contract signed with
Sevem Trent Water International in January 2003.            The evaluation was prepared using
commercial, operational, and financial indicators and statements provided in GWI's Final
Revised Strategic Plan.

11.     Methodology

GWI's management team has developed a comprehensive spreadsheetmodel presenting in detail
two years of historical results (2003, 2004) and four years projections based on the expected
outcome under the Management Contract. The model was prepared including all commercial and
operational targets to be reached under the MC.

The model was used for this analysis building for the projected years (2005-2008) different
scenarios according to levels of compliance of the targets of the MC.

For each scenario the performance of the Company was assessed based on the following
indicators:

Operational Indicators

    0   Cost to Income Ratio (with and without depreciation);
    0   Percentageof unpaid water and sewerage bills,
    0   Bad customer debts to revenues
    0   Net present value of free cash flows from operations
    0   Percentage of investments financed by own resources

The financial analysis presented in this Annex i s distinct from the Project cost-benefit cost
presented in Annex 9. The cost-benefit analysis calculates the net benefits generated by each
project investment activity on an incremental basis ("with project" and "without project"
scenarios). The financial assessment presented in this Annex analyzes the viability of the
company as it i s most likely to evolve following the implementation of the proposed projects
("with project" scenario only).

111.    CurrentFinancialSituation

Even though the Government has taken some important steps in the last two years to improve the
performance of the water and sanitation sector in Guyana, the company still does not show
healthy financial results and it remains insolvent. The main problems shown in the fmancial
results of GWI(See Table 5) are:




                                                86

    0    Tariffs do not cover operating costs. When depreciation is not included, tariffs cover
         about 80% of operating costs. When depreciation i s included, tariffs are below 70% of
         operating costs.
    a    Current tariffs are enough to cover just energy and personnel costs. Energy costs reap
         more than 65% of all operating costs.
    0    There i s high dependency on external sources to run the company, in the last two years
         there was subvention from the Government of 13% and 54% of income just to cover
         operating costs. The subvention was not enough to cover losses and thus the company
         showed net losses of 29% of income in2003 andprofit of 10% in 2004.
    0    The commercial performance, although improved during 2004, i s still very poor. Billing
         collection rate i s about 75% account receivable comparator i s 7.5 months, and provision
         for bad customers debt i s 17% of income. In addition, non-revenue water, although
         significantly improved from 2003 levels, i s still 50%.
    0    Coverage of metering is barely 24%.

IV. ProjectedSituation

For the following years, better results are expected, given that GWI i s working to achieve the
targets and it could be possible to reach some targets for continuity of supply, revenue metering,
wastewater disposal efficiency, customer complaints and Hinterland coverage. The tariff i s
expected to increase as a result of the review to be undertaken in 2005 and to be restructured in
June 2005 with a view of achieving full cost recovery.


commercial indicators and additional increases intariffs are implemented(See Table 5 - Financial
Under these premises, a base case scenario was built, assuming the following targets for

Statements of GWI).

If these assumptions are reached, GWI would be able to build a solid basis to reach financial
stability and be independent of extemal sources to pay for operating costs. In addition GWI
would be able to generate cash to partially pay for investment costs.

As shown in table 3, tariffs would cover operating costs by 2007, and GWI would have a net
income margin of 19%. Moreover, 22% of capital expenditure could be fianced with intemal
sources. That means transfer from donors could be reduced by about GY$ 1,300 million (US$ 7
million).

With a reduction of almost 10points inNRW andbetter management of energy usage, the energy
cost could be reduced and decrease its participation inoperating costs from 65% in 2004 to 61%
in 2007. This savings could be further enhanced through the implementation of the energy
efficiency project currently under consideration.

Even though some important efficiency improvement i s assumed for this scenario, there i s still
 ample room for additional progress in all commercial and operational indicators, when targets are
 compared with intemational standards.

 V.       Sensitivity Analysis

 A sensitivity analysis is made to show the negative impact on financial stability of GWI incase
 some of the premises were not reached. Assuming that NRW, billing collection rate or tariffs do
 not improve, or that electricity cost increases, GWI will not be financially healthy and it would




                                                     88

  depend on transfers to cover operating costs and be unable to participate in financing investment
  costs.

  Comparing the changes with the base case scenario, in which there is an increase in tariffs of
  47%, table 4 shows as the worst case scenario the one with no tariff increase, in which GWI
  would have operating losses, and would need transfer from the Government to cover the losses
  (about US$ 1.2 million in the period). A similar situation would occur if NRW does not get
  betterandremains at current values, which would generate additional lossesof US$O.9 million.

  Ifthereisnoimprovementinbillingcollectionratetheimpactoncashflowavailablefor
  investment will be important and additional transfers from donors andGovernment needed would
  be of about US$ 1.2 million. On the other handif electricity costs increasesby 12% in 2005 there
  will be a reduction of internal cash close to US$ 2 million (Table 4), even when energy efficiency
  and reduction of NRWare considered.

  VI.      Conclusion

  It is then critical for the long term sustainability of the sector that GWI complies with the MC
  targets and improves its operationalefficiency, includingan energy efficiency programto manage
  electricity costs. If any of these targets are not met GWI would present operating losses and
  additional grants would be needed. The proposed Project aims to support the achievement of
  these improvements. It is also equally important that the Government maintains its commitment
  to review tariffs regularly to achieve cost recovery.

1.       Introduction

The Management Contract signed by the Govemment and Sevem Trent fixes'final targets for
seven performance indicators or criteria and establishes that yearly targets for each of them will
be agreedupon once the baseline figure for 2003 (year inwhich STWI took over the operation of
the utility) was to be known after the first year of operations. The seven specific sector targets
are the following:

As envisaged under the MC, in February 2004 STWI completed a proposal for the 2003 baseline
figures for each of these indicators, which was reviewed by an independent expert, Halcrow
Group Ltd, in June 2004. Halcrow's review set out the baseline figures and then the targets for
the next five years were set. According to this review, the 2003 baseline values and yearly targets
are the following:

T h i s Annex aims to describe the progress made by GWI towards achieving the performance
targets set for Year 2 of the Management Contract (2004), as well as the main issues and
challenges for the achievement of these targets throughout the life of the MC.

The M C defines Non-revenue Water as:


                  (Volumeof water supplied (Mld) Volume of water billed(Mld)
                                                        -
                                                                                              x 100 %
                                    Volume of water supplied(Mld)


GWIclaims that the value reached at the end of 2004 was 50% which - considering the baseline
figure of 61% in 2003 - is a very significant progress. Nine new District Meter Areas (DMA's)
have been introduced since June 2004 and GWI i s fixing service connections, and occasionally
fixing bigger leaks, however more work needs to be done to reduce leakage inthose new DMA's
and other areas. Part of the problem is the difficulty in locating the bigger leaks, due to
insufficient availability of leakage detection equipment.




                                                      92

The reduction of losses and unaccounted-for-water is the single most important target and the
financial viability of GWI very much depends on the reduction of NRW - mainly through the
reductionof electricity costs - as evidenced inAnnex 11.

As the recent Output-for-Purpose review undertaken by DfiDunderlined, there is also a question
-raisedbyHalcrow intheir independentreview-astothe appropriatenessofthemeasurement
used in the MC. Without fixing the leakages first, as GWI increases the level of continuity of
service from current levels to 24 hours, the amount of NRW (in terms of Mld) will increase
mainly because most of the water pumped into the main at night will find its way out through the
leaks46.This will have the adverse effect of increasing leakage. According to DfID's review,
measuring NRW as a percentage renders its achievement as not compatible with the achievement
of continuity of service. The likely way forward would be for NRW to be measuredby another
method, or changing this target to a real losses target47.This issue will be discussed amongst the
relevant stakeholders during 2005 as the GoG, STWI and GWI move forward in the
implementation of the Action Plan includedinthe Roadmap to Success. The measurementof this
Project's key performance indicator for reduction of non-revenue water would be adjusted
accordingly to ensure consistency inthe monitoring procedures.

Continuity of service i s defined in the contract as: "The number of hours per day that all
connected customers receive pressurized water supply at their premises. Pressurized water supply
i s defined as minimum5.0 metres at customer premises".
As mentioned above, at the present moment with the current level of leakages there seems to be
an incompatibility between achieving 2417 service and reducing the NRW percentage. Although
the target for the year 2004 - 12 hours of continuous service at a pressure of at least 5 meters -
will not be met, there has been significant improvement since 2003. Current levels claimed by
GWI are showing an increase in the average service from 2.7 hours to 4.3 hours at the end of
2004.
GWIhas done several tests in several areas runningthe pumps into supply for 24 hours and has
concluded that 2417 supplies will be difficult to achieve without the introduction of elevated
 storage - but elevated storage would not be effective unless the levels of leakage are reduced
 considerably from current levels. Furthermore, the investment program developed by KPMG in
 19991 2000 concluded that it was not economic to install elevated storage across the flat
 geography of the coastal strip of Guyana. Consequently, it may be more beneficial within the
 short to medium term to relax the need to achieve 24/7 levels of service and adjust the situation.
 GWI has the intention of completing a study to investigate this option further as well as the
 appropriateness of the elevated storage solution. This issue will be discussed amongst the relevant


 46 According to Appendix A of the Baseline Year Data Report preparedby     STWI, during August 2003 with 15 hours
 pumpingthe NRW was 217.4Mld andinDecemberthis figure was 144.7 with only 12 hours of pumping.
 47 A possibility would be to use the Infrastructure Leakage Index or ILI for measuring the progress. The ILIis a
 measure of how well a distribution network is managed(maintained, repaired andrehabilitated) for the control of real
 losses, at the current operating pressure. It is the ratio of Current Annual Volume of Real Losses to Unavoidable
 Annual Real Losses. If the ILIwas used, GWI would have a value of 62, comparing with 8.5 inBoston(USA) or 2 in
 Bristol Water (UK)and 114inCahul(Moldova) or 278 inDushanbe (Tajikistan).

stakeholders during the next Water Thematic Group in 2005. The objective of these discussions
will be to explore ways to move forward most likely involving a study on viability of achieving
24/7 service in Guyana. Based on the outcomes of the study, a revised target for the MC may be
proposed. This Project's key performance indicator for continuity of service will be reviewed
accordingly at such time to ensure consistency, although according to the feasibility studies for
this Project, 24/7 service is achievable in the areas included in the three investment subprojects -
given that the three subprojects include rehabilitation of the networks resulting in reduced
leakage.

According to the Output-to-Purpose review conducted by DfID, GWI is likely to have achieved
the Year 2 target of 75.8%. In the third quarter of 2004 the estimated revenue collection figure
was 75.1% and thus on course to hit the target by year-end.

The new billing system will probably be fully operational at the end of 2005. The determination

too long -almost 2 and a half years into the contract - and this has obviously impacted the ability
of the need for a new billing system, the decision to change it and its implementation has taken

GWI's 2004 metering plan included the installation of 13,700 meters under the LBI project and
5,136 meters under the Georgetown I1project. This would give a total of 18,836 meters planned
for the year. The target for 2004 should have been inthe region of 24,250 installed meters, which
already indicates that Year 2 target could not be achieved under the current investment and
financing plan. This situation has been exacerbated by delays in both of these projects, and at the
time of the 2004 Output-for-Purpose review only 6,000 meters of the LBI project were likely to
be installed in 2004 which would place the Year 2 Indicator in24%, up from 20% in2003.

Achievement of the annual targets will be dependent upon the level of capital investment - not
just for the meters but for treatment facilities to remove the iron that would otherwise damagethe
meters. The proposed project will support the achievement of this target inthe Project areas.

48The new billing systemshould also enable GWI to report on the "age" of debt, since at the moment it is not possible
to identify the amount of collections in 2004 that relate to old debt. This is important information that GWI should
reporton once the new billing systemis inplace.

There i s no requirement within the Management Contract to set a Year 1 baseline for this
indicator and although new forms and procedures to record and follow up complaints and their
resolution has been set up by GWI, it is difficult to monitor accurately the compliance with the
targets until the new "billing" system i s in place. This new billing system will also log all
customer complaints in a more professional manner. Improvements in this area include the
implementation of a more sophisticated telephone system to enable clients to record their
complaints and a "leakage line" telephone number to enable leaks to be reported more quickly by
customers.

The new billing system will need to be effectively implemented and operated by the end of 2005
order to measure and meet this indicator.

Delays in approval of the final Hinterland report and strategy, coupled with difficulties anddelays
in appointingnew staff to runthe programas well as weaknesses in the procurementprocesshave
meant no progress made in the achievement of this indicator during 2004. However, new staff
has now been appointed, including the new local Hinterland Manager. The plan is in place, and
GWIexpects to have completed most of what they should have achieved inYear 2 by the middle
of Year 3. Achievement of the overall Year 3 target will require considerable efforts from all of
the stakeholders.

9.          Conclusions

Although significant improvements have taken place in most of the indicators, 6 out of the 7
targets have not been met in Year 2. In principle and under the MC, this would be cause for
termination of the Contract, and will result in no incentive compensation to the Operator.
However, the Govemment and the donor community have acknowledgedthat considerable efforts
have been made to turn around GWI, reflecting on issues which are not directly attributable to
meeting a specific performance target, like overall improvement in the level of services, health
and safety, integration of the two former companies, staff training, improvement of management
systems, customer relations and better use of information. It should also be noted that almost all
the targets set are fundingdependant, and the operator does not have direct control of the finance
required to deliver the necessary levels of capital investment, which seriously reduces the ability
to meet the targets that depend on such investment.

As described elsewhere in this document, in the recent meetings that took place in Guyana in
December 2004 between the Govemment and STWI, both parties and other stakeholders to the
MC, including the donor community, reiterated their commitment to work together to develop a
way forward, and not focus solely on the composite performance score, since not all of the causes
for performance not being at its anticipated level are within the sole or direct control of the
private operator. Also, and as mentioned above, there are some doubts as to whether all of the
targets set in the MC are compatible with the levels of affordable investment foreseen at the
inception of the reform. A debate involving all stakeholders may be needed to close this gap.
The agreement between the Govemment and S T W I to continue the efforts to make the M C
succeed through the implementation of the agreed Action Plan and Roadmap will provide
adequate forum for holdingthis debate as the MC moves forward.
