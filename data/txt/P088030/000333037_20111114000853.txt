F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project development objective is to support the achievement of sustainable universal
access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially the poor.
This Project will also help to consolidate the water sector modernization and reform
process supported by IDA and other donors in recent years. Specifically, the Project will:

  - Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of
treatment facilities in the coastal water supply systems in regions 2, 3 and 5.

                                                                                                vi
  - Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already
connected to the service.
  - Provide the technical assistance needed to allow for the sustainable development of
water resources in Guyana, and support the modernization and financial sustainability of
GWI.
  - Through the emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after
the January 2005 floods.

                          x
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Guyana Water Sector Consolidation was initiated in response to a comprehensive
Reform Program in the water sector, investment needs in the sector, and in the aftermath of
severe flooding in the country. The core objective was to improve access and quality of water in
three different urban and peri-urban areas of the country and support broader institutional
strengthening activities.

2.       Water Sector Reform: In 2000 Guyana embarked on a major and comprehensive Reform
Program for the water and sanitation sector. Reforms were led by the GoG with the assistance of
the donor community, with the goal of providing sustainable universal access to safe and
affordable water for the population of Guyana. Reforms implemented before appraisal had
facilitated a complete reorganization of the water and sanitation sector around three key
principles and aspirations:

      A modern, efficient and customer-oriented utility
      Long-term financial sustainability
      A governance and institutional framework characterized by independent regulatory
       functions and a clear division of responsibilities

3.      Key achievements of the Reform Program at the time of appraisal in 2005 included: (i)
The establishment of a modern legal, regulatory and institutional framework under the Water and
Sewerage Act of 2002; (ii) The creation of Guyana Water Inc (GWI) through the merger of the
two water utilities, GS&WC and GUYWA in 2002 and (iii) The award of a performance-based
“Management Contract? for five years to an international operator - Severn Trent Water
International (STWI) in January 2003.

4.     At the time of appraisal, achieving financial sustainability at GWI was a big challenge
primarily due to high electricity costs, insufficient tariff levels, and overall modest revenue
growth. As a result, the GoG had to extend operating subsidies of over US $7.5 million in 2004
and 2005 to GWI.

5.     Investment Plan to Address Service Deficiencies: At appraisal there were deficiencies in
the quality and coverage of water supply services in Guyana. Major problems with the safety,
continuity, and reliability of supply persisted both along the coastal strip (home to 90% of
Guyana‟s population) and in the severely under-serviced Hinterland region (which comprises
over 95% of the land area). The lack of source water treatment in some of the areas serviced by
GWI posed risk of bacteriological contamination. Most parts of the serviced areas - both in
Georgetown and outside the capital -experienced low water pressure and intermittent supply.
There was also a need to improve the operations, management, and level of service.




                                                                                           1
6.      To respond to these needs GWI developed a Ten Year Investment Program as part of the
May 2005 GWI Strategic Plan. The GWI Ten Year Investment Program outlined a
comprehensive investment program to substantially improve access to safe and reliable water.
7.      Flooding in Guyana: Beginning in late December 2004, exceptionally heavy rainfall in
Guyana resulted in severe flooding within the coastal administrative regions of West
Demerara/Essequibo Islands, Demerara/Mahaica, and Mahaica/West Berbice. These areas are
inhabited by 75 percent of Guyana‟s population and include the capital city, Georgetown. The
flooding along the coast, between the Demerara and Mahaica rivers, had seriously inhibited
GWI‟ s ability to supply potable water (approximately 164,000 people affected) and to dispose
of wastewater in the affected areas. Immediately after the flooding occurred, IDA sent a team
specialized in disaster management to conduct a preliminary needs assessment.

8.      Water Sector Consolidation Project: The Water Consolidation Project was developed by
taking advantage of IDA‟s experience in the water sector globally and in Guyana. The Water
Consolidation Project was designed to respond to the need for further support of the sector
reform, to develop GWI‟s capacity, and to provide funding for investment financing under the
Ten Year Investment Program. Since the timing of the appraisal coincided with the 2005 floods,
the Project design also incorporated adequate response to the associated impacts on water
infrastructure. The Project was designed to provide $10.1 million (out of the $170 million needed
in the Ten Year Investment Plan) of investments in water supply. Additionally, the Project would
strategically leverage IDA engagement through the small institutional development component
(US$0.3 million) to remain engaged in the larger Reform agenda being pursued by GoG with
support of the donor community that included more significant financing for institutional
strengthening from IDB and DfID.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.     The Project Development Objective was to support the achievement of sustainable
universal access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially the poor.
This Project would also help to consolidate the water sector modernization and reform process
supported by IDA and other donors in recent years. Specifically, the Project would:

      Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of
       treatment facilities in the coastal water supply systems in regions 2, 3 and 5
      Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already connected
       to the service
      Provide the technical assistance needed for the sustainable development of water
       resources in Guyana, and support the modernization and financial sustainability of GWI
      Through the emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after the
       January 2005 floods


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification



                                                                                               2
10.     The PDO was not revised after appraisal.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      The primary target group for the investment component comprised over 48,000 people
living in urban and peri-urban areas in Regions 2, 3, and 5 that include low to middle income
residents. Additional beneficiaries identified at appraisal included 164,000 people affected by the
2005 flood. GWI and its customers also would benefit from the institutional strengthening of the
utility.

1.5 Original Components

12.     The Project was designed to support the GoG‟s Program through a Specific Investment
Grant to be implemented by GWI. GWI would have overall technical responsibility for the
Project including procurement. The Grant would be divided into four components that included:

13.    Component 1: Water Supply Infrastructure (US$9.1 million of IDA financing, US$1.0
of government counterpart financing): This component was designed to finance infrastructure
works including upgrading of raw water source, installation of water treatment facilities,
upgrading of water transmission systems, and rehabilitation of the distribution systems in
Division 1, Division 2, and Division 4 of GWI‟s operating zones (in GoG‟s administrative
Regions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).

14.     Component 2: Design, Project Management. and Supervision (US$ 0.8 million of IDA
financing, US$0.1 million of government counterpart financing): This component was designed
to finance staff, consultant services and equipment to strengthen the capacity of GWI and its
Asset Development Team to execute, supervise, and monitor the results of the Project.

15.     Component 3: Institutional Strengthening Component (US$0.3 million of IDA
financing, US$.03 million of government counterpart financing): The component was designed
to finance technical assistance architecture around the Management Contract. This was necessary
to bring the needed specialized skills and expertise to support GWI and its Board of Directors to
turn the company into a modem and efficient utility.

16.     Component 4: Emergency Component (US$ 1.1 million, 100% IDA financed given the
Emergency nature of the intervention): Under this Component, the Project would finance the
rehabilitation of water treatment plants, pumping stations (water and wastewater), and
distribution systems damaged by the flooding. It would also finance minor capital works targeted
at the distribution systems and small equipment repairs and replacements, household connection
replacements, and other minor investments.

1.6 Revised Components

17.    The components were not revised after appraisal of the project.



                                                                                                 3
1.7 Other significant changes

18.    The Project was restructured in order to extend the closing date from March 31, 2010 to
March 31, 2011 to allow for extra time for completion of some of the outstanding works which
could not be completed during the original project time period. This was caused by delays in the
bidding process of the main treatment plant works and the termination of two other contracts (i.e.
for well drilling and installation of pipes) due to underperformance by contractors and the
subsequent need for re-contracting.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.   The key project preparation and design considerations that impacted implementation and
outcomes were:

20.      Multi-donor commitment and long term strategic engagement with GoG and GWI:
Given that GWI‟s Investment Program was designed to benefit from a multi-donor program, and
the lack of donor coordination in the previous engagement was having an adverse impact on
sector performance – donor commitment and cooperation was critical for the success of this
Project. Thus this was an important element of the design as it provided strategic support to
institutional change and capacity building at GWI and allowed the Project to have a more
significant engagement with regard to GWI institutional strengthening that it otherwise would
not have had under the very small (US$0.3 million) institutional strengthening component.

21.    Government Commitment: The long term engagement as part of the Reform Program
emphasized that institutional strengthening and reform are key to not just improving water
supply in Guyana but also for the investments to be successful and sustained. The Government
was committed to the Ten Year Investment Program which was evident by the funds it was able
to mobilize for a large portion of the medium term investments (US$64 million of the required
US$74 million for the first 3 years) necessary for the Reform Program. The GoG was also
committed to provide the required counterpart funding for this Project. This was important to the
design as it demonstrated Government commitment and ownership.

22.     Relationship to the Management Contract: At appraisal, the legal basis for infrastructure
and institutional performance was the recently issued Management Contract and GWI‟s
operating license. Some of the institutional and operational/infrastructure performance targets
were therefore made consistent with the goals of the management contract. However the realism
of these targets was questioned at appraisal and acknowledged as a risk that eventually affected
the Project outcomes as measured by the indicators agreed at appraisal.




                                                                                                4
23.      Planning, targeting, and design of investments: The needs of the sector and the targeted
districts were thoroughly researched as part of the upstream work on the investment plan.
This was done through community consultations and by identifying specific works under the
Project. As a result the Project included investments that were anticipated to increase access to
safe water in communities that needed it.

2.2 Implementation


24.     The only formal restructuring undertaken for the Project resulted in a one-year extension
on the closing date from March 2010 to March 2011.
25.     In GWI‟s view, implementation delays, particularly early on in Project implementation,
were attributed to extensive periods in the procurement processes, termination of some contracts
and retendering. In addition, there were periods when construction materials were scarce or
unavailable locally, which resulted in delay in construction completion;

26.     However, there were series of important actions taken during the initial stages of
implementation in response to challenges that were severely impeding the implementation of the
project. In addition to issues inherent to implementing public works projects in Guyana
(including time to complete procurement, quality of contractors and availability of construction
materials), there were challenges related to capacity development and learning in financial and
procurement management, and ongoing institutional issues within GWI that were causing. delays
and resulting in under-disbursement. Some of the issues in particular were:

      Weaknesses in the financial management system that included internal control problems
       related to contract management, failure of the accounting system, and understaffing in the
       Finance Department at GWI. Key management positions in GWI were left vacant for
       extended periods of one year or more, delaying decisions on contracts. The high turnover
       of staff in GWI also limited their capacity
      Agreed operating procedures of the Board and changes in its composition were slow to
       implement
      The 2006 election period affected the pace of decisions on contracts
      GWI‟s day to day operations were disrupted after the decision to terminate the
       Management Contract was taken

27.      The actions taken in response to these issues were implemented over a period of several
years in response to institutional and political changes by GoG and GWI, taking advantage of the
institutional strengthening component already designed in the Project, recommendations during
World Bank supervision missions, and strong donor coordination.




                                                                                               5
               Fig 1: Key Events and Actions Taken to Increase Disbursement


28.     From the onset GoG and GWI sought to address the delays, with support from the project
supervision and the institutional strengthening components and in coordination with other
donors. In January 2007 the GoG decided to terminate GWI‟s 5-year Management Contract with
Severn Trent Water International due to slow progress in achieving the contractual goals. After
contract termination, GWI began managing the utility directly and in parallel, began its
reorganization. Subsequently the engagement focused on GoG‟s and GWI‟s development
through a coordinated engagement with the donor community and a “Turnaround Plan? that
would define a vision for the future at GWI. The Turnaround Plan, eventually approved by the
GoG by the end of 2007 was “broadly satisfactory to the Bank,? and targeted many of the issues
that affected the satisfactory progress of the Project.



                                                                                             6
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.     The original project design contained a series of outcome indicators to track the
achievement of the Project Development Objective which was to provide the population, in the
areas served by the investments, water supply that meets national water quality standards at an
acceptable level of service. The indicators included targets for water quality, efficiency and
continuity of the supply, non revenue water reduction, universal metering and improved
customer satisfaction as a result of the Project infrastructure investments. It also included
indicators for institutional development at GWI, project management for investments, overall
management, and technical and monitoring capacity.

30.   Several issues affected the application and measurement of these indicators during
implementation:

31.     Addition of Core Indicators: As part of the Multi-Donor Managing for Development
Results agenda, a set of core indicators were established and applied to all water supply and
sanitation projects. This resulted in the addition of 2 indicators to the Project (related to the
number of water utilities supported and the piped household connections benefitting from
rehabilitation).

32.     Performance Indicators in the Changing Context of GWI Management: The specific
target values for many of the Project indicators were adopted based on the criteria and
performance required under the GWI Management Contract and Operating License which was
the applicable legal and contractual arrangement at the time of appraisal. With the development
of the Turnaround Plan an additional set of indicators were developed and accepted by the core
donors (World Bank, IDB, and DFID) as a basis for continued sector support. The initial set of
indicators were based on aspirations of the performance of the private sector Management
Contract which were not realized, while the Turnaround Plan indicators were a more realistic
consensus of the potential improvements GWI could make under the circumstances. The project
indicators were however not formally changed. The indicators used in the ICR evaluation of the
outcomes (Section 3.2) are the original project indicators. The Turnaround Plan indicators were
discussed in the ICR (under the institutional strengthening section under “overarching themes,
other outcomes and impacts?, section 3.5b) in light of the broader institutional strengthening
achieved during this period as part of the multi-donor engagement.

33.     Quality of Data and Capacity to Monitor: At the onset, the need to build monitoring
capacity at GWI was acknowledged. Thus capacity building for this purpose was incorporated as
part of the Project. In the first few years of the Project, data collection for the performance
indicators was a fundamental issue. However significant progress was made on the quality and
quantity of data collected on GWI performance in the last few years. Annual monitoring reports
were produced and used as a reliable source of management information and regular internal
management reporting at Board meetings. Although data quality has improved it remains to be a
challenge, needing corrections, estimations and assumptions in certain cases to make effective

                                                                                               7
use of raw data and, basic data having limited accuracy. Non-revenue water in particular is not
measured systematically and while estimates could be made at the system level, no accurate
estimates or measurements were able to be made in the project areas.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


34.     Safeguards Safeguard compliance was rated “satisfactory? throughout project
implementation. Operational Policy 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) was the only safeguard
triggered and the Project was classified as a “category B.? To that end, GWI, with support from
the World Bank, completed “Environmental Guidelines for Construction Projects and
Environmental Assessment? that established clear guidelines to protect the environment before,
during, and after construction of proposed water projects. Consistent with these guidelines,
Environmental Impact Assessments, which included consultations with key stakeholders and
public disclosure, were completed in 2004 for the three water upgrade projects funded by the
Bank. The overall Project created substantial positive environmental impact, and did not face any
unusual environmental risks.


35.     Procurement: The major contracts under the loan were a series of works associated with
the design and construction of the treatment plants, well borings, transmission system, pumping
stations, and repairs to the distribution system. Procurement suffered from delays partly due to
difficulties in complying with World Bank procedures which was a result of the lack of
familiarity and human resources constraints at GWI. Procurement was also delayed due to an
investigation carried out after a protest was lodged by one of the losing bidders which after
delays was not validated. Other procurement issues that were less directly related to compliance
but contributed to delays include the termination of two contracts, late sub-contracting and
technical, non-performance, cash flow and liquidity issues on the contractor‟s end.

36.    Although no major compliance concerns (that would prevent disbursements) were raised
by the Independent Procurement Review conducted in 2009, the rating for procurement
compliance was placed at “Moderately Satisfactory? at the time. This rating remained such until
the end of the Project.

37.    Financial Management: At the beginning of the project, financial management
compliance was rated “Moderately Satisfactory?. This was due to GWI‟s financial management
systems having several structural gaps including weaknesses in internal control related to
contract management oversight, accounting of customer payments, human resource capacity, and
the incapability of GWI‟s accounting and operating system to adapt to changes in accounting
software.

38.     A review by DFID‟s Internal Audit Section in 2007 had reported internal weaknesses in
GWI financial and management systems, and a list of recommended improvements and
redirection of some funds to support these improvements. The list of measures to be applied was
included in the Turnaround Plan adopted at the end of 2007.

                                                                                               8
39.     Audits in 2008 raised concerns about GWI‟s ongoing financial management weaknesses
and the slow pace of implementation of measures to rectify deficiencies and implement the
actions outlined in the Turnaround Plan. In addition to these concerns allegations of corruption
surfaced in early 2009, which prompted swift action from the GWI Board of Directors and led to
termination of several staff contracts. An investigation report prepared by GWI‟s Board and GoG
confirmed that no World Bank funds were affected by any of the alleged malpractices. GWI‟s
inability to address these issues in a timely manner resulted in the “Moderately Unsatisfactory?
rating for Financial Management.

40.     Subsequently, IDB funded activities to build capacity in financial management at GWI.
Subsequent supervision missions concluded that while ongoing weaknesses remained, the
progress made by GWI in addressing the issues was acceptable and that the deficiencies
identified dealt primarily with issues of efficiency rather than compliance. With the significant
progress made in GWI to resolve the weaknesses, the financial management rating was raised to
"Moderately Satisfactory" in 2010, a rating that remained until the end of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     Sustainability of the works will depend upon the system of operations and maintenance
which is currently in place and being continuously improved on at GWI. Additional capacity is
likely to be built as part of the continued investments in the sector through IDB and GWI
funding. The sustainability of the institutional strengthening will depend on continued
commitment by GoG and GWI to the Reform Program. The key principles of reform in the
sector (modern, efficient and customer oriented utility, financial sustainability, clear
responsibilities and regulatory independence) and the associated institutional strengthening goals
for GWI have remained consistent throughout implementation. The Turnaround Plan has expired
but will be replaced by a strategic plan currently being developed through IDB funding which is
expected to follow the same basic principles outlined in the Reform Program. Additional
investments are also planned through GWI funding and two projects funded by the IDB. One
project will fund the construction of a water treatment and distribution plant in Linden to service
over 50,000 people in the region. The other project will fund the renewal of sewers and sewage
pumping stations in Georgetown.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


42.     The Project was closely aligned to Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and the
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Guyana: This Project was initiated by the Government
of Guyana as part of the water sector Reform Program. The GoG requested the World Bank
support in 2004 to help Guyana reach its Millennium Development Goals and meet its Poverty
Reduction Strategy targets. The Project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY03-FY05 which focused on IDA‟s assistance to Guyana through a series of planned
Poverty Reduction Support Credits, accompanied by a Public Sector Technical Assistance
Credit. The January 2005 Emergency due to severe flooding that affected 75% of Guyana‟s
population also exposed vulnerabilities in GWI‟s emergency response capability and required
IDA‟s intervention in disaster management.

43.    A shift in IDA’s strategy in Guyana resulted in more selectivity in interventions: The
Bank decided to assist Guyana in addressing its development challenges through a new CAS in
2009 with two main pillars: (i) strengthening environmental resilience and sustainability; and (ii)
improving education quality and social safety nets. In addition to the alignment with Guyana‟s
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper the two pillars were chosen based on: (i) the GoG‟s request for
Bank assistance in Forestry, Education, and Social Protection, and its emphasis and commitment
to addressing the issues related to those sectors; (ii) ongoing engagement with the GoG on
environmental resilience and education; and (iii) past achievements that would be sustained and
continued during this CAS. Since this new strategy is highly selective, investments in water
supply sector related projects were not considered a CAS priority going ahead.

44.     GoG and GWI are focused on continuing support for the water and sanitation sector:
The continued support to the water sector by the Government of Guyana is outlined in the
Guyana's Ministry of Housing and Water 10-year strategy. The Strategy provides support to the
development of water services through GWI. It specifically targets the improvement in access to
safe water to 90% of the country's population and is also focused on reducing the disparity that
exists in access to water in the coastal and hinterland regions. As part of this strategy GWI will
continue its commitment to implementation of the goals of the Turnaround Plan to improve the
quality and coverage of service, improve its financial sustainability, and implement a Hinterland
Water Strategy to improve the access of safe water sources and sanitation to hinterland
communities. IDB is funding two projects to increase coverage of the services across the
country.

45.      As a result of the close alignment of the PDO with Guyana‟s Reform Program, IDA‟s
CAS at the time of Project appraisal, and the continued commitment of the GoG in the sector and
project institutional goals, the ICR rates the relevance of the Project as “High?.




                                                                                                10
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

46.     The Project provided an important contribution to the goal of sustainable universal access
to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana. The Project had a significant impact
with respect to the specific goals of increasing access in the Project area and supporting the
recovery needs of the January 2005 floods. It achieved moderate impacts related to levels of
service and the modernization and financial sustainability of GWI, having only met a portion of
the targets for these goals.

47.    Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of
treatment facilities: The water supply infrastructure was successfully built, servicing a
population of 50,901 (11,718 piped household connections) which is greater than the initial
estimate of 48,000. The facilities are operating and providing adequate water quality to these
beneficiaries, none of which had access to piped treated water before the project. As in the
process of upgrading the system a small number of new consumers were connected to the
network, new connections to piped water was provided as part of the project to a small portion of
the beneficiary population.

48.     Improved levels of service: Some improvements in levels of service were achieved both
in and out of the project areas. In the project areas, in addition to the water quality
improvements, there is 100% metering and the investments provided a significant improvement
in the hours of service per day and pressure provided, at levels that can be considered adequate in
the context of Guyana and only slightly lower than the targets envisioned at appraisal. Outside
the project area, the broader efforts by GWI supported by the project and other donors improved
the quality, continuity, and pressure of the water supply significantly.

49.     Assist in the sustainable development of water resources in Guyana and support
modernization and financial sustainability of GWI: The Project assistance was designed to
provide some targeted assistance to support the broader goal of turning the company into a
modem and efficient utility. In accordance with the targets set in the PAD, the Project was able
to strengthen design and project management capacity and enhance the utility‟s ability to
implement investments, monitor and manage assets as evidenced by the realization of the
investments and the establishment of a monitoring system. The training programs, the knowledge
gained from the contractual consultants, and the hands on learning as a result of GWI
management and design of the project works improved staff qualification and the knowledge of
Board members. The Project also funded 3 engineers from GWI for a Master‟s program in
Project Management in the University of Guyana, some of whom are currently working in senior
management positions in GWI. Additionally, significant improvements in customer satisfaction
(measured as responses to complaints) were observed during the implementation as a result of
operational improvements under the Project.

50.     Support Recovery needs after the January 2005 flood. The planned works for
emergency recovery were completed and helped increase the overall quality of service in the
affected areas. The Emergency Component was used to address the short term loss of water
supply and sanitation to the affected population by primarily funding repairs and replacement of
equipment damaged due to the floods. This included spare parts for over 20 sewage pumps,


                                                                                                11
piping, submersible water well pumps, and electrical and mechanical components. The funds
were also used to cover repairs to backhoe assigned to GWI‟s operations department,
construction of flood protection walls at all bore well locations in GWI‟s Division 3 service area,
and to carry out structural rehabilitations works in some of the regions serviced by GWI.

51.     The Project was able to substantially achieve the primary objective of the project which
were related to the increase in access to treated water. It also was able to respond successfully to
the flood emergency and made significant progress in meeting the intermediate targets set out at
appraisal for levels of service and institutional modernization. Considering these outcomes and
the relative emphasis the project put on the development outcome related to access to treated
water, the achievement of Project Development Objective is rated as “Substantial?.

3.3 Efficiency

52.      Efficiency was assessed using a similar financial analysis done at appraisal, and updated
to the conditions found at the end of project. Due to the challenges faced by GWI in terms of low
tariffs and fee collection and the availability of donor funds for investments, in the medium term
investments were envisioned to be funded partially or totally through grants. In this context, the
analysis in the PAD assessed different combinations of grants provided for investments (% of
grant funding) and levels of tariff increases as scenarios for potential financial outcomes (see
table below). At appraisal, it was concluded that in order to make the project financially viable,
there would be a need to be an additional increase in tariffs or a grant to partially finance
investment.

                           Estimated Project Returns at Appraisal
                        Scenario                        Estimated NPV at appraisal
  A. No tariff change and no grant for investment.           -US$6.28 million
  B. No tariff change and 100% grant for investment          US$2.07 million
  C. 47% tariff increase and no grant for investment.        -US$5.12 million

53.     When looking at conditions at the end of the project the actual tariff increases (5% for
metered customers, 10% for unmetered customers) and grant funding (100% through the IDA
grant) ended up close to scenario B. Under these end of project conditions including the grant
financing, a positive net present value was found. However, when considering the works as a
grant equity investment (no grant financing assumed), the return on the investment is lower than
the opportunity cost of capital, resulting in a negative net present value and an internal rate of
return of 2%.
                               Project Returns at End of Project
                                 Indicator                                      Value
                    NPV (100% grant)                                        US$4.36 million
                    NPV (no grant)                                          -US$5.45 million
                    IRR (no grant)                                                2%
                       Revenues and operational costs based on assumptions provided in Annex 3, Depreciation
                       of 3.5% percent and 30 year operational life was used based on values of similar works.




                                                                                                                 12
54.     Overall financial performance of the project using the grant financing mechanism
therefore had a favorable return. However, true gains in efficiency of the investment would have
relied upon increases in tariffs combined with the reduction of non-revenue water, both of which
showed only limited progress under the project.

55.     Considering the above and taking into account the additional economic benefits that were
not valued (e.g., health, time and money saved) and its contribution to poverty reduction goals
and improved living conditions through increased access to basic services, the rating for
efficiency considered “Modest?.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

56.    Rating: Satisfactory.

57.     The ICR rates the overall outcome of the Project as “Satisfactory? based on a “High?
rating for relevance, “Substantial? rating for efficacy and “Modest? rating for efficiency. The
Project supported a sector that was and still is important to the GoG during a challenging time in
its evolution. It provided targeted investments that improved water quality, continuity and
pressure to over 50,000 people in underserved areas that, with the grant financing, is resulting in
a financial benefit to GWI and providing broader economic benefits to the serviced population.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     The Project was designed to ensure the supply of water, improve flow rates and
pressures, and improve the quality of water to over 50,000 people in the target communities
which included predominantly low to middle income groups. At the time of appraisal none of the
target communities received treated water and as a result faced health risks associated with the
use of untreated sources or spent time and money boiling or purchasing water of unknown
quality from vendors. The project thus was able to reduce the health risks and time and money
used for obtaining water. The emergency recovery component also helped restore service in the
aftermath of the floods which affected the poor significantly.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.     The broader sector strengthening and reform of GoG and GWI were supported to some
extent by the small activities financed under the project‟s institutional strengthening component
but more substantively by the dialogue through a joint effort with the other donors who had more
significant financing targeted at sector reform and strengthening. This engagement was
developed during preparation and designed into the project as a means of providing coordinated
and sustained support for these themes. During this time GWI has been able to realize significant
improvements with regard to institutional strengthening and levels of service (see table below)
and some improvements in its financial situation.



                                                                                                13
60.    When benchmarking the improvements against the targets set in the Turnaround Plan
(provided in Annex 5), GWI has been able to meet or nearly meet those related to water quality,
customer satisfaction and financial ratios. Other targets related to accounting, operations, human
resources and non revenue water reduction have not been met, although significant
improvements have been achieved.

                                                               continued reliance on GoG subsidies.

61.     Among the many goals of institutional strengthening, the achievement of financial
sustainability independent of government subsidies was part of the policy dialogue, Reform
Program and was a large area of focus for IDB and DFID related projects. Revenues have
increased significantly primarily through increased billing coverage and efficiency but less than
anticipated due to the fact that tariff increases were not realized. At the same time costs have
increased primarily due to the related costs of providing the improved level and coverage of
service including new housing schemes that were not anticipated and a significant increase in
electricity prices. To reach financial sustainability it is anticipated that both further
improvements in non-revenue water (leakage reduction, reducing illegal connections and
improved billing and collections) and significant tariff increases will be needed.




(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

62.     On the positive side the Bank was able to provide and finance specialized advice to GWI
during the supervision of the construction of the Water Treatment Plants. The contract used for
the construction, which was designed as a turnkey contract (allowing for alternative designs to be
proposed by bidders and the consideration of expected O&M costs of the infrastructure as part of
the bid evaluation) was very innovative in the context of Guyana and allowed for the provision
of adequate technology characterized by relatively simple and non-expensive operation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

63.          Rating: Significant1

64.     Provide Access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of
treatment facilities: The risk of the investments not being able to continue providing water of
adequate quality to the targeted population depends on the proper operation and maintenance of
the facilities and the acceptance by the population and operation of the metering system. GWI is
challenged by lack of easy access to spare parts and high turnover of operators and acceptance of
the use of the meters by the population. Systems are however in place to respond to deficiencies
in operation and metering performance. Thus the risk of the investments not being able to
continue providing the desirable water quality to the targeted population is considered low to
moderate.

65.     Improved levels of service: As part of its corporate strategy GWI intends to ensure that
the levels of service throughout their entire system that have been achieved are not just
maintained but also increased. The risk to ensuring this continuous improvement at the corporate
level relate to being able to expand infrastructure investments and surmount the technical,
administrative and financial challenges associated with the operation of the investments. While
the systems are in place and institutional commitment for the improvements continue, the
technical challenges of ensuring system wide improvements combined with the institutional and
financial challenges described below makes the risk to the outcome of improved levels of service
moderate to significant.

66.      Support to the modernization and financial sustainability of GWI: The risk to the goal
of GWI being a modern and efficient organization that is independent of government subsidies
are considered significant due to the still high political intervention in GWI management and
tariff setting and institutional challenges associated with the modernization program and the fact
that without tariff increases and non revenue water reduction, it is likely that GWI will continue
to be dependent on GoG subsidies.

67.    Modernization of GWI: The risks associated with the modernization of GWI relate to its
continued role as a water company under the current arrangements and the risk that the capacity
gains cannot be sustained. Since the consolidation of water companies and the formation of
GWI, the major institutional change has been the termination of the Management Contract by
GoG. Since that time there has been continued commitment to the basic institutional model and
goals of the reform. However, with the upcoming need to develop a new strategic plan to
replace the Turnaround Plan and renew GWI‟s license, the upcoming national elections, and the

    The risks were considered as a composite of the likelihood of the risk and the impact of the risk if it was realized.



                                                                                                                            16
continued dependence of GWI on GoG financially, there is a significant risk to the operation of
GWI as a water company as envisioned under the Reform Program. The challenges of retention
of qualified staff and the long term vacancies in appointed positions persist and represent another
risk to this outcome.

68.     Financial Viability of GWI: The financial viability of GWI was one of the key sector
issues that was highlighted at appraisal and continues to be a challenge. GWI is still financially
dependent on government subsidies due to increases in power prices and the continued high non
revenue water due to gaps in metering and leakage. GWI has continued to be committed to
reaching financial viability through efforts to improve metering and billing and reduce non-
revenue water. To reach this stage in the medium term, the program on non revenue water and
metering needs to be accelerated and/or tariffs need to be increased. While GWI is going in the
right direction, considering the level of the technical and administrative challenges and the need
for unpopular tariff increases, the risk to this development outcome is considered high.


69.     Support Recovery needs after the January 2005 flood: As these are works designed as
a short term measure to rehabilitate the water infrastructure to the levels of operation that existed
before the flooding and that goal was achieved, there is negligible risk to this outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

70.     The ICR rates Bank performance during preparation as “Moderately Satisfactory?. The
Project design took advantage of the experience from a previous World Bank investment project
and was developed to support a pre-existing a Reform Program and Ten Year Development Plan.
Therefore it was a thoroughly prepared project with strong Government ownership that was able
to identify the critical risks. It developed mitigation measures, taking advantage of targeted
technical assistance and institutional building components. The design incorporated adequate
flexibility with solid donor coordination which proved to be essential in reacting to challenges
during implementation.

71.     The shortcomings relate to the overstated targets for GWI operational indicators, an
optimistic approach to the likelihood of identified risks materializing, and underestimation of the
effect of capacity issues on the project schedule. These can be considered moderate due to the
impact on the project outcomes and delay in implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

72.      The ICR rates Quality of Supervision as “Satisfactory?. The Project began with a series
of challenges related to implementation pace, procurement, financial management and broader
institutional issues. Strong supervision during this time was crucial to assisting both the Project

                                                                                                  17
and more broadly the institutional development of GWI. Minor shortcomings relate to the limited
formal supervision in later years at a time when the Project was largely on track to completion
within the extended time period and when arrangements for specialized consultant advisory and
supervision support were used to more directly assist the construction and operation process.

73.     The fact that the target values for the indicators associated with intermediate objectives
were not changed during implementation represents a missed opportunity to have a formal
restructuring of the project to reflect the target values that were being pursued by GWI through
their turnaround plan. Although such a modification may have enabled the Project to better meet
the institutional indicators, these shortcomings are considered to be mostly formal and its impact
in the project outcomes is negligible. For these reasons, overall quality of supervision is
considered satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

74.    The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as “Satisfactory? given that Bank
performance during preparation has been rated “Moderately Satisfactory? and during
implementation has been rated as “Satisfactory?.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance

75.      The ICR rates the overall Government performance as “Moderately Satisfactory?. At
appraisal, GoG was committed to the water and sanitation sector Reform Program and had taken
key steps towards its implementation which included creation of GWI, awarding of the
Management Contract, and securing funding under the Ten Year Investment Program. The GoG
also took proactive steps to develop a new direction for GWI subsequent to the termination of the
Management Contract. The key shortcomings were related to the inability to maintain continuity
in appointments in GWI and its Board, and delays in contractual decisions during the national
elections. These can be considered moderate due to the project delays and the impacts on the
institutional development goals of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

76.    The ICR rates the overall Implementing Agency performance as “Satisfactory?. GWI
performance under the Project was clearly split into two distinct phases. During the first part of
implementation, the Project faced significant delays and inefficiencies related to contract
management and oversight, accounting systems, human resource capacity and prolonged
vacancies, among other issues. In the later stage of implementation, as a result of a series of
proactive actions on project specific issues and the development of the Turnaround Plan to help
address more systematic issues, GWI was able to overcome many of the challenges and complete
the Project with only one year delay. Minor shortcomings relate to the delays, lack of pro activity
in pursuing tariff increases and lingering issues related to financial management and procurement
compliance.

                                                                                                18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

77.    The ICR rates the overall Borrower performance as “Satisfactory? taking into account the
proactive response to challenges in the project and the relative importance of the above
shortcomings in achieving the development objectives.


6. Lessons Learned
78.     Donor coordination proved instrumental in the policy reform and institutional
strengthening agenda: The Project benefited from the coordination of several donors. There was
a consensus on the policy Reform Program and institutional strengthening agenda. The
effectiveness of the coordination is particularly noteworthy during the early stages of the Project.
The combination of a consistent message and complementary efforts on the same issues were
instrumental in, supporting the Turnaround Plan, and in addressing procurement and financial
management capacity constraints.

79.      Early and thorough engagement is important to successful sector reform programs:
Reform programs such as this that are crucial to the performance of investments, require long
term engagement. The Project benefited from a more than 10 year Bank engagement in the sector
through the previous investment project and the extended period of engagement in developing
the reform agenda. This ensured a well designed project grounded on well developed
institutional and regulatory reform.

80.     Government ownership was key to sustaining sector reform and improvements within
GWI: The long term and productive involvement of the government on the water sector reform
also enabled high government and ownership at the time of appraisal which was able to be
sustained during implementation. Even if the Government decided to give the Management
Contract an early termination, it remained engaged in dialogue with the main donors and GWI
and there was high support at the highest levels for the agreed turnaround plan which proved
invaluable to sustaining the improvements achieved and maintaining the principles of the
reforms throughout this crucial time in the development of the sector, even if the management
contract tool for GWI was discarded by the Government at the time.

81.     Targets should be based on realistic expectations rather than aspirations: The targets
set at the beginning of the Project mirrored the Management Contract and GWI license
obligations which had been approved fairly recently and that had been developed based on
assumptions on what, through the involvement of a private contractor, was thought to be possible.
This resulted in institutional, financial and non-revenue water reduction targets that ultimately
were overstated when considered the technical and operational reality on the ground and the
structural overarching institutional obstacles. The indicators and goals of similar projects can
benefit from a more realistic assessment of the impact of the level of maturity of a water
company in reaching financial and institutional development targets. For non-revenue water
reduction, there are significant technical and administrative challenges to undertake a program of
leakage reduction; installation, operation and maintenance of meters; and improved billing and

                                                                                                 19
collection. Thus targets should realistically reflect the context and cultures of a particular country,
the condition of its infrastructure and administrative capabilities of the water utility.

82.      Continuity and quality of human resources in Guyana should be addressed as part of
design in projects in Guyana: Implementation was affected by challenges in recruiting and
maintaining quality staff experienced by GWI during the Project hampered the continuity in the
Project team and management. As this challenge in the medium term may be expected in
Guyana more generally, in future projects in the country, a system should be in place to ensure
institutional memory is maintained and succession plans or backup arrangements are in place for
key positions vacated.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This section takes as basis the financial analysis presented in the PAD, which considered the
proposed investment under several possible extremes of scenario as seen at the time of the PAD.
A review of the assumptions and other PAD data was carried out in the light of the scenarios
considered at appraisal and the actual scenario that was realized at the time of project closure.

ASSUMPTIONS

Population: Data from the 2002 census was used in the PAD, with projections to 2024 which
were 117.8% of 2002 figures. No new census data is available, but it is known that trends for the
3 Regions of the project are for continued growth, and for the purposes of this report, current
populations are estimated as 108% of 2002 census data.
The new plants serve sections of 3 out of the 5 operating Divisions of GWI. Total current
population served is estimated at 51,000, 23% of the total population of the 3 Regions/Divisions.

Average household size: This was estimated as the total population divided by the number of
recorded customers of GW1. GWI has 173,850 recorded customers (March 2011 mgt. report).
It is suggested by staff that some of these are still „ghost‟ accounts and the real figure may be
taken as 170,000.
The 2011 population of the coastal strip of Guyana is estimated based on the assumptions above
as 725,000.
Average household size (persons served per GWI connection is estimated at 725,000/170,000 =

Billings and Collections: While there is data on running costs broken down by Division and
by pumping station/treatment plant, the billings and collections are only broken down by
Division. For the purposes of this report, comparison is made of data for 2005 and 2010,
being the years immediately prior to start of project and the last complete year to date, during
which the new plants have been in full operation since about July, and in partial operation
during the previous 6 months. Billings and collections have both increased significantly since
2005. For GWI as a whole the data are:

                    Collection ratio                 81.7%                              76.6%
   NB Collection ratios are approximate due to collection lagging behind respective billings, and subject to adjustments.
   The long term collection ratio has been of the order of 75 – 82 % throughout the last 10 years.

Since the beginning of the project there was a 10% increase in tariff for unmetered
consumers and a 5% increase for metered consumers, which was implemented in July 2005.
The overall actual tariff increase since 2005 has been approximately 8%. The principal
reason for the improved figures of both billing and collection is most probably the
introduction of a new billing system in 2007. The increase in numbers of metered accounts
from about 25% to the present figure of 39% has also been a significant factor.

    NB1. Due to removal of meters by some customers, 2011 numbers are in some cases lower than in 2010, eg Division 4
   has seen a drop in metered accounts of 1,328 in the past 12 months. NB2It is not currently possible to disaggregate
   collections from metered and unmetered customers.

The range of revenue per metered account considers the fact that many Division 1 customers
make significant use of rain water harvesting to reduce their GWI water consumption and
charges, whereas in Division 4 there is (currently) considerable use made of GWI water for
small scale farming. This also is the reason why many meters have been removed by
customers.
Financial Analysis: The Financial viability of each of the projects was appraised by
measuring its flows of costs and benefits in market prices, which focus the evaluation on the
subgroup of the population directly affected by the Project. Benefits are assumed equal to
the estimated flow of financial revenues. That is, financial benefits are defined as equal to
tariffs times estimated consumption, times collection rate.

The PAD considered 2 extreme scenarios and one „base‟ scenario which was expected to be
close to the end of project scenario.

            A.        No tariff change and no grant for investment.
            B.        No tariff change and 100% grant for investments.
            C.        47% tariff increase and 100% grant for investments (base case)

                     Scenario                        Estimated NPV at appraisal
                        A.                                 -US$6.28 million
                        B.                                  US$2.07 million
                        C.                                 -US$5.12 million


The end of project scenario is much closer to scenario B than to the base case, as the tariff
has increased by only a small amount (5% for metered customers, 10% for unmetered
customers).


                                                                                                                   26
The annual financial benefit derived from the customers served by the 3 plants can be
estimated in several ways, with results as under based on 2010 performance, based on the
actual revenue collections from metered customers in the project service areas of each
Division.
            Division 1     G$67,002,000       $335,000
            Division 2     G$97,143,712       $485,718
            Division 4     G$125,410,842 $627,054
            Total                             $1,447,772
                             3
Operating costs are $0.15/m , and current consumption is averaged at 235l/c/d by 50,900
persons, so annual costs of supply to the target population is $654,892 per year. Net
revenues of $792,880 per year are generated. Considering the project investments as a grant
(100% grant financed investments using the IDA grant) with a project life of 30 years and
depreciation of 3.5% (based on values for similar water treatment investments) it had a
positive net present value. However, when considered as an equity investment (no grant
financing), the return on the investment is lower than the opportunity cost of capital, resulting
in a negative net present value and an internal rate of return of 2%.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1. A draft ICR was shared with GWI and Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Housing
   and Water and discussed with them in Georgetown on September 7, 2011. Further
   comments were received from GWI in writing. The main comments received are the
   following:

      In GWI‟s view, implementation delays, particularly early on in Project
       implementation, were attributed to extensive periods in the procurement processes,
       termination of some contracts and retendering. In addition, there were periods
       when construction materials were scarce or unavailable locally, which resulted in
       delay in construction completion;
      The project was initiated very well by the respective parties and there are some
       lessons learnt that have benefitted GWI which are as follow.
       (i)      Close coordination with the Bank, GOG, GWI and the consultants resulted
                in the successful completion of the Project
       (ii)     It was a good approach for the GWI to employ individual consultants
                under the Project, which resulted in significant cost savings. In addition,
                this approach resulted in strengthening of GWI Institutional capacity,
                which is presently benefitting the organization. Presently, there are several
                persons at GWI that received training that are working in senior
                management positions within the organization.
      In GWI‟s view, lack of financial sustainability at GWI should be attributed to the
       expansion in GWI‟s service areas and the improved service provided which has
       resulted in an increase in operating costs; Increase in electricity costs and
       machinery usage to meet demands has also contributed to greater operating costs.
       It is acknowledged that collection rates need to be improved and NRW needs to
       be reduced;
      GWI acknowledges that the targets set out in the Management Contract and
       specifically for this Project were ambitious. The unanticipated demands due to
       new housing schemes played a major role in not meeting the expected operational
       targets;
      The Government recently released the progress report on the MDG goals. Water
       related targets have not just been met but have also played a critical role towards
       the Health and Education goals, something which should be considered in the
       discussion and rating of the PDO related to efficiency;
      GWI has anticipated the risks to maintaining current levels of service and has a
       system in place and commitment to improving levels of service;
      GWI acknowledged the benefits received from having an external consultant
       engaged by the Bank to help supervise works and operations in the later part of
       the project. The training provided by the consultant played an important role in
       institutional strengthening and capacity building. Thus the limited formal
       presence of Bank supervision during the later period of the Project was not
       considered to be inadequate by GWI;


                                                                                         30
        Tariff reviews should be initiated by GWI and approved by PUC and should not
         be considered a GoG shortcoming;
        Collaboration between consultants, GoG, GWI, and donors led to contractual
         consultants being employed full time at GWI which helped build capacity of the
         teams.
        GWI acknowledged the Project contribution in building capacity and expertise to
         produce its infrastructure designs in house which also helps in cost reduction.

Annex 6. Comments of Co financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

A draft ICR was shared with representatives of JICA, IDB, DfiD and the European
Commission and presented in a meeting in Georgetown on September 6, 2011. The
following comments were received.

      IDB has further engagements in the water sector in Guyana and is concerned
       about the absence of donor coordination going ahead: As the donor
       involvement is decreasing in this sector, the donor leverage is also decreasing
       which is proving to be a challenge for existing donors in Guyana.IDB has two
       water sector infrastructure projects in the pipeline and TA for corporate
       governance and is concerned about the lack of involvement of multiple donors
       with GWI going ahead since it proved to be critical to the success of this Project
       and other donor funded projects.

      Further Bank engagement with GWI: IDB plans to support climate change
       related projects at GWI and would like the Bank to explore similar projects at
       GWI since it is related to the Bank‟s CAS for Guyana and also technical
       assistance, advisory or regional training opportunities for GWI.

      GWI needs a new strategic direction since the Turnaround Plan ended in
       2010: A key concern to sustainability is the lack of a replacement to the
       Turnaround plan. IDB is funding the study to develop a strategic plan that hopes
       to fill this gap.

      2011 elections could set back the progress achieved: With the elections being
       scheduled for later this year, political influence has increased which is limiting
       GWI and can hamper the progress made on institutional strengthening and
       financial sustainability.

      Financial sustainability and human resource constraints are the two key
       challenges observed by JICA in the water sector in Guyana: Having supported
       the construction of two water treatment plants in Guyana, JICA has observed that
       financial sustainability and high turnover of staff at GWI are challenges that need
       to be addressed to ensure sustainability of investments.
