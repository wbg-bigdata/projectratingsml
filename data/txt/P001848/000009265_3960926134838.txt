MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
development credit to Mauritania for SDR 7.9 million (US$10.0 million
equivalent) is submitted  for approval.   The proposed credit  would be  on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help finance a
development management project. The project would be cofinanced by FAC for
FF2.3 million (US$0.4 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Never rich in natural  resources, over the last  ten
years, Mauritania has had to contend with war, severe drought, and a
collapse in the price of iron ore, its primary export. Inadequate policies
were also a factor in the deterioration of economic performance, as were
general public  sector  management weaknesses:  these  became  particularly
critical as a serious financial crisis developed in the late 1970s.    This
led to the implementation of increasingly severe stabilization measures
which culminated, in 1985, with the approval of a sweeping Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) designed to restructure the economy. Because of the
predominant position of the public sector in the economy, public sector
management reform became a major element of this program. Slow but steady
progress is being achieved in restructuring public enterprises supported by
the Public Enterprise Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1567-MAU).
3.        Government now has decided to make its own deficiencies the focus
of a reform program based on an administrative assessment carried out by
IDA in 1985. Starting in 1987, this program is to be implemented in
phases. To launch the reform, the Government created a Bureau for
Coordination of  Institutional Reform  (BCIR), under  the h.nister  of  the
Civil Service, and a Consultative Committee for Institutional Reform (with
representatives  from  the  Presidency,  central  administrations,   higher
education, employers, and labor) to manage the program. It has also me'-ged
the Ministry of Plan and the Ministry  of Finance into the new Ministry  of
Economy and Finance (MEF) and began to reorganize civil service management
with French and IDA assistance. Reflecting the importance that both
Government  and  IDA  place  on  public  sector  management  issues,   this
administrative reform program is an important component of the first
Structural Adjustment operation (Cr. 1812-MAU) approved on June 2, 1987.
4.        Rationale for IDA  Involvement.  Improving  the effectiveness  of
public sector management is a critical development issue for which the
Government has asked for IDA support. It is also central for the SAL, as
weak  administration  ultimately   constitutes  one   of  the   significant
constraints to the adjustment process. IDA, through its investment lending
and past assistance to improve public sector management, has established a
constructive dialogue on these issues. This led to the administrative
assessment done in 1985 which provided the focal point for the Government
to examine its administrative systems and procedures. Support under the
project for the formulation and implementation of specific reform action
programs in priority areas now provides the vehicle for Government to
tackle fundamental weaknesses in its administration.

5.        Project  Objectives.   The  proposed   project  would  help   the
Government to complete the design of its administrative reform effort and
to implement key actions including  those incorporated under the SAL.    In
the first phase, priority is focussed on: (i) improving Government's core
management processes; (ii) rehabilitating personnel administration and
initiating reform of the civil service; (iii) strengthening economic
management; (iv) initiating decentralization of government services; and
(v) laying a framework for the future extension of administrative reform to
other areas.
6.        Project Dascription.   The  proposed project  would  provide  the
Mauritanian Government with the resources and skills required for its
administrative  reform  program,  in   partlcular  to:  (a)  improve   core
Government management capabilities within the Presidency, in the areas of
interministerial   decision-making   management,   legal   and   regulatory
oversight, public sector auditing, financial control, procurement oversight
and  Organization  and  Method;  (b)  strengthen  economic  and   financial
management by reinforcing (i) ;ublic expenditure management, (ii) fiscal
administration, and (iii) by supporting an institutional strengthening
program for the MEF; (c) initiate civil service reform with assistance to
the Ministry of Civil Service, by rehabilitating personnel management
procedures and information systems, and starting a gradual and consultative
reform process of the personnel management policy framework; and (d) help
establish local municipalities recently created under the Government's
decentralization policy, through support to the Ministry of the Interior
and training of municipal staff and elected officials. Surport would also
be provided to prepare additional reform prcgrams, partic larly in the area
of fisheries, and to the recently created BCIR, which is responsible for
managing the administrative reform program. The project would provide each
of these components with the required consultancy and advisory services,
training, vehicles, office equipment, computers and logistical support to
carry out the project activities. Annual work programs will be established
for the individual components  In agreement with IDA.   The project, to  be
carried out over seven years, is estimated to cost US$11.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$8.0 million (70
percent). A PPF of US$0.5 million was extended to prepare the project; a
request for a second PPF for an additional US$1.0 million is expected
shortly; both will be refinanced. Bilateral assistance from France is
providing co-financing, amounting to US$0.4 million, for advisory services
to the Presidency. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Mauritania are given in Schedules C and
D respectively. A separate Staff Appraisal Report (No. 7012-MAU, dated
November 23, 1987) is attached. A map is also attached.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During  negotiations, agreement with  Government
was reached on: (a) the establishment of the Organization and Methods
Bureau by December 1988 and a review of its mandate and effectiveness by
July 1991; (b) completion of MEF's reorganization of its Planning Aid
Coordination  and  Budget  Departments  by  June  1988;  (c)  adoption   of
satisfactory full cost recovery measures for the publication of tax



materials; (d) submission of interim reports on civil service reform ty
April 1989 and final reports by February 1990; (e) provision of detailed
action programs for each component by October of each year; and (f)
submission of proposals  for strengthening  the Ministry  of Fisheries  and
Maritime Economy, the Auditor General's Office, the Financial Controller's
Office and any other activliies in support of administrative reform by
December 1989. Conditions of effectiveness are that: (a) the Committee for
Coordination of Institutional Reform would be functioning; (b) NEF would
have appointed a training coordinator; (c) the project training coordinator
be appointed; and (d) first-year action programs for all components would
have been agreed to.
8.        Benefits.  The project will begin to address long term issues  of
the cost-effectiveness of public institutions. It will provide a framework
and establish a process for public administration reform, notably in areas
critical to structural adjustment, which today are being carried out on an
ad-hoc basis and with a large and unsustainable element of technical
assistance.
9.        Risks.  The main  risks are  that: (i)  the political  commitment
behind public sector management reform waivers; (ii) reform management
requirements exceed local capacities; (iii) civil service resistance blocks
implementation;  and  (iv)  it  proves  difficult  to  identify   technical
assistance with the required expertise  and acceptable to Mauritania.   The
Government's recent actions including the assignment of a highly qualified
project director, demonstrate its commitment. The management risk will be
attenuated by having flexible implementation arrangements through annual
work programs and by building management assistance into the project.
Finally,  effectiveness  of  technical  assistance  will  be  enhanced   by
maximizing the use of twinning arrangement and of local consultants, in
particular through a local skills mobilization scheme which is an integral
part of project design.
10.       Recommendation.  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit  would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
