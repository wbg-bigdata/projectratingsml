F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to develop the productivity and profitability of the private
agriculture sector. This would be achieved by facilitating the access of Georgia's mainly
small and medium-scale farmers to supply chains, improving the competitiveness of the
supply chains and strengthening the capacity of selected agricultural and financial
institutions to serve private-sector agricultural market activity.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised objective is to improve agricultural production and access to markets for
Georgia's small and medium-scale farmers and rural enterprises supported by the project,
through: (i) increasing the competitiveness of selected supply chains; (ii) strengthening
the delivery of rural financial services and of the financial intermediaries; and (iii)
modernizing key institutions for food safety and property registration with direct impact
for increasing competitiveness of Georgia's agriculture.

prosperity. Assessments indicated that Georgia had the potential to significantly improve
its agricultural production base and become a net exporter of a number of agricultural
products 1 , such as wine, nuts, mineral water, herbs, citruses, fresh vegetables and
livestock products. These sub-sectors had demonstrated potential for incremental
production and sales, which could have led to a significant reduction in rural poverty.
However, the country had been unable to produce the quality and quantities necessary to
test these comparative advantages and gain stable access to export markets. The primary
constraints for a more vibrant development of the sector were: (i) limited access to
essential, modern agricultural inputs (ex. improved varieties); (ii) lack of know-how and
wider proliferation of new agricultural technologies; and (iii) limited access to investment
and working capital. In addition, critically necessary and enabling marketing
infrastructure for most agricultural supply chains was poorly developed, with agro-
processors themselves representing a weak link in supply chains, unable to offer more
favorable prices to primary producers, induce technology transfer, provide credit to
farmers, or exercise proper supply chain quality control functions.

2.      A particularly limiting handicap for the sector’s development was the lack of
agricultural credit - its sources very limited and volumes insufficient. Banks and non-
bank financial institutions had weak capacity for agricultural lending. This lack of
capacity was exacerbated by the small size of the financial sector as a whole and its
limited capacity to provide medium and long-term credit. Farmers and agricultural
enterprises seeking medium and long-term investment capital were the main victims of an
inefficient financial market. Generally, Georgian commercial banks and NBFIs had a
preference for urban clients, but were beginning to consider a more active expansion
towards rural clients. However, progress was tenuous, because of lack of adequate
knowledge of agricultural lending and suitable loan products. In the case of the NBFI’s
an added constraint was related to lack of financial resources, as well as an adequate
legislative and regulatory framework. At that time, the experience of the Agriculture
Development Project with small-scale rural credit unions provided an eloquent example
of the issues that barred the NBFI’s from establishing a more stable and ubiquitous
presence on the rural lending market.

3.      Last but not least, the appraisal context was marked by a situation in which
farmers and agricultural businesses suffered from insufficient and inefficient institutional
support. Most of the concerned government agencies were under-resourced and guided in
their approach by archaic policies, laws and regulations, thereby becoming a serious
impediment to rural growth. At the time of preparation, there was a build-up of
momentum for activities aimed at modernizing legislation and reorganizing and
restructuring government institutions, which clearly required more focus and a better
sense of direction to be effective. Areas of particular concern to the agriculture and agri-
business communities included product standards and food safety, sanitary and phyto-
sanitary regulations, and technical support services, such as secure registration of land
and moveable assets. The Government’s evolving food safety agenda was governed by a
strategic approach towards approximation of food safety legislation and institutions with
the practices in the EU2. The property registration agenda was regarded as essential for
successful rural and agri-business development as a factor which can underpin investor
confidence in long-term agriculture investment and security for creditors. Several
investments were made under the ADP to develop land registration and fee-management
systems to generate income for partial self-financing of a registration agency. A National
Agency of the Public Registry was established with a mandate for land registration and
cadastre and the registration of securities on moveable assets.

4.       The continued involvement in the agriculture sector by the World Bank and IFAD
was considered crucial for the sustainability of investments in land registration and credit
unions already made under the ADP and for further development of activities necessary
for the growth of commercial agriculture and agricultural exports. Furthermore, the
World Bank and IFAD’s involvement was justified by their unique ability to support the
Government of Georgia in its sector development efforts aimed at providing direct
support to private agricultural businesses through technical assistance and training;
providing direct or intermediated investment resources to rural beneficiaries; and
strengthening the legal and institutional framework of selected public institutions for
providing improved services and regulation, and creating an enabling environment for
private sector investment. This ability was engendered by the World Bank and IFAD’s
capacity, expertise and in-country and international experience to engage in activities
aimed at strengthening agricultural supply chains, proven ability to assist the Government
of Georgia in analyzing agricultural development policies, and significant experience in
promoting the development of rural financial institutions. Additionally, IFAD had
extensive in-country experience with activities aimed at alleviating poverty, particularly
in up-land areas. Because of their overall approach and position, the World Bank and
IFAD were believed to be able to play a catalytic role in helping to coordinate donor
activities in agriculture and rural development rural in Georgia.

5.     At appraisal, the project was consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy for Georgia for 2004-20063 (December, 2003) which emphasized the need for

    A draft Food Law was in an advanced stage of preparation at the time of appraisal.

                                                                   2
further support to the rural sector, and described strategies to promote export markets and
an environment for private sector-led growth. The project was also included in the
priority assistance program in the Reform Support Credit presented to the World Bank
Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2004.

6.      The ultimate higher-level objectives pursued by the Bank and IFAD in supporting
the Government of Georgia through this project were sustainable rural income growth
and poverty reduction, strong public institutions and good governance. The intent was to
achieve these goals through activities propagating growth of private commercial
agriculture, with a high level of participation by small-scale farmers and unemployed and
under-employed rural people. Investments to develop strong public institutions and to
promote good governance were meant to enhance sector growth and opportunities for
employment creation and rural income growth, and in some cases Georgia’s compliance
with WTO and EU requirements.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The objective of the project was to develop the productivity and profitability of
the private agriculture sector. This would be achieved by facilitating the access of
Georgia’s mainly small and medium-scale farmers to supply chains, improving the
competitiveness of the supply chains and strengthening the capacity of selected
agricultural and financial institutions to serve private-sector agricultural market activity.

8.      To track the progress toward achieving this development objective the following
set of PDO outcome indicators was meant to be used, as reflected in the PAD Results
Framework (Annex 3)4:

        Increase in sales and profits of enterprises in the supply chains supported under
     the project;
        Increase in net income of farmers participating in project-enhanced
     marketing/supply chains;
        Amount of employment created in agriculture and agro-industry enterprises
     supported by the project;
        A sustainable system of rural credit cooperatives;
        A substantial self-financed public registry for land and moveable property
     registration by the end of the project.
        Seed, sanitary and phyto-sanitary, and food safety laws enacted and food safety
     system upgraded.
        Strategies and action plans for institutional development completed.




4
 The Credit Agreement Supplemental Letter #2 on Performance Monitoring Indicators contains a significantly reduced version of the
PAD Results Framework. The differences are discussed below.



                                                               3
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.      The revised objective was to improve agricultural production and access to
markets for Georgia's small and medium-scale farmers and rural enterprises supported by
the project, through: (i) increasing the competitiveness of selected supply chains; (ii)
strengthening the delivery of rural financial services and of the financial intermediaries;
and (iii) modernizing key institutions for food safety and property registration with direct
impact for increasing competitiveness of Georgia's agriculture.

10.    To track the progress toward achieving the revised development objective the
following set of revised PDO indicators was used:

            Improved incomes for farmers and enterprises from activities supported under the
             project;
            Improved access to agricultural rural finance;
            Improved capacity of the food safety and property registration institutions.

11.      The change in the project’s PDO and the ensuing modifications in the results
framework were dictated by: (i) substantive changes in the content and scope of project
components; and (ii) significant reallocation of proceeds amongst project components
and disbursement categories. These changes were necessary for corrective and adaptive
reasons. On the one hand, by the time the Level 1 Restructuring was processed, the
project was clearly on a poor performance path due to a combination of factors, such as
design flaws and uncertain government commitment to some of the project’s initial
activities. On the other hand, the project needed to retain relevance by adapting to the
evolving strategic direction of policies and reforms promoted by the Government at the
time. The initial formulation of the PDO was determined to be “ambitious and broad? 5,
and the results framework deemed difficult to measure and suffering from attribution
problems. Subsequently, the Government of Georgia and the World Bank (in consultation
with IFAD) agreed on a restructuring approach which would have enabled the project to
achieve the revised objective in a simpler, yet more effective manner.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.          The main beneficiaries identified at appraisal were:

(i) Private: A broad range of private sector operators in the country’s agriculture and
agri-business sectors, ranging from small and medium-size farmers, to agricultural
processors, as well as other private, supply chain-integrated entities. These were meant to
receive financial and technical support aimed at increasing agricultural knowledge and
technology transfer, strengthening supply chains, accessing rural finance, and accessing
more sophisticated markets. Another distinct beneficiary category is the country’s
financial sector players, represented by commercial banks and non-bank financial

                                                      4
institutions, which were meant to benefit from access to medium and long-term financial
resources for further financial intermediation, as well as capacity building activities
aimed at increasing facility with agricultural lending, diversification of loan products, and
branching out into rural areas. The causality linkages between the project’s activities,
intended beneficiaries and project outcomes were based on the assumption that providing
(generally speaking) access to agricultural knowledge and finance would lead to
increased productivity and profitability of the sector, and would reduce poverty in rural
areas by increasing incomes and employment.

(ii) Public: A number of government agencies that were undergoing institutional
modernization and had the potential for playing a key role in establishing an enabling
environment for a more vibrant operation of the agriculture and agri-business sectors.
The thematic focus of the institutional modernization effort supported by the project was
two-fold: (a) food safety; and (b) land/property registration. At the time of appraisal, the
country’s institutional food safety set-up was still evolving hence the description of
intended beneficiaries is vaguely formulated to indicate a focus on professionals in the
MOA in charge of various food safety aspects, as well as on the creation of a Food
Department in the MOA. In regard to public property registration, the main institutional
beneficiary of the project’s activities was the National Agency for Public Registry.

13.     The Level 1 Restructuring of the project did not lead to any substantive changes
in the type or expected number of beneficiaries reached by the project.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Agricultural Supply Chain Development (Estimated Cost US$4.27
million, of which IDA - US$0.58 million, IFAD - US$0.31 million, PHRD Grant -
US$2.17 million, Beneficiaries -US $0.29 million and Government- US$0.92 million)

14.    The component aimed to support the efficient development of marketing/supply
chains for commodities that have a demonstrated market potential, with the view of
expanding profitable domestic and export market opportunities. The project would work
with all agents in potentially profitable agricultural supply chains to develop and
implement a holistic strategy for identifying and addressing weaknesses and bottlenecks.

(a) Supply Chain Analysis and Development. The objective of this sub-component was
to develop a holistic strategy for the expansion of profitable sales in domestic and export
markets. This would involve assistance in determining consumer demand, identifying
technical, regulatory, institutional, contractual and financial constraints, developing a
collaborative strategy for their redress, and analyzing sources of supply. The supply chain
analysis would attempt to determine where commodity associations and other market
participants could productively reinforce linkages among actors along a commodity chain
both formally and informally. The project would finance for each project year, technical
assistance, training, and studies in market and supply chain analysis and development. It
would support agri-business firms in identifying regulatory, technological, contractual,



                                             5
and investment constraints and assist in the development of marketing plans, supply
chain linkages, contractual agreements, and investment proposals.

(b) Linkages to Farm Communities. The sub-component was to test a program to assist
farmers and communities to engage with commodity supply chains in an equitable and
profitable manner. Using field demonstrations, capacity building workshops and local
study tours, the RDP would introduce farmers to more productive and profitable market-
linked agricultural technology. Farmers would be empowered to develop marketing
groups and associations with a view of improving product quantity and quality and,
thereby, improving market access and price. Provisions would be made to support the
development of business plans and proposals for loan applications to participating
financial institutions (PFIs) and for activities supporting the initiation and development of
enduring commercial relationships between farmers and key supply-chain entities.
Local/international NGOs, employed under performance-linked contracts, would manage
pilot programs in eastern, central and western Georgia, which would be reviewed after 15
months, leading to the identification of a longer-term project strategy for improved small-
scale commercial farm productivity and market linkages. Second, the project would also
provide assistance both to the new and to existing farmer groups to link to commodity
supply chains. For this, the project would finance technical assistance and training and
partially support farmer group set-up costs and some equipment.

(c) Technology Transfer. The project was to support small-scale farmers and farmer
groups engaged in potentially profitable agricultural supply chains to develop
appropriate, modern farm technology, crop and livestock management practices, and
post-harvest technology and demonstration programs. Development of technology would
be supported through the Agricultural Supply Chain Development Fund. Producers,
processors and traders would be encouraged to identify technology gaps and develop
applied research and demonstration programs in collaboration with local and national
research and extension institutions. The proposals would be submitted to the ASCDF
Advisory Committee for competitive selection.

Component 2. Rural Finance Services (Estimated Cost US$25.76 million, of which
IDA - US$8.2 million, IFAD - US$8.49 million, PHRD Grant US$1.16 million,
Beneficiaries - US$4.50 million, Government - US $0.51 million, Commercial Banks -
US$2.7 million and NBFIs - US$0.20 million)

15.     This component intended to improve the capacity of PFIs to lend to the farmers,
processors and agri-business enterprises involved in the marketing/supply chains of
marketed agricultural commodities. This would be achieved by (a) providing them with
additional capital for lending to private entities in the agricultural sector, particularly
medium and long-term loans for investment, and (b) strengthening their capacity for
sustainable rural lending.

(a) Credit Line for Commercial Banks. This credit line would be made to eligible
commercial banks to increase their capacity to make medium and long-term investment
loans to eligible farmers, processors and agri-business enterprises.



                                             6
(b) Credit Line for Non-Bank Financial Institutions. This credit line would be made to
eligible non-bank financial institutions (including Credit Unions) to increase their
capacity to make small investment and working capital loans to eligible farmers,
processors and agri-business enterprises.

 (c) Strengthening the Capacity of PFIs for Sustainable Rural Lending. This
component aimed to strengthen the capacity of participating rural financial institutions to
appraise and manage loans for production, agro-processing and agri-business; develop
and promote appropriate loan products and collateral instruments; provide matching
grants to selected NBFIs for the establishment of new rural branches; and develop
sustainable rural credit unions. Support would be provided for training of bank and NBFI
personnel, technical assistance to design, test and adopt more appropriate loan products,
collateral instruments and financial services, and matching grants of up to $10,000 to
cover the costs of qualifying NBFIs of establishing new rural branches. Well-managed
Credit Unions would be supported to expand and become financially sustainable.

Component 3: Institutional Modernization (Estimated Cost US$3.17 million, of which
IDA- US $0.68 million, IFAD - US$0.65 million, PHRD Grant - US$1.05 million,
Beneficiaries - US$0.05 million and Government - US$0.74 million).

16.    This component was to focus on specific, key legal and institutional reforms that
impact directly on the competitiveness of Georgian agriculture and the safety and
marketability of its products and enable Georgia to meet its international sanitary and
phyto-sanitary obligations. Project interventions would be focused on:

(a) Institutional and Legal Framework. The sub-component intended to work with
relevant MOA staff to revise selected food, plant variety protection and veterinary laws
and regulations to meet international trade and treaty requirements and support Georgian
membership and participation in international standards organizations relevant to
Georgian agricultural trade. Training and study tours would be provided, and operating
manuals based on an EU compliant legislative framework would be developed. The
project would also enable the Georgian government to establish a comprehensive, unitary
food safety management and risk assessment system in line with the requirements of a
draft Food Law existent at the time. This was to include the establishment of a Veterinary
and Food Department within the MOA, the strengthening of domestic and border sanitary
inspection capacity, the strengthening of laboratories for accredited food inspection, the
development of a risk assessment capability and the establishment of the Food Safety
Council prescribed under the draft law.

(b) Support for Selected Commodity-Specific Programs. The sub-component was to
support specific commodity chains. For example, the project would provide, based on the
needs and proposals from the commodity chains, support for the development of product
certification, quality testing and labeling standards.

(c) Continuing Support for Property Registration. The sub-component was to support
the recently created NAPE by contributing to the completion of its network of regional
centers, developing of systems for the integration of land and moveable property registry


                                            7
and land cadastre databases, establishing a secure NAPR data management and transfer
network, and developing information programs on NAPR services.

Component 4: Project Management (Estimated Cost US$1.51 million, of which IDA -
US$0.54 million, IFAD- US$0.67 million, PHRD Grant - US$0.12 million and
Government - US$0.54 million).

17.     The project was to be managed under the umbrella of an existing World Bank
Project Coordination Center, or its agreed successor within the MOA. The PCC or its
agreed successor would be responsible for all aspects of project administration, including
overall project oversight, TA, goods and materials procurement, and financial control.
The day-to-day management of the project would be with the technical Project
Implementation Unit within the PCC, or its agreed successor. A Project Steering
Committee (PSC) including representatives from government, private sector and donor
agencies would provide project oversight and ensure national program integration.


1.6 Revised Components

18.    Following the Level 1 Restructuring 6 the project maintained the same four-
component structure. However, the first three components were revised in scope and
content as follows.

Component 1: Agricultural Supply Chain Development

19.        The main changes were:

         Replacing Sub-component 1 (b) – Linkages to Farm Communities, with a new
      Sub-component 1 (b) – Training and Demonstration Program. The objective of the
      new sub-component was to establish a training and demonstration program for
      farmers and rural enterprises involved citrus and hazelnut supply chains.

          Renaming Sub-component 1 (c) – Technology Transfer, to Sub-component 1 (c)
      – Competitive Grant Program. The sub-component was also revised in substance to
      allow for the possibility of extending small competitive grants to farmer groups and
      rural enterprises for competitiveness enhancing sub-projects in priority supply chains.
      The competitive grant scheme was to be managed by the PCC/PIU, and the
      establishment of the initially envisaged Agricultural Supply Chain Development Fund
      was no longer required.




6
  The team has erroneously entered the Level 1 Restructuring in the system twice: one dated July 9, 2009; and one dated July 10,
2009.




                                                                 8
Component 2: Rural Financial Services

20.        The main changes were:

          Support envisaged for strengthening the capacity of credit unions was dropped
      due to the collapse of the credit union system in Georgia;

           The amount of credit lines for participating commercial Banks was increased.

Component 3: Institutional Modernization

21.     The main change was refocusing the support for the food safety agenda by
preparing the groundwork for when the legislation will be changed towards enforcing
food safety actions and controls. The support was to include: (i) the rehabilitation of, and
provision of equipment to a food safety laboratory; (ii) the rehabilitation of, and provision
of equipment to several regional veterinary offices; and (iii) training and technical
assistance for staff involved in the food safety agenda.

1.7 Other significant changes

22.     Throughout its lifetime, the project has undergone three restructurings. The first
was a Level 1 Restructuring, approved on July 09, 2009. In addition, to changes in the
PDO, results framework and components, the restructuring led to a reallocation of
proceeds across the project’s funding sources, categories, and components. In response to
the Government’s stated preference to use IFAD and PHRD grant resources for providing
grants to farmer groups and rural enterprises, uncommitted IFAD grant proceeds were all
consolidated under Component 1 (US$700,000). Subsequently, undisbursed IDA
resources (US$500,000) initially allocated to Component 1, were reallocated to
Component 2 for augmenting the credit line available to the PCBs. Last but not least, the
restructuring extended the project’s closing date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011.

23.     The second restructuring was a Level 2 Restructuring processed on March 29,
2011. Its main purpose was to reallocate remaining IDA funds away from the commercial
bank credit line towards micro-finance institutions. This reallocation was necessary to
channel funds towards a more vibrantly disbursing activity7, while lending through PCBs
has come to a halting stop due to their inability to continuously meet eligibility criteria
for drawing project funds and, more generally, their lack of interest in agricultural
lending following the impact of the global financial crisis on Georgia.




7
  At the time of the restructuring, the allocation of funds to MFIs has been fully disbursed (RDP Restructuring Paper, March 23,
2011).




                                                                  9
24.    The third restructuring was a Level 2 Restructuring processed on April 28, 2011.
It came to complement the above restructuring, by removing the limit to maximum
lending to non-bank financial institutions, and increasing their borrowing limit from 50%
to 70% of their equity. This was necessary to accommodate growing demand for credit
resources from MFIs for rural-based lending. Appropriate assessments of the institutional
and financial health of the participating MFIs indicated that such adjustments would not
negatively affect the sustainability of the MFIs. 

25.    IFAD financing extended to June 30, 2012, beyond the closing of IDA financing
of June 30, 2011. Remaining IFAD funds were allocated primarily for the MFI credit
line.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.     Project background analysis. The project was generally well-contextualized in
existing strategies and policies in place in Georgia at the time of preparation. It has
benefitted from sound analytical and technical work supported by the World Bank, IFAD,
Japan’s PHRD Fund, and USAID. A particularly solid body of knowledge that seems to
have shaped the focus of the project’s supply chain development activities was the
experience of the USAID-funded AgVANTAGE project and the World Bank-financed
Enterprise Rehabilitation Project. 

27.     In addition to a solid body of technical and analytical knowledge, the project
benefited in its design from the experience of other agricultural and rural development
World Bank projects under implementation at the time - the Agriculture Development
Project and the Irrigation and Drainage Community Development Project. The ADP had
a particularly strong influence on the preparation of the RDP by presenting essentially
“real-time? examples on what were the main sector challenges that needed to be
addressed in the area of rural finance and registration of land and moveable assets.

28.      Reflection of lessons learned in the design. The discussion on the reflection of
lessons learned in the RDP PAD is rather generic. While the narrative provides a proper
description of the sector context, background and sources of technical and analytical
information that influenced the design (as noted in para. 25-26 above), it mostly fails to
provide details on the specific lessons that informed the design of components and
activities. For example, the PAD states that AgVANTAGE had carried out extensive
analyses of various supply chains, which the RDP used in designing its support for
supply chains, but it does not highlight what elements of these analyses were
incorporated into the RDP design (nor alternatives considered). Similarly, the experience
of the Center for Enterprise Restructuring and Management Assistance created under the
ERP is presumptively stated to have been useful for the design of institutional
arrangements, selection of procedures for companies receiving assistance, and cost-
sharing arrangements between the project and beneficiaries. But again, there is no



                                           10
specificity as to what where the important elements that were picked up in the design of
the RDP. The positive exception here is the detailed elaboration on ADP lessons
regarding access to rural finance, i.e. relevance for sector growth, financial
intermediation approaches, strengthening of financial institutions, and expansion of the
rural client base. It provides a well-set logical segue into the structure and operating
principles of the Rural Finance Services Component.

29.      A somewhat questionable statement made on lessons learned from Bank and
IFAD-financed operations, which was embedded in the design relates to the need to keep
project design as flexible as possible. Indeed, some degree of flexibility is rendered,
especially for demand-based activities that require fine-tuning and adjustments during
implementation. However, at the time of preparation general consensus in project design
and management was shifting away from a loose design, to a more pro-active supervision
effort, and the ensuing utilization of project restructuring as a means for maintaining
necessary flexibility during implementation.

30.    The rationale for Bank and IFAD intervention. The rationale for Bank
intervention was well-argued and sound. The World Bank and IFAD were logical
partners in the project given their institutional mandates, as well as international and in-
country experience in the sector. There were also positive synergies to be explored with
on-going Bank and donor-funded projects, as well as from bundling the IDA and IFAD
financing into a single project. The World Bank involvement also served as a vehicle for
the mobilization of extensive PHRD co-financing.

31.     Project design. An unequivocal assessment of the quality of the RDP’s design is
problematic. The benefit of hindsight, as related to the project’s implementation record
and the need for a Level 1 Restructuring, indicates that quality of design at entry was
variable. The project was not reviewed for quality at entry by the Quality Assurance
Group.

32.     The original PDO was overly ambitious and broad. The original Results
Framework relied on too many PDO indicators. These suffered from poor causal links to
the PDO, were difficult to measure and suffered from attribution flaws8. For example, an
original indicator used employment creation in targeted farms and rural enterprises as a
measure of the original PDO (increased profitability and productivity). While
employment creation is a generally positive economic outcome, it is a poor gauge of a
company’s profitability and especially productivity. The revised PDO represented a
much more meaningful statement of intent, with a more accurate and logical
representation of the project’s intended goals. Also, the revised Results Framework
eliminated the original’s ambiguity, immeasurability and attribution deficiencies.
However, some revised outcome indicators were set for fairly low quantitative targets.



8
 As mentioned forth in more detail, the original (PAD) Results Framework was never fully utilized to measure the project’s progress.
Only two PDO indicators were included in the project’s ISRRs.




                                                                11
33.       The quality of design of the project’s components was uneven.

         The design of the Agricultural Supply Chain Development Component was
      generally adequate. Its structure was based on thematically sound, well-integrated
      sub-components, that covered activities aimed at identifying and strengthening supply
      chains with potential for growth. However, the component’s scope could have been
      more focused, both in breadth and depth. Seemingly any element or part of a supply
      chain (and any supply chain) was covered, without concentration on a particular
      element or sub-element of the supply chain (or concentration on particular supply
      chains). The concentration on particular supply chains was to be determined through
      Sub-Component (a) – Supply Chain Analysis and Development, but it can be argued
      that this is a typical preparation/appraisal activity that needs to be firmed up before,
      not during implementation. This loose approach has caused implementation problems
      down the road, when the component was being treated as a financier of last resort for
      emerging MOA requests, whether in line or not with the project’s thematic thrust and
      objectives. Also, Sub-components (b) and (c) suffered somewhat from lack of detail
      on the implementation approach to providing technical and financial assistance to
      farmers and rural enterprises. As a result, the two sub-components were revised
      through the project’s Level 1 Restructuring to make implementation more practical.

         The Rural Finance Services Component had a well-structured, straightforward
      and generally focused design. It had the feel of a well-appraised component with
      clearly outlined activities. The PAD version of the Rural Credit Guidelines provided a
      good initial framework for the operating principles of the project’s credit lines and for
      access by potential PCBs and NBFIs, the criteria of eligibility for the PCBs and
      NBFIs, on-lending principles, etc. While not all the activities of the component were
      successfully implemented, these failures were largely caused by exogenous factors,
      and were not inherent to the quality of design. The project’s Level 1 Restructuring
      had only marginal revisions of the component.

         The quality of the design of the Institutional Modernization Component was
      variable. Sub-component (a) – Institutional and Legal Framework lacked focus and
      took an all-encompassing approach in providing technical assistance and institutional
      support to the country’s emerging food safety agenda. Sub-component (b) – Support
      for Selected Commodity-Specific Program was extremely vague, as it seemingly
      intended to support some unidentified outputs from Component 1. Sub-component (c)
      – Continuing Support for Property Registration was a well-structured sub-component,
      with clear definition of activities. The project’s Level 1 Restructuring primarily
      addressed the need to focus the component’s activities, in an uncertain policy and
      institutional environment, on some basic elements of the country’s food safety agenda.

         The quality of the Project Management Component was solid, relying on the
      existing experience of the ADP and other World Bank projects implemented prior to
      the RDP




                                               12
34.     An overarching theme for the quality of design is the project’s complexity.
Complexity per-se is not an indication of poor quality of design. However, when
contextualized in the thematic breadth of the project’s three component’s and nine-sub-
components, the number of organizations involved in implementation, and not the least
the novelty (for Georgia) of the approaches under Component 1, an emerging conclusion
is that the design of the project should have been more streamlined and focused on a
smaller number of activities.

35.     Government commitment. Government commitment at appraisal was solid. The
PAD and other documents on file, indicate that the Government was active in the
preparation and implementation of this operation. A contribution of US$2.5 million in
counterpart funds was pledged by the Government to the operations of the project.
Further commitment was shown through the Government’s willingness to implement the
project through the PCC/PIU that was tasked with day-to-day management of the project,
including preparation of work plans, procurement, financial management, reporting,
monitoring and evaluation.

36.     Assessment of risks. The design adequately identifies and reflects some of the
risks inherent to financial intermediation projects such as commercial and financial risks,
and offers appropriate mitigation measures. To a large extent, the project itself was a
vehicle for mitigating risks related to financial intermediation. Also, the PAD properly
reflects fiduciary risks and associated mitigation and management measures. However,
on safeguard risks, the PAD does not sufficiently elaborate on the risks associated with a
likely increase in the use of pesticides by participating farmers and subsequently does not
trigger OP 4.09 – Pest Management. This was rectified through the Level 1 Restructuring,
when OP 4.09 was triggered and proper measures were initiated.

37.      On other possible implementation risks, there is only a timid assessment of such
risks and associated mitigation measures, primarily related to general business
environment, political instability and availability of counterpart funding. This assessment
does not provide a meaningful and realistic account of implementation risks related to the
range and magnitude of policy and institutional reforms the project aimed to support,
institutional capacity to absorb supported activities, government commitment and design
risks, nor is there a discussion of possible mitigation measures.


2.2 Implementation

38.     A straightforward and unequivocal assessment of the project’s implementation is
problematic. In order to present a more nuanced, yet systemic assessment of the project’s
implementation performance, it is necessary to set a framework that distinguishes among:
(i) exogenous factors – factors outside of government/implementing agency control; (ii)
endogenous factors - factors subject to government and/or implementation agency
control; (iii) implementation performance before the project’s Level 1 Restructuring; (iv)
and implementation performance after the project’s Level 1 Restructuring.




                                            13
39.    Exogenous factors that affected implementation. The country has been exposed to
three major external shocks that to some extent or another affected implementation
performance. Chronologically, the first shock came in the spring of 2006 when the
Russian Federation banned imports of Georgian wines. However, the negative impact of
the wine ban on the implementation progress was fairly marginal - more psychological
than material. If anything, the ban provided an impetus for the Government to seek a
more comprehensive and strategic approach towards the development of the wine sector,
and the project was well positioned to provide the necessary support.

40.     The second shock came in 2008, in the aftermath of a brief, yet economically and
socially crippling military conflict with a neighboring country. This shock had a
significant impact on the project’s Rural Finance Services Component, as both supply of
and demand for rural credit, as well as quality of the PCB and NBFI portfolio
deteriorated in light of economic disruptions and ensuing uncertainty. 

41.     The third shock came in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis. It affected
the country’s financial system and lead to a marked contraction of commercial credit in
the economy, and a deterioration of the financial standing of the country’s commercial
banks. This had a severe impact on the project’s participating commercial banks, which
found themselves unable to comply with eligibility requirements for accessing the
project’s credit line. Additionally, the PCBs became much more prudential about lending,
which significantly reduced their interest in reaching rural clients. The combination of
these two factors led to an initial de-facto suspension of Sub-Component 2 (a) - Credit
Line for Commercial Banks, followed by a formal reallocation of credit line resources
away from banks to non-bank financial institutions. 

42.     Endogenous factors that affected implementation. The following summarize the
factors which were subject to Government/Implementing agency control:

(i) Sector policies:

       a. Government indecision on the utilization of a revolving fund for credit unions
       established under the ADP led to the impossibility of providing technical
       assistance to qualified credit unions through the RDP. Eventually the country’s
       credit union system collapsed and the project’s support activities were cancelled.

       b. Some provisions of the legal framework for the operation and registration of
       microfinance organizations caused delays in the implementation of MFI support
       activities. These issues were not sorted out until after mid-term review.

       c. Policies related to the food safety agenda were ambiguous and led to loss of
       direction of the project’s support. While a Food Safety Agency was established in
       2006, by-laws related to enforcement of food safety actions and controls were not
       put in place in a timely manner, resulting in implementation delays and eventually
       revision of activities.




                                            14
(ii) Government Commitment:

      a. Government commitment to the project suffered from significant unevenness.
      The country went through a change in the Government composition in 2005. This
      lead to the withdrawal of the World Bank CAS 2006-2009 from Board of
      Executive Directors. Essentially the project was prepared during the tenure and
      under the governance program of one Government, but was implemented during a
      different Government. In addition, the project was implemented during a period
      that saw six different Ministers of Agriculture with different policy agenda, views
      and priorities. This fluidity was the major contributing factor to the unevenness in
      government commitment, both to the original design of the project, and also to the
      revised activities. Poor commitment was reflected primarily in lengthy delays in
      approval by the Government of key documents that were necessary to commence
      certain activities.

      b. The project’s effectiveness was delayed by two months from August 26, 2005
      to October 26, 2005, although partially this problem can be attributed to the
      Parliament’s schedule

      c. The Agricultural Supply Chain Development Component suffered the most
      from delays and actual indecision which led to significant underperformance. The
      Ministry of Agriculture moved very slowly on the approval of specific component
      activities, and failed to approve the operational manual for the ASCDF, as well as,
      following the component’s formal revision, the operational manual for the
      Competitive Grant Program. Even the reallocation of funds that ensured that only
      grant resources (PHRD and IFAD) were to be used for the financing of the
      Competitive Grant Program was not sufficient to engender full support on the part
      of the Ministry of Agriculture.

      d. The Rural Finance Services Component suffered from delays in the approval
      of the final version of the Rural Credit Guidelines for commercial banks which
      took more than 12 months. The approval of the Rural Credit Guidelines for non-
      bank financial institutions, which was largely the same document as the one for
      the commercial banks, took nearly 18 months. Also, as mentioned above there
      was no support for the project’s activities aimed at the credit union system, and
      eventually the activity was cancelled.

      e. Under the Institutional Modernization Component, the activities related to the
      food safety agenda were significantly delayed by the indecision of the approval of
      a food safety training program and action plan prepared with support from the
      project that would have set the strategic and institutional framework for further
      investments and technical assistance to be provided by the project. The
      commitment towards the activities aimed at the institutional strengthening of the
      NAPR was much more solid, yielding very positive and timely results.




                                          15
            f. The commitment towards ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted
            implementation of the project’s activities comes into question when considering
            the impact of the Government’s decision to liquidate the PCC and the technical
            PIU, and mainstream the implementation of the project through the MOA. While
            the rationale of the mainstreaming effort is not subject to review, the timing (six
            months before the closing of IDA and PHRD financing) and the modality of the
            effort was certainly unproductive, especially as it happened during an extremely
            busy implementation period. These actions caused disruptions in activities under
            implementation and lead to the eventual cancellation of a large number of
            programmed activities. Details on cancelled activities are available in Annex 2. 

            g. Finally, another general element that is reflective of the Government’s
            variable commitment was the ad-hoc approach to the project’s activities. This was
            particularly prominent until the Level 1 Restructuring in 2009. The restructuring
            brought in more structure to the components, which lead to less randomness in
            requests for support from the MOA (although it did not completely eliminate
            them), and even a renewed commitment to the project’s revised activities.
            Unfortunately, while the commitment displayed towards Components 2 and 3,
            was relatively solid, Component 1 was hampered by further indecision, resulting
            in significant under-disbursements from the PHRD Grant.

(iii)       Management effectiveness and appointment of key staff.

            a. The initial choice of pursuing implementation through the PCC/PIU ensured
            an overall efficient management of day–to–day project tasks, as well as proper
            compliance with fiduciary and safeguard requirements. But there were problems
            in administrative procedures as related to approval of project activities or outputs
            by the MOA, particularly under Component 1. In addition, the above-mentioned
            mainstreaming effort stripped the PCC/PIU of juridical power to sign project
            contracts, virtually bringing implementation to a halt in the last six months of
            implementation of IDA and PHRD financed activities. As mentioned above, this
            has left a number of important activities unfinished.
            
            b. Appointment of key staff affected implementation of Component 1, when a
            national supply chain coordinator could not be recruited for two years. The above-
            mentioned mainstreaming effort also negatively affected the staffing of the PCC/
            PIU, with a number of employees leaving prematurely as a result.

43.    Implementation performance before the project’s Level 1 Restructuring. The
implementation performance at the time the restructuring was processed can be
characterized as variable and registering an unequivocally slow progress. The project’s
implementation rating was moderately unsatisfactory9.

    ISRR Sequence #7.



                                                16
44.     Implementation performance after the project’s Level 1 Restructuring. The
implementation performance following the restructuring can be characterized by positive
improvements, although still variable across components. Even after restructuring, the
Agricultural and Supply Chain Component never received necessary support from the
Ministry of Agriculture10 for the implementation of the Competitive Gran Program. The
other two components fared much better. The implementation performance was also
negatively impacted by the mainstreaming of project management into the MOA. The
project’s implementation rating at closing was moderately satisfactory11.

45.    In conclusion, the factors described above had an adverse impact on the overall
implementation progress, which was variable and characterized by stop-and-go progress.
This was captured in the supervision effort through adequate reflection of the
implementation progress ratings, as well as continuous corrective measures initiated by
the task team. The mid-term review essentially set the groundwork for the Level 1
Restructuring, although it can be argued that the restructuring should have been
processed sooner12. The implementation supervision effort was not subject to a review by
the Quality Assurance Group for a project with “at risk? status.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

46.    ?he initial results framework had the following serious structural and presentation
shortcomings:

           (i) Major discrepancy between the formulations of the PDO in the PAD main text
           under section B. Project Description – para. 2 and the Results Framework table
           contained in Annex 3;

           (ii) Major discrepancies and inconsistencies between the compositions of outcome
           indicators listed in the PAD main text under section B. Project Description – para.
           2, and the Results Framework table contained in Annex 3;

           (iii) The table on the Arrangements for Results Monitoring contained in Annex 3
           lists only three outcome indicators, as opposed to seven in the Results Framework.
           Similarly the Credit Agreement Supplemental Letter #2 lists only three outcome
           indicators. Also, the three outcome indicators are worded differently in the table
           on the Results Framework (and Supplemental Letter #2) and the table on the
           Arrangements for Results Monitoring. The difference for the first outcome
           indicator is of substance as it brings ambiguity to the outcome target group.

           (iv) The results indicators for each component differ in number for all three
           components and in substance for Components 1 and 3 in the table on Results
           Framework and the table on Arrangements for Results Monitoring.

10
   The Ministry of Agriculture failed to approve the operational manual for the Competitive Grant Program.
11
   ISRR Sequence #12
12
   The Level 1 Restructuring was processed 15 months after the mid-term review.



                                                                17
             (v) Only 2 out outcome indicators were used to track the project’s progress in the
             ISRRs before the Level 1 Restructuring. This is compared to 7 outcome indicators
             in the table on Results Framework, 3 outcome indicators in the table on the
             Arrangements for Results Monitoring (Annex 3), and 3 outcome indicators in the
             Supplemental Letter #2.

             (vi) Only 3 results indicators were used to track the project’s progress in the
             ISRRs before the Level 1 Restructuring. This is compared to 14 indicators in the
             table on the Results Framework, 10 results indicators in the table on the
             Arrangements for Results Monitoring (Annex 3), and 10 results indicators in the
             Supplemental Letter #2.

             (vii) According to the PAD implementation schedule, the project was supposed to
             be implemented over 5 years, by the PAD Results Monitoring table (page 40)
             only put intermediate targets over 4 years.

47.     From a qualitative perspective the outcome and results indicators were too
numerous, difficult to measure and suffering from attribution flaws. They did not present
a logical and sufficiently reflective structure of the project’s inputs. 

48.    These inadequacies in the structure and quality of the results framework persisted
until the Level 1 Restructuring. The restructuring brought about simplicity and
improvements in the indicators.

49.      Design. The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation activities was conferred
to the PCC/PIU. The project was processed without the completion of the baseline study.
The baseline was to be established at the beginning of implementation of each sub-
component. Data format and collection requirements were supposed to be developed
during the first supervision mission The monitoring of credit lines was to occur at two
levels, regular reviews of the financial soundness and viability of the participating
financial institutions, and simultaneous reviews of the way in which beneficiary loans are
being used and managed 13 . In addition, IFAD worked with the PCC to elaborate an
exhaustive questionnaire, which would have allowed for the monitoring of multiple
variables (including outcome variables) related to the beneficiaries of the project’s credit
lines. Implementation progress was supposed to be monitored through regular (quarterly)
reporting by the PCC/PIU in agreed formats.

50.      Implementation. As was originally envisaged, monitoring and evaluation
activities were implemented by the PCC/PIU. A full-time monitoring and evaluation
specialist was brought on staff. Contrary to statements made in the PAD, there is no
evidence that the initial plans of establishing the baselines and data format and collection

                                                 18
requirements were developed early in the supervision effort. This is particularly,
unfortunate against the backdrop of the deficiencies in the Results Framework
highlighted above. The monitoring of data for Components 1 and 3 was limited to an
account of project outputs, with only scant information collected on outcome indicators.
This had a negative impact on the quality of the updates of the Results Framework in the
project’s ISRRs. This situation persisted until the project’s Level 1 Restructuring. For
Component 2, the situation was markedly better. The PCC/PIU had a sound system for
providing timely and accurate information, collected from the National Bank of Georgia,
PCBs and NBFIs, on the financial health of the participating financial institutions. The
PCC/PIU also had a well functioning system for the monitoring of the health of the
lending portfolio of the PCBs and NBFIs. Unfortunately, monitoring of credit line
beneficiaries based on the IFAD supported questionnaire was not implemented. 

51.     Following the Level 1 Restructuring, and the ensuing improvements in the Results
Framework, the Bank team and the PCC/PIU made a concerted effort to improve the
monitoring system for Components 1 and 3. A Monitoring Plan outlining these
improvements was developed. Unfortunately, the Monitoring Plan was never
implemented, partially due to lack of implementation progress under Component 1, and
partially to deficient administration arrangements towards the closing of the IDA and
PHRD Gran financing. 

52.    The PCC/PIU complied adequately with the project reporting requirements.
Although progress reporting was not done quarterly, as indicated in the PAD, but semi-
annually, and sometimes with delays. 


53.     Utilization. Data monitored and collected under the project was used primarily
for two purposes: (i) inform decision-making related to project implementation; and (ii)
impact evaluation. In relation to the first point, collected data on the financial health of
the participating financial institutions and health of the lending portfolio was used to
inform decisions related to eligibility of these financial institutions to the project’s credit
lines. Collected data was used to estimate the impact of the project’s interventions on
target groups, which subsequently informed the updates of the project’s outcome and
results indicators. Information was collected based on a random survey method through
one-on-one interviews of PCB and MFI beneficiaries and can be considered reliable. An
end-project impact evaluation was not carried out, primarily due to the institutional
confusion caused by the liquidation of the PCC/PIU. This is unfortunate because such an
exercise would have provided additional insight into the project’s outcomes, particularly
at farm/rural business level, and would have ultimately given a better sense of the
economic and financial benefits of the project.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

54.    Financial Management. Regular financial management reviews of the PCC/PIU
carried out by the Bank team confirmed a highly satisfactory financial management
system during the project life, compliant with the financial covenants of the project’s


                                              19
legal Agreements. Internal controls, accounting procedures and financial management
reporting were all carried at highest standards of competence. Annual project audits were
unqualified (clean), and recommendations that were occasionally raised were addressed
in a timely manner.

     Procurement. The PCC/PIU’s ability to effect procurement activities in line with
World Bank policies and procedures has been consistently sound. Procurement ratings
have never been rated lower than moderately satisfactory, with the median rating being
satisfactory. Procurement post-reviews found that procurement processes were generally
reliable, timely and transparent with some corrective actions requested by the Bank
related to updates and compliance with the procurement plan, quality of technical
specifications and contract management.

56.     Disbursement. Disbursements are a function of successful implementation. To
this end, the Project struggled early on to keep up with initial disbursement estimates due
to a slow start, although, certainly, disbursement estimates were overly-optimistic to
begin with. With a surge in performance and substantial reallocation of proceeds towards
the Rural Finance Services Component, disbursements picked up significantly for the
IDA credit. In addition, the extension of its closing date ensured its nearly full
disbursement. The IFAD Credit also registered high disbursement rates. The PHRD
Grant registered poor disbursement rates due to lack of implementation progress under
the Agricultural Supply Chain Development Component. Specifically, 103% of IDA
funds were disbursed, 88% of IFAD funds were disbursed and 36% of the PHRD funds
were disbursed.

57.     Environmental Assessment. The project was rated as “environmental category
FI?, initially triggering only OP 4.01(Environmental Assessment). Following the Level 1
Restructuring, the project retained the environmental category, but OP 4.09 (Pest
Management) was also triggered. This was due to the fact that the implementation of the
proposed Competitive Grant Program would have led to an increase in the use of
pesticides and fertilizers. Essentially, OP4.09 should have been triggered from the
beginning, in response to the types of grants that may have been financed under the
original Sub-Component 1 (c) – Technology Transfer. However, due to lack of
implementation progress of the original activities of the sub-component, there were no
violations of OP4.09. An Environmental Management Plan and Environmental
Guidelines were prepared to comply with the requirements of OP 4.01. Following the
triggering of OP 4.09, the Environmental Guidelines were updated to include a Pest
Management Plan and a Pest Management Handbook.

58.     There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguard policies
throughout implementation. Overall, safeguard compliance was satisfactory, as indicated
by regular reviews. The project’s ISRRs have rated overall safeguard and environmental
assessment (OP 4.01) compliance as satisfactory in all but two ISRRs (Sequence s #5 and
#10 – moderately satisfactory). Pest management compliance (OP 4.09) was always rated
as satisfactory. The episodes in which the rating was moderately satisfactory related to:
(i) the need for better compliance of the participating banks with the requirements of



                                            20
environmental screening and classification of sub-loans; and (ii) the need to ensure more
individualized environmental management plans for construction works supported by the
project. Necessary corrective measures were promptly implemented and ratings were
upgraded.

59.     Social Safeguards. No social safeguards were triggered by the project. All
construction works were carried out on sites on public land. OP 4.12 - Involuntary
Resettlement was not triggered.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

60.      The outlook for the post-completion phase of the activities of the Agricultural
Supply Chain Development component is mixed. On one hand, a positive factor is that
targeted farmers which have benefited from technical assistance under the development
of citrus and hazelnut supply chains received important knowledge and inputs that should
make their operations more competitive. The project laid the groundwork for further
commercialization of hazelnut cultivation, as demonstrated by on-going USAID funded
activities apply approaches similar to the RDP’s14. In addition, many technical activities
and studies supported by the project (particularly in the wine sector) led to knowledge
generation that would likely inform sector policies and strategies. On the other hand, due
the failure of the ASCDF and the Competitive Grant Program, project financing for
activities aimed at supply chain development was negligible. Essentially, the efforts to
integrate farmer and rural businesses into supply chains stopped at project closing.

61.     The outlook for the post-completion phase of the activities of the Rural Finance
Services is positive. The participating MFIs are well-positioned to continue their
operations in the country’s rural areas – their portfolios are healthy and institutional
capacity to continue rural lending is robust. They are now in a better position to access
external resources for on-lending to rural beneficiaries, than they were before the project.
A revolving mechanism for the utilization of IDA and IFAD reflows would have allowed
them to sustain more easily current levels of lending. Unfortunately such a mechanism
was not put in place yet 15 . Commercial banks, that significantly reduced agricultural
lending in the aftermath of the financial crisis, are likely to resume it when their financial
situation allows it.

62.    The outlook for the post-completion phase of the activities of the Institutional
Modernization Component is moderately positive. On one hand, the National Agency for
Property Registration emerged into the post-completion phase as a very well-functioning,


14
   A training program designed by USAID’s Economic Prosperity Initiative (EPI) and delivered in collaboration with the Italian
company Ferrero (the largest foreign investor in Georgian agriculture).

15
     For IFAD the establishment of a revolving fund is a loan covenant.




                                                                  21
well-equipped, trained and fully sustainable (including financially) institution. On the
other hand, there is a lot of uncertainty about the ability of the food safety laboratory of
the MOA and the 10 regional NSVFS to become fully operational in the post-completion
stage due to further funding, staffing and equipment needs. However, the country’s
engagement with the EU on the negotiations of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade
Agreement, and the prospect of funding from the EU Comprehensive Institutional
Building Program, strengthens the sustainability outlook for the country’s food safety
institutions, as additional funding is likely to be provided to achieve food safety
compliance with the EU rigors.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

63.     The Project’s revised objective, design and implementation remain highly
relevant to Georgia’s development priorities. The original objective and implementation
also remain relevant, while the original design has a few elements which are less relevant
in the current context (ex. support for Credit Unions). This is the case both for the
original PDO and design, as well as the revised PDO and design. The Government’s
medium-term program entitled “United Georgia without Poverty? (2008) and the “Basic
Data and Directions? strategy document (2010-2013) which outline sector strategies,
clearly establish as priority development areas growth in agricultural exports, increased
rural productivity and incomes, job creation, food safety and effectiveness of governance,
financial intermediation and strengthening of property rights.

64.     The project also remained highly relevant in the context of the FY06-09 CPS
Progress Report, under the pillar of “Generating jobs? and “Strengthening of public
sector management?. The FY10-13 CPS also renders the project relevant through its
strategic pillar of “Restoring growth and competitiveness?

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

65.      The original PDO was to develop the productivity and profitability of the
agriculture sector. This was to be achieved by facilitating access of Georgia’s mainly
small and medium-scale farmers to supply chains, improving the competitiveness of the
supply chains and strengthening the capacity of selected agricultural and financial
institutions to serve private sector-agricultural market activity. The achievement of the
original development objective was de-facto measured only through two outcome
indicators and three intermediate outcome indicators, despite a more extended results
framework contained in the PAD. Indeed, implementation progress was very slow and
indicators were not being achieved, but a deficient Results Framework made it even more
problematic to gauge the project’s impact and assess the achievement of the development
objective. A detailed review is presented below.




                                            22
Outcome indicators

      i.    Increased sales (20%) and profit (50%) of enterprises by the project. The last
            reported status for the indicator, before the project’s Level 1 Restructuring, had no
            quantitative information about the progress, simply stating that “Indications are
            positive with a wide range of activities supported under the credit line?. As such,
            it is impossible to state that the outcome and its contribution to the PDO were
            being achieved.

     ii.    Increased net income (50%) of farmers participating in project-enhanced
            marketing supply/chains. The last reported status for the indicator, before the
            project’s Level 1 Restructuring, had no quantitative information about the
            progress, simply stating that “Only one grant provided to citrus exporters allowing
            access to new market, technical assistance and demonstrations for improved
            agricultural practices conducted?. As such, it is impossible to state that the
            outcome and its contribution to the PDO were being achieved.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

      i.    Number of commodity chains evaluated and supply chains supported. The
            quantitative target was for the support of 14 supply chains. The last reported
            status for the indicator, before the project’s Level 1 Restructuring, indicated that 3
            supply chains were evaluated and being supported. Since, this indicator was
            revised (target reduced) following the restructuring its consideration against the
            original PDO is not feasible.

     ii.    Key institutional development areas supported. The quantitative target was for the
            support of 4 areas. The last reported status for the indicator, before the project’s
            Level 1 Restructuring, indicated 3 areas of support: food safety, seed legislation
            and cadastre. This represents 75% of the target. Numerically, the contribution to
            the objectives of the project was strong. However, the indicator was vague and
            was not providing any insight into the effect this support had on specific
            regulatory and institutional policies.

    iii.    Increase of agricultural lending as a percentage of agricultural GDP. The
            quantitative target was 4% of agricultural GDP, from a baseline of 1.2% of
            agricultural GDP. The project targeted an approximate increase of 2.8 percentage
            points. The last reported status for the indicator, before the project’s Level 1
            Restructuring, indicated that agricultural lending was 2% of GDP - an increase of
            0.8 percentage points 16 . This represented 29% of the target at the time
            immediately prior to the Level 1 Restructuring, after which the indicator was
            dropped. A judgment on the contribution of the indicator to the project objectives
            has to be based on an assumption of how much more progress would have been



16
     The source for the status of outcome and indicator progress before the Level 1 Restructuring is the ISRR Seq. #7.



                                                                  23
           made in the remaining two years of implementation if the indicator was not
           dropped. Based on the end-of-project amounts of credit resources channeled to the
           rural economy, it can be reasonably assumed that 29% represented a strong
           contribution to the project’s objectives, and had it not been dropped it would have
           been in the 75%-100% range of achievement.

66.     The project’s revised PDO was to improve agricultural production and access to
markets for Georgia’s small and medium-scale farmers and rural enterprises supported by
the project through: (i) increasing the competitiveness of selected supply chains; (ii)
strengthening the delivery of rural financial services and of the financial intermediaries;
and (iii) modernizing key institutions for food safety and property registration with direct
impact for increasing competitiveness of Georgia’s agriculture. The achievement of the
revised development objective was measured through three outcome indicators and nine
intermediate outcome indicators17. A detailed review is presented below.

Outcome indicators

      i.   Improved incomes for farmers and enterprises from activities supported under the
           project. The quantitative end-target was to achieve a 10% increase in incomes.
           The actual reported increase achieved was 28.3%. This represents a 183%
           achievement of the outcome and a very substantial contribution to the
           achievement of the PDO.

     ii.   Improved access to agricultural rural finance. The quantitative end-target was to
           achieve a rate of 35% of rural households having access to finance from a
           baseline of 28%. The actual reported rate achieved was 41.4%, which is 6.4%
           more than target, and represents a 191% achievement of the outcome (13.4%
           actual increase from 28%, over the forecasted 7% increase). This represents a
           very substantial contribution to the achievement of the PDO.

 iii.      Improved capacity of the food safety and property registration institutions. The
           qualitative end-target was to develop central and local capacity. The indicator has
           to be disaggregated for activities focused on improving food safety institutions
           and the NAPR. The project’s outputs for the improvements in the food safety
           system have been delivered, although at the time of the closing of IDA financing,
           some were still not operational. The objective of improving the capacity the
           NAPR was fully achieved. The contribution to the achievement of the PDO can
           be considered significant.


Intermediate Outcome Indicators

      i.   Number of supply chains supported. The quantitative end-target was 5 supply
           chains, from a baseline of zero. The project supported 3 (hazelnut, citrus and


17
   The Level 1 Restructuring Paper had a revised Results Framework which contained 3 outcome and 9 intermediate outcome
indicators. Only 7 intermediate outcome indicators were tracked through ISRRs. Indicators 3 and 6 were not.



                                                             24
             wine). This represents a 60% achievement. The indicator was not fully achieved,
             so the contribution to the project’s objective can be characterized as moderate.

     ii.      Number of farmers/farmer groups supported in the supply chain through T&D
             and grants. The quantitative end-target was 35, from a baseline of zero. The
             actual reported target achieved was 43 direct beneficiaries (farmers), which
             represents a 123% achievement. There were 604 additional indirect beneficiaries.
             The contribution to the project’s objectives was substantial.

     iii.    Number of rural enterprises supported through grants. The quantitative end target
             was 7. The actual target achieved was 1, which represents 14%. The contribution
             to the project’s objective can be characterized as negligible.

     iv.     Total rural investments generated by the project through the banks. The
             quantitative end-target was US$22.0 million. The actual reported target achieved
             was US$22.0 million. This represents a 100% achievement, and a substantial
             contribution to the project’s objective.

      v.     Number of jobs created through PFI lending with project funds. The quantitative
             end-target was to create 50 jobs. The reported achievement was 205 jobs. This is a
             410% achievement. Numerically the target was overachieved, and represents a
             very substantial achievement, but the initial target was very low. Unfortunately,
             the indicator doesn’t capture self-employment that was engendered by the MFI
             lending, where the portfolio clearly enabled thousands of rural inhabitants to
             explore such opportunities.

     vi.     Total number of loans and micro-credits generated by the project. The
             quantitative end-target was to extend 1,000 bank loans and micro-credits. The
             latest monitoring data indicates that there were 10,000 micro-credits extended by
             MFIs and 27 sub-loans extended by the PCBs. This represents a 900%
             achievement of the target. If reflows are taken into account the number of loans
             extended by PCBs and MFIs is 11,081 (1,100% achievement). The contribution to
             the project’s objectives was very substantial, but the initial target was very low.

vii.         Well-functioning and effective labs and regional centers for food safety. The
             qualitative end-target sought an upgrade in capacity. The MOA food safety lab
             was rehabilitated and equipped. Six regional veterinary centers were constructed18.
             Training to staff of the national service (FSA) was delivered. However, some of
             the laboratory equipment was not in operation at the time of closing; the territorial
             offices were not functional due to lack of equipment and furniture. Thus, while
             the scope of activities was substantial, the contribution to the project’s objective
             was achieved only partially.



18
     The ISRR Sequence #12 mistakenly states that 10 territorial offices were constructed.



                                                                   25
viii.       Establishment of the network of NAPR regional centers. No quantitative end-
            target was established. The project served as a catalyst for significant donor
            support for the establishment of a network of 68 territorial centers19. The project
            also provided equipment and technical assistance for ensuring the connectivity,
            interoperability and integration of data management systems of the NAPR and its
            regional centers. The contribution to the project’s objective was substantial.

     ix.    Development of the CORS for NAPR. The qualitative end-target was to establish
            a CORS system. The system has been installed and was fully operational at
            project’s end. The capacity of the NAPR staff to utilize the system was enhanced.
            The contribution to the project’s objective was substantial.
            
67.     They were 8 core indicators introduced in 2010 (see datasheet). Most were for
reporting purposes and are not reviewed in the narrative.


3.3 Efficiency

68.     Generally, a judgment of the appropriateness of cost levels vs. expected outputs at
appraisal is problematic due to the flexibility of the design that often did not set clear
linkages between initial component costs and expected outputs, and to the demand-based
nature of the activities supported under Component 1 and 2. Project or component ERRs
were also not calculated at appraisal. The most meaningful ex-post analysis of the
project’s cost-efficiency can be made along the premise that nearly 80% of project funds
were disbursed under the Rural Finance Services Component which relied on market-
based financial intermediation. Allocation of resources to end-beneficiaries at financial
rates of return that ensured that sub-loans were bankable (both by commercial banks or
non-bank financial institutions), and subsequent high repayment rates, represents robust
evidence that the project was implemented efficiently. In addition, project results for all
components were achieved without exceeding the financing envelope at appraisal,
therefore strengthening the conclusion of overall efficiency.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     The outcome rating against the original PDO and Results Framework is rated
moderately unsatisfactory. This is based on assessment that accounts for the
shortcomings described above in achieving the project objectives, while at the same time
accounting for a relatively high relevance of objectives and implementation (less so for
the relevancy of the original design) and efficiency. While an analysis of the outcome
indicators suggests a lower rating, the problem was essentially one of measuring the
outcomes due to deficiencies in the Results Framework described earlier.


19
     These activities were also supported with funding from USAID, GTZ, KFW, SIDA and NAPR’s own resources.



                                                              26
      The outcome rating against the revised PDO and Results Framework is rated
satisfactory. The following considerations were used to arrive to this conclusion. The
revised PDO remains highly relevant for Georgia’s development agenda. It had specific
objectives related to supply chain development, rural finance and institutional
modernization directly linked to Components 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Their relative
importance to the PDO can be best judged by the initial amounts allocated to the
underlying components. To this end, the first specific objective of increasing the
competitiveness of selected supply chains was not fully achieved due to poor
implementation progress of Component 1. The second specific objective of strengthening
the delivery of rural financial services and of the financial intermediaries was fully
achieved. This judgment is informed by the data on outcomes, but also on the quality of
outputs that were generated under the component in terms of total lending to farmers and
rural enterprises, the diversity of the rural lending portfolio, the quality of the rural
lending portfolio (repayment rates), expansion by the commercial banks and non-bank
financial institutions of their rural client base, etc. The third specific objective of
modernizing key institutions for food safety and property registration with direct impact
for increasing competitiveness was also largely achieved. This judgment is informed by
the magnitude and sustainability of the modernization effort achieved in the food safety
institutions (partial) and the NAPR (modernization and sustainability). To this end, the
PDO was achieved from a quantitative and qualitative point of view through the
contribution of the specific objectives supported by Components 2 and 3, with
Component 2 having the largest relative share of financing (80%). The contribution of the
specific objective supported by Component 1 was not fully achieved. The project was
implemented efficiently. The combination of relevance and achievement of the revised
PDO, in the context of overall efficiency, justifies a satisfactory outcome rating. 

71.      The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The conclusion is based on
a weighted evaluation approach which takes into account the outcome rating against the
original PDO, the outcome rating against the revised PDO, and disbursement rates before
(44%) and after the restructuring (56%).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.     In addition to economic benefits, positive gender externalities were also an
important achievement of the project. Nearly 70% of beneficiaries supported by the
project’s hazelnut supply chain development activities were women. For citrus the
participation of women was 80%. In addition, micro-finance lending achieved similar
outreach to women.
        
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

    Institutional changes/strengthening achieved by the project was described earlier. 




                                           27
       

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

74.     The ability to timely channel more resources        towards micro-finance lending
served as a great aid to Georgia’s rural people in the      aftermath of the August, 2008
conflict. The country was faced with huge economic          and social challenges, and the
availability of micro-finance resources for lending to      the rural population helped in
relieving some of the economic pressure.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

    There was no project completion stakeholder workshop held. 

       
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

76.     There are a number of aspects that could influence the project’s long-term
sustainability.

       a.      For Component 1, sustainability of technical advice delivered to
       beneficiary farmers is impacted by lack of follow-up, both during the project
       phase, as well as in the post-operation phase. There is no public or private
       extension service in the country that could either build up on the project’s
       engagement with farmers and rural businesses, or continue with the dissemination
       of the knowledge created under the project to a larger audience of farmers. In
       addition, the initial approach of engaging qualified NGOs for propagating support
       for supply chain development has failed, not allowing for the evolvement of a
       core of small consulting entities that could support future activities related to rural
       business development. This is mitigated by continuing donor and private sector
       support for facilitating farmer access to integrated supply chains.

       b.      For Component 2, the biggest risk to long-term sustainability is different
       for commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions. For banks, the risk to
       sustainability comes from the fact that aversion to rural lending (caused by the
       2008 financial crisis), may continue too long, leading to loss of institutional
       memory and knowledge for rural lending that was built with project support. For
       NBFIs, the major risk to sustainability comes from possible future difficulties in
       assuring adequate external funding for on-lending to rural clients. The World
       Bank and IFAD proposed to the Government of Georgia to consider the
       establishment of a revolving fund that would use project reflows for continuous
       lending to NBFI. Unfortunately, such a fund was not established and at some
       point the NBFIs will need to seek and secure funding from other resources.
       However, the mitigating factors for this risk are: (i) existing SLAs would allow



                                             28
       the participating NBFIs to use reflows for on-lending for a few more years (albeit
       in discontinuing volumes as they repay to the MOF); and (ii) as a result of the
       project, the NBFIs are much better positioned to secure external lending, having
       established a record of successful performance under the RDP.

       c.      For Component 3, the highest risk to sustainability comes from the ability
       of the project supported institutions to ensure proper operation, maintenance and
       up-keep of the equipment and facilities that were procured/rehabilitated. In the
       case of the NAPR there is quite a bit of certainty that the long-term institutional
       sustainability will be maintained. This assessment is based on the comprehensive
       support the agency received from the project and other donors, but also from its
       business model and approach to cost-recovery and development. For the food
       safety institutions supported by the project, the risk to sustainability is high, due
       to their reliance on government funds for full operationalization of the assets
       provided by the project, as well as future maintenance and up-keep needs. This is
       mitigated by the country’s strategic alignment for compliance with EU food
       safety rigors through the negotiations of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade
       Agreement, which should ensure steady financing for maintenance and further
       upgrades of the food safety institutions.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

     The Bank properly established the sector context, the project’s relevance,
thematic coverage, and the resulting mix of components. However, the overall design
suffered from lack of focus and, particularly for Components 1 and 3, the project often
suffered from lack of finality on what it was going to support. Components 1 and 3 were
structured in a way that left some elements under-designed (ex. the operations of the
ASCDF) and vague (lack of initial specificity on the support for the food safety agenda).
Without a clear direction, these components struggled the most initially, and had to be
significantly revised through the Level 1 Restructuring. The project suffered from a
poorly formulated initial PDO and weak causality in its Results Framework. Additionally,
the Results Framework was wrought with inconsistencies and mistakes. The economic
analysis was deficient, lacking an ERR calculation (at least for Components 1 and 3), and
substituting proper quantitative and qualitative economic analysis with notions related to
comparative trade analysis. Environmental aspects did not cover pest management issues,
which were clearly relevant under Component 1, and the proper safeguard was not
triggered. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements for Components 1 and 3 lacked
specificity and structure. 

(b) Quality of Supervision



                                            29
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The Bank maintained a solid focus on ensuring the fulfillment of project
objectives. The task team closely supervised implementation through annual, and at times
more frequent missions, fiduciary reviews, and maintenance of a constructive dialogue
between the project’s major stakeholders. Issues raised were addressed in a timely
manner and were candidly reported in the official documentation. For example, during
the MTR the Bank identified very specifically the substantial problem areas, suggested
ways in which the MOA and the PCC/PIU, as well as other relevant institutions could
resolve them, and followed up with specific measures on the Bank side to facilitate the
necessary changes (Level 1 Restructuring). The task team did a solid job of ensuring that
the project’s activities were implemented in line with the provisions of environmental
safeguards triggered by the project. Fiduciary reviews were carried out in a timely and
effective manner as per institutional requirements. The team managed relatively well
other internal institutional requirements related to reporting (ISRRs). Finally, the task
team built an excellent partnership with IFAD which resulted in a very effective,
participatory approach to the supervision of project’s activities.

79.     The areas were Bank performance should have been more astute relate to the
timing of the corrective measures implemented through the Level 1 Restructuring. The
Bank should have been more pro-active in processing the restructuring sooner, perhaps at,
or immediately after the mid-term review 20 . The underlying realism of performance
ratings should have reflected better the state of urgency for engendering necessary project
revisions. Some initial design flaws, as well as the weakening commitment by the MOA,
should have been addressed more aggressively and much sooner than nearly four years
into implementation. Another, negative aspect relates to the Bank’s failure to reflect the
changes in the project’s Results Framework in the legal agreement, by formally
amending the Supplemental Letter #2.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    World Bank support to the Government of Georgia in preparing and
implementing the project is rated as moderately satisfactory. The rating is derived largely
from the Bank’s performance on supervision, especially in the context of the project’s
Level 1 Restructuring, which demonstrated responsiveness and adaptation to
implementation challenges. 

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




20
     The MTR took place in March, 2008. The Level 1 Restructuring was approved on July 9, 2009.




                                                                30
81.     At preparation, the Government of Georgia supported the project and its
objectives. However, from the outset, the implementation dynamic has been difficult due
to delays in the approval of key project-specific implementation documents, for example,
the RCGs for commercial banks and NBFIs (Ministry of Finance), or the operating
manual for the ASCDF and the Competitive Grant Program (Ministry of Agriculture). In
addition, there were significant delays or lack of direction in engendering critical legal
and institutional adjustments (credit unions, food safety) which were imperative for an
efficient implementation of the project. Government performance has stabilized after the
mid-term review, especially for Components 2 and 3, allowing for improvements in
implementation and a positive outlook for the achievement of the project’s main
objectives. Counterpart funds were provided in adequate (although not full) volumes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.      The Ministry of Agriculture was the project’s implementing agency. For fiduciary
tasks and component coordination it was assisted by the PCC/PIU. As discussed above,
the MOA displayed highly variable, but mostly weak commitment to the project’s
activities (structure) and objectives. The most unfortunate example is the protracted
indecision on activities under Component 1. Generally, resolution of implementation
issues was slow, despite agreements reached with the Bank. The mainstreaming of the
PCC/PIU into the MOA was also handled in a manner which had an adverse impact on
the implementation of the project in early 2011, i.e. inability to finalize multiple activities
due to outright cancelation by the MOA, or the inability of the PCC/PIU to effect
necessary procurement, in the absence of feasible viable alternatives. These transitional
problems also had a negative impact on the end-of-project impact evaluation, which was
not carried out.

83.     Against this backdrop, the performance of the PCC/PIU was generally
satisfactory. Fiduciary aspects related to financial management, procurement, safeguards
compliance were addresses in a timely and qualitative manner, as acknowledged by
period reviews. Financial management was a particular highlight, as it was constantly
rated as highly satisfactory.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.     The justification for the rating stems from the weight of the MOA’s role, as an
implementing agency, in the assessment of the Borrower’s performance. The
implementing agency had a much more prominent role than the Government of Georgia
at large, whether central or local, and in particular the Ministry of Finance, the other
important player in the project.

6. Lessons Learned

85.     Project design should be more focused. The project would have benefited from
more thematic focus, and subsequently fewer, yet implementable activities. Indeed,
development needs and demands are always numerous, but an adequate balance is always
necessary between a meaningful and manageable scope and the instinct to go for more.
Ideally, project-supported themes should be complementary and provide for mutually
enabling, and perpetuating results. The benefit of hindsight comes to support plausibly
this conclusion. The RDP would have benefited from fewer components and sub-
components (activities). This would have also contributed to a more meaningful initial
formulation of the PDO and to a tighter and more logical Results Framework.

86.     Project activities should have better definition. While recognizing the need for in-
built flexibility of design, there is a clear need to have well-appraised activities
(technically and otherwise), that give the project a sense of finality and strategic direction.
Too much flexibility leaves the project hostage to situational, spur-of-the-moment
preferences by project proponents, hampering implementation pace. Again, poorly
defined activities pose problems for establishing firm causal links between the project’s
outputs (which become tentative) and outcomes.

87.     Operating guidelines for grant-schemes. Echoing the lesson above, operating
guidelines for competitive grant schemes need to be properly outlined in project appraisal
documents. Indeed a certain degree of operational flexibility is intrinsic to the nature of
such demand-based activities. However a firm general framework is absolutely critical to
establishing a clear initial approach to the implementation of a grant program.
Additionally, a document that establishes the operating principles of a grant scheme
should be approved by the counterpart as early as possible in the preparation cycle, and
ideally be a covenant for a preparation milestone, such as negotiations or board
presentation.

88.    Finality of monitoring and evaluation arrangements. A project’s monitoring and
evaluation arrangements framework should be finalized at appraisal, and be meaningfully
connected through its monitoring and impact variables to the PDO and the Results
Framework. It is certainly not desirable to leave the conceptualization of the M&E
arrangements for the early stages of project implementation. Even the practical set-up and
functionality issues should be firmed-up as early in the preparation process as possible.

89.      Readiness for implementation. Setting key realistic expectations in areas of policy
reforms, regulations and institutional strengthening is a key pre-requisite for successful
and timely implementation of project’s that address institutional modernization. While
not suggesting that projects should not follow ambitious goals, overall project design and
activities should be better grounded in the reality at preparation.

90.    Pro-activity in restructuring problem projects. Substantive corrective measures,
such as Level 1 Restructurings should be implemented more pro-actively, and early
enough in the project implementation cycle, especially when the underlying design issues



                                             32
and implementation problems dictate such actions. In addition, to the actual merits of
corrective measures, their timely processing allows for a sufficient time horizon in the
post-restructuring implementation phase, thus making restructurings more meaningful for
achieving results.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

(b) Co-financiers

     In its comments to this report, IFAD raised the issue of effective assessment of
the project’s impact in the absence of an end-project impact evaluation, expressing the
opinion that the report could strengthen this point. In fact, the ICR clearly states that
failure to carry out the evaluation was unfortunate as it did not allow for additional
insight into the quality of project’s outcomes.

     Another comment by IFAD seeks clarification on the state of operations at the
food safety laboratory and NS regional centers at the time of closing of the IFAD
financing. The report purposefully posits as a benchmark for the assessment of
achievement of these activities the closing date of IDA financing, as these were not
supported by IFAD during the remaining duration of IFAD financing. Nonetheless, since
the closing of IDA financing there has been progress in achieving operationalization of
these facilities. 

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

COMPONENT 1: AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT

1.      The Agricultural Supply Chain Development Component had the objective to
support the efficient development of marketing and supply chains for commodities that
had a demonstrated market potential, with the view to expand profitable domestic and
export market opportunities, through: (i) supply chain analysis and development; (ii) a
training and demonstration program; and (iii) the provision of competitive grants.

2.      The component had only moderately achieved its objectives. Despite some
notable achievements, the component never achieved an optimum scale of
implementation. It lacked a clear strategic vision, and many supported activities were of
an ad-hoc nature generated, by situational needs of the MOA. In addition, many
programmed activities were not completed. Detailed information on component outputs
and activities dropped is presented in the Table 1 below.

3.       Sub-component 1 (a) - Supply Chain Analysis and Development. The project
supported analyses and development of three supply chains: hazelnut, citrus and wine. It
did so through a variety of activities such as: (i) applied technical assistance and studies;
(ii) a draft wine sector strategy (ii) marketing and awareness-raising events; (iii) applied
testing for improved production and competitiveness; and (iv) applied technical
guidelines for cultivation. A particular highlight is the support that the project provided
for the organization and proceedings of the 33rd International Vine and Wine Congress.
This event helped raise international awareness about Georgian wines, at a time when
further diversification of wine exports was paramount. Unfortunately, another major
project output that could have contributed further to the development of the country’s
wine sector - the draft Wine Sector Strategy, was not approved by the Ministry of
Agriculture, and as such was never formalized as a national strategic document.

4.      Sub-component 1 (b) - Training and Demonstration Program. The project
supported demonstrations of new technologies for citrus and hazelnut cultivation in the
Adjara Region and Zugdidi District. These demonstrations focused on introduction of
new varieties, agronomic improvements, and plantation maintenance. There were 43
direct beneficiaries (farmers) and more than 604 indirect beneficiaries. These new
technologies contributed to: (i) an increase in the productivity of private hazelnut and
citrus plantations; (ii) to improvements in the consistency and quality of harvest; and (ii)
to better supply-chain integration. Ultimately, these activities generated additional
employment and increased incomes for beneficiary farmers. The approaches tested under
this sub-component are now implemented under other donor and private-sector funded
farm advisory programs.

5.      Sub-Component 1 (c) - Competitive Grant Program. Despite repeated attempts to
initiate the Competitive Grant Program (as well as the ASCDF before it), including
simplification of draft operating guidelines and reallocation of proceeds, the program was




                                             35
      never implemented due to the indecision on the part of the Ministry of Agriculture to
      clear the guidelines.

1.      The Rural Finance Services Component had the objective to increase the capacity
of participating commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions to lend to farmers,
processors and agri-business enterprises involved in the supply chains of various
agriculture commodities.

2.      The component had successfully achieved its objectives. It provided credit to
farmers and rural enterprises through a credit line for commercial banks and a credit line
for micro-finance institutions. It had surpassed expectations on two levels: the impact on
the income of the beneficiaries and the extent to which participating financial institutions
reached out to rural clients. The only area in which the project was less successful is the
support to credit unions (these activities were formally dropped through the Level 1
Restructuring). Detailed information on component outputs and activities dropped is
presented in the Table 2 below.

3.      Sub-component 2 (a) – Credit Line for Commercial Banks. The project provided
credit resources for much –needed medium and long-term investment capital to a broad
range of agricultural and food-processing businesses. The PCB portfolio was healthy and
diverse, generating nearly US$22.0 million in investments, and creating 205 new jobs.
The investments supported by the PCBs were in viticulture and wine-making, live-stock
breeding, meat packing, dairy operations, cultivation of fruits and vegetables, and other
food processing. Unfortunately, the commercial bank credit line was impacted by a series
of exogenous shocks to the country’s financial system. Otherwise it is plausible to
assume that its outreach would have been wider.

4.      Sub-component 2 (b) – Credit Line for Non-Bank Financial Institutions. The
project channeled a significant amount of rural credit through this sub-component. There
were five participating micro-finance institutions involved: Credo, Finca, Kristal, Lakiza
Capital, and Finagro. These are relatively well-capitalized and financially healthy
entities. The project financed a wide range of activities, including livestock breeding,
greenhouses, small production of fruits and vegetables, dairy production, minor food-
processing, agricultural trade and services. The average sub-loan size was around
US$1,100, with an average maturity of 13.69 months. The sub-loan portfolio was very
sound with the 30-day portfolio at risk of 1.36%. Repayment rates were high, with the
write-off ratio at only 0.92%. These activities have provided critically necessary rural
lending at a time when the lending through commercial banks was shrinking, resulting in
increased rural employment (self-employment and new jobs) and ultimately in increased
incomes for the beneficiary farmers and rural entrepreneurs.

        5.       Sub-component 2 (c) – Strengthening the Capacity of PFIs for Sustainable Rural
        Lending. The project was successful in building capacity of the participating financial
        institutions. It delivered necessary training to credit officers in appraisal of rural
        investments and delivery of new financial products. The best gauge for the quality of
        these activities is the positive financial results achieved under the sub-component, both in
        terms of the quality of the sub-loan portfolio, as well as its size and reach. However,
        probably the biggest contribution to the strength of the NBFIs was their participation and
        experience with the RDP. Before the project, these micro-finance institutions were small
        and relatively unknown entities. Now they have a track-record that can help them in
        securing additional donor funding to proliferate their rural lending activities.

                                                   Restructuring).


        COMPONENT 3: INSTITUTIONAL MONDERNIZATION

        1.       The Institutional Modernization Component had the objective to strengthen the
        institutional capacity of key agencies that could impact on the competitiveness of
        Georgian agriculture, marketability and safety of its products through: (i) support for
        food safety; and (ii) support for land registration.

        2.    The component had achieved its objectives, although some food safety activities
        were implemented partially. Detailed information on component outputs and activities
        dropped is presented in the Table 3 below.

        3.     Sub-component 3 (a) – Institutional and Legal Framework. This sub-component
        focused on support for the country’s food safety agenda. Following the Level 1


                                                    38
Restructuring, the project focused on essential activities, with the intent of providing the
following support for food safety: (i) rehabilitation of and equipment for the food safety
laboratory of the MOA; (ii) rehabilitation of and equipment for several regional
veterinary offices; and (iii) training and technical assistance for food safety staff.
Frequent changes in the leadership and staffing of the National Service for Veterinary
and Food Safety made implementation of this component challenging. More specifically,
the food safety laboratory was fully rehabilitated and necessary equipment procured and
supplied. However, due to implementation disruptions caused by the closure of the
PCC/PIU and its mainstreaming into the Ministry of Agriculture, some equipment was
not installed an operational at project closing, and training in the use of the new
equipment was not provided. Similarly, due to implementation disruptions associated
with the PCC/PIU closure, the project supported the construction of six regional
veterinary offices, but furniture and equipment were not procured and supplied, hence
veterinary staff could not move into the buildings and utilize the new facilities. The
project also supported training for the National Service staff in Latvia on the following
topics: on-farm quality assurance for raw materials; controls of food and animal origin;
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points; Food and Hygiene Controls; EU Food
Standards; EU Food Legislation; animal welfare; plant health controls; risk analyses
(assessment, management and communication); control of food and feed of animal and
non-animal origin.

4.     Sub-component 3 (b) – Support for Selected Commodity-Specific Programs. There
are no specific outputs linked to this sub-component, either before or after the Level 1
Restructuring.

5.      Sub-component 3 (c) – Continuing Support to Property Registration. The
objectives of this sub-component have been fully achieved. These included establishing a
network of 68 NAPR territorial offices, developing a system to integrate land and
movable property register and cadastre databases, and establishing a secure NAPR data
management and transfer network. All 68 offices have been connected to the Georgia
Global Network (radio wave connections for all state and public organizations), so there
is a back-up system for the electronic offices. For the establishment of the 68 territorial
center, the project contributed to a larger effort supported with funding from other donors
(USAID, GTZ, KFW and SIDA) and NAPR’s own resources. Additionally, the project
supported together with SIDA the development of the Continuously Operating Reference
System, which includes 12 reference stations across Georgia, with prospective
connections to the European Reference System. The NAPR is the owner of the system
and responsible for its maintenance. The NAPR is financially self-sustaining from the
fees charges for property and business registration.

6.     Essentially, at the end of the project, the NAPR was a modern, well functioning
and transparent cadastre and registration agency, offering advanced services (including
eServices) to its clients in a simple, timely, effective and client-friendly manner. It now
plays a significant role in Georgia’s quest for sustained economic growth through
reducing the cost of doing business and securing land-ownership and property rights.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     The PAD did not attempt to estimate and overall NPV or ERR for the project.
There were also no estimations of component-level NPV and ERRs for Components 1
and 3, which were the most amenable to such an analysis. For Component 3, the
economic and financial analyses were based on a number of selected production models
for which NPV and FRRs were calculated.

2.      Component 1. Agricultural Supply Chain Development. The implementation of
the component did not go beyond a limited number of activities for a limited number of
supply chains. The activities that were implemented were essentially knowledge
generation, dissemination and demonstration activities for improved agronomic
cultivation of citrus and hazelnut. A precise measurement of the likely
economic/financial benefits from these activities is problematic for two reasons: (i) some
benefits are intrinsically unquantifiable (ex. publication of thematic booklets); and (ii)
there was no attempt made during the component’s implementation to estimate adoption
rates of knowledge/information disseminated to farmers, nor was there any actual
assessment of ensuing impact on yields and incomes for those farmers that adopted the
agronomic advice received. In any event, it is plausible to assume, that access to new
information and knowledge on improved productive practices and varieties would lead to
better financial performance. Additional economic externalities can be expected from
incremental wage employment generation and a more vibrant rural economy in the
communities were targeted farmers are operating.

3.      Component 2. Rural Finance Services. This was the component with the largest
cost at appraisal, and at closing accounting for nearly 80% of all project funds. Hence its
weight in the project’s overall economic outlook is highly essential. The PAD had no ex-
ante aggregate ERR/FRR estimations for finance activities, as they were deemed
impossible due to the demand-driven nature of financeable sub-loans. There were only
estimates of NPV and FRR values for a set of six production models: red saperavi grapes
plantation, hazelnut plantation, apple orchard, parsley greenhouse production, tea
plantation, and small dairy cattle. The discount rate used was 12%, and the time horizon
of the investment models varied from 12 to 25 years. These calculations indicated the
financial feasibility of investments in plantations of red saperavi grapes (FRR of 20%),
hazelnut (FRR of 15%), apples (FRR of 26%) and greenhouse production of parsley
(FRR of 46%). Investments in tea plantations and small dairy cattle had negligible and
marginal rates of returns, respectively.

4.      The production models considered in the PAD were clearly meant for financing
by commercial banks, judging by size of investments and maturity of loans. An ex-post
confirmation of these individual NPV and FRR estimates is unfeasible at this time for
two reasons: (i) a disconnect between the initial production models and the actual
investments (27 sub-loans) financed by the participating commercial banks; and (ii) the
relative “youth? of investments that were financed with sub-loans. Regarding the
disconnect, an analysis of the portfolio of sub-loans by the PCBs indicates that there were
only four sub-loans that fit the typology of the PAD production models - one grape
plantation sub-loan, two milk production sub-loans, and one hazelnut cultivation sub-


                                            42
loan. Even so, there are problems in adequate financial comparisons between these sub-
loans and the PAD models due to differences in the size of investments, maturity and
lending terms. Regarding the second reason above, i.e. the relatively young age of the
investment projects, it could significantly skew a calculation of the rate of return
downwards due to the likely negative cash flow on the investments in the initial years.
Indeed, some of the sub-loans have not reached full maturity and not yet been repaid, so
the investment costs are still outweighing the income streams. An additional
methodological reason, that makes a de-facto FRR calculation unfeasible at this time
relates to the specific nature of SME lending. SME lending is not “project finance?,
where assets and cash flows generated by the investment are legally segregated from the
rest of the company’s assets and cash flows. The investment project will increase or
replace assets, but the incremental return attributable to the investment is buried in the
company’s overall return on all assets. The increase in profit is a very crude indicator of
the incremental “return? because the net profit is affected by a range of other
management decisions (acquisition or sale of other assets, hiring, marketing, systems,
etc.). Thus even if the RDPP investment were not undertaken, there would be a change in
profit due to other decisions and actions. In cases where the investment is a significant
portion of a company’s total assets, the overall profitability of an SME can be a close
measure of the RDP project, but as mentioned above, the relatively young age of these
investments and the unrealized full “return? makes and NPV and IRR calculation
premature.

5.     Against this background of analytical limitations at the time of the ICR, the best
proxy (indication) of the likely financial performance of the project-supported
investments is the business plan estimation of the IRR which informs the lending
decision by the commercial banks. Available data on the pool of loans financed by the
RDP indicates robust median rates of returns in the mid-30% (outliers ranging from 8%
to 79%).

6.       For the sub-loans supported by the MFI’s, the average loan size was of US$950,
for short-term working capital and small rural investments. Lending decisions by the
MFIs’ are generally not informed by strict IRR calculations, so it is impossible to present
an analytical account of IRRs for the 10,000 loans (11,111 including loans from re-flows)
that were made by the RDP participating MFIs. In any case, MFI lending evaluation
literature establishes a direct correlation between the level of capital employed and
financial returns. To this end, in the case of micro-finance loans that employ lower
capital, the financial returns are higher, although net income is generally low due to high
interest rates.21 The up-take demand, growth in rural portfolio of the MFIs and repayment
rates (against the backdrop of growth in farmer incomes - 35%), are good predictors of
sufficiently high return rates for the RDP micro-finance activities.

7.      In addition to the returns both to the borrowers, banks and MFIs in realizing the
returns financed by the proceeds of the project, the project yielded a range of intangible


21
     The interest rates charged by the RDP participating MFI’s were in the range of 25-30%.




                                                                  43
benefits, namely: (i) increased rural lending facilitated by the availability of long-term
capital and ability to borrow in Georgian Lari; (ii) increased presence/outreach of the
financial sector in the rural areas (ex. an increase of approximately 345%); (iii) increased
lending to rural (iv) a more vibrant rural economy, which resulted from generation of
self-employment opportunities, new jobs and increased incomes for rural population; (v)
provision of financing at a critical time to the microfinance industry allowing it to grow
considerably and transform from informal NGO-type operations to a profitable, regulated
industry supervised by the National Bank of Georgia.

8.      Component 3. Institutional Modernization (US$2.92 million). The institutional
capacity engendered under the component is expected to generate several distinct types
of benefits, which cannot be quantified at this time due to early stages of roll-out,
operationalization and application of such capacity. At the time of ICR most investments
are less that 1-year old. Yet it is plausible to assume that as a result of the strengthening
of key food safety institutions Georgia will be able to export its agricultural produce to
more markets and at better prices than those commanded at present. In addition, the
strengthening of food safety institutions and procedures will impact not only exports, but
all food products moving through formal market channels (including, domestic sales and
imports) and will therefore have important local public health benefits. The plausibility of
these conclusions is strengthened by studies which have found that investments in public
services and infrastructure associated with improvements in food safety management
exhibit solid country-level economic returns, especially when benefits are assumed to
derive from avoided trade losses and growing domestic and international trade volumes

The borrower owns 2 hectares of land and green houses, where he produced tomatoes,
peppers and maize. He used to sell crops a wholesale market at very low prices. He decided
to sell his product by himself and with his wife at the local market. He had no money to
pay for daycare for his children and for that reason his wife couldn’t help him. The MFI
gave him a loan of 1,800 Lari to buy 2 cows. He made an agreement with the kindergarten
to provide them with milk products and as a payment in kind for his children daycare. The
result of such a decision was very beneficial for his family. The parents can both work and
sell their produce on the local market three times a week.

The person is a refuge from Abkhazia. She settled on her mother’s land after the military
conflict. It’s the highest village in Samegrelo region with remote roads and very difficult
living conditions. Together with her husband she started some agricultural activity to
improve their living conditions. They have bought two cows and cultivated a small plot of
land. Their incomes were very low and they decided to borrow money from MFI Lazika
Capital to purchase a small herd of goats. They received a loan 1,000 Lari. Nowadays they
sell goat milk and cheese in local market and in the future this activity will bring them
higher incomes.

Loan:                               5,000 Gel.

This story is about 41 year old family man, who worked in a school and had a very low
income. He tried several times to receive a loan from banks for cultivation of
agricultural land, which was left to him by his forefather and without any success. After
an appraisal of his land he received a loan of 5,000 Lari. They allocated 3,500 Lari for
land cultivation and potatoes seed, and 1,500 Lari for buying cows. Milk and milk
products were used for family needs, and the excess for sale and repayment of the loan.
That year the family had a 4-5 ton potato harvest. A part of the income was used to
improve the family’s life conditions, while the remaining part was used to repay the
loan.

Activity:                          Green House

The borrower and his family members were working as workers for hire in green
houses, but their income was very low. They had very good experience in the green
house business, so they decided to build their own one. MFI Crystal extended a
US$3,000 loan to them. This was their first loan and was repaid in full and on time. The
green house business worked well generating a steady income. Following this
experience they received a second loan worth 5,000 Lari. Nowadays the borrower has
two green houses and delivers his produce to the local market. The family income grew
and they plan to expand their business.

                            Summary of the Borrower’s ICR

SUMMARY

The overall objective of the project was to develop the productivity and the profitability
of the private agriculture sector. This had to be achieved by facilitating the access of
Georgia’s mainly small and medium scale farmers to supply chain, improving the
competitiveness of the supply chains and strengthening the capacity of selected
agricultural and financial institutions to serve private-sector agricultural market activity.
This had to increase incomers and employment and reduce poverty in rural areas.

Output indicators were:

Number of commodity chains evaluated and supported
Number of communities and producer groups supported
Number of on-farm technology demonstrations
Number of loans to agriculture producers, agro-processors
Number of computerized and moveable asset registration transactions conducted and the
level of cost recovery achieved by the NAPR
The repayment performance of agricultural loans by banks and NBFIs
The membership of the national system of rural credit unions
Veterinary, see, sanitary, phyto-sanitary and food laws and regulations enacted and an
improved food safety system

It can be stated that the most of outcome indicators were partially met.
In particular:
- 3 commodity chains were supported (citrus, hazelnut and wine);
- 71 farmers were supported;
- 9 on-farm technologies were conducted (5 in nuts growing and 4 in citrus growing);
- 11,111 agro-loans were issues (via banks and MFIs) with the total amount of
17,333.620 USD .
- CORS system was purchased for NARP and as of today NAPR is one of the successful
financially sustainable agency in the country;

Project significantly supported National Agency for Food Safety by improving its
infrastructure that was in very bad condition. Currently National Agency of Food Safety
is public-legal agency that gives them right to keep their income and be more self-
sustainable. Project also assisted laboratory of the MoA in purchasing of the modern
technology equipment.
Credit union sub-direction was not implemented at all. The main reason for this was very
bad experience from the previous Agriculture Development Project, and Ministry of
Finance’s firm position was not to continue assistance to the credit unions. Accordingly
this direction was taken out from the credit agreement.
In overall the project was effective but it could be more efficient.

PERFORMANCE BORROWER

Project was implemented by the legal public entity – World Bank Financed Georgian
Agriculture Development Projects Coordination Centre. The organization has more than
10 years of experience of implemented WB projects.
The overall management and coordination of the project were quite well arranged. The
Centre had Highly Satisfactory in the financial management and clean audit opinion with
no recommendation during last 2 years.
In February 2011, Government decided to merge project implementation units within the
line ministries in order ministries to have more ownership on projects. Thus, from
February 2, 2011 PCC was under the liquidation process that was completed on June 30,
2011. From that period Ministry of Agriculture through its International Organizations
Projects Implementation Department is the main implementation agency.

PERFORMANCE WORLD BANK

The project was intensively monitored and supervised by the World Bank team. The
Bank was quite flexible in meeting different priorities and requests of the government It
is reflected in their understanding and flexibility during implementation. Their ongoing
monitoring, technical assistance and patience greatly contributed to a positive outcome of
the project. Nevertheless, the rules and regulations of the World Bank directly connected
to implementation of the project were consequently enforced. They were at times helpful,
at times seen as unduly strict and cumbersome, especially as borrower was also obliged
to follow own rules. As the project in the practice was heavily depending on outsourcing
of both goods and services, requirements and there were sometimes reason of delays in
implementation.

Proposed arrangements for future cooperation

Ministry of Agriculture has about 15 years of experience of working with the World
Bank. RDP was fifth project in the sector and during this period quite close and good
cooperation was established. It would be better if the design of the future project is
simpler from the implementation point of view and not having implementation
arrangements with other agency (in RDP case, the project also was supporting to the
NAPR that was under Ministry of Justice).

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Summary of Comments from IFAD


Thank you for inviting IFAD to provide feedback to the ICR and commend it for being a
candid report which will serve to better inform future development-oriented investments
in Georgia. In particular, the risks associated with sustainability are shared concerns and
IFAD looks forward to addressing them jointly through their on-going programme.

Specific comments on the report are as follows:

(i)     The description of project implementation and performance and the analysis of
project outputs is factual and IFAD has no comments.

(ii)    The Report notes that "an end-project impact evaluation was not carried out,
primarily due to the institutional confusion caused by the liquidation of the PCC/PIU".
Without an end-project impact evaluation and considering M&E data and information
under RDP, it is unlikely that the assessment of a number of key criteria, including
overall effectiveness and impact indicators, can be effectively undertaken. We appreciate
the difficulties you are experiencing in this regard, as the report is somewhat silent in this
respect.

(iii) For indicator 7 of (b) Intermediate Outcome Indicator(s), it is noted "The
laboratory was rehabilitated and equipped. Not all equipment was operational at the
closing of IDA financing. Six regional NS centres were constructed. However, they were
not yet operational at the time of the closing of IDA financing." It would be interesting to
know whether they were operational at the time of the closing of IFAD financing.

(iv)   The rationale for intervention should include IFAD.

(v)     With respect to the revolving mechanism for the utilization of IDA and IFAD
reflows (para. 61), IFAD made some recommendations and in principle, reached an
agreement during the March, 2012 mission. It is not yet clear what the Government
intends to do. However, please note that for IFAD the establishment of a revolving fund
is a loan covenant.

(vi)    The performance of IFAD should also be rated and it would be important to
note/list the implementation support mission undertaken by IFAD.
