         We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Credit No. 4062-GE) for the above-
referenced Project, dated May 28, 2005 between Georgia (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (the Association) as amended (the Credit Agreement). We also refer to
your letter dated April 1, 2011, requesting certain amendments to the Credit Agreement.

       We are pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, the Association has agreed to
amend the Credit Agreement as follows:

1.      Section II (v) of the Annex to Schedule 4 to the Credit Agreement is amended to read as
follows:


        “(v) Maximum loan size. The maximum (cumulative) loan to any single PCB be 25% of
        the PCB’s capital and 70% of the NBFI’s capital, unless otherwise agreed by the
        Association.?

2.      All the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement that have not been amended hereby
shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
