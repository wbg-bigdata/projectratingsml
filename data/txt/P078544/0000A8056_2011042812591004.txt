                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised objective is to improve agricultural production and access to markets for Georgia's small and medium-scale farmers and rural enterprises
                         supported by the project, through: (i) increasing the competitiveness of selected supply chains; (ii) strengthening the delivery of rural financial services and of
                         the financial intermediaries; and (iii) modernizing key institutions for food safety and property registration with direct impact for increasing competitiveness of
                         Georgia's agriculture.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) continues to be attainable, with noteworthy results and positive outcomes already achieved. However, due to implementation delays and
                         lack of disbursements under the credit line, the Project has been rated Moderately Satisfactory for progress toward the PDO and Implementation Progress.
