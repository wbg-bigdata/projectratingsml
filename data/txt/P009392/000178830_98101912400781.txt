STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
Government Policy and IDA Lending Strategy
1.01      Bangladesh, with a population of about 85 M and a cultivable area
of only 22.5 M ac, of which one-third is normally flooded annually, presents
a critical and complex development problem. The population is poor (per
capita income is about US$110), overcrowded (1,550 per sq mi and growing
at 2.8% per year), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is well under 50
years), in many cases unemployed (perhaps 25-30%), and largely illiterate
(about 75%). Foodgrain imports of about 1.5 M tons, or nearly 15% of total
requirements, are necessary in a "normal" year. Climatic extremes of drought,
untimely rains, excessive floods, and cyclones periodically bring disaster.
1.02      The most important short-run priority of the Government is agricul-
tural and rural development to benefit the largest number of people. The
major objectives are: to attain self-sufficiency in foodgrain production in
the shortest possible time; to create employment for the rural poor; and to
increase substantially jute production. These objectives point to the neces-
sity of generating without delay a series of quick-yielding, labor-intensive,
low-cost projects.
Project Formulation
1.03      The Bank's Hardcore Program Report of February 1973 recommended,
among other things, criteria for the selection of irrigation and flood control
projects. Such projects should: contribute to rapid increase in food pro-
duction, be self contained or part of a phased plan, be economically viable
and incorporate labor intensive methods. Chenchuri Beel (CCB) and
Kolabashukhali (KBK) projects were identified because they would eliminate
salinity and reduce the incidence of flooding, thus resulting in an increase
in crop yields and improved cropping patterns. The Brahmaputra Right Embank-
ment (BRE) project was originally financed by IDA Credit 39-PAK (US$5.0 M,
1963). The embankment has provided a degree of flood control permitting a
shift from low yielding broadcast aman to transplanted aman and the greater
use of inputs, thereby promoting higher yields and production levels. The
existing BRE is in danger of collapse due to river erosion and breaches and
requires urgent rehabilitation and improvement.
1.04      The proposed project would be the seventh irrigation and/or flood
control project in Bangladesh financed by IDA. The previous projects have
been: the Chandpur II Irrigation Project (Credit 340-BD, 1972, US$13.0 M)
to provide flood protection for about 140,000 ac and irrigation for about



- 2 -
75,000 ac; the Northwest Tubewells Project (Credit 341-BD, 1972, US$14.0 M)
to provide irrigation from groundwater for about 180,000 ac; the Barisal
Irrigation Project (Credit 542-BD, 1975, US$27.0 M) to provide irrigation for
about 140,000 ac by low-lift pumping; the Karnafuli Irrigation Project (Credit
605-BD, 1976, US$21.0 M) to provide irrigation, flood control and drainage
to 46,000 ac; the Shallow Tubewells Project (Credit 724-BD, 1977, US$16.0 M)
to provide irrigation from groundwater for about 150,000 ac; and the Muhuri
Irrigation Project (Credit 725-BD, 1977, US$21.0 M) to provide irrigation
for about 35,000 ac and improved drainage for about 50,000 ac.
1.05      The implementation of all six projects has involved substantial
delays. Reasons for the slippage of the implementation schedules have been
primarily administrative and include difficulties in: the hiring of consult-
ants, appointment of project staff; timely release of budgetary allocations;
approval of contracts; and coordination among the various implementing agencies.
The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has already taken a number of steps to
remedy the most serious bottlenecks. IDA and the Government have also given
increased emphasis to regular monitoring and supervision of the various pro-
jects in order to identify and resolve the potential problems at an early
stage. In addition, IDA is assisting the Government in strengthening key
agricultural ministries and agencies, e.g. the Water Development Board (WDB)
and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), through
detailed studies of their organizational set-ups and operating procedures.
These steps have already produced noticable improvements in the rate of
project implementation. Further improvements are expected during the next
few years.
1.06      The proposed project was prepared by WDB, assisted by consultants
NEDECO (Netherlands), and was appraised in January/February 1978 by a mission
consisting of Messrs. H.J. Tennent, B. Kanchanalak (Bank), Hpu and J. K. Lee
(consultants). A second drainage and flood control project is being prepared
by WDB with assistance from NEDECO and would include, among others, the
Karatya drainage subproject, a badly drained area behind BRE.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The proposed project consists of three separate subprojects.  The
Chenchuri Beel (CCB) and Kolabashukhali (KBK) areas are contiguous, located
in the southwestern part of the country. Brahmaputra Right Embankment (BRE)
area i-s in the northwestern region of Bangladesh (Map 13523).
2.02      CCB is located in Jessore District about 20 mi north of Khulna.
It is bounded on the north, east and south by the Nabaganga River and on the
west by the Chitra River. The area is within three thanas: Narial, Loha-
gara and Kalia (Map 13520R).



- 3 -
2.03      KBK is situated just north of Khulna.  It is bounded on the south
by the Bhairat and Atharbank rivers, on the west by the Athi and Nabaganga
rivers, on the north by the Nabaganga River and on the east by the Patna and
Chitra rivers. The area is within four different thanas: Kalia, Terakhada,
Daulatpur and Khulna (Map 13521R).
2.04      BRE is located in the Rangpur, Bogra and Pabna districts.  It ex-
tends about 170 mi along the right bank of the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers
from the mouth of the Hurasagar River in the south to Solmari on the Teesta
in the north (Map 13522R).
Climate
2.05      The climate is tropical, with heavy seasonal rains interrupted by
a dry period of about four to five months. The mean annual rainfall varies
from 60 to 90 inches in different parts of the project.  About 90% of the
rainfall occurs between May and October, however, occasional showers in March
and April are of considerable importance for cultivation of aus paddy and
jute crops. The rainfall pattern is highly erratic. Large variations occur
from year to year in the dates of onset and cessation of the rainy season as
well as in the amount of rainfall. The project areas are generally unaffected
by cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal.
2.06      As in other parts of Bangladesh, mean monthly temperatures rise
steadily from 70 0F in February to 85 F in April, remain fairly steady around
900F from May to October, and then fall to reach to a low of about 60 0F in
December and January. Mean relative humidity is high throughout the year --
ranging from about 60% in March to 90% during the rainy season. The maximum
monthly evaporation of about six inches occurs during April. Annual evapora-
tion is about 40 inches.   On the average, the winds are moderate but localized
heavy storms are liable to occur during April and May. Subject to availability
of irrigation during the dry season, the climate is suitable for year-round
cropping (Annex 1, Table 1).
Topography and Soils
2.07      Topography.  The major part (70%) of Bangladesh is a great delta,
formed by silt deposits from the three major rivers that converge in the
middle of the country -- the Ganges from the west, the Brahmaputra from the
north and the Meghna from the north-east. The central and southern parts of
the country are flat and have only minor relief. In the north, where the
Brahmaputra enters Bangladesh, the elevation is about 200 ft above mean sea
level (MSL) but by the time the river reaches Serajganj (about half way to
the Bay of Bengal), the elevation is only about 30 ft and from there the
river gradient flattens out. The gradient of both the Ganges and Meghna in
Bangladesh is also flat as they enter the country at elevations of 50 and
30 ft above MSL respectively. Because of the small gradient in the southern
part of the country and the tidal action, the rivers overflow their banks and
flood much of the land during the summer monsoon.



- 4 -
2.08      Soils.  Since the soils were formed through inundations from flood,
the coarser sands and silts have settled out near the rivers, while the finer
materials have been carried to the more distant inland areas and to the
southern part of the delta. The natural levees are pronounced in the north
but hardly apparent in the lower delta. Even so, there are inland depressions
in both the north and south where drainage water accumulates and limits the
use of such lands. The soil texture varies from sands to sandy loams on the
natural levees in the north to silt loams in the intermediate positions and
to clays in the more inland areas. The heavier soils are slightly acidic, but
if properly drained they are suitable for production of a wide range of crops,
particularly paddy. The limitations to increased agricultural production are
the lack of precipitation during the winter, and sometimes even during the
summer monsoon, as well as the annual flooding and ponding of water that occurs
during the summer moonsoon, particularly in the depressions with heavier soils.
Farm Size, Land Tenure and Population
2.09      Size of Farm.  Farms are small in the three sub-projects areas,
averaging 2.0 ac in the KBK area, 2.6 ac in CCB and 3.9 ac in BRE. These
compare to an average size of 2.8 ac for all of Bangladesh (Annex 1, Tables
2 and 3).
2.10      Land Tenure.  As in rest of the Bangladesh the majority of the lands
in CCB and KBK (75% and 70%, respectively) are owner operated. In terms of
number of farms, only 4% in CCB and 7% in KBK are operated by tenants while
30% and 48% respectively, are operated by part-owners. The balance are oper-
ated by owners. Although the data are not available to support the conclusion,
it is believed that the tenancy rate is highest in the northern part of the
country where the average farm is larger. In the usual tenancy agreement,
the tenant provides all or most of the inputs and gives back half the crop
as rent. Under such an arrangement, there is little incentive for tenants to
develop lands for irrigation or to adopt improved farming practices. GOB is
aware of this constraint and proposals are under consideration to modify tra-
ditional tenurial arrangements to provide better incentives for increased
production. One of the factors contributing to the extent of tenancy is the
inheritance laws which requires property to be divided among heirs. This has
resulted in the excessive fragmentation of farm holdings; the average owner-
ship unit may include as many as 10 or 15 separate parcels of land. As a
result, owners often find it desirable to rent out part of their land and
in turn rent in other land closer to their village.
2.11      Population.  The rural population density in the subproject areas
is relatively high averaging 1,840/sq mi of cropland in CCB; 2,130 in KBK and
2,170 in the BRE; these compare to 2,540 for all of Bangladesh. This roughly
translates to about three people per acre of cropland and the population is
continuing to grow. As a result of the large rural population in relation to
the agricultural land resource, and even though women do not normally perform
field jobs (except for some minor field tasks), there is an abundance of
agricultural labor during most of the year. There is one agricultural laborer
per ac of cultivated land for both CCB and KBK and 1.2 per ac for BRE.



- 5 -
Total population is estimated at 138,000 in CCB, 117,00 in RBR and 610,000
in BRE.
2.12      Minimum holding sizes required to provide subsistence level in-
come 1/ vary considerably with the land elevation and flooding levels, from
about 2 ac in higher lying areas to about 5 ac in deeply flooded areas. Cur-
rently, about 60% of the cultivated lands in the project areas are subject
to deep flooding. Considering this and the existing land tenure situation,
including incidence of landlessness, it is estimated that currently, some
70-80% of the households in CCB and KBK and about 50% in BRE have incomes
below subsistence level. The majority of the rest are small farmers whose
per capita income is only marginally above the poverty level criteria. Thus,
the target group population would be about 100,000 in CCB, 85,000 in KBK and
300,000 in BRE.
Present Situation
2.13      CCB and KBK.  These areas are subject to annual floods between June
and October. On higher lands, winter crops are grown as well as the wet season
paddy, but the majority of people obtain only the rainfed crop between April
and July, which usually suffers from either late rainfall or early flooding.
The villages are situated around the naturally higher perimeter land.
2.14      BRE.  This subproject was originally constructed under IDA Credit
39-PAK between 1963 and 1970. Due to river meandering and lack of maintenance
it has deteriorated to a point where breaches occur annually. The benefits
from the original project are in danger of being lost unless remedial action
is taken.
Agricultural Practices
2.15      Cropping Patterns.  Cropping patterns in Bangladesh vary in rela-
tion to the climate, the elevation of lands and the annual flooding patterns.
Paddy, which is by far the major crop, occupies 83% of the cropped area.
Jute occupies 4% and a variety of other crops such as pulses, oilseeds, wheat,
sugarcane and vegetables occupy the remaining 13%. The overall cropping in-
tensity averages 148%, varying from 179% in the north which has considerable
irrigation (largely from deep tubewells) to 114% in the south which has limited
irrigation, and is subject to tidal action, particularly during the summer
monsoons.
1/   Assuming a per capita cereals consumption of a 16 oz per day, a 20%
margin for non-cereal foods to achieve a balanced diet, and a 30%
margin for non-food expenditures (housing, clothes, fuels, medicines,
etc.), the per capita subsistence level requirements are estimated
to be the equivalent of about 300 kg of rice (or 12 mds of paddy)
per year. At the prevailing price levels in Bangladesh, this implies
a subsistence level income of about Tk 1,000 per capita per annum.



-6-
^.16      The main varieties of paddy are:
Aus  -    short season varieties sown in March/April and har-
vested in June/July;
Aman -    long season varieties sown in March/April or June/July
and harvested in November/December 1/.
Boro -    varieties grown in the rabi (dry season) under irrigation.
Both aus and aman varieties may be grown from broadcast seed (b. aus or
b. aman) or transplanted (t. aus or t. aman), the latter giving higher yields.
2.17      The most common cropping pattern in the project areas is b. aus
and b. aman followed, where possible, by a dry season crop such as vegetables,
pulses and oilseeds. T. aman and jute are grown only on higher lands (Annex 1,
Tables 4, 5 and 6). Farming equipment and methods are primitive. Cattle are
used for plowing and smoothing of the seedbed; most other field operations are
performed by hand. The local labor supply is generally abundant. Wages are
low and consequently the labor input is high. The use of inputs such as
fertilizer, improved seeds and insecticides is low; but deposition of silt
from the annual floods has contributed to the continued productivity of the
soils.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.18      The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is responsible for agricultural
research and extension, and through BADC, for procurement and distribution
of agricultural inputs. The Ministry of Land Administration, Local Govern-
ment, Rural Development and Cooperatives is responsible for the Integrated
Rural Development Program (IRDP), cooperatives, and the Thana Irrigation
Program. The IRDP at present covers about 50% of the thanas in the NW region
in which BRE is located, but does not cover any thanas in CCB or KBK sub-
projects.
2.19      Fertilizer.  Although the demand for fertilizer in Bangladesh has
grown dramatically over the past decade, the present use remains significant-
ly below the recommended levels. Over half of the supply has been imported
in recent years. BADC distributes all fertilizer to the thanas where it is
retailed by private dealers at fixed subsidized prices. In spite of the
Government's efforts to meet the demand, the supplies have been inadequate
and a black market for urea now operates in some parts of the country. In
recognition of the inadequate supplies and also the desirability of meeting
the ndeds from domestic supplies, GOB has undertaken a program to recondition
some of the existing plants as well as to construct a new plant at Ashuganj
(Credit 527-BD). In addition, GOB is actively considering programs to update
and improve the existing distribution and storage system.
1/   Those sown in March/April are floating varieties capable of surviving
in deep water.

2.20      Plant Protection.  The BADC is responsible for procurement of pes-
ticides while the Plant Protection Division of the DOAEM is responsible for
storage, distribution and guidance on application. Prior to 1974, pesticides
were supplied free to the farmers and that often led to inefficient and waste-
ful use. Since then a 50% reduction in the subsidy has cut down on wastage.
However, farmers' knowledge about types, dosages and protective measures is
still inadequate. The use of pesticides is not extensive and, therefore,
the supplies received through bilateral aid are adequate to meet the current
demand.
2.21      Agricultural Research.  The Bangladesh Rice Research Institute
(BRRI), which was established in 1970, works in close cooperation with the
International Rice Research Institute, and is responsible for research on
various aspects of paddy improvement and production and for the training of
extension staff and subject matter specialists. The Agricultural Research
Institute (ARI) deals with development of crops such as wheat, pulses and
oilseeds. Separate organizations also exist for research on jute, cotton,
tobacco and sugarcane. Others involved in agricultural research are the
Mymensingh Agricultural University and the Soil Fertility Institute. The
coordination of research is the responsibility of the newly established
Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council.
2.22      The quality of research conducted by BRRI is good.  The other re-
search organizations, however, suffer from the lack of staff, funds and to some
extent, motivation due to low salaries and allowances and lack of transport.
Another major problem with the current research program is the lack of empha-
sis on adapting basic research results to the different agro-environmental
conditions found in various parts of Bangladesh. The Extension and Research
Project (EARP) (Credit 729-BD), and the Agricultural Research Project (ARP)
(Credit 828-BD) will strengthen adaptive research.
2.23      Agricultural Extension Services.  The Directorate of Agriculture
(Extension and Management) (DOAEM) in the MOA, maintains extension agents
at District, Sub-Division, Thana and Union levels. The Union Agricultural
Assistants (UAAs) which average one per 2,000 farm families are the primary
field extension workers. Their work is supervised by Thana Agricultural
Officers (TAOs). In addition, several other agencies are involved in agri-
cultural extension.
2.24      The extension service has been largely ineffective because:
(a) its programs tend to be obsolete and diffuse; (b) the technical advice
given by extension workers often lags behind research findings; (c) the staff
is poorly trained and handicapped by a lack of transportation facilities,
housing and training materials; and (d) extension workers are often used by
other agencies for administrative work, such as census and statistical re-
porting. In recent years in recognition of the importance of an effective
extension service, GOB has taken steps to strengthen it. Among these are the
appointment of Thana Extension Officers (TEOs) in place of TAOs, progressive
in-service training of extension officers at different levels and the



- 8 -
introduction of the "Training and Visit" (T&V) system 1/ on a nationa1 basis.
EARP will strengthen the agricultural extension services in the NW region
along the lines successfully adopted in several Bank Group supported projects
in East and South Asia.
2.25      Agricultural Credit.  Even though since liberation in 1971 GOB has
attempted to expand agricultural credit, institutional credit is still not
available to the vast majority of farmers. Some 85% of them either use no
credit or depend upon private sources. The remaining 15% receive their credit
from the Agricultural Credit Banks (the Bangladesh Krishi Bank or the Bangla-
desh Jatiya Sambaya Bank (a cooperative bank) or the six commercial banks
which were nationalized in 1972 and began to make agricultural loans in 1973.
To encourage credit use, GOB authorized a special credit of one billion taka
in 1977 to be made available to operators of farms of three ac or less at 12%
interest. IDA-is currently financing, under the Second Technical Assistance
Credit (Cr 622--BD} , a study by consultants assisting the Government in
reviewing the agricultural credit subsector and recommending appropriate
reforms.
III. THE PROJECT
Main Features
3.01      The proposed project would cover three separate sub-project areas:
Chenchuri Beel (CCB) and Kolabashukhali (KBK) in the southwest and the
Brahamaputra Right Embankment (BRE) in the northwest (Map 13523). In CCB
and KBK, the project would provide flood control and improved drainage to
46,000 ac and 42,000 ac, respectively (Maps 13520R and 13521R). In BRE, it
would rehabilitate and improve the existing embankment which protects about
180,000 ac against flooding from the Brahamaputra River (Map 13522R). Of
the 42,000 ac in KBK, some 7,000 ac are currently uncultivable due to deep
flooding; they would be made cultivable under the project. To promote a rapid
adoption of improved cropping patterns and cultivation practices, possible
after the project works, the project would also include support for strengthen-
ing of the agricultural extension service in CCB and KBK 2/. Complimentary
1/   The T&V system is based on regular fortnightly visits by village exten-
sion workers (VEAs) on given days to selected groups of farmers. Each
group of farmers or block, would comprise on the average about 1,000
active farm families. Each block would be divided into eight sub-blocks
of 60 to 150 families, and each sub-block would have 10 to 15 contact
farmers who would be the principal channel for conveying extension
messages to the other farmers of the sub-block. VEAs would also carry
out demonstrations and undertake field trials. A detailed description
of the system can be found in the Bank document "Agricultural Extension:
The Training and Visit System" (June 1977).
2/   Similar support in BRE is already being provided under EARP.



- 9 -
irrigation facilities (low lift pumps and shallow tubewells) are available
under other ongoing and proposed projects, both IDA-financed and financed
by other agencies. Additional benefits from such irrigation have not been
included in the economic analysis.
Project Components
3.02      The project would include the following:
CCB
(a) .60 mi of embankment with an average height of 6.5 ft,
a top width of 14 ft and involving about 83 M cu ft of
earthwork;
(b) a drainage network with four new regulators varying
from 5 ft to 10 ft wide, covering a net cultivated area
of 46,000 ac 1/;
(c) 25 mi of 18 ft wide access roads with 12 ft wide broken
brick surfacing;
(d) five gatekeepers' quarters, two godowns, two staff barracks
and one workshop for WDB;
(e) one training center and about 45 quarters for agricultural
extension staff; and
(f) equipment and vehicles for the construction program and
for the agricultural extension service (Annex 1, Table 7).
KBK
(a) 53 mi of embankments with an average height 4.5 ft, a top
width of 14 ft and involving about 44 M cu ft of earthwork;
(b) a drainage network with 13 drainage regulators varying from
5 ft to 40 ft wide, covering a net cultivated area of
42,000 ac;
(c) 20 mi of 18 ft wide access roads with 12 ft wide broken
brick surfacing;
(d) 5 gatekeeper's quarters, two godowns, two staff barracks and
one workshop for WDB;                            I
(e) one training center and about 45 quarters for agricultural
and extension staff; and
1/   A 50 ft wide regulator has already been constructed in CCB.



- 10 -
(f) equipment and vehicles for the construction program and for
the agricultural extension service (Annex 1, Table 7).
BRE
(a) rehabilitation and improvement of 106 mi out of 170 mi of
existing embankment to an average height of 12 ft and a
top width varying from 14 to 24 ft. Earthwork involved
is estimated at 135 M cu ft;
(b) construction of 36 mi of retired embankments 1/ involving
about 90 M cu ft of earthwork;
(c)  about 78 cross embankments, involving about 23 M cu ft of
earthwork, for protection of the main embankment as well
as groynes and revetments where required;
(d) drainage channel improvements including eight drainage
regulators;
(e) one gatekeeper's quarters, one godown, one staff barrack
one workshop for WDB; and
(f) equipment and vehicles for the construction program
(Annex 1, Table 7).
3.03      About three years of consultant services would be included under
the project for assistance in engineering and agricultural aspects of the
project. Provision would also be made for short overseas study tours by
selected agricultural extension staff for observing implementation of the
T&V extension system in other developing countries.
Engineering Works
3.04      The project has been planned and designed to feasibility standards
by WDB, with the assistance of NEDECO (Netherlands) consultants. A three foot
freeboard would be provided for CCB, KBK and the Teesta river section of BRE.
There would be a five foot freeboard for the main section of BRE, where more
wave and wind action would be encountered. Water levels outside the embank-
ments of CCB and KBK are such that no gravity drainage would be possible
between July and September. Accordingly, the drainage systems are designed
for a quick draw-down of interior flood waters from mid-October to allow plant-
ing of crops in November/December. The systems are also designed to conserve
useful rainfall within the area. Compaction would be by labor-intensive
methods in keeping with the policy of GOB. The hydraulic gradient for CCB
1/   Built to close the breaches created by the river meandering along the
existing embankment.  The word "retire" implies the new alignment of
the embankment which retreats further inland from the original to
provide a longer set-back distance from the river.



- 11 -
and KBK would not be steeper than 1:5, which is in line with the design
criteria used for some 2,300 mi of embankment in Bangladesh. For BRE, since
the river is so large, the hydraulic gradient will be not less than 1:7.
Seepage, however, is not a major factor in embankment failure, which is
usually due to direct erosion. The height of embankments would be designed
for 100-year flood levels, this would not add much to the cost since the
100-year flood levels are only six inches above the 50-year levels but would
provide another safety factor.  It would be impractical to control a river
the size of the Brahmaputra by an embankment, even when groynes and revet-
ments are constructed.  Hence, it is anticipated that BRE would be retired
and rebuilt at an average rate of six mi per year.  Final designs and detailed
engineering would be completed by WDB when all surveys and investigations are
completed.  Some 24 man-months of short-term consultants have been provided
(para 4.06), to be used as needed, to assist WDB in the design work. An
assurance has been obtained that WDB will design the embankments to the above
standards satisfactory to IDA. Since the works are of a simple nature, WDB
would supervise construction itself without outside assistance.
Agricultural Extension
3.05      The agricultural extension in the six thanas in which CCB and KBK
are located (paras 2.02-2.03) would be reorganized on the basis of the T&V
system, currently being implemented in the northwest through IDA-financed
EARP (para. 2.24). The number of VEAs for the six thanas would be increased
by about 50% over the present level of 53. Following present GOB policy,
TEOs would be appointed in each of the six thanas. The Association would
finance the cost of the additional extension staff.
3.06      For the fortnightly training and the technical guidance and super-
vision of VEAs, two Training Units, one each in Jessore and Khulna districts,
would be established. Each Unit would consist of administration offices,
training hall, dining area, demonstration hall, and accommodation for about
40 students for about two nights. The Units would be suitably located, pre-
ferably close to a research station in Jessore and to the Agricultural Train-
ing Institute at Daulatpur in Khulna district. The Training Units would be
staffed with three Crop Production Specialists (CPSs) (cereal crops, plant
protection and non-cereal crops) who would be experienced agricultural
graduates with a period of training at BRRI and ARI.
3.07      For effective operation of the T&V system, improved facilities
would be provided in the form of housing, transport and equipment. All VEAs
in the thanas would be provided with housing. Some 22 unused union seed
stores would be rehabilitated and transformed into houses, and some 53 new
houses would be built for the other VEAs. At thana headquarters, six addi-
tional houses would be built for TEOs and accommodation for CPSs would be
provided adjacent to the Training Units. The various buildings would be
designed to the same standards as those in IDA-financed EARP. The project
would provide bicycles for VEAs, motorcycles for Thana and Subdivisional
Extension Officers and CPSs, pickup trucks for Training Units and four-wheeled
vehicles for the District Extension Officers. Audio visual and teaching
equipment and demonstration materials would also be provided under the project.



- 12 -
3.08      Assurances have been obtained that agricultural extension and
training on the T&V system will be instituted and maintained under a program
satisfactory to IDA not later than January 1, 1980. Assurances were also
obtained from GOB that the bicycles and motorcycles provided under the proj-
ect would be made available to DOAEM's staff on terms and conditions similar
to those agreed under EARP (Credit 729-BD).
Implementation Schedule
3.09      Project implementation would take five years, extending from late
1978 until the onset of the rainy season in May 1983. Field surveys and
investigations would be fully completed by May 1980 and all detailed designs
and contract documents by November 1980. Tender documents for the construc-
tion equipment and vehicles are currently under preparation and procurement
would be completed by November 1979. Construction of the major works would
start by November 1979. During negotiations, the implementation schedule was
discussed and agreed upon and details of the first year's program of work were
provided by GOB.
Cost Estimates
3.10      The total project cost including taxes and duties (US$1.6 million
equivalent) is estimated at US$28 M (Tk 420 M equivalent), of which US$3.2 M
or about 11% would be foreign exchange (Table 3.1). The cost estimates for
imported vehicles and equipment are based on unit prices in recent contract
awards and on international prices. Costs of civil works, including embank-
ments, drains, and buildings are based on recent costs in Bangladesh for
similar works. Costs for consulting services, estimated at an average of
about US$9,800 per man month, are based on recent experience in Bangladesh,
adjusted for proportionately higher overheads due to short-term assignments
(para 4.04). Base costs have been adjusted to mid-1978 prices. Physical
contingencies have been estimated at 20%, since detailed surveys are yet to be
completed. Price contingencies are based on an annual inflation rate of 9%
for both local and foreign costs, since the local and international rates are
not expected to be significantly different. Annex 1, Tables 8, 9, 10 and 11
present detailed cost estimates and a schedule of expenditures.
Financing
3.11      The proposed IDA credit of US$19 M (covering 72% of the total pro-
ject costs, excluding duties and taxes) would finance 100% of foreign exchange
costs, and about 68% of local costs. GOB would finance the balance of the
project cost, US$9 M (Tk 135 M equivalent, including duties and taxes), through
annual budget appropriations. To ensure prompt provision of project budgetary
funds and hiring of any extra project staff required, it would be a condition
of effectiveness that the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council
had approved the Project Proforma 1/.
1/   An internal GOB document, the approval of which is a prerequisite for
release of funds and authorization to hire staff.

?rocurement
3.12      Civil Works (US$19 M). 1/  The works would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding (ICB) because they comprise relatively
small, simple, labor-intensive and scattered works. In addition construction
would be subject to seasonal weather and flood interruptions. The work would
be carried out under contracts let through local competitive bidding procedures
which are satisfactory to IDA. Construction materials not provided by the
contractors would be obtained after ICB. There is a tendency in Bangladesh
to let many petty contracts, resulting in excessive paperwork at all levels
of project implementation. Accordingly, assurances were obtained that none
of the civil works contracts would be smaller than US$5,000 (Tk 75,000).
An approximate summary of expected contract types and value is given below:

3.13      Equipment, Vehicles and Spare Parts (US$0.7 M). 1/  These would be
procured through ICB in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference
limited to 15% of cif price or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Small
off-the-shelf items costing less than US$20,000 for each contract, which are
either urgently needed or are not suitable for ICB, would be purchased through
normal Government procedures, on the basis of comparing prices from no less
than three suppliers. Such purchases would be limited to a total of US$200,000.
After the project, the vehicles and equipment would be used for maintenance or
moved to other projects.
3.14      Documents for all contracts, whether for civil works, materials,
equipment or vehicles estimated to cost above US$50,000 would be sent to IDA

mated to cost less than US$50,000 would be awarded in accordance with normal
Government procedures, which are satisfactory. A summary of the bid evalua-
tion would be sent to IDA with all contracts for which disbursement is sought.
The format was agreed at negotiations.

manufactured equipment, vehicles, spare parts and construction
materials procured under ICB;
(d) 90% of total expenditures for other equipment vehicles,
spare parts and construction materials procured locally
without ICB;
(e) 100% of total expenditures for consultants' services and
overseas training; and
(f) 100% of salaries of additional staff for agricultural extension.
3.16      The proposed credit allocation and the estimated schedule of dis-
bursement are shown in Annex 1, Tables 12 and 13. It is expected that the
credit would be fully disbursed by June 30, 1984 i.e. about one year after the
project completion.
1/   Including contingencies but excluding taxes and duties.

Accounts and Audits
3.17      Assurances were obtained that:
(a) separate accounts would be kept for the project by WDB and MOA;
(b) these accounts would be audited annually in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to IDA; and
(c) GOB would send IDA copies of the audit reports annually
within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
Environmental Impact
3.18      Projects such as the one under consideration necessarily involve
substantial ecological changes, not all of which can be fully foreseen. The
improved flood protection and drainage should reduce the incidence of malaria
and cholera both of which are endemic to the project areas. The effect on
flood levels outside the project areas is likely to be negligible since the
flood discharges in the affected rivers are vast compared to changes made
under the project. The disturbances in the natural drainage patterns, how-
ever, could have some adverse effects on isolated pockets within the project
areas (as evidenced by the occasional breaches made by the farmers in similar
embankments in other areas). Construction of the embankments could have some
adverse impact on the water transport; however, since currently most cargo
is transferred from small boats (sampans) to larger boats at the confluence
of major rivers and drains, the effect is likely to be small. Some adverse
effect should also be expected on the fish production in the project areas.
The proposed IDA assisted Oxbow Lakes Fisheries Project, now under prepara-
tion, would include a Central Hatchery within 60 mi of the two sub-projects
in the southwest. The hatchery would be well suited for supplying the
affected areas with high quality fry and fingerlings. Lastly, there could be
some loss in land fertility due to absence of soil deposition during the annual
floods. This loss could, however, be readily compensated through the use of
chemical fertilizer. On the whole, it is anticipated that the ecological
impact of the project should be positive. However, there is a need for close
monitoring. Assurances were obtained that for five years after project
completion, GOB would undertake an annual monitoring program commencing May
1983 for assessing the impact, in any, of the project on water transport and
fisheries in the project areas and would take remedial actions, as necessary.
IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization
4.01      Implementation.  The WDB would be responsible for surveys, planning,
designs, procurement and implementation of all works, except agricultural
staff quarters, training centers and related procurement. WDB would carry
out the work through its normal channels: planning and design being undertaken



- 17 -
in Dacca under the Chief Engineer (CE) (Planning) and CE (Design) and con-
struction and detailed financial control being through the respective regional
CEs, Superintending Engineers (SEs) and Executive Engineers (EEs) (Charts
18909 and 18910). The DOAEM would be responsible for the introduction of
the T&V extension system. They would also arrange construction of extension
staff quarters and training centers and procure equipment and vehicles for
agricultural extension.
4.02      Overall responsibility for project administration and supervision
would rest with the Member, Implementation (WDB). To assist the Member, Imple-
mentation in monitoring project progress, co-ordinating the work of various
WDB units, liaising with DOAEM, and in sorting out implementation problems, a
small Project Cell headed by a Project Coordinator would be attached to the
Member's office. The Project Coordinator would also be responsible for corres-
ponding with IDA on project related matters including annual work programs
and periodic progress reports. The Project Coordinator would be at least of
SE rank with extensive experience in management and implementation of con-
struction projects. Assurances were obtained that the WDB would establish
and maintain a project cell headed by a Project Coordinator with experience
and qualifications satisfactory to IDA. The appointment of the Project
Coordinator will be a condition of credit effectiveness&. During negotiations,
it was agreed that the Director of Programs, assisted by EE's would be desig-
nated the Project Coordinator.
4.03      At the field level, WDB staff would need to maintain close contact
with the respective staff of other agricultural agencies such as BADC, IRDP
and DOAEM. This would be particularly important in the later stages of the
project when the project works would enable introduction of substantial
changes in prevailing cropping patterns and cultivation practices. Accord-
ingly, in each sub-project, a Project Coordination Committee would be estab-
lished. The committees would report to the Project Coordinator (para 4.02)
and would include appropriate level officials from the concerned agricultural
agencies. The committees would meet quarterly or more often, if necessary.
Establishment of the three Coordination Committee with membership and terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
During the negotiations, it was agreed that the Chairmen of the Project
Coordinating Committees would be SE Khulna for CCB and KBK, and CE Northern
Zone for BRE. The establishment of these Committees with membership and terms
of reference satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Annual Work Programs
4.04      Before each construction season, WDB and DOAEM would prepare
annual programs detailing activities and works to be undertaken during the
forthcoming year. Such programs would include appropriate maps, charts and
drawings, staffing and material requirements as well as cost estimates. The
Project Coordinator would be responsible for collating and consolidating
these programs for submission to IDA. Assurances were obtained that by
August 31 of each year, IDA would receive, for review and comments, work
programs for the forthcoming construction year.



- 18 -
Lauld Acquisition
4.05      Construction of project facilities would require acquisition of
substantial amounts of privately owned land: about 1,800 ac in CCB, 700 ac
in KBK and 2,000 ac in BRE. Due to land scarcity in Bangladesh and a lack
of alternative means of livelihood, many landowners in Bangladesh are often
reluctant to part with their holdings. Inadequate and delayed financial
compensation, have also often obstructed timely land acquisition. Delays in
land acquisition have, in turn, often contributed to long and costly delays
in implementation of various projects. During negotiations, land acquisition
procedures were discussed and the Ordinance and Laws relating to land acqui-
sition were examined. Under the latest Ordinance, GOB cannot enter land
without paying 90% of its estimated value to the owner, the balance due may
be delayed a few months. This ensures that the owner will be paid, provided
funds are available. Since the land will be purchased piecemeal keeping as
much scarce financial resources as possible available for works, assurances
were obtained that, at least three months before the land is required, suffi-
cient funds for such land shall be deposited with the Deputy Commissioner or
other appropriate authority. The land acquired for embankments consists of a
relatively narrow strip only 20 to 30 yds in width and, since holdings are
fragmented (para 2.10), it is quite likely that a person would sell one or
two plots but still retain five or six within the project area. Thus, the
need to resettle displaced persons would not arise in many cases, nevertheless,
assurances were obtained that GOB would discuss with the Association, the
effects of land acquisition on displaced persons, consult on steps to be
taken to relocate such displaced persons and would implement, as necessary,
a program of relocation.
Technical Assistance
4.06      Consultants.  As engineering works under the project are technic-
ally simple, full-time consultants would not be required for the project.
Short-term consultants would be employed, as necessary, for assistance in
design work and in establishing appropriate procedures and organizational
set-ups for proper operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project facilities,
particularly for BRE (para 4.09). A total of 24 man-months of engineering
consultants is included. Provision has also been made for about 12 man-months
of consulting services for assistance in establishing the T&V system of agri-
cultural extension in CCB and KBK. Under EARP, GOB has already agreed to
obtain technical assistance for the strenthening of agricultural extension in
the NW region. This would include the services of two expatriate consultants
(18 months of an extension specialist and 12 months of an applied research
specialist). If possible, the contracts for these consultants would be ex-
tended about six months each and the scope of their work would be amended
to include CCB and KBK. Assurances were obtained that WDB and DOAEM would
employ consultants, whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions
of employment would be satisfactory to IDA.
4.07      Training.  To familiarize the extension staff in CCB and KBK with
successful operation of the T&V extension system, short-term study tours
would be organized for about 20 staff members to neighboring countries such
as Thailand and India. Assurances were obtained that GOB would furnish by



- 19 -
July 31, 1979 its proposed overseas training program of study tours for
approval of IDA and, thereafter forward for review the qualifications and
experience of the proposed candidates.
Supporting Services
4.08      BADC would be responsible for procurement and distribution of seeds,
fertilizers, plant protection equipment pesticides and irrigation equipment.
The requirements for the project being relatively small, the availability of
farm inputs should not be a constraint to development. BRRI and ARI would
provide training to CPSs and research support to the project. The IRDP would
be responsible for organizing farmers' cooperatives and for administering and
supervising the credit facilities to the cooperative societies. The IRDP is
already active in the NW region where BRE is located. As staff becomes avail-
able, IRDP would extend its operations to CCB and KBK areas.
Operation and Maintenance
4.09      Civil Works.  WDB would be responsible for the O&M of all project
works except agricultural buildings, the responsibility for which would rest
with DOAEM. WDB's normal staff of EEs and their assistants (Charts 18911,
18912 and 18913) would undertake the work. In the past attention given to
O&M has been grossly inadequate and as a result many works and facilities in
Bangladesh have tended to lose their usefulness prematurely. 1/ Partly, the
problem has been due to the lack of well formulated procedures and programs
for O&M and partly, due to inadequate budgetary allocations. The economic and
financial viability of the proposed project would crucially depend upon
ensuring proper O&M for the project facilities. Provision for the O&M costs
during the five year implementation period have been made under the project.
Subsequent annual O&M is estimated to require (in 1978 prices) Tk 1.4 M, 1.1 M
and 11.5 M for CCB and KBK and BRE, respectively. 2/ This would have to be
financed from GOB's normal budgetary appropriations. WDB brought to negotia-
tions detailed O&M programs and an assurance that adequate funds would be
provided for such work. The scope for assistance from short-term consultants
(para 4.06) in preparing O&M manuals was also discussed during negotiations.
Assurances were obtained that adequate and timely funds would be allocated
annually for O&M of the project and that project facilities would be main-
tained in accordance with sound engineering practices. Assurances were also
be obtained that before December 31, 1979, WDB would submit to IDA, for review
and comment, a detailed program for inspection, maintenance and operation of
the CCB, KBK and Brahmaputra embankments.
4.10      Agricultural Extension Service.  Motorcycles and bicycles sold to
the extension staff would be maintained by the buyers through private work-
shops. DOAEM would provide a mileage allowance to the concerned staff for
1/   BRE being a good example of such neglect.
2/   The high O&M cost in BRE is due to the anticipated need for retiring
some 6 mi of embankment every year.



- 20 -
the O&M of these vehicles. The O&M of other extension equipment, vehicles
and buildings would be the responsibility of DOAEM. Past budgetary provi-
sions for travel, allowances and operating supplies have often been in-
adequate.  The  incremental O&M expenditures for the strengthened extension
service over the five year implementation period have been included in the
project cost. Subsequently, they were financed from normal budgetary appro-
priations to DOAEM. Assurances were obtained that GOB would provide suffi-
cient funds for the proper operation of the agricultural extension service
under the project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.11      Monitoring of the project progress would be through quarterly and
annual progress reports prepared by the concerned staff of WDB and DOAEM.
Reporting formats for such reports were agreed during negotiations. The
reports would include all relevant data on physical and financial progress of
the project together with reasons for deviations, if any, from the targets set
under annual work programs (para 4.04). Following review and consolidation by
the Project Coordinator (para 4.02) quarterly and annual reports would be
promptly sent to IDA.
4.12      The main objectives of the evaluation studies would be to esti-
mate the direct and indirect benefits resulting from the project as well as
the socio-economic characteristics of the project beneficiaries. The data
for evaluation would be obtained through a few selected in-depth interviews
in the project area as well as through canvassing representative samples
of project beneficiaries.  A benchmark survey would be conducted about one
year before project completion to establish the pre-project situation. Two
follow-up surveys would be conducted after completion of the project works --
the first after one year and the second after four years. The surveys would
include information on cropping patterns, yields, cultivation practices,
production and employment levels as well as income levels for the various
classes of project beneficiaries. The evaluation studies and surveys would
be undertaken by well qualified local consulting firms or research institu-
tions selected in consultation with IDA. Assurances were obtained that
before January 1, 1980, MOA would prepare and submit to IDA for concurrence
a detailed proposal for evaluation of the project impact. The progress
reports and the data from evaluation studies and surveys would form, in
part, the basis for preparation of the Project Completion Report by WDB.
V. PRODUCTION, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
5.01      The CCB and KBK subprojects would together affect agricultural
production about 90,500 ac of which 7,000 ac are presently uncultivable due
to deep flooding. Net of some 2,500 ac needed for project works, the two
subprojects would benefit production on 88,000 ac. The BRE sub-project would
ensure and improve flood protection to about 180,000 ac of agricultural
lands.



- 21 -
Cropping Patterns
5.02      CCB and KBK.  Protection from early flooding and salt water intru-
sion, reduction in flooding depths and durations as well as the improved
agricultural extension under the project would promote more intensive land
use and enable shifts from aus/b. aman to t. aman and/or from local to high
yielding varieties. Paddy would continue to dominate the cropping patterns;
there would, however, be a substantial increase in the acreage under rabi
crops such as wheat, pulses, oilseeds and vegetables. Proportionately, the
project works would be more beneficial in KBK areas which have generally
lower elevations than CCB areas and accordingly, are subject to more severe
flooding. However, even after the project, land use in KBK areas would be
less intensive than in CCB areas. Given the increasing population pressure
on cultivable land in Bangladesh, substantial increases in cropping intensi-
ties are projected over the next decade or so, even without the project.
5.03      Based on the expected flooding levels and durations at various
elevations within the project areas, the cropping patterns in the two sub-
projects are projected to change as follows\:

_).04     BRE.  Because of the breaches at several locations, the flood pro-
tection from the existing embankment is not as effective as envisaged prior
to construction of the embankment during 1963-67. Undoubtedly, however, the
embankment has contributed significantly towards improvements in the crop-
ping patterns and intensities on some 180,000 ac. If the existing embank-
ment were to collapse, many low-lying areas would again have to be culti-
vated with b.aman. Also, there would be a substantial shift away from the
high yielding varieties and reduced scope for double cropping. The pro-
posed rehabilitation under the project would eliminate this danger. The
closure of the existing breaches and improvements to internal drainage net-
work would also enable further intensification of land use as summarized
below:

Yields and Production
5.05      CCB and KBK.  Protection from early flooding and salt water inun-
dation in the lower lying areas would lead to higher yields. On the higher
lands, drainage and protection from flood inundation would, apart from per-
mitting the use of HYV seeds, make larger and more effective applications of



- 23 -
chemical fertilizers and pesticides financially rewarding. 1/ Assisted by
the improved extension services, it is estimated that farmers' use of fer-
tilizers in the CCB and KBK area would increase from about 900 tons at present
to about 5,500 tons at full development. Typically, with the project, crop
yields would increase by about 30% over the present levels (Annex 1, Tables
4 and 5). In contrast, without the project crop yields in CCB and KBK are
projected to increase only by 5-10% over the next decade. Considering the
shifts in cropping patterns to higher yielding varieties, average paddy yield
would increase from about 0.50 tons/ac (13.5 mds/ac) at present to 0.53
tons/ac (14.3 mds/ac) without the project and 0.75 tons/ac (20 mds/ac) with
the project.
5.06      BRE.  Collapse of the existing Brahmaputra embankment would make
cultivation more risky, discouraging the use of cash inputs and improved
cultivation practices. With improvements in the agricultural extension
service in the northwest, anticipated under EARP, it is likely that on
balance, the future crop yields in BRE would not decline from the present
levels, even if the embankment were to collapse. The rehabilitation and
improvement of BRE under the project would, however, enable substantial
yield increases over the present -- typically, by 10-15%. Considering the
associated changes in patterns, the average paddy yield in BRE areas is
expected to change from 0.70 tons/ac (18.5 mds/ac) to about 0.60 tons/ac
(16.5 mds/ac) without the project and 0.80 tons/ac (21 mds/ac) with the
project (Annex 1, Table 6).
5.07      The estimated present and projected future production levels in
the three subprojects are summarized below:

Market Prospects
5.08      Due to low land productivity and high population pressure, cur-
rently, both CCB and KBK subprojects are food deficit areas, depending upon
imports for 30-40% of their requirements. With the expected population
increase over the next decade, the deficits are likely to grow larger without
the project. Despite substantial increases under the project, the two areas
would still experience a food deficit, although the deficiencies would only
be 5-10%. Accordingly, the increased foodgrain production will be readily
absorbed within the project areas. No problem is foreseen in marketing
the additional production of pulses, oilseeds and vegetables. With improved
income levels, demand within the project areas would grow considerably; any
surplus would be marketed in the urban centers of Khulna and Jessore which are
in close proximity to the two subprojects. The access roads to be constructed
under the project should facilitate the movement of the agricultural produce
within the project areas. In BRE where the primary objective is to safeguard
the existing production, further increases over the present levels would be
relatively small, barely enough to keep pace with the expected population
growth. Accordingly, marketing problems are also unlikely in BRE.
Prices
5.09      For paddy and wheat, GOB provides "guaranteed support prices", the
current procurement price being Tk 84/md for both. Due to weaknesses in the
official procurement machinery, inadequate storage capacity and poor timing
of food aid shipments, until recently, the farm gate prices fluctuated con-
siderably and often dipped below the respective support prices. However,
the situation has improved considerably during the past year and further im-
provements are expected over the next few years, in part because of the IDA-
financed Second Foodgrain Storage Project (Credit 787-BD). The current pro-
curement prices, if enforced effectively, are considered reasonable and pro-
vide adequate incentives to the cultivators. Accordingly, paddy and wheat
prices used in financial analysis correspond to official prices (in constant
1978 terms) adjusted for estimated transportation and handling charges between
the farm gate and the procurement centers as well as for quality differentials.
Production of other crops such as pulses, oilseeds and vegetables is small
and mostly for home consumption. There are no price support programs for
them and accordingly, their prices are highly volatile. The prices assumed
for the following analysis are based on historical ratios between their prices
and prices of foodgrains.
5.10      Fertilizer and pesticide prices used in the analysis are based on
current subsidy policies. Prices for other inputs such as animal labor and
hired human labor are based on prevailing prices in Bangladesh. For analysis
of "project rents", family labor has been valued at Tk 8/manday, some 20%
lower than the prevailing market wage rate. In order to isolate the project
impact from changes in nominal prices of inputs and outputs, a single set
of prices, expressed in constant 1978 terms, has been used to estimate the
present and future incomes (Annex 1, Table 16).

Farm Incomes
5.11      In each of the three subprojects, the present and projected future
farm budgets have been analysed for three different farm sizes: 1 ac, 3 ac
and 7 ac representing the "marginal", "small", and "large" farms, respectively.
Due to the lack of data on non-farm incomes, only crop production activities
have been considered. The estimates for the 3 ac farms are based on cropping
patterns that approximate the averages for the respective subprojects. Some-
what higher intensities have been assumed for the 1 ac farms and somewhat
lower intensities for the 7 ac farms (Annex 1, Tables 18, 19 and 20). Hired
labor requirements have been estimated assuming a peak monthly family labor
availability of 40 man-days. The income estimates include the imputed value
of produce consumed by the farm family.
5.12      As summarized below in Table 5.4, the project would have a pro-
nounced effect on incomes for farms of all sizes. Proportionately, the
largest increase would occur in KBK where the present income levels are the
lowest and the potential benefits from flood protection and drainage the
highest. The modest increases over the present income levels in BRE should
be viewed in the context of likely declines from the present in the absence
of the embankment rehabilitation proposed under the project. Due to heavy
dependence on family labor in smaller farms as well as more intensive culti-
vation, the per ac farm incomes have an inverse relationship with the farm
size. Typically, the net farm incomes would increase by Tk 500-1,000 per
ac, representing a 50-100% increase over the without project income levels.
If account is taken of the risky nature of cultivation in Bangladesh and
appropriate awards provided for greater input of family labor and farm man-
agement, incremental farm incomes (i.e. "project rents") would still range
from Tk 370-570 per acre. These increases are considered to be fully adequate
for ensuring active participation and cooperation of the bulk of project area
farmers. It should, however, be stressed that the income projections pre-
sented below are based on "average" conditions in the project area. In fact
project benefits vary considerably from farm to farm and from year to year
depending on the degree of cultivation risk faced by flood prone farms which
is itself related to microtopographic circumstances and climatic conditions.

Recovery of Costs
5.13       At a discount rate of 10% per annum, the present value of the con-
struction costs 1/ is Tk 60 M or Tk 1,300 per ac in CCB, Tk 50 M or Tk 1,200
per ac in KBK, and Tk 115 M or Tk 650 per ac in BRE. In addition, the O&M
of project works would cost about Tk 30 per ac in both CCB and KBK, and about
Tk 60 per ac in BRE. Assuming that the project charges were to be introduced
two years after project completion, full cost recovery would require a total
annual per ac charge of about Tk 320, 300 and 200 for CCB, KBK and BRE, res-
pectively. These amount to more than 50% of the estimated annual per ac proj-
ect rent.
1/   All costs net of taxes and duties in constant 1978 prices.



- 27 -
5.14      It is unrealistic to expect such a high proportion of the bene-
fits accruing from a Government-financed project to be tapped by investment
recovery charges, particularly in view of the low per capita incomes of the
bulk of project area population. For all flood control and drainage projects,
GOB's ability to impose such charges is limited by the following practical
considerations:
(a)  while it is possible to determine aggregate benefits
of the project (or average per ac benefits) it would be
administratively cumbersome to design and implement a
cost recovery scheme geared to individual farmers'
ability to pay in a situation where individual farmers
experience a wide variety of cultivation risks, depend-
ing on their location, land level and soil quality.
Conversely, imposition of charges based on "average"
conditions would not be equitable;
(b)  flood protection in Bangladesh, as in many countries,
is considered a social service and no charges have
been traditionally collected by GOB for this type of
project. To be sure, land values are likely to reflect
differences in productivity brought about by the pro-
ject. Hence, a betterment tax would be the more
logical method of achieving cost recovery from this
type of project. However, in the absence of any land
taxation system in Bangladesh (it was abolished in
1971), this alternative is not available.
5.15      For the above reasons, as in previous Bank Group financed drainage
and flood control projects it is not proposed under this project to impose
charges on the beneficiaries. This is not to say that there is no need to
help rationalize GOB's pricing policies in the agricultural sector. In this
context, enhanced irrigation water charges are clearly desirable. At GOB's
request, IDA prepared a report, reviewing water charges policy. In accord-
ance with the recommendations of this review, the Government has recently
prepared draft water charge legislation for surface irrigation schemes which
will provide for a flat rate to recover annual O&M charges within three to
five years of project completion and some investment costs thereafter. In
addition, the Government is preparing proposals rationalizing rental charges
for pumps. These proposals will be assessed in connection with IDA consider-
ation of a proposed low-lift pump project which is now being prepared.

VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
6.01      During the past five years, Bangladesh has imported an average of
1.5 M tons of foodgrain annually. This severely restricts the resources
available for other essential imports. The primary national benefit from
the project would consequently be increased foodgrain production and the
resultant foreign exchange savings. The population in the project area
would benefit directly from increased farm incomes and an increase in employ-
ment opportunities in agriculture, transportation and marketing.
Foodgrain Production
6.02      The improved drainage and flood protection for some 88,000 ac of
cultivated area in CCB and KBK would enable more intensive land use as well
as shifts to higher yielding varieties. As a result, the foodgrain production
in CCB and KBK is estimated to increase by some 19,000 tons 1/ over the
projected 1988 production levels without the project. Based on a projected
import price (in 1978 dollars) of about US$300 per ton for rice and US$200 per
ton for wheat, the annual gross foreign exchange saving would be about US$5.3
M. Net of foreign exchange costs of imported inputs such as fertilizers and
pesticides, the foreign exchange saving attributable to the project would be
about US$4.5 M.
6.03      In BRE, the project would, besides increasing the current food-
grain production by 19,000 tons, prevent a decline of 14,000 tons which is
likely to follow the collapse of the existing embankment. The project-
associated production of 33,000 tons 2/ would mean an annual gross foreign
exchange saving of US$9.4 M and a net foreign exchange saving of US$7.5 M.
Employment Opportunities
6.04      The labor-intensive civil works proposed under the project would
provide an estimated 18 M man-days of employment during project implementa-
tion. The more intensive cultivation envisaged under the project would
generate incremental annual employment of 3.5 M man-days in on-farm works.
Also, there would be a substantial increase in secondary employment in
Also, there would be a substantial increase in secondary employment in
activities such as marketing, processing, and supply of farm inputs. All
this would help to relieve the large unemployment and underemployment pre-
vailing in the project areas.

2/   Milled rice 28,000 tons, wheat 5,000 tons.



- 29 -
Income Distribution
6.05      Due to low productivity of land in CCB and KBK areas, the present
income levels in the two subprojects are lower than those in most other
parts of Bangladesh. In view of this and the existing land ownership
pattern, it is estimated that some 70-80% of the families have below sub-
sistence income levels (para 2.12).  With the project, the net farm incomes
in the two areas would be generally more than twice the current levels.
Demand for hired labor would also increase substantially, thereby creating
additional employment opportunities for landless laborers and submarginal
farmers. Although, the overall income distribution will remain largely
unchanged, the project will substantially reduce the level of absolute
poverty in the areas. Allowing for the increased population at full develop-
ment in 1988, the proportion of below subsistence level households is likely
to decline to about 50%.
6.06      In BRE, due to the protection provided by the existing embankment,
the current production levels are somewhat higher and proportion of below
subsistence households is perhaps around 50%. With expected increases in
population and reduction in land productivity likely to follow collapse of
the existing embankment, incidence of poverty would get much worse without
the project. The proposed project would help avoid this danger.
Economic Rate of Return
6.07      Assumptions.  The economic analysis is based on the following
assumptions:
(a)  Benefits.  Although benefits accruing to individual
farmers in a given year may vary considerably from farm
to farm depending on cultivation risk, microtopographic
circumstances and flood levels, the projected income
included in the analysis represents "average" conditions
in the project areas. Although the project would also
reduce transport costs through improved access roads,
only increased agricultural production due to the proj-
ect has been counted as a project benefit. Expected
crop yields, acreages and production are shown in
Annex 3. The gross benefits are summarized in Annex 1,
Tables 22, 23 and 24.
(b)  Prices:  For internationally traded goods, the farm gate
prices used in the economic analysis are derived from
projected 1985 world market prices expressed in 1978
currency values. Appropriate adjustments have been
made for freight, handling and processing, and quality
differentials. For other agricultural produce prices are
based on the historical ratio between their prices and the
foodgrain prices. For non-tradeable services such as hand-
ling, processing and transportation, a standard conversion
factor of 0.75 has been applied to reflect the prevailing



- 30 -
regime of import taxes and quotas. To reflect the prevail-
ing unemployment and underemployment in the project areas,
the farm labor requirements are valued at a seasonally ad-
justed wage rate varying from 40-80% of the peak market rate.
The price assumptions are summarized in Annex 1, Table 17.
(c) Crop Production Costs. Per acre input requirements are
shown in Annex 1, Tables 14 and 15. Crop production
costs are summarized in Annex 1, Tables 18 and 19.
(d) Investment and O&M Costs. All investment costs except
price contingencies, cost of land acquisition 1/ and
taxes and duties are included in the economic analysis.
The cost of the regulator already constructed in CCB
(para 3.02) which would be integral to the project works,
is also included in the investment costs. To reflect the
low opportunity cost of unskilled construction labor, a
construction conversion factor of 0.75 is applied to the
local cost element in the civil works. With these adjust-
ments the investment costs are estimated to be Tk 59 M for
CCB, Tk 50 M for KBK and Tk Ill for BRE. Project facili-
ties are assumed to have a useful life of 25 years. The
O&M costs during the project implementation are included
in the investment costs. Subsequent annual O&M costs (in
economic terms) for project works and services, estimated
at Tk 3 M each for CCB and KBK and Tk 10 M for BRE, have
been included separately in the analysis.
(e) Phasing of the Benefits. Construction would be phased
over five years. The improved extension service would,
however, start operating in CCB and KBK from the second
year and accordingly some benefits are expected even
before the project is fully implemented. Also, as the
extension service in KBK and CCB would prepare the farmers
for changes in cropping patterns and cultivation practices
ahead of the project completion, projected full development
production levels should be achieved by the fifth year after
project completion. In BRE, the project objective is two
fold: (i) to safeguard current production levels by rehab-
ilitation of the existing embankment; and (ii) to augment
the current production levels by improvements to the exist-
ing embankment.   Phasing of the additional benefits would
be basically as in CCB and KBK i.e. reaching full potential
four years after project completion.  Benefits under (i)
depend, however, upon the expected deterioration over time
in the existing embankment. With the current O&M practices,
it is expected that the existing embankment would lose its
usefulness completely in about 15 years and accordingly the
benefits from rehabilitation are phased over 15 years.
1/   The production to be foregone on land required for project works has
been subtracted from the project benefits.



- 31 -
Based on the above considerations, the overall phasing of
the benefits for three sub-projects is estimated to be as
follows:
Table 6.1: Phasing of Benefits
Year    1-3  4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11   12    13   14  15-30
-------------(% of full development benefits)           ------------
CCB & KBK    0   5  10  40  60  75  90  100  100  100  100  100   100
BRE    0  10  15  35  50  65  75   85   88   91   94   97   100
6.08       The estimated costs and benefits streams for the three sub-projects
are given in Annex 1, Table 28. The economic rates of return is estimated to
be 28% for CCB, 37% for KBK and 38% for BRE, indicating that all three sub-
projects are economically sound. The economic rate of return for the project
as a whole is estimated to be 34%.
Sensitivity Risks
6.09       Sensitivity tests indicate that the project remains viable under a
variety of adverse assumptions about costs and benefits. Results from some
of the important tests are given below:

(k)  all farm labor valued at full market wage          26         34         35
6.10       The project faces considerable risks.  The pace of project imple-
mentation, especially in the water resources sector in Bangladesh, has not
been satisfactory, due in large measure to organizational weaknesses and a
lack of interagency coordination. The proposed project is simple technically
and organizationally and involves only two agencies in its implementation.
Substantial delays in implementation are still a distinct possibility, how-
ever. The other major risk concerns the adequacy of O&M works, following
completion of the project facilities. This has been a continuing problem in
Bangladesh and many facilities have lost their usefulness prematurely. WDB
is preparing a detailed program for O&M of the project facilities. Compliance
with the program should minimize the problems related to inadequate maintenance.



- 32 -
As indicated in para 6.09, the project should remain economically viable even
if there were to be substantial delays in implementation or reduction in
project longevity due to inadequate maintenance.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreements have been reached with GOB that:
(a) design standards and construction specifications including
compaction for the embankments would be satisfactory to
IDA (para 3.04);
(b) agricultural extension on the T&V system would be insti-
tuted in CCB and KBK to a program satisfactory to IDA
not later than January 1, 1980 (para 3.08);
(c) bicycles and motorcyles provided under the project would be
made available to DOAEM'S extension staff on terms and con-
ditions similar to those under EARP (Credit 729-BD)(para 3.08);
(d) no civil work contracts smaller than US$5,000 equivalent

in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA; and
(iii) GOB would send IDA copies of the audit reports annually
within six months of the end of the fiscal year (para 3.17).
(f) for five years after completion of the project GOB would
undertake an annual monitoring program commencing May 1983
for assessing the impact, if any, of the project on water
transport and fisheries in the project areas and would take
remedial actions, if necessary (para 3.18);
(g) by August 31 of each year, IDA would receive, for review
and comments, work programs for the forthcoming construc-
tion year (para 4.04);
(h)  (a) at least three months before land was required WDB would
deposit sufficient funds for such land with the appropriate
authority; and (b) GOB would discuss with IDA the effects
of land acquisition on displaced persons, consult on steps
to be taken to relocate such persons, and would implement,
as necessary, a program of relocation (para 4.05);



- 33 -
(i) WDB and DOAEM would employ consultants, as necessary,
whose qualifications, experience and terms and condi-
tions of employment would be satisfactory to IDA
(para 4.06);
(j) GOB would furnish by July 31, 1979, its proposed over-
seas training program of study tours for approval of
IDA and thereafter forward for review the qualifications
and experience of the proposed candidates (para 4.07);
(k) before December 31, 1979 WDB would submit to IDA a
detailed program for inspection, maintenance and opera-
tion of the CCB, KBK and Brahmaputra embankments. Also,
adequate and timely funds would be provided annually for
O&M of the project and that project facilities would be
maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices
(para 4.09);
(1) GOB would provide sufficient funds for the proper
operation of the agricultural extension service under the
project (para 4.10); and
(mi) MOA would prepare and submit to IDA for concurrence, before
January 1, 1980, a detailed proposal for evaluation of the
project impact (para 4.12).
7.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) the Project Proforma had been approved by the Executive
Committee of the National Economic Council (para 3.11).
(b) WDB had designated a Project Coordinator with experience
and qualifications satisfactory to IDA (para 4.02);
(c) GOB had established a Project Coordination Committee
for each of the three subprojects, with membership and
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para 4.03); and
7.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suit-
able for an IDA credit of US$19 million on standard IDA terms. The Borrower
would be the Government of Bangladesh.
