PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture is the largest economic sector in the Republic of Cyprus,
providing 35% of all employment and contributing 19% to GDP and 50% to total
exports.  Irrigation is important to agriculture as the country is located in
a low rainfall region and the normal rainfall, 85% of which occurs during
November-March, is inadequate for either perennial or summer agriculture.
Only 43,000 ha (12%) of the total 360,000 ha cultivated are irrigated. In
its national five-year plans, Government has been emphasizing expansion of
irrigation to achieve rapid agricultural growth. In furtherance of this
policy, endorsed by the Bank's economic missions, Government has requested
a Bank loan to help finance the Paphos Irrigation Project in southwest Cyprus.
This would be the largest irrigation project undertaken in Cyprus and the
first to be financed by the Bank.
ii.       Bank lending to Cyprus during the last decade consists of nine loans
totalling US$56.l million, net of cancellations, for port development, roads,
power, water supply and sewerage and DFC. Progress on all these projects and
working relations with the Borrower have been satisfactory.
iii.      The proposed Paphos Irrigation Project would provide on-demand
sprinkler irrigation to 4,960 ha net and improve rainfed cultivation on an
adjoining area of 1,470 ha net. The project would include installation of
about 35 tubewells in wellfields along three rivers flowing through the
project area and construction of a dam on one of these rivers with a gross
storage capacity of 51 Mm3. The irrigation network would consist of a 12 km
long concrete-lined canal, a 25 km long main pipeline, 13 pumping stations
with a combined capacity of 7,600 horsepower and nine separate distribution
networks of buried pipelines. The project would also include construction
of farm roads, a few buildings for operation and maintenance staff and vehicles
and equipment for use during construction and after completion. On-farm devel-
opment would be carried out by the farmers with technical assistance from the
Agriculture Department and medium- and long-term credit to be made available
by the Cooperative Central Banks (CCBs). 1/
iv.       The project would be executed by the Water Development Department
(WDD) and other concerned departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources. An expatriate Project Manager would head the project ac-
tivities under WDD. A consulting firm would assist WDD in design and con-
struction supervision of the dam and irrigation network; and individual ex-
perts would assist concerned departments in agricultural research, extension
and marketing under the project.
1/   There are two Cooperative Central Banks; one primarily for Greek Cypriots
and the other primarily for Turkish Cypriots.



- ii -
Total project cost is estimated at US$36.2 million, of which the
::reign exchange component would be US$18.2 million (50%) which would be fi-
nanced partly by a US$14 million Bank loan. Government has agreed to finance
the foreign exchange gap of US$4.2 million with its own foreign exchange re-
sources. The balance of US$18.0 million, except for US$0.9 million to be
contributed by project farmers (20% of credit component), would be met by Gov-
ernment from its own resources. Construction would start in 1974 and be com-
pleted by 1980. The total cost of project works, excluding contingencies,
that could be tendered is estimated at US$21.4 million, of which works, equip-
ment and supplies costing about US$17.1 million (80%) would be procured follow-
ing international competitive bidding. The balance, comprising works of small
magnitude scattered over time and location, would be executed by local con-
tractors following competitive bidding and by force account.
vi.       About 80% of Cyprus' population is of Greek origin, 17% Turkish,
and 3% of various origins. After the inter-communal fighting of 1963, a peace-
keeping force is stationed in Cyprus and efforts are underway to find a po-
litical solution. Since 1963, the Turkish population has concentrated in
pockets adjoining Turkish majority villages or Turkish parts of towns and
Greeks are not allowed to enter such areas. Turkish Cypriots have also
largely withdrawn from Government services. About 20% of the project area
is owned by Turks, who constitute about 24% of its population. Turks have
indicated their willingness to cooperate with Government in project imple-
mentation, provided: (a) the community is represented at the decision-making
and executive levels of project administration; (b) Turks displaced by con-
struction of project works are resettled on a part of Government-owned land,
to be irrigated by the project; and (c) Turks are given share in the project
staff and labor. To meet (a) a Project Policy and Coordination Committee
would be set up under the chairmanship of Minister of Agriculture with repres-
entatives of Turkish Cypriots and UNDP Resident Representative in Cyprus. The
Government has agreed to meet the conditions (b) and (c).
vii.      At full development in 1986, the project would increase annual pro-
duction of main crops: citrus by 38,000 tons, table grapes by 23,000 tons,
vegetables by 54,000 tons and bananas by 2,000 tons. The existing production
of cereals and other crops would drop by about 6,000 tons due to diversion of
land from cereal to vegetables and fruit production. Gross value of production
would be increased from the present US$2.9 million to US$19.4 million and the
foreign exchange earnings from the export of project produce would amount to
US$7.3 million. The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 19%.
viii.     As adequate assurances were obtained from Government during negotia-
tions, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$14 million, for a term of
22 years including 7 years' grace. The Borrower would be the Republic of
Cyprus.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Cyprus has requested a Bank loan of US$14 million
to finance the foreign exchange component of the Paphos Irrigation Project
estimated to cost US$36.2 million. On completion in 1980, the project would
irrigate 4,960 ha net through a combined supply of surface and groundwater
and would increase production on an additional 1,470 ha of adjacent rainfed
highlands through improved technology and supporting services.
1.02      The Bank's economic updating mission, 1973, identified water shortage
as a major constraint to agricultural development. The three successive Five-
Year National Development Plans (1962-76) have emphasized the need for water
development to achieve rapid growth in the agricultural sector. During the
first two plans (1962-71), about 50 small dams and a number of tubewells were
constructed, which increased total irrigated area (excluding flooded plains)
by about 20,000 ha to 43,000 ha - an increase of about 9% per year. Despite
continued emphasis and efforts to expand irrigation, the total area irrigated
at present is only 12% of the total cultivated area (360,000 ha), and uses
only about 330 Mm3 out of about 600 Mm3 of exploitable water. The contribu-
tion of irrigated areas to production, however, is very substantial as, in
value, it accounts for about 75% of the total agricultural production.
1.03      Bank lending started in 1963 for power development and for the con-
solidation and expansion of the Electricity Authority. Further lending was
made for the construction of a new port at Limassol and for improvement of
port administration and operation through the creation of a National Ports
Authority. Two loans were made for sewerage and drainage systems, including
the creation of Sewage Boards. A loan for industry and tourism development
was made through the Cyprus Development Bank. Highway and road infrastruc-
ture reinforcement was also financed. As of November 30, 1973, total Bank
lending to Cyprus (net of cancellations) amounted to US$56.1 million.
1.04      This would be the first Bank loan for agricultural development in
Cyprus. The Paphos Irrigation Project, among others, was identified in 1961
by a UN Economic Mission financed under the Expanded Technical Assistance
Program. Detailed studies of the project were made in two phases. Phase A
covered detailed assessment of hydrology, hydrogeology, agronomy, dam recon-
naissance and overall planning and was carried out between October 1968 and
April 1970 by Thomas Ingledow and Associates Ltd. of Canada. Phase B, com-
prising preparation of a feasibility study, was entrusted to Sir M. MacDonald
and Partners, Hunting Technical Services, Howard Humphreys and Sons--all of
UK-and Jean Saliba of Lebanon. Their studies extended from March 1971 to
February 1973.  Studies for both phases were financed by UNDP and sujp ,r-ised
by FAO as its executing agency.

1.05      The project was appraised in May 1973 by a Bank mission consisting
of Messrs. M. Altaf Hussain and S. M. Niaz (Bank) and M4essrs. N. Ravid, M.
Boaz, R. Kimelmann, Y. Natav, N. Wydra and G. Post (consultants). The last
four consultants assisted the mission in the field part-time. In addition
to the mission's findings, this report is based on documents and information
furnished by Government agencies and the feasibility studies prepared by the
consultants (para 1.04).
II. BACKGROUND
2
2.01      Cyprus, with an area of 9,251 km , has a population of about 650,000
(mid-1973 estimate), which is increasing at about 1% per annum. About 80% of
the population is cf Greek origin, while 17% is of Turkish descent and the
remaining 3% of various origins. The country became independent in 1960 and
inter-communal fighting broke out in 1963. Peace was soon restored in the
country by UN intervention and has been maintained since 1963 by the presence
of a UN military force. However, the Turkish population has concentrated it-
self in pockets of Turkish majority areas-either in Turkish parts of cities
and towns or in villa&.s, 'Ihere they were already in a majority, and they do
not allow Greek Cypriots to enter either their parts of the towns and cities
or their villages.  Also since 1963, Turkish Cypriots have largely withdrawn
from the Government se-rvices. Some mixed villages, where the two communities
live together still exist.  Efforts are underway to find a political solution
which would restore mut-ual confidence between the two communities.
2.02      About 47% of the total area or 435,000 ha is considered arable,
about 21% is pasture land, and the remainder is non-agricultural. About
360,000 ha are currently cultivated of which about 12% or 43,000 ha are
irrigated. During the second plan period (1967-71), despite year-to-year
fluctuations, agricultural production at 1958 constant prices increased at
the projected average annual rate of 8.5%. The third plan (1972-76), like
the second plan, allocates almost half of Government's development expendi-
ture for agricultural and rural development (including water development)
and has a 7% growth target for the~ agricultural sector.
2.03      Agriculture is the largest sector in the economy.  It accounts for
-2%  -'P and provides employinent to about 95,000 (35%) of the total 275,000
economically active population. Agricultural exports make up about one-half
of the annual exports, which average about SC 40 million.  In addition, agri-
culture supplies raw material to local processing industries. The main export
crops are citrus, vegetables (notably potatoes) and grapes. Agricultural com-
modity imports are minimal and, together with capital goods for agriculture,
constitute less than 10% of the nearly SC 100 million annual imports.
2.04      At present, per capita GDP in the agricultural sector is about BC 160
.'r year, which is less than one-half that in other sectors (IC 400). Govern-
nent's present agricultural policy aims at increasing the earning capacity of



farmers so that the income gap between agricultural and other sectors is nar-
rowed. To realize this objective, two major constraints need to be removed:
the first and more important is the water scarcity, and the second is the size
and structure of the farms, which are generally small and fragmented.
2.05      Cyprus lies in a low rainfall region.  The project area, receiving
about 420 mm annually, is among the high rainfall areas of the country, but
this rainfall is inadequate for perennial or summer agriculture. River basins
are small, the largest being 710 km2.  About 85X of the rainfall occurs be-
tween November and March and results mostly in flash spate flows.  Droughts
are not uncommon and two consecutive drought years were experienced in 1931-
33 and more recently in 1970-72. The geological structure, generally compris-
ing igneous and limestone formations, is unsuitable for holding groundwater.
Only some parts of the country, among them part of the project area, are under-
lain by low-yielding calcarenite aquifers. Gravel aquifers are generally
limited to river beds. Most aquifers, fortunately not those in the project
area, are badly overpumped. This factor and the existence of a good damsite
on one of the rivers (fourth largest in the country) flowing through the proj-
ect area make the proposed project the most attractive water development scheme
available. It would reduce water scarcity and impact of droughts in the re-
gion and would bring modern agriculture to about 5,000 ha in a relatively
underdeveloped part of Cyprus.
2.06      The structural constraint to farms arises from the laws of inheritance
which permit division of land among heirs. There are about 69,000 holdings in
Cyprus, about two-thirds of which are below 8 ha, mostly divided into small
and scattered plots. The project area has a similar structural pattern (para
3.07). Legislation was enacted in 1969 to encourage consolidation by:
(a)  voluntary exchange of land between owners;
(b)  compulsory exchange in those areas where the majority of
owners opt for consolidation; and
(c)  compulsory consolidation primarily in those areas where
irrigation is to be developed by public schemes. However,
Government has an understanding that in Turkish and in mixed
Turkish-Greek villages, consolidation will not be compulsory.
In practice, Government, through a specially created Land Consolidation
Authority, is attempting to achieve consolidation through education and per-
suasion. To date, success in this direction is modest but Government's en-
thusiasm is undampened. The current practice of creating viable operational
holdings by renting, leasing or exchanging land substantially mitigates the
evil influence of fragmentation. Also, the rapid economic growth in the last
decade, which has generated employment opportunities outside the ag, Xcultural
sector, encourages owners of small farm plots to either sell their urnecaomical
holdings or rent them to their neighbors.



III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
3.01      The project area, 9,660 ha gross and 6,430 ha net, is located in
southwest Cyprus and is a coastal strip about 38 km long and 3 to 4 km wide.
It lies between the Aspros river in the north and the Khapotami river in
the south and is bounded by an escarpment in the east. The district town of
Paphos (Ktima), which is also a small harbor, is situated in the center of
the project area (Map 10593).
Climate
3.02      The climate is Mediterranean with its characteristic hot, dry sum-
mers and relatively cool, rainy winters. The project area receives an average
annual rainfall of about 420 mm, of which about 85% falls during November
to March and 50% in December and January. This rainfall pattern limits the
choice of crops.  Average temperatures range from 13°C in January to 27C in
August. Monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures are about 8'C above
and below these values. Frost is rare in the project area although in the
adjacent mountains, above 1,500 m elevation, snow cover stays from January
to April. Clear skies are typical of the area; sunshine hours range from 52%
in January to 87% in July to September. Winds are light to moderate (2.3 to
3.5 m/sec) and are predominantly west to northwest. Climatic data are sum-
marized in Annex 1.
Topography
3.03      East of Paphos town, the project area is flat, sloping towards the
sea at an average 2%, and is traversed by three major rivers: the Ezonsa,
the Xeropotamos and the Dhiarrizos - all originating from the western slopes
of the Troodos mountains and flowing westward to the sea. West of Paphos,
the area is relatively irregular, sloping towards the sea at gradients ranging
from 4 to 8%, and is traversed by two smaller rivers: the Mavrokolymbos and
the Xeros.  Together with the rlop-ng topography, the five rivers provide
adequate natural drainage.
3.04      The Agriculture Department carried out a semi-detailed soil survey
in the project area in 1968. Later, this survey was supplemented by additional
investigations, also made by the Agriculture Department in association with
consultants, during preparation of the feasibility study. Most soils are
alluvial in origin, having been deposited by the five rivers flowing through
the project area. They are fertile, grey to brown in color, medium to heavy
in texture, moderate to high in lime content and low in salinity. Close to
the coastline, there are small pockets of calcareous soil with a high water
table, which are not suitable for the proposed crops and have been excluded
from development. Red shallow soils mixed with gravel, found at higher
elevations mostly in the western area, are suitable for vegetable cultivation



only. The 1,470 ha of arable land in the non-irrigable area is suitable
for cereal cultivation.
Population
3.05      The last census, in 1960, showed the population of the project area
to be 18,000. In 1973, the project area population is estimated at 21,500,
with half living in Paphos town and the remainder in about ten villages.
About 24% of this population is Turkish and four villages have a Turkish
majority. The average family size is about 4.5 persons of whom 2.5 are of
working age. Of the total of about 4,800 families, 3,500 (73%) own land in
holdings of varying sizes. Not all of them are farmers; some 20% (small own-
ers) lease their land to others and work as agricultural labor. Most non-
owners are agricultural workers and a substantial number work either full
or part-time in the industrial and services sectors. Local agricultural labor,
which is adequate at present, would be in short supply after project completion,
particularly during peak periods. The short distances involved and availabi-
lity of an effective transport system, which encourages migration of labor,
would offset the possibility of a labor shortage.
Land Tenure and Farm Size
3.06      Land is freehold and inheritance through subdivision is legal.
Nearly three out of four farm families own land; others are either farm
laborers, tenants or lessees. The ownership pattern in the project area
(Annex 2) is as follows:
Ownersghip                                     Area
(ha)     (X)
Private individually owned                4,350    45
Private community owned                   3,250    34
Government owned (Chiftlik) /a            1,170    12
Other Government owned                      370      4
Religious institutions                      520      5
Total gross area                          9,660   100
/a   Taken over from absentee landlords in 1948.
Privately held land (individually plus community owned) accounts for 79% of
the project area, while the remaining 21% is owned by either Government or
religious institutions. About 59% of the privately owned land is in holdings
of 7 ha or less, about 12% is in holdings of between 7 and 15 ha and the
remaining 29% is in holdings of 15 ha or more, of which about 14% is held
by a few owners in sizes exceeding 67 ha. Land belonging to Government .or



- 6 -
religious institutions is generally leased to tenants in holdings that aver-
age 2.5 ha. About one-third of Government land is not leased and is either
under experimental or demonstration farms or is unused.
3.07      Fragmentation of holdings into three or more plots, often widely
separated, is quite common. The number of plots per holding increases with
the size of holding but the average for the project area is 3.2 plots each of
about 0.57 ha. The operational holdings, created by exchange of plots and
renting or leasing contiguous plots from either large or small owners or co-
owners of community-owned land, are, however, generally economically viable.
Although farming of doubtful economic size can be observed in the project area,
such a practice is not very common.
Transport and Communications
3.08      Paphos town is connected to all the major villages in the eastern
part of the project area, the port town of Limassol, and Nicosia by a two-lane
highway, which traverses the project area but more or less at the boundary of
the area to be irrigated. West of Paphos, a single-lane metalled road connects
the villages of the western area and leads on to the north coast through Peyia.
In addition, a good network of all-weather secondary roads serve the region.
Some fair weather farm access roads exist but would have to be improved. Addi-
tional farm roads are needed to provide access to all parts of the project area.
3.09      Paphos has a small harbor capable of handling fishing boats and
coastal vessels of up to 1,000 tons. Present traffic is limited to fish,
vine products and carob fruit exports. A car ferry operates during the tou-
rist season between Paphos and the Turkish coast. Limassol, which is the
nearest large port and serves the southwestern part of Cyprus, is 75 km away;
at present larger vessels anchor off-shore, but after construction of the new
port (under Bank Loan 628-CY) is completed, the handling capacity at Limassol
would be greatly enlarged. Nicosia airport, 160 km from Paphos, is used for
air freighting exports, where handling facilities have already been improved.
3.10      Paphos is rnow Linked to other major towns through direct dialing
telephone facilities and existing rural telephone exchanges, including those
serving all villages in the project area, are gradually being converted to
this system. Telegraph and postal services are satisfactory.
Power
3.11      The Paphos region is served by the National Grid with generating
stations at Limassol and Larnaca through a 66 KV primary transmission line
and a substation near Paphos. Power is distributed throughout the project
area by 11 KV lines and most project villages are already electrified. An
additional substation and a new 11 KV line would provide power for project
Ise.



-7-
Present Land Use and Yields
3.12      At present, almost the whole arable area of 6,430 ha net is being
cultivated, of which about 1,210 ha are inadequately irrigated by surface
diversion or by pumping from calcarenite and river aquifers and the remainder
(80%), is under seasonal rainfed cultivation. About 30 ha are being irrigated
from the Mavrokolymbos dam, completed in 1968 to irrigate 300 ha.  The distrib-
ution system from this dam is presently incomplete and would be completed under
the project. About 28% of the irrigated area is under vegetables, 26% under
grapes, 7% under citrus, 3% under banana and the remaining 36% under other
crops - mainly cereals and beans. About 80% rainfed cultivation consists of
cereals (wheat and barley) and dry beans. The present yields are 20 tons per
ha (with 130% intensity) for vegetables, 12 tons for table grapes, 30 tons
for citrus, 15 tons for bananas and 1.5 tons for cereals and dry beans. These
yields can be substantially increased through improved irrigation and greater
application of technology. Annex 1 gives details of present cropping pattern,
area, yield and production.
Credit and Marketing
=E ~   ~     Z
3.13      Each village in the project area has a cooperative credit society;
all have been working satisfactorily since the 1940's (Annex 3). These so-
cieties extend short-term credit at 8% per annum to members up to a maximum
of SLC 1,000 per member. Their own resources are supplemented by funds from
the Cooperative Central Bank (CCB) at 7% per annum on request. The recovery
record of these societies is satisfactory. The present annual operations of
each society, limited to about IC 15,000, are rather small but can be in-
creased with their unutilized funds, and further borrowings from CCB. CCB
extends medium- and long-term credit to farmers; for its own funds it charges
interest at 8%, while for Government allocated funds the interest rate is
4-1/2%. The CCbs are efficient organizations and can manage anticipated expan-
sion in credit arising from project implementation.
3.14      Some of the village cooperative credit societies also undertake
marketing of crops. Several cooperative organizations, outside the project
area, exclusively deal with the marketing of citrus and other produce in
domestic and foreign markets and after the project, similar cooperatives would
be established in the project area. In addition, some of the existing coope-
rative societies in the project villages would also handle marketing of crops.
Both types of societies would deal with local and export marketing under the
guidance of the Cooperative Development Department. A cold storage plant
already exists in Paphos.
Agricultural Research and Extension
3.15      Agricultural research facilities are well developed in Cyprus. An
Agricultural Research Institute at Athalassa near Nicosia, established in 1961
with UNDP and FAO assistance, has extended its coverage to almost all crop
production conditions on the island. This institute is staffed by 35 full-
time scientists and has adequate facilities. A 7 ha substation of the in-
stitute, located at Akhelia in the project area, was established in 1966 to



- 8 -
test the general research findings under local conditions and operates under
the direction of the senior staff of the institute. The main experiments
and trials at this substation are on vegetable and fruit production and
water use.
3.16      The Department of Agriculture operates an extension service in every
district of Cyprus. Its activities are directed by the section heads at
Nicosia and are coordinated within the Paphos district by the District Agri-
cultural Officer. The present approach is generally sound but the number and
quality of staff need to be improved. There is only one extension officer for
each 1,000 farmers against a more desirable ratio of 1:250 and few agents
have specialized training in producing high value crops.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The project would provide irrigation to 4,960 ha net and would im-
prove production on 1,470 ha of rainfed cultivation. Works to be constructed
under the project are summarized below; details are presented in Annex 4 and
Map 10594:
(a)  35 tubewells in three wellfields with three conveyance pipelines;
(b)  an earthfill dam with a storage capacity of 51 Mm3;
(c)  a main conveyance system from the reservoir to the distribution
network;
(d)  a pressurized water distribution network to serve 4,960 ha;
(e)  farm access roads;
(f) on-farm development; and
(g)  buildings.
The project would also finance land acquisition for the reservoir (320 ha),
irrigation network (100 ha, including 65 ha of easements for buried pipelines),
and iarm access roads (110 ha); construction of houses for 300 persons to be
displaced from the reservoir area and their resettlement; medium-term credit
for on-farm development; equipment and vehicles for construction, and operation
and maintenance (Annex 7, Table 2); and consultants and administrative services.
The project, which would take about seven years to complete, would be executed,
operated and maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
A consulting firm would be engaged by Water Development Department (WDD) of
this Ministry to furnish engineering services for the project, and individual
specialists would be recruited to supplement and train the existing staff of
agricultural extension and cooperative marketing services.



-9-
Detailed Features
4.02      Wellfields.  Three wellfields would be developed along the Dhiarrizos,
the Xeropotamos and the Ezousa rivers by installing 13 tubewells each in the
first two rivers and nine tubewells in the third. The capacity of these tube-
wells would vary from 50 to 120 1/sec. After completion of the dam on the
Xeropotamos, eight of its 13 tubewells falling within the reservoir and down-
stream would be abandoned after a use of about three years. Water from these
wellfields would flow in three separate pipelines, laid along the wellfields,
and initially, would serve areas to be irrigated directly. Later, with the
completion of the reservoir and the canal, the Dhiarrizos pipeline would feed
the pipeline that would serve the area east of Xeropotamos river and the other
two pipelines would discharge into the canal.
4.03      Asprokremmos Dam.  A 52 m high earthfill dam would be3constructed
on the Xeropotamos river with a gross storage capacity of 51 Mm . A side
channel chute spillway with a flip bucket would be constructed in the right
abutment with a maximum discharge capacity of 832 m3/sec. A 3 m diameter
concrete-lined tunnel, also in the right abutment, would divert the river
flows during construction. Two 0.8 m diameter steel pipes would be con-
creted in this tunnel to convey the reservoir water into the canal. Since
the dam is located in an earthquake zone, downstream areas safety requires
some regular formal inspections of the dam and its appurtenant structures.
WDD would make, at intervals of not more than two years, a formal inspection
to determine whether there are actual or potential deficiencies which may
endanger their safety, take any remedial action required, and forward a copy
of each inspection report to the Bank. Assurances were obtained to this effect,
during negotiations.
4.04      Main Conveyance System.  A 12 km long concrete-lined canal of 3.6
m3/sec capacity would convey supplies from the reservoir to the distribution
systems of the area west of the Xeropotamos up to Paphos. A 4 km long asbestos
cement pipe would take the water from the canal eastward, across the
Xeropotamos river. At the end of the canal, there would be a terminal reser-
voir with a capacity of 70,000 m3. From this reservoir water would be lifted
110 m at a rate of 1.15 m3/sec by a 2,500 horsepower pumping plant to feed
the 21 km long pipeline that would supply the distribution systems of the
area west of Paphos. This pipeline would cross the existing Mavrokolymbos
canal and would feed it whenever required.
4.05      Distribution Network.  The project area to be irrigated would be
divided into nine irrigation units; each unit would be served by a separate
distribution system pressurized by secondary pumping stations to furnish
on-demand sprinkler irrigation at 3 to 3.5 atmospheres. Each unit would
receive its supply either from the canal or from the main pipeline. Except
for two booster stations, the secondary pumping stations would be sited at
suitable locations close to the canal or the main pipeline. A total Ofc 12
secondary pumping stations, with a combined capacity of 5,100 horsepower,
would be constructed. The secondary and tertiary pipelines would be of
asbestos cement and would be buried along the farm roads. Each tertiary
pipeline would provide suitably located outlets along its length. Each out-
let (capacity 4 to 10 1/sec) would generally serve two farm plots, by turn.



- 10 -
4.06      Farm Access Roads.  A total of 240 km of farm roads would be con-
structed, of which 200 km would be unsurfaced farm roads 3 m wide, while the
balance of 40 km would be 5 m wide and gravelled to provide all-weather access
to the secondary farm roads.
4.07      On-Farm Development.  Land planing would be carried out on about
700 ha. The on-farm sprinkler systems would be designed by the Water Use
Section of the Agriculture Department. Equipment for these systems would be
standardized, and would be procured by the farmers under medium-term credit
from CCB. The project would finance the foreign exchange component of on-
farm development costs.
4.08      Buildings.  An office building, store, workshop, and about 30 houses
would be constructed for use during construction and subsequently for operation
and maintenance.
Water Demand. Supply and Quality
4.09      Water Demand.  At full development, with the proposed cropping pat-
tern, the average annual irrigation water requirement in the field for 4,960
net ha would be about 29 Mm3. At 80% overall efficiency, the annual demand
at source would be 36.2 Mm3. Prior to dam completion, irrigation would be
extended to a maximum of 2,530 ha by 1977 from the existing wells and
Mavrokolymbos reservoir, and the project wellfields to be completed by mid
1976. Water demand during these years would be 4.7 Mm3 (1975), 12.0 Mm3 (1976),
20.5 Mm3 (1977 and 1978) and 29.2 Mm3 (1979). Details are given in Annex 5.
4.10      Water Supply.  Prior to dam completion, the water demand would be
met by the existing Mavrokolymbos reservoir {net yield 2.0 Mm3) and the project
tubewells (yield 5.2 Mm3 in 1975 and 17.0 Mmi in 1976). The existing wells
(yield 3.6 Mm3 in field equivalent to 4.5 Mm3 at canal head) would also be
used whenever required to supplement the supplies from the project system.
After completion of the dam in 1978, the water demand would be met from the
above sources and the reservoir, all of which would be operated to obtain
optimum use. A reservoir operation study, based on 15 years data (1957-1958
to 1971-1972), shows that the Proposed Asprokremmos reservoir, supplies from
project wellfields and the two existing sources (Mavrokolymbos reservoir and
calcarenite wells) would be sufficient to meet project demand at full devel-
(Annex 5).  This study also indicates that the proposed storage, after
an average water year, would be sufficient to meet the full demand for the
following year, should that be a year of drought. In case a very good water
year is followed by two consecutive drought years, the proposed storage cap-
acity along with the supplies from other sources would be sufficient to meet
full project demand in two consecutive dry years.
4.11      Water Quality.  Groundwater from the river aquifers is of high
salinity and low sodium hazard, while the surface water of Xeropotamos river
is of medium salinity and low sodium hazard. Except for the first three years,
the two waters would be mixed and then supplied for irrigation. The salinity
of the mixed water is estimated as about 600 ppm, which is suitable for irri-
gation.



- 11 -
Water Rights
4.12      All unused surface water and all groundwater, except for wells re-
gistered before 1928, is vested in Government. Present users of seasonal
spate water would, after the project, receive assured perennial supplies,
which would more than compensate them for the loss of a free source. None
of the present extractors of groundwater has a groundwater right, except
Mandria village which receives about 1.9 Mm3 gross annually from an under-
ground gallery located upstream of Asprokremmos damsite. This water is
wastefully used by the farmers for raising cereal and fodder crops. After
the project, this free source would be lost and Government would compensate
the village in cash up to the extent of present net use, estimated at about
1.5 Mm3. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained that Mandria's water
rights would be adequately compensated by cash payment.
Drainage
4.13      The project area, about 3 to 4 km wide, slopes towards the sea at
gradients varying from 2 to 8%. It is also traversed by several well-defined
natural drainage channels including the five rivers. Part of the project
area is underlain by a calcarenite aquifer, which has a relatively high per-
meability and is pumped at an annual rate of about 3.6 Mm3. Under these
circumstances and with the introduction of sprinkler irrigation, no drainage
problems are anticipated.
Status of Engineering and Consultants
4.14      WDD has a number of trained engineers and other technical staff
and would be responsible for project execution except for the credit part
of the project which would be executed by the CCBs. Most investigations
and surveys for the dam and the canal have already been completed. The
wellfields would be designed by WDD and the Geological Survey Department.
The canal, farm roads and buildings would also be designed by WDD. A con-
sulting firm would be engaged to design and supervise construction of the
dam and the irrigation network. Additional investigations required for
detailed design of the dam and its ancillary structures would be supervised
by this firm. The Water Use Section of the Agriculture Department would de-
sign the on-farm irrigation systems.
Construction Schedule
4.15      WDD plans to start installation of tubewells in the Dhiarrizos
wellfield before end of 1973. Construction of the other two wellfields
would be started in 1974 and 1975 and completed by the end of 1975 and mid
1976, respectively. Detailed engineering of the dam and the irrigation sys-
tem would begin in 1974, after a consulting firm is engaged. Construction
of the dam would start by January 1976 and would be completed by end 19t/.
The canal, and the main pipeline and pumping station would be complecej by
mid 1976 and end 1977, respectively. The distribution systems would be taken
up one by one and would be completed by end 1978, and on-farm development by
early 1980.  Detailed construction schedule is given in Annex 6 (Chart 7882).

Cost Estimate
4.16      The total project cost, excluding import duties, is estimated at
US$36.2 million (71C 12.5 million) including US$8.1 million (bC 2.2 million)
of physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange costs would be
US$18.2 million (hC 6.3 million) or 50% of the total cost. The cost estimate
is based on unit rates currently applicable to similar works in Cyprus.  Land
acquisition costs are based on market rates as provided by relevant law.

exchange costs of the project.  Government would finance the foreign exchange
gap of US$4.2 million and the local cost of the project (US$18.0 million) ex-
cept for US$0.9 million, which would be contributed by the farmers as their

The Bank loan would be for a term of 22 years including seven years' grace.
Procurement
4.19      The total cost, excluding contingencies, of project works including
on-farm equipment that could be tendered is US$21.4 million. Of this total,
contracts for the construction of Asprokremmos dam (US$8.7 million), main
pipeline and all pumping plants (US$3.1 million), and for the supply of
asbestos cement pipe, pipe fittings, on-farm equipment, tubewell pipe, pumps,
power equipment, other equipment and vehicles (US$5.3 million), would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the guidelines for procurement under Bank loans and IDA credits. During nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained to this effect. The remaining uorks
(US$4.3 million), comprising installation of secondary pipelines, construc-
tion of canal, and farm roads are all works of varying nature and small mag-
nitude and would be contracted after local competitive bidding, existing pro-
cedures for which are satisfactory. Drilling of tubewells, installation of
pumps and power lines and transformers, and construction of buildings would
be either carried out by local contract under competitive bidding or by force
account. For local contracts, exceeding US$200,000 in value, bidding docu-
ments would be furnished to the Bank for approval prior to issue and awards
would be made in consultation with the Bank. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained to this effect.

Disbursement
4.20      The proposed Bank loan of US$14.0 million would be disbursed, net
of taxes, over seven years as follows:
Civil works               - For work performed under international
competitive bidding, local competition
bidding or force account, 40% of total
expenditures.
Equipment and materials  - The CIF cost of directly imported goods
and 80% of total costs of imported goods
purchased from local agents.
Consultant services       - The foreign exchange costs of the consulting
firm and individual expatriate employees.
On-farm works             - 50% of payments made by Cooperative Central
Banks, representing the estimated foreign
cost component of medium- and long-term
credit to project farmers.
Disbursement requests would be supported by full documentation, except for
force account work and loans made to farmers which would be disbursed against
a statement of expenditures, the supporting documents of which would be re-
tained by the executing agency and be available for review by project super-
vision missions. Increases in cost would be met from the unallocated category
(US$1.91 million). All savings after project completion would be cancelled.
An estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is given in Annex 9.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
4.21      A total of 465 ha would be acquired for construction of the dam and
its reservoir and other project works. In addition, temporary easements would
be needed for an area of about 65 ha to lay irrigation pipelines (Annex 2).
Land -ne: easemne-nts ¢ould be acjuLred by Government under existing laws, which
are adequate for the purpose, prior t;. the award of respective construction
contracts, and due compensation would be paid to the owners. D)uring negotia-
tio. , aesurancee were obtained that land required for the project works and
the temporary easements would be acquired under existing laws prior to the
award of respective construction contracts.
4.22      About 300 persons, mostly Turkish Cypriots, own about 75 ha of cul-
tivable and 230 ha of non-cultivable land within the reservoir area of the
proposed Asprokremmos dam and demand to be resettled on land to be irrigated
by the project. Government owns about 16% of the area to be irrigated by the
project, which at present is mostly leased on a short-term basis. The farmers
Aisplaced from the reservoir area, therefore, should be given Government land
to be irrigated under the project, in parcels that are at least equivalent in
value to those held by them at present. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained to this effect.

Land Leases
4.23      At present Government leases the State-owned land in the project
area for periods of one to two years, with the exception of one large estate,
which is under a 30-year lease due to expire in 1980. Short-term leases are
not conducive to optimal farming as the lessees cannot make large investments.
After the project, it would be essential that Government land, after meeting
the requirements of displaced persons (para 4.22) and demonstration and ex-
perimental farms, be leased for longer periods of about 30 years to enable
the lessees to make long-term investments in on-farm equipment and perennial
crop plantations. Such leases should be renewable for a further 10 to 20
years in the 20th year of the first lease, so that lessees could renew their
plantations. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
would follow the practice of awarding long-term leases along the above lines.
Accounts and Audit
4.24      Separate accounts would be kept for the project by WDD and other
agencies. Presently, accounts of these agencies are audited annually by the
office of the Auditor-General. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that separate accounts would be kept for the project by all agencies involved
and the CCBs ad the project accounts audited annually by the Auditor General
of Cyprus would be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the
closing date of the Cypriot fiscal year.
Environment and Health
4.25      The project area is free of endemic diseases, such as bilharzia,
and the project is not expected to adversely affect the environmental condi-
tions. Malaria, which was endemic in some coastal parts of the project area,
has already been eradicated. Although the canal (due to its variable flow)
and the balancing reservoirs (which empty during the day and fill up during
the night) would not be conducive to mosquito breeding, the creation of a
storage reservoir and the expansion of irrigation could reintroduce malaria
to the project area. Government's Health Department is adequately equipped
to take any necessary preventive measures and during negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the Health Department would monitor the project area for
any recurrence in the incidence of malaria, or occurence of bilharzia, and
promptly take necessary remedial measures.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Coordination
5.01      The project would be implemented by the CCBs and the Water Develop-
ment Department (WDD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
with the active participation of the Agriculture and Geological Survey Depart-
ments of this Ministry and in coordination with the Ministries of Interior



- 16 -
(District Officer, Lands and Surveys Department), Commerce and Industry (Co-
operative Development Department) and Finance and the Planning Bureau. To
coordinate the activities of these agencies and to lay down the policies for
project implementation, a Project Policy and Coordination Committee (PPCC)
would be set up under the chairmanship of the Minister of Agriculture and
Natural Resources. Members of PPCC would be the Directors General of the
Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Finance, Interior, Commerce
and Industry; Planning Bureau; and the Commissioners for Cooperative Develop-
ment. The Director of WDD would be the Secretary of this Committee. In view
of the existing communal situation in Cyprus (para 2.01), the Turks asked for
participation in project activities, both at the decision making and execu-
tive levels.  In order to ensure cooperation of the Turkish community, this
demand, which is considered reasonable, would be met by including a represen-
tative of the Turkish Pancyprian Farmer's Union besides the Commissioner for
Turkish Cooperative Development as members of PPCC. The Resident Representa-
tive of UNDP in Cyprus should also be a member of PPCC in order to influence
harmonious working between the two communities--a function which he currently
performs in several development activities. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that within three months after the date of Loan Agreement, the
PPCC would be established with membership and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank. It was stated during negotiations that the Bank recommended,
and UNDP Headquarters had informally agreed, that the Resident Representative
of UNDP should be a member of the PPCC. The Turkish Cypriots also asked for
share in the project staff and labor, and Government agreed that they would
be given representation.
Project Organization
5.02      Project activities would be supervised by a suitably qualified and
experienced Project Manager, who would be employed by WDD on terms and con-
ditions acceptable to the Bank. The Project Manager would report directly
to the Director of WDD and his employment would be a condition of loan ef-
fectiveness. The existing Tender Board, set up by Government to open,
analyze and award all contract bids, would assist the Director of WDD in
handling bids for all project works. Two Deputy Project Managers--one,
the District Agricultural Officer (a Greek) and the other a senior engineer
(a Turk)--would assist the Project Manager. A Project Advisory Committee
(PAC), to be established within three months of Loan Agreement, consisting
of the District Officer, Paphos (Chairman), the District Cooperative Officers
for Greek and Turkish Cooperative Development, the managers of Greek and
Turkish Paphos cooperative banks, District Land and Surveys Officer and a
representative of the Land Consolidation Authority, District Agricultural
Officer, three farmers' representatives (two Greeks and one Turk) and the
Turkish Deputy Project Manager (Secretary), would advise the Project Manager
on local affairs and developments affecting the project. PAC would also be
the forum to obtain the views of farmers' representatives on matters like
operation and maintenance of completed works, hours for irrigation and proj-
ect charges and their recovery, and would explain project objectives to the
farmers. The complete project organization, including PPCC, PAC and the
Tender Board, is illustrated in Chart 7916, in Annex 10. Further details
are also given in Annex 10.



- 17 -
Implementation of Project Works
5.03      Civil Works.  WDD would be responsible for planning, design and con-
struction supervision of the project works. W4DD would engage an experienced
consulting firm to assist in the design and construction supervision of the
dam, and the design of the irrigation system including the main and secondary
pumping stations but excluding the canal. The canal and the wellfields would
be designed and supervised by WDD.  Construction of distribution systems, ex-
cluding secondary pumping stations, and construction of farm roads and build-
ings would also be supervised by WDD.
5.04      On-Farm Development.  The on-farm irrigation systems would be
designed by the Water Use Section of the Agriculture Department and would
be constructed under its supervision. The on-farm equipment would be stand-
ardized and supplied to the farmers either with their own funds or with
medium-term credit, for which provision has been made under the project.
Operation and Maintenance
5.05      To meet the project water demand, WDD would regulate the Asprokremmos
and Mavrokolymbos reservoirs and the wellfields with a view to minimize effect
of a drought year and optimize the use of project water sources. For this
purpose, WDD would complete by December 31, 1977, a water study which would
indicate the best alternatives for regulation of the project water sources.
This study would be reviewed by the consulting firm before submission to the
Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained to this effect. WDD
would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the completed proj-
ect works. The operation and maintenance of the completed works would remain
under the project organization during the project construction. After project
completion, a separate section under WDD would become responsible for opera-
tion and maintenance of all project works. This section, in the light of
aforementioned study, would regulate the two reservoirs and the wellfields
in accordance with the water demand forecast periodically by the Agriculture
Department and would maintain the project works including the farm roads.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that on project completion a
separate section would be created in W4DD to operate and maintain the project
works as a unit and that the section would be given executive administrative
and legal powers to perform its functions. The farmers would be responsible
for the maintenance of the on-farm distribution networks.
Consultants
5.06      WDD would engage a consulting firm, experienced in the design of
dams and pressurized irrigation systems, to carry out investigations required
for design and construction of the dam and prepare specifications and tender
documents for the two main construction contracts (the dam and the irrigation
network), and the main supply contracts and would also supervise the exec-tion
of these contracts. The firm would also prepare rules for the operation of
the reservoir and the operation and maintenance of project works. Proposed
terms of reference for the firm are given in Annex 10. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that a consulting firm, acceptable to the Bank, would
be employed by March 31, 1974 on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.



- 18 -
Training
5.07      Overseas training would be provided for a total of 66 man-months to
suitably qualified Cypriots in the fields of sprinkler irrigation, agricultural
research, extension and marketing related to early vegetables, quality citrus
and early table grapes. It would take the form of short visits of three to
six months duration to enable qualified staff to obtain specialized training
in the above fields. In addition, experts with the consulting firm and the
individual experts would provide in-service training to their Cypriot counter-
parts. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that selection of candi-
dates for overseas training would be made, in consultation with the Bank, and
in accordance with a training program, which would be submitted to the Bank
for approval not later than April 1, 1975.
Agricultural Research
5.08      Agricultural research pertaining to the project crops would be con-
tinued at the central station at Athalassa, near Nicosia and at the substation
at Akhelia, which is located within the project area. A soils and water testing
laboratory would be added to the Akhelia substation. Research efforts would be
primarily directed towards (a) growing practices of all project crops with spe-
cial emphasis on further advancing maturity, (b) crop varieties best suited to
various projects soils, and (c) efficiency in water use. Three additional local
specialists and four assistants would be provided under the project to strengthen
the existing research staff.
Agricultural Extension
5.09      Individual experts, specialized in the fields of sprinkler irriga-
tion and the growing and marketing of out of season and early vegetables,
quality citrus and early maturing table grapes would be provided for a total
period of 36 man-months. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
these experts -would be employed on terms and conditions and timing of their
employment acceptable to the Bank.
5.10      In additions three e±xtension officers would strengthen the existing
extension staff. Besides giving advice on technical matters, the extension
staff would assist the project fan.iers in preparation of farm plans required
tor" --ort their requests to CCBs for credit to finance on-farm development.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that additional local staff, as
required, would be provided to strengthen the existing staff for agricultural
research and extension in the project area.
Credit
5.11      Short-term credit would continue to be provided to the project far-
mers by the village cooperative credit societies. Although these societies
ave some unutilized funds, requirements fo- short-term lending during proj-
ect development would increase substantially and the societies would have to



- 19 -
borrow additional funds from CCIBs. Accordingly, during negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained that CCBs would fully meet the needs of the cooperative
societies for short-term credit in the project area from their own resources.
5.12      The farmers would carry out on-farm development, including the pur-
chase of on-farm equipment, either from their own resources or through medium-
and long-term loans from CCBs, which would not exceed 80% of the total cost
of such developments, the other 20% being farmer's contribution. CCBs will
require additional resources to meet this commitment. A subsidiary agreement
would provide that Government will lend CCBs during the project the full amount
of its disbursements (of which 50% would be reimbursable from the proposed loan,
see para 4.20). CCBs lend their funds to cooperatives at 7%, for on-lending to
members at 8% for short-term credits (see para 3.13).  Currentlv, Government
lends to CCBs at 3% which they on-lend to farmers at 4-1/2% for medium- and
long-term credits. Commercial terms for medium- and long-term purposes are
about 9% but, while there is no justification for the subsidized rate of
4-1/2% for the project, it would be undesirable to raise rates above those
available to cooperative members for short-term borrowing. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Government would lend Project funds to
CCBs at an average of not less than 6-1/2% per year (loan component would
be re-lent at 7-1/4% per annum) for on-lending to farmers at not less than
8% per annum; such interest rates would be maintained in line with commercial
rates of interest on loans made for similar purposes. The Borrower has agreed
to include these interest rates in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with CCBs.
5.13      To enable farmers to obtain their credit requirements from the CCBs,
the following improvements would be made in the existing conditions for lend-
ing: (a) easing of security requirements by adding to items acceptable for
mortgage; and (b) repayment periods for medium- and long-term loans to be
increased to match crop development periods and repayment capacities of farmers.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that these changes would be in-
cluded in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Government and CCBs.
Recovery of Project Costs
5.14      At present, Government recovers a part of investment cost and full
operation and maintenance costs of irrigation projects constructed and main-
tained with public funds through a fixed charge on a volumetric basis. For
various projects, such a charge varies from 5 mils to 15 mils per m3 of water
used. The amount of subsidy involved is about 50%. Government intends to
follow a similar policy for the project, with a view to recovering a major
part of project investment but leaving sufficient incentive for farmers to
use project facilities.
5.15      For the purpose of recovery of project investment and replace-
ment costs and the annual Operation and Maintenance costs, a project charge
of 25 mils (EC 0.025) per m3 of water was used as indicative basis, which
a          should be levied in the first year of irrigation.  This unit charge would
yield a revenue of EC 86.25, 166, 200 and 250 respectively per ha of table
grapes, vegetables, citrus and bananas. At full development, with the pro-
posed cropping pattern, the annual recovery would amount to about SC 724,000
(US$2.1 million), which would be equivalent to an average charge of LC 146
(US$423) per ha of irrigated area.



- 20 -
5.16      To evaluate the impact of the proposed project charge on farmers'
income, budgets for farm sizes of 1 ha and 4 ha (50% owned, 50% leased), 8
ha (all owned) and 2.5 ha (all leased) have been prepared and are presented
in Annex 11. These budgets are essentially illustrative as they exclude in-
come earned away from the farm and income from livestock or other farm-related
activities and assume that a portion (12-1/2% to 30%) of each farm would not
be irrigated but would remain under rainfed cereal cultivation. The budgets
indicate that the proposed project charge would vary from a minimum of 20%
of the incremental income before payment of project charge (1 ha owned farm)
to a maximum of 29% (2.5 ha leased farm). A higher project charge is unlikely
to be accepted as the proposed charge is more than 60% above the highest of
the currently charged water rates for public schemes. With the proposed
charge, full investment, replacement and operation and maintenance costs
would be recovered during the project lifetime of 50 years at an interest
rate of 4% per annum. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
Government would collect commencing with the first year of irrigation a
water charge from water users in the Project Area at such rates as shall
be required to obtain revenues sufficient to (i) recover annually full an-
nual operation and maintenance costs; and (ii) recover gradually over a pe-
riod of fifty years the investment (including replacement) costs at an in-
terest rate of not less than four percent (4%) per annum.
5.17      With the proposed charge of 25 mils per m , the value of Government
subsidy to project beneficiaries, measured by discounting at 10% over the
project life of 50 years investment and replacement costs (including those
of Mavrokolymbos dam, in 1973 value) with physical and price contingencies
but without interest during construction, would amount to about EC 3.9 million
(US$11.3 million) or 45% of investment costs. Such a level of subsidy is con-
sidered reasonable when compared with the present subsidy of about 50% and
Government's desire to narrow the gap in per capita income between the agri-
cultural and other sectors (para 2.04).
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES AND FARMERS' INCOME
Production
6.01      The current levels of crop yields, both in the unirrigated and ir-
rigated parts of the project area, are as high as can be achieved under the
scanty and seasonally concentrated rainfall, often interrupted by droughts,
and inadequate irrigation. Without the project, therefore, any further in-
crease in production is unlikely.
6.02      After the project, the area under irrigation would increase from
the present 1,210 net ha (irrigated by gravity) to 4,960 net ha (all pressure-
irrigated) and the remaining 1,470 net ha, out of the total project area of
6,430 net ha, would continue to be under rainfed cultivation. For crops
other than vegetables, the present cropping intensity of 100% would remain
unchanged after the project, both for irrigated and rainfed areas. For
vegetables, however, the present cropping intensity of 130% would reduce



- 21 -
to 125% due to expansion from 340 ha to 2,040 ha and also due to introduc-
tion of perennial vegetable crops and longer term cultivation under green-
houses and plastic tunnels. Crop yields in irrigated areas would substan-
tially increase due to optimum and secure water supply, together with greater
use of better inputs supported by efficient extension, research, credit and
marketing services, all of which would be improved under the project. Crop
yields in the rainfed area would also increase, due to better use of tech-
nology and supporting services but would not exceed the current average
yield from the irrigated and unirrigated areas because some of the good
soils would be diverted to irrigated crops.
6.03      At present, low-value cereal crops are raised over about 80% of
the project area, which is largely rainfed and partly irrigated by river
spates. In the area irrigated by groundwater, high-value vegetables and
fruit crops (citrus, grapes, bananas) are grown with admirable skill and
success. With commencement of irrigation under the project in 1975, a rapid
shift from cereal cultivation to high value crops is envisaged; and it is
expected that, following project completion in 1980, almost the whole ir-
rigated area would be growing high-value crops. The full development pe-
riod, beginning with planting, is estimated at three years for vegetables,
two for bananas, four for table grapes and eight for citrus. At full de-
velopment in 1986, the project's cropping pattern, cropped area and incre-
mental production would be as follows:

Market Prospects
6.04      Citrus.  The annual citrus production in Cyprus averages about
250,000 tons, of which about 65% is oranges, 22% grapefruits, 12% lemons,
and the balance of 1% unimportant varieties. About 80% of total produc-
tion is exported and 20% is locally consumed--mainly fresh and partly proc-
essed. At present the world market for oranges is highly competitive and
over-supplied; production of oranges in the project is, therefore, not
planned. For grapefruits and lemons, world market prospects are better.
6.05      Grapefruits.  Grapefruit production in Cyprus averages 55,000 tons
per annum of which about 80%, constituting about 15% of international trade,
is exported. The main importers, UK and EEC, import about 75%; and between
5 to 10% is imported by East European countries. The consumption of grape-
fruits in West European countries has been and is expected to continue in-
creasing by about 10% a year, as the current per capita consumption of 1
kg/year is low compared with 7 kg in USA. The project incremental produc-
tion of 24,000 tons would come on the market in 1986, at which time it would
be less than 4% of total demand in the present markets. Factors that ensure
the saleability of this small quantity are the reduction by 40% in import
duties granted by EEC, a reputation for top quality commanding premium prices,
and an experienced export organization composed of private firms and coopera-
tive societies. Moreover, local processing of citrus in Cyprus is less than
5% of production; and there is a sizable unutilized industrial capacity which
could meet possible changes in demand, at home and abroad.
6.06      Lemons.  Lemon production in Cyprus is about 32,000 tons per annum,
of which 25,000 tons are exported to the same markets as grapefruits. Since
the incremental production of lemons (12,000 tons) is smaller than grapefruits
and the consumption growth follows similar trends, their export should not pose
any problem particularly because current demand for lemons in the international
market is not fully met.
6.07      Table Grapes.  The production of table grapes in Cyprus averages
40,000 tons per annum, of which nearly one-third is exported (about 85% of
which to the UK), about 12% is used in industry, mainly for wines, and the
remainder is consumed locally. The local consumption, estimated at 30 to 40
kg/head/year, is the highest in the world, and any sizable increase in it is
urtli'1^v. In the export market, competition with European g-owers is keen
during the main season because Cyprus is at a greater distance from the mar-
ket and the commodity is perishable. Cyprus, however, has the climatic ad-
vantage, which allows the crop to be harvested about four weeks earlier than
in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, and France) and by and large protects Cyprus
from competition in the European grape market up to the end of July, after
which the prices fall considerably.
6.08      The present production consists of the Sultana variety (70%) and
ither improved and local varieties (30%). Under the project, cultivation
of Parlette, Thompson Seedless and Cardinal varieties are recommended, of
which the first two, being seedless, are also suitable for raisins. These
varieties are eminently suited for earlier harvest, which ensures that the
bulk of the crop could be exported before other competitors get into the



- 23 -
market. The total incremental production by 1986, under the project, would
be about 23,000 tons, of which about 15,000 tons are intended for export and
the balance for industry and increased population. Projections indicate that
by 1986, demand in the UK, Germany and Scandinavian countries would increase
by about 30,000 tons. Cyprus would be able to meet a major part of this
demand.
6.09      Vegetables.  Vegetable marketing is well organized in Cyprus, both
for domestic consumption and for export. About 50 exporters, including a
potato marketing board and several cooperative societies, maintain about
20 packing plants and export vegetables to the UK through 32 weekly flights
from Nicosia to London. The Cooperative Department maintains two market in-
telligence offices in London and Hamburg; two more, in Paris and Munich,
are being added. Quality control is being exercised by Government.
6.10      Incremental production of vegetables would be about 54,000 tons.
According to available studies, including one sponsored by FAO, the per capita
annual consumption of vegetables in Cyprus would increase from the present
243 kg by between 33 to 53 kg in 1986. At an average increase of 40 kg,
about 28,000 tons (52X of incremental production) would be required for the
growing home market, already short of certain early vegetables and onions.
Climatic advantage would be exploited for early harvest through use of green.-
houses and plastic tunnels already practiced on a small area. Also, accord-
ing to above-mentioned studies, the demand for Cyprus vegetables in the
European market is estimated to increase, by 1986, by 30,000 to 35,000 tons.
The disposal of the incremental production of vegetables, therefore, should
not pose problems, but would require an efficient and expanded marketing or-
ganization with emphasis on quality control. It is proposed to entrust export
marketing to the Cooperative Department, which is already supported by mar-
ket intelligence offices abroad and has the relevant experience.
6.11      Bananas.  The small incremental production of 1,800 tons is intended
for domestic consumption. Imports are banned by Government and the current
production in Cyprus is already short of the demand. These conditions ensure
good prospects for the incremental production.
Prices
6.12      Two sets of prices have been used, one for financial analysis of
farm budgets and the other for economic analysis and are given in Annex 12.
Prices used for financial analysis are the average of 1969-73 farmgate prices,
including Government subsidies where applicable. Farmgate prices for 1969-71
were taken from official publications and for 1972 and 1973 (some crops only)
were collected from relevant Government offices. Before averaging, the 1969-
72 prices for all crops, except cereals, were increased by about 3% per annum
to adjust for inflation. Government is the monopoly buyer of cereals at
prices that include an element of subsidy; therefore, for cereals, 1973
prices were used without any adjustment. All other costs used in the analy-
sis were estimated at 1973 rates.



- 24 -
6.13      For economic analysis, adjustments were made in the farmgate prices
used for financial analysis to reflect the influence of taxes (practically
negligible), subsidies and probable demand of commodities. Although agri-
culture in Cyprus is subsidized, its main focus is on irrigation--a develop-
ment which is yet to take place in the project area. Taxes on agricultural
crops and inputs are negligible. The increase in production of mainly perish-
able comodities and posrible demand shifts in the probable markets (mainly
Western Europe), were discussed with the FAO and IBRD commodity experts and
the following adjustments were made. Farmgate prices were reduced by 10%
for citrus despite its reputation for quality; and 20% for table grapes not-
withstanding their improved quality and early maturity. The prices of vege-
tables and cereals, however, were not changed because quality improvements
under sophisticated technology would tend to better future prices. The
prices of vegetables were weighted for use in two groups--one for early vege-
tables and the other for summer vegetables. The prices used for the early
group (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and eggplants) and the summer group (nine
vegetables) were the weighted average prices for the vegetables in each
group on the basis of 1973 farmgate prices and the expected production of
each at full development. For bananas, the price used was 50% of the cur-
rent farmgate prices in order to eliminate distortion created by the Gov-
ernment ban on imports (para 6.11).
Farmers' Income
6f14      Farm budgets for typical farm sizes of 1 and 4 ha (50% of area
leased from other farmers), 8 ha (all owned) and 2.5 ha (all leased) are
presented in Annex 11. Farmers' income has been calculated at current aver-
age farmgate prices. Production costs include all inputs, valued at current
sverage prices, and take into account the deployment of family and hired
IaY,or and machinery as required by the different-sized farms. Family and
hired labor have been costed in full at the current average rate of EC 1.50
e-e SC 1.75 per man-day respectively.  Cost of establishing orchards for
the pre-fruit yielding years including cost of water and irrigation equip-
m"nt has been annualized at 10% per year. Interest on working capital has
Deen vzken into account at 107% per annum for 12 months for perennial crops
ifr six rnontlis for veetablt czops, There is no direct tax on agri-
cltutal land in Cyprus.  Pro.Ject -.ar-es have been assumed at 25 mils per
m-2   water used,. Based on these r sin;,icios and after payment of project
rer hectare incremental income from 1, 4, 8 and 2.5 aa farms is
,'Smated at EC 553, 456, 412 and 424, respectively.  Project charges would
amount to 20%, 25%, 24% and 292, respectively, of tne total incremental in-
come before payment of project charges. These figures are summarized below:

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Benefits
7.01      The introduction of large scale irrigation in the Paphos region of
Cyprus and the provision of proper agricultural inputs and services under the
project would bring modern agriculture to some 5,000 ha, which have been sub-
ject to rainfed and spate irrigated agriculture. The provision of a carry-
over storage reservoir would assure badly needed irrigation supplies even
in years of drought. The major quantifiable economic benefits from the proj-
ect would be the significant increase in the production of high value export-
able crops which would result in: (a) an annual foreign exchange earning of
about US$7.3 million, (b) higher income for about 3,500 farm families and



- 26 -
employment opportunities for 1,300 landless families in the projct area, and
(c) additional production of vegetables and fruit for domestic consumption.
The annual net value of production would increase from the present SC 0.45
million (US$1.3 million) to ,C 3.33 million (US$9.7 million). Investment
in farm roads, in addition to serving the project needs, would improve the
general communications network in the area.
7.02      Most of the project beneficiaries would be small farmers, as about
70% of the project area is cultivated either by small owners having 7 ha or
less each or by tenants and lessees farming 2.5 ha each. Among the poorest
farmers are the Turks, who have not had opportunities to improve their lot.
The project would increase the net income of small farmers by about 400 to
500%. Although the income of a 2.5 ha leased farm would increase by 120%,
it would increase further when Government would give long-term leases of
30 years, as was proposed under the project and has been agreed by the
Government.
Economic Rate of Return
7.03      The project's economic rate of return, costing family and hired
labor at current wage rates, is estimated at 19%. Sensitivity tests show
that a 10% increase in investment costs, a 20% decrease in prices of proj-
ect commodities, a 10% decrease in crop yields and extension of the devel-
opment period by one year would decrease the rate of return to 17.5%, 14.3%,
17.4% and 16.7%, respectively. Even when a 20% reduction in prices of com-
modities is combined with a one year extension of the development period,
the rate of return would be 12.7%. Details of the economic analyses are
presented in Annex 12.
Employment
7.04      The project would increase direct employment from the current
136,000 man-days to 762,000 man-days at full development. In addition, it
would generate employment in the supply of inputs and packing, processing,
transport and marketing of project produce, which is estimated at about
200,000 man-days per year.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following points:
(a)  WDD would make, at intervals of not more than two years,
formal inspections of the Asprokremmos Dam and its appur-
tenant structures and would forward for review a copy of

that are at least equivalent in value to those held by them
at present (para 4.22);
(f)  Government-owned land (including Chiftliks, para 3.06) in
the project area would be leased for periods of about 30
years and such leases would be renewable in the 20th year
for a further 10 to 20 years (para 4.23);
(g) separate accounts would be kept for the project by WDD and
CCBs and other agencies; the accounts would be audited an-
nually by the Auditor General of Cyprus; and a copy of each
audit would be sent to the Bank not later than six months
after the close of each fiscal year (para 4.24);
(h) the Health Department would monitor the project area for any
recurrence in the incidence of malaria or occurrence of bil-
harzia and promptly take necessary remedial measures (para
4.25);
(i) a Project Policy and Coordination Committee would be set up
within three months of the date of Loan Agreement under the
chairmanship of Minister of Agriculture; this Committee would
include representatives of all departments connected with proj-
ect activities, a representative of the Turkish Community, the
Commissioner for Turkish Cooperative Development and (as agreed
with UNDP headquarters) the Resident Representative of UNDP in
Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots would be given adequate representation
in the project staff and labor (para 5.01);
(j) a Project Advisory Committee would be established, within three
months of date of Loan Agreement. It would consist of District
Officer, (Paphos) Chairman, the District Cooperative officers
for Greek and Turkish Cooperative Development, the managers of



- 28 -
Greek and Turkish Paphos Cooperative banks, District Land
and Surveys officer, a representative of the Land Consolida-
tion Authority, the District Agriculture officer, three farmer's
representatives (two Greek and one Turkish), and the Deputy
Project Manager who will act as secretary of the Committee
(para 5.02);
(k) WDD would complete by December 31, 1977 a water study which
would indicate the best alternatives for regulation of the
project water sources in typical years, and after review by
consulting firm submit it to the Bank (para 5.05);
(1) prior to the Closing Date, a separate section would be
created in WDD to operate and maintain the project works
(para 5.05);
(m)  a consulting firm, acceptable to the Bank, would be engaged
by March 31, 1974 on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank (para 5.06);
(n) candidates for overseas training would be selected in consul-
tation with the Bank and in accordance with a training program,
which would be submitted to the Bank for approval not later
than April 1, 1975 (para 5.07);
(o) experts in agricultural extension, sprinkler irrigation and
marketing of crops would be employed for project extension
services on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank
(para 5.09);
(p) additional local staff, as required to strengthen the existing
research and extension staff for the project, would be provided
(paras 5.08 and 5.10);
(q) CCBs would fully meet the needs of the cooperative societies
for short-term credit in the project area from its own re-
sources (para 5.11);
(r) Government would lend project funds to CCBs at an average of
not less than 6-1/2% per year, and CCBs would on-lend to proj-
ect farmers at not less than 8% per annum. These interest
rates would be included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with
CCBs (para 5.12);
(s) Government would improve existing lending conditions for
project farmers with a view to: (i) easing security require-
ments, (ii) raising ceilings on loans to individuals, and (iii)
increasing repayment periods of loans to match crop development
periods and farmers' repayment capacities (para 5.13);



- 29 -
(t) a project charge would be collected from project beneficiaries
at rates to be agreed with the Bank, with a view to recovering
full annual operation and maintenance costs and full investment
and replacement costs over the project lifetime of 50 years at
an interest rate of at least 4% per annum (para 5.16).
8.02      The appointment of a suitably qualified and experienced Project
Manager on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and the execution
and ratification of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Borrower and the
CCBs (para 5.12) would be the conditions of loan effectiveness (para 5.02).
8.03      With the aforementioned agreements and fulfillment of the above
condition of effectiveness, the project constitutes a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$14 million to be repaid over 22 years including 7 years'
grace.  The Borrower would be the Republic of Cypras.
December 18, 1973.

CYPRUS
PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agriculture
General
2
1.        Cyprus has an area of 9,251 km , of which about 47% is arable,
about 21% rough pasture and the remainder non-agricultural. Of the total
435,000 ha arable, about 360,000 ha are cultivated but only 43,000 ha are
irrigated. The main irrigated crops are citrus, vegetables, deciduous
fruits and table grapes. The main dry land crops are barley and wheat.
Agricultural production constitutes about one-fifth of GDP and about one-
half of total exports.
2.        The project area, located in the southwest coastal region of Cyprus,
has a favorable climate for irrigated agriculture, is endowed with surface
and groundwater resources, both of acceptable quality, and an industrious and
progressive rural population.
Climate
3.        The principal meteorological station in the project area has been
maintained by the Royal Air Force at Paphos since 1945. In addition, daily
rainfall data have been collected at a station near Akhelia since 1924.
Monthly average values of temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, sunshine
hours, wind speed and evaporation over 21 years (1945-1965) are given in
Table 1. Mean monthly minimum temperatures ranged from 4°C in February to
20C in August and mean maximum from 20°C in January to 33°C in July and
August. Rainfall averages 422 mm per year, with about 370 mm (87%) falling
during November to March and about 210 mm (50%) falling in December and Jan-
uary only. Humidity (afternoon values) varies from a low of 59% in November
to 68% in June. Sunshine hours vary from 52% in January to 88% in August.
Winds are generally light to moderate, predominantly from west to northwest,
with a mean speed varying from 2.3 m/sec (August, October, November) to 3.5
m/sec (January). Evaporation averages 1 ,546 mm per year and varies from a
minimum of 53 mm in December to a maximum of 219 mm in July.
Soils
4.        The project area is a coastal strip, some 38 km long and 3 to 4 km
wide. East of Paphos town, the project area is flat sloping towards the sea
at 2%; west of Paphos, the area is more irregular and slopes towards the sea
at 4 to 8%.
5.        The Agriculture Department carried out a semi-detailed soil survey
in the project area in 1968, which was supplemented later when additional in-
vestigations were made for the feasibility study. The major soil types are



ANNEX 1
Page 2
alluvial in origin, having been deposited by the five rivers that flow through
the area. Due to the calcareous nature of the sediment emanating from the
river catchments, a soft calcareous layer is found at varying depths below
the surface. These alluvial soils are fertile, generally medium to heavy
in texture and relatively low in permeability. River terrace soils are
found bordering the rivers Dhiarrizos and Xeropotamos. Colluvial soils are
found at the foot of steeply sloping areas, which are mostly outside the
area to be irrigated. These are deep brown soils of clay-loam texture with
coarse material and are high in calcium. In the western part of the project
area, most soils are alluvial-colluvial, which are also fertile. Minor areas
of alkaline soils occur near the coast; mostly these have a high water table
and a poor texture and have been excluded from development. All soils included
in the project are suitable for sprinkler irrigation.
Land Classification
6.        Of the gross project area (9,660 ha), 1,830 ha are unsuitable for
cultivation. Of the remaining gross area, 7,830 ha, only 6,200 ha would be
irrigable, and the balance, 1,630 ha, would continue to be under rainfed cul-
tivation. Net area under irrigated crops would be 4,960 ha (80% of 6,200 ha),
and under rainfed cultivation, 1,470 ha (90% of 1,630 ha).
7.        While the whole irrigable area is suitable for production of vege-
tables, about 70% is considered suitable for cultivation of table grapes and
about 40% for citrus. The rainfed area is suitable for cereals and beans.
Present Cultivation
$.        At present, all 6,430 net ha are under cultivation, of which about
450 ha are under perennial irrigation from wells and Mavrokolymbos dam and
about 700 ha are under seasonal irrigation from river spates. A small area
of about 60 ha, under early vegetables, is irrigated by water transported in
tankers. The present cropping pattern, yield and production are given below:
Crop                      Net Area           Average Yield         Production

ANNEX 1
Page 3
9.        Present yields are low, mainly due to inadequate water supplies
and inefficient irrigation methods. Some farmers, however, have achieved
a high degree of specialization in early crops by making use of the favor-
able climate and irrigation water transported in tankers. In the vegetable
areas, a cropping intensity of about 130% is achieved. Vines are normally
not trellised nor adequately irrigated and hence their yields are low.
Rainfed crops are badly affected by recurring droughts.
Future Cultivation
10.       With the project, net cultivated area would be unchanged, but the
area under irrigation would increase to 4,960 ha. MIoreover, availability of
irrigation supplies would be assured even in the drought years due to the
carry-over storage on the Xeropotamos River. This would enable growing of
high value crops in the irrigated areas. With proper supporting services
and better application of technology, higher yields would be realized. The
recommended cropping pattern, yields and production for the irrigated area
at full development would be as follows:
Crop                         Net Area            Average Yield      Production
(ha)         (M)          (ton/ha)          (ton)
Vegetables               2,040          41            30              61,200
Table Grapes             1,800          36            15              27,000
Grapefruits                550          11            45              24,750
Lemons                     350           7            35              12,250
Other Citrus               100           2            30               3,000
Bananas                     120          3            20               2,400
Total               4,960         100
11.       The rainfed area (1,470 ha net) would continue to be under cereal
crops (wheat, barley) and beans and would yield about 1.5 ton/ha as at present.
The greater use of technology in rainfed areas would be offset by the diver-
sion of some good soils for irrigated crops.
12.       Irrigation would commence on 520 ha in 1975 and would extend to the
whole area by 1980. The cropping intensity on the area under vegetables would
be about 125%. Within the vegetable category, about 40 ha (2%) would be de-
veloped under unheated greenhouses, 590 ha (29%) under plastic tunnels, 180 ha
(9%) under perennial vegetables and the balance, 1,230 ha (60%), would be under
uncovered spring and summer crops. Cultivation under greenhouses and plastic
tunnels would be limited to early vegetables; mostly tomatoes, cucumbers,
peppers and eggplants. Other vegetables would include onions, artichokes,
peas, okra, beans, melons and watermelons.
13.       Production of table grapes would be of Parlette, Thompson seedless
and Cardinal varieties. The first two, being seedless, are also suitable for
raisins. Proper trellising would be introduced for which medium-term credit
would be available. Citrus production would be limited to grapefruits and
lemons which have a better export market than oranges. In the first two years



ANNEX 1
Page 4
of citrus plantation, vegetables would be intercropped. Full development
period for bananas, vegetables, table grapes and citrus is assumed at two,
three, four and eight years, respectively.
Agricultural Research
14.       Facilities and staff of the research substation at Akhelia would
be strengthened under the project and a soils and water testing laboratory
would be added to enable determination of exact suitability of various soils
to the proposed crops. Depending upon the soil infiltration rates, exact
water requirements for different crops would be ascertained and the farmers
would be advised accordingly. Crop varieties most suited to the project con-
ditions would be recommended. New varieties would be tested and demonstrated
at Government research and demonstration farms.
Agricultural Extension
15.       At present the extension service is small as the project area is
mostly unirrigated. During the project development period, the extension
staff would be adequately increased. Three expatriates would be employed
to organize the extension service and to train the local staff, especially
in the production of early vegetables, quality citrus and early table grapes.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
Land Tenure, Consolidation and Acquisition
Land Tenure
1.        There are four types of ownership in the project area, with the
following distribution:
Ownership                                      Area
(ha)          (%)
Private, individually owned              4,350         45
Private, community owned                3,250          34
Government owned /a                      1,540         16
owned by Religious Institutions            520          5
Total                         9,660         100
/a   Including land taken over from absentee landlords in 1948.
Privately held land (individually plus community owned) accounts for 79% of
the project area and the remainder is either owned by Government (16%) or
religious institutions (5%). Of the privately held lands, about 20% is owned
by Turkish Cypriots. The distribution pattern of privately owned land, by
sizes, is as follows:
Holding Size                                   Area
(ha)          (Z)
Less than 0.3 ha                           100          1
0.3 ha to 1.5 ha                         1,160         15
1.5 ha to 3.0 ha                        1,210          16
3.0 ha to 7.0 ha                        2,010          27
7.0 ha to 15.0 ha                         930          12
15.0 ha to 67.0 ha                      1,150          15
Above 67.0 ha                            1,040         14
Total                         7,600         100
Land belonging to Government or religious institutions is generally leased
to tenants in sizes averaging about 2.5 ha. About one-third of Government
land is not leased and is either under experimental or demonstration farms
or is unused.



ANNEX 2

Land Consolidation
2.        The laws of inheritance allow division of private land among heirs.
This practice has led to fragmentation of holdings, over the years. Statis-
tics indicate that the average number of plots per holding, for the whole
project area, is 3.2, each of 0.57 ha. Fragmentation generally increases
with the size of holding. The fragmented plots are generally scattered. The
prevailing practice of leasing land or exchanging remotely located farm plots
with nearby plots belonging to someone else, however, is a relieving feature
and results in farm sizes that are economically viable and about twice the
size of the area owned.
3.        Under these conditions, land consolidation has become necessary,
and has been initiated by Government. A land consolidation law, passed in
1969, provides for voluntary and, if necessary, compulsory consolidation of
holdings and elimination of ownerships of below 0.27 ha, which constitute about
1% of the project area. Government has created a Land Consolidation Authority,
which is pursuing the task energetically and seriously although, so far, the
results achieved are modest. Currently this Authority is working in one of
the villages of the project area with signs of success.
4.        The proposed cropping pattern for the project area is well suited
to small farms. Development of agriculture under the project, therefore,
would not be hampered by the present situation of land fragmentation and hold-
ing size, especially as the common practice of renting, leasing and exchange
of plots creates operational holdings that are economically viable. Although
it would be desirable to improve the size of farms by consolidation, it does
not seem attainable in the immediate future due to strained relations between
the Turkish and Greek communities. The irrigation distribution system has
been designed to serve the existing situation, but would also fit in with
the requirements, after consolidation. Development under the project would
be taken up first in Kouklia, Akhelia and Mandria units respectively (Annex 6),
where the least amount of land consolidation is required. By that time (1976),
it is expected that land consolidation in other units would have been largely
completed, at least in the Greek-held lands.
Land Acquisition
5.        A total of 465 ha would have to be acquired for the construction
of project works, of which about 320 ha would be for the construction of
Asprokremmos dam and its reservoir. In addition, temporary easements would
be taken for about 65 ha for laying underground pipelines for primary and
secondary distribution network. The land would be acquired and owners would
be compensated in accordance with the existing laws.
6.        Asprokremmos reservoir would submerge 75 ha of cultivable and 230
ha of non-cultivable land. Phinikas, a Turkish village located on the right
bank of the reservoir on the site of an old landslide, would be partly sub-
merged. Compensation would not be limited to the houses directly affected
by the reservoir, as the old landslide could be reactivated by saturation of



ANNEX 2
Page 3
its toe or a rapid drawdown; the whole village therefore would be acquired.
A new village would be constructed at a suitable nearby location to resettle
about 300 displaced persons.
7.        Most landowners displaced by the reservoir would like to be com-
pensated by land within the irrigated part of the project area. Government
would consider granting them land from the State-owned area.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION RPOJECT
Credit and Marketing
Credit
1.        Existing Facilities.  In the Paphos district there are 134 coopera-
tive societies with a membership of over 23,000 individuals. Of these, about
24 societies are in the project villages. Besides affording credit to its
members, these societies sell seeds, fertilizers and insecticides to their
members and some of them also market the members' produce.
2.        At present, farmers' credit requirements are met from two sources -
the cooperative credit societies and the Cooperative Central Banks (CCBs),
one serving Greek Cypriots and the other Turkish Cypriots. The cooperative
societies, which exist in every village, extend only short-term credit at 8%
per annum, while CCBs give medium- and long-term credit to farmers at 8% and
supplements the resources of cooperative credit societies, on request, at 7%
interest. CCBs also acts as Government's agent in issuing medium- and long-
term loans at 4-1/2% interest from two Government-allocated funds, advanced
by Government to CCBs at 3% interest - one for general agricultural purposes
and the other for improvement of irrigation. For the latter, Government makes
a grant of 15% of total costs and CCBs issues the balance of 85% as a long-
term loan. Repayment periods for CCBs loans vary from four to 15 years with
up to two years' grace. Security requirements are strict; only land mort-
gage with a value equivalent to twice the amount of loan is accepted.
3.        The size of loan to individual members from the societies is limited
to EC 1,000 and the average size of operation of each society is about IC 15,000
(US$43,500) per year. Annual lending by CCB for medium- and long-term, out of
both Government funds, averages about SC 330,000 (US$957,000) 1/ with indi-
vidual loans limited to SC 2,000 for general agricultural purposes and EC
3,000 for improvement of irrigation. Accounts of the cooperative societies
are regularly audited by the Cooperative Departments - one for Greek Cypriots
and the other for Turkish Cypriots.
4.        Future Credit Requirements.  During the project construction period,
the farmers would have to carry out the on-farm development, which includes
land planing, purchase and installation of lateral pipes and sprinkler equip-
ment, and construction of greenhouses and trellises. It has been assumed that
this development would take place from funds, 80% of which would be obtained
by the farmers as medium- or long-term credit from CCBs and 20% contributed by
the farmers themselves. The total cost of on-farm development is estimated at
EC 1.55 million (US$4.5 million) with a peak expenditure of E6C 352,000 (US$1.02
1/   Greek CCB only.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
million) in 1977. Accordingly, the total requirement for medium- and long-term
credit would beLG 1.24 million (US$3.6 million), of which the maximum annual
demand in 1977 would be EC 281,000 (US$815,000). One half of this requirement
would be met by Government and the other half (corresponding to the foreign
exchange expenditure) would be met from the proceeds of the Bank loan. Other
agricultural inputs would be financed by the farmers through short-term credit
from the cooperative societies.
5.        To enable the farmers to obtain their credit requirements from the
societies and CCBs, the existing conditions for lending would have to be mo-
dified as follows:
(a) security requirements should be eased;
(b) ceilings on loans should be either raised or removed. In case
of their removal, the limit should be determined by the merits
of each applicant;
(c) repayment periods for medium- and long-term loans should be
increased to match crop development periods and repayment
capacity of each applicant;
(d) CCBs should give the required support to cooperative societies
so that they can meet the increased needs of the farmers for
short-term credit;
(e) the existing margin of 1 to 1-1/2% for CCBs should be increased
to about 2% so that CCB could function efficiently and effec-
tively as a prime lending institution and could properly super-
vise the lending activities of the cooperative societies; and
(f) the rate of interest of 4-1/2% charged by CCBs on Government-
allocated funds is low and should be raised to at least 8% to
reduce the element of subsidy.
Marketing
6.        After the project, marketing of all crops should continue to be a
function of the cooperative societies, as it is in certain cases at present.
Of the total 900 cooperative societies in Cyprus, over 50 societies deal with
the marketing of various agricultural products. In addition, several coopera-
tive unions and organizations, of which many individual societies are members,
engage in marketing of agricultural produce. Of the total production, 85%
carobs, 100% cereals, 90% almonds, 90% tobacco, 80% lemons and a substantial
percentage of the island's production of citrus, carrots, melons, potatoes,
sugar beets and table grapes are channeled to the domestic and foreign mar-
kets through these societies, unions and organizations. The larger unions
and organizations have their own grading and packing plants and stores. The
Cooperative Development Department plans to convert the existing cooperative
societies in the project villages into multi-purpose societies, which would
undertake assembling, grading and packing of marketable commodities. New



ANNEX 3
Page 3
cooperative unions would emerge, which, under the guidance of the Cooperative
Development Department and with the assistance of an expatriate experts to be
provided under the project, would handle most of the domestic and export
marketing of project produce. The proposed cooperative marketing system
would have the following advantages:
(a) it is already being practiced in many parts of Cyprus and
is well understood and generally liked by the farmers;
(b) it would have the support and guidance of the Cooperative
Development Department and would receive valuable assistance
from the Department's market intelligence offices at home and
abroad;
(c) it would save the farmers from middleman exploitation;
(d) it would reduce capital outlay on the establishment of
grading, packing and storage facilities by providing these
facilities at suitable and central locations, which would
be easily accessible to all producers; and
(e) it would enable bulk transportation to domestic and foreign
markets at economical rates.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
Description of Project Works
Project Works
1.        The principal features of the project (Map 10594) are:
(a) three wellfields, consisting of 35 tubewells, along the
Dhiarrizos, the Xeropotamos and the Ezousa rivers and
their conveyance pipelines;
(b) the Asprokremmos dam on the Xeropotamos river with a
storage capacity of 51 Mm3;
(c)  an irrigation conveyance system flowing westward from
the dam and consisting of a 12 km long canal, a pumping
plant and a 21 km long pipeline, and a 4 km long pipeline
flowing eastward from the dam;
(d) a pressurized distribution network serving 4,960 net ha;
(e) 240 km of farm access roads;
(f) on-farm development of the whole irrigated area, including
land planing and construction of greenhouses and trellises;
(g) the procurement of construction and operation and maintenance
equipment; and
(h) the construction of buildings.
2.        Wellfields.  Three wellfields would be developed in the gravel
aquifers of the Dhiarrizos, the Xeropotamos and the Ezousa rivers by installa-
tion of 35 tubewells, of which 13 tubewells each would be in the first two
rivers and nine in the third. The width and depth of these aquifers, con-
fined to the river valleys, generally increase towards the coastline, and
tubewells in the lower river reaches would yield more water than those in
the upper reaches. The capacity of the tubewells would vary from 50 to
120 1/sec. After completion of Asprokremmos dam, four tubewells located
within its reservoir and another four downstream of the dam would be aban-
doned.  The gravel aquifers of the three rivers are fully recharged every
winter by the surface flows, and the annual yield from the tubewells wou'd
be reliable.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
3.        Asbestos cement pipelines laid along the Ezousa and Xeropotamos
wellfields would convey water from these wellfields to the canal, while an-
other pipeline laid along the Dhiarrizos wellfield would feed into the pipe-
line extending eastward from the canal (see Map 10594). However, prior to
canal completion, supply from the three wellfields would be delivered di-
rectly to the distribution systems of three irrigation units (Akhelia,
Mandria and Kouklia respectively). With the completion of the canal, the
tubewell supplies would be extended to Timi irrigation unit. After comple-
tion of the dam, supplies from the wellfields would supplement the releases
from the reservoir, which would be conveyed by the canal to the distribution
systems of various irrigation units. Three 11 KV lines would be extended
along the wellfields from the existing 66 KV transmission line in the area
to supply power to the tubewells.
4.        Asprokremmos Dam.  The Asprokremmos dam would be constructed on
the Xeropotamos river, 3.5 km upstream from the coast and about 15 km east
of Paphos town.  The dam would consist of a 52 m high earthfill embankment
with a crest elevation of 84.0 m above mean sea level. The gross storage
capacity of the reservoir would be 51 Mm3 at the maximum retention level
of 79.5 m. During construction the river would be diverted through a con-
crete-lined tunnel, 3.0 m in diameter, in the right abutment. Two 0.8 m
diameter steel pipes, laid at the tunnel invert and concreted in place, would
serve as irrigation outlets. The spillway, located on the right bank, would
consist of an ungated crest with a chute and a flip bucket and would pass a
maximum discharge of 832 m3/sec while routing the maximum probable flood of
1,650 m3/sec with a surcharge of 4 m. Additional data on the proposed dam
and its ancillary structures are given in Table 1. The major construction
quantities of the proposed works are estimated as follows:
Item                                        Unit      Quantity
Open excavation in soft material                        m3       438,000
Open excavation in rock                                 m3       110,000
Underground excavation (tunnel & galleries)             m         10,000
Drilling (grouting, anchors, drainage)                  m3        20,000
Rolled clay core and blainket                           m3       313,000
Compacted gravel fill                                   m3     1,345,000
Filters and selected materials                          m3       240,000
:L   and slope protection                          m3         68,000
'Mass concrete                                          m3        10,000
Reinforced concrete                                     m3         5,000
Concrete lining (tunnel and galleries)                  m2         4,000
Road surfacing                                          m         18,000
5.        Conveyance System.  The main conveyance system would extend west-
ward from the Asprokremmos dam outlet works to Ayios Yeoryios and would be
about 33 km long. The first part of this system would consist of a 12 km
long concrete-lined canal, with a uniform capacity of 3.6 m3/sec, which
would terminate into a 70,000 m3 reservoir near Yeroskipos. The second part
would be a 4 km long asbestos cement pipeline extending eastward from the
canal. Located next to the terminal reservoir would be a 2,500 horsepower



ANNEX 4
Page 3
pumping plant, which would lift water 110 m from this reservoir at a rate
of 1.15 m3/sec, and deliver it through a 2 km long steel pipeline into a
balancing reservoir with a capacity of 12,500 m3. The third part of the
conveyance system, consisting of a 19 km long pipeline, would begin at the
balancing reservoir and terminate at Ayios Yeoryios. En route, it would
cross the existing Mavrokolymbos canal, where arrangement would be made to
feed this canal, whenever required. A new substation would be constructed
near Yeroskipos, which would provide power to the main and secondary pump-
ing plants through a new 11 KV transmission line.
6.        The canal would flow continuously, feeding the distribution systems
of the eastern area (3,390 ha) during 16 hours and the terminal and balancing
reservoirs during the eight hours at night when irrigation would cease. Re-
leases from the Asprokremmos reservoir would be adjusted daily after taking
deliveries from the wellfields into account. The main pumping plant, operat-
ing 22 hours per day, would feed the distribution systems of the remaining
1,570 ha including 300 ha served from the Mavrokolymbos reservoir.
7.        Distribution Network.  The project area is divided into the follow-
ing irrigation units by village boundaries:

All units, except Koloni, Yeroskipos and Paphos, would be served by direct
offtakes from the main canal or main pipeline and their distribution networks
would be pressurized by pumping stations located close to these offtakes. The
Koloni, Yeroskipos and Paphos distribution systems would be pressurized by



ANNEX 4
Page 4
pumps located in the main pumping station near the Yeroskipos terminal re-
servoir.  The offtakes for Peyia unit would not require additional pressure
and would be served directly by the tail reach of the main pipeline. Small
balancing reservoirs, varying in capacity from 2,500 to 12,000 m3, would be
provided at suitable high level locations for irrigation units of the western
area. All pumping stations in the western area would operate for 22 hours --
16 hours for pressurizing the distribution networks and six hours for filling
up the balancing reservoirs. The secondary and tertiary pipelines are of
asbestos cement and would be buried along the farm access roads. Each tertiary
pipeline would provide suitably located outlets along its length. Each outlet,
located to serve two farm plots by turn and with a capacity varying from 4 to
10 1/sec, would consist of a common valve, and two valves and two water meters
installed in parallel.
8.        The distribution network would be designed as an on-demand supply
system with a working pressure of 3 to 3.5 atmospheres at the outlets. The
average hydromodule for the project area is 1.2 1/sec/ha. This would meet
the peak demand for the month of June on the basis of 16 hours of irrigation
per day. In addition to the main pumping station, 12 secondary pumping sta-
tions would be required to pressurize the distribution network, data on which
are given in Table 2. Power to the pumping stations would be supplied through
a new 11 KV transmission line.
9.        Farm Access Roads.  Most project villages are connected with the
Limassol-Paphos highway and its extension to Ayios Yeoryios. The network
of secondary roads within the project area would be enlarged by constructing
about 40 km of 5 m wide gravelled roads.  About 200 km of 3 m wide unsurfaced
farm roads would be constructed to serve most farms in the project area.
10.       On-Farm Development.  About one-half of the Western area (700 ha)
would require land planing to varying extents, which would be carried out
by local contractors under the supervision of the project staff. The on-
farm sprinkler system for each plot would be designed by the staff of the
Water Use Section of the Agriculture Department. Equipment for these sys-
tems would be standardized and would be procured by the farmers, for which
medium-term credit would be available. The layout of the on-farm irrigation
systems would be supervised by the project staff. The project extension staff
would particularly advise farmers in the planning and design of greenhouses,
plastic tunnels and trellises.
11.       Equipment.  The project would furnish vehicles to be used by the
project staff and consultants during the construction period. Equipment
required for survey, design and office use and for the soil and concrete
laboratory would also be provided by the project. Vehicles and equipment
required for the operation and maintenance of project works would be fur-
nished towards the end of the construction period. Small quantities of
asbestos cement pipes of various diameters, pipe fittings, valves, water
meters and outlets would also be furnished to provide initial stocks for
maintenance of the irrigation network. List of equipment and materials is
attached as Table 2 in Annex 7.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
12.       Buildings.  An office building and about 30 houses would be con-
structed to meet the requirements of operation and maintenance staff. A
small workshop and a store would be constructed near the main pumping sta-
tion to serve the maintenance needs of completed works. These facilities
would however be constructed in the first two years and would be initially
used by the project staff during the construction period.
Operation and Maintenance
13.       The completed project works including the dam would be operated
and maintained by WDD under the supervision of a Project Manager, who would
be provided with adequate staff, equipment and materials. The Agriculture
Department would monitor agricultural activities in the project area and
would also supervise the research and extension work. The Agriculture De-
partment would indicate water requirements to the Project Manager, who would
regulate the supply from the wellfields and the reservoir. The new substation
and power lines would be maintained by the Electricity Authority, which would
sell power to the project. The on-farm irrigation systems, greenhouses, plas-
tic tunnels and trellises would be maintained by the farmers.
Drainage
14.       East of Paphos, the project area slopes towards the coast at 2%
while in the west the slopes vary from 4 to 8%. The project area is tra-
versed by several well-defined natural drainage channels and is underlain
by calcarenite aquifers, which have a relatively high permeability. The
soils, in general, have satisfactory infiltration capacities. With the
introduction of sprinkler irrigation and the recommended cropping pattern,
no drainage problems are foreseen. Continued pumping from calcarenite
aquifers by existing wells and expected additional exploitation of this
source for local use further assure that drainage problems would not arise
in the future.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
Water Demand, Supply, Quality and Rights
Need for Irrigation
1.        Rainfall in the project area averages 422 mm per annum, about 85%
falling in the period November to March. The summers are usually hot and
dry and any rainfall during this period is insufficient for crop growth.
Droughts are not uncommon; two were experienced successively in 1931-32 and
1932-33, followed by a near drought year of 1933-34. More recently 1963-64
and 1971-72 were years of drought, the latter being the worse in the past
54 years. Therefore, irrigation is required to obtain optimum yields for
the winter crops and to introduce perennial fruit and seasonal summer crops.
Water Demand
2.        Water Requirements for Crops.  The water requirements of the pro-
posed crops were estimated on the basis of class A pan evaporation data, rele-
vant field experiments and data on water requirements for similar crops under
comparable regional conditions. The pan evaporation data, taken from the
records of the Agricultural Research Institute, are based on average observa-
tion during 1966-1972 at Akhelia Government Farm, located within the project
area. The crop coefficients adopted are based on field experiments and re-
gional data. The net monthly requirement for a given crop was calculated
by multiplying the average daily evaporation by the crop coefficient and
the number of days in that month, adjusting it for the average effective
rainfall for that month and whether the crop was covered or not. Average
rainfall of 15 mm or less was ignored.
3.        Effective Rainfall.  The proposed cropping pattern, evaporation and
rainfall data and net monthly water requirement per hectare for each crop are
given in Table 1 (Chart 7881). The weighted average net requirement per hec-
tare of project area is estimated as 5,900 m3 and the corresponding gross re-
quirement, at 80% overall efficiency (para 4), is 7,375 m3. The annual crop-
ping intensity for area under vegetables (42% of project area) is 125% and
the intensity for the whole project area is 110%. The overall intensity is
low as perennial vegetable and fruit crops would occupy about 60% of the
net irrigated area.
4.        Irrigation Efficiency.  Except for 12 km length of canal, which is
concrete lined, the whole irrigation network would consist of pipelines. The
conveyance losses, therefore, would be very small. Since the whole area is
served by sprinkler irrigation, the field efficiency would be high. The
overall efficiency of the system has been assumed as 80%.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.        Irrigation Demand.  Under the project, irrigation would commence
in 1975 by the use of tubewell water and the entire 4,960 ha would be under
irrigation by 1980 - one year after completion of the dam. Based on the pro-
posed development schedule, the cropping pattern and the water requirements
of crops, the net and gross irrigation demands are given below:

1979                         3,730                    23.4          29.2

/a   At 80% overall efficiency.
6.        Other Water Demands.  At present a small amount of water (about
2.5 Mm3) is extracted annually by wells from the Dhiarrizos and Ezousa rivers
for use upstream of the project area. Some of these wells may be adversely
affected by pumpage of the project wellfields in these river reaches and in
that case, the present users of the affected wells would have to be given
compensation water.  However, since it is not possible to anticipate the
reduction in yields of the existing wells, an ad-hoc provision has been
made in the project estimate to make arrangements to provide water from
the conveyance pipelines of the two project wellfields. A review of future
demand for municipal uses in the project area indicated that about 2 Mm3
would be required annually at some future date for extension of Paphos town
water supply. This amounts to a continuous flow of 65 1/sec or 195 1/sec
for the off-irrigation eight hours and could be easily furnished from the
project network.
Water Supply
7.        The project would derive its water supply from two existing sources:
the Mavrokolymbos reservoir in the western area and the open-pumped wells
scattered all over the eastern area; and two new sources: the wellfields
along the three rivers Dhiarrizos, Xeropotamos and Ezousa and the Asprokremmos
reservoir on the Xeropotamos.
8.        Exising Mavrokolymbos Reservoir.  A dam with a storage capacity of
2.18 mM was completed on the Mavrokolymbos river in 1968. The catchment area
of the river is about 35 km2 with an average inflow of about 3.9 Mm3 per annum.
This dam was designed to irrigate 300 ha in Kissonerga village. Except for
the main canal, the distribution system for this project has not yet been
constructed. This reservoir would yield about 2.0 Mm3 in an average year
(excluding estimated evaporation losses of 0.18 Mm3), but in a year of below



ANNEX 5
Page 3
average inflow the yield would be lower. Further, it is silting up at a rate
of over 20,000 m3 per year, which is higher than originally estimated, on ac-
count of the bank slides experienced since its completion. Therefore, this
reservoir does not constitute a reliable source of supply for its 300 ha and
it is proposed to integrate it with the Paphos Irrigation Project, so that
water from Asprokremmos reservoir could supplement its supplies, whenever
required.
9.        Existing Wells.  A large number of dug wells, with cross sections
varying from 1.8 m x 1 m to 1 m x 1 m and about 6 to 10 m deep and pumped by
5 to 8 horsepower pumps are scattered over the eastern area and tap the low-
yielding calcarenite aquifer that underlies the narrow coastal strip. These
wells, on an average, yield about 10 1/sec. The total net annual yield from
these wells is estimated as 3.6 Mm3 at source, which at 80% efficiency is
equivalent to 4.5 Mm3 at the head of the new distribution system. It is es-
timated that due to expansion of irrigation, a further 2.0 to 3.0 Mm3 could
be extracted from this aquifer, but this additional development has not been
included in the water balance, as it is unlikely that the farmers would invest
in such developments when project water supply becomes available.
10.       New Wellfields.  Under the project, three wellfields would be de-
veloped along the Dhiarrizos, the Xeropotamos and the Ezousa (Annex 4). The
total yield of these wellfields, prior to completion of Asprokremmos reservoir,
is estimated as 17.0 1Mm3 per year, which will reduce to 15.3 Mm3 after comple-
tion of the reservoir due to the abandonment of eight tubewells falling within
and downstream of the reservoir. Since the river gravel aquifers are fully
recharged by the surface flows every winter, the reliability of this source
would be high.
11.       Asprokremmos Reservoir.  Upstream of the damsite, the Xeropotamos
river drains approximately 227 km2. Although discharge measurements were
started in 1956, reliable data are not available in view of a braided river
course and the highly variable and flashy nature of the flow. Snythetic
runoff has, however, been calculated for the past 54 years from reliable
precipitation data through a computer program that analyzed the mathematical
model of the watershed representing the hydrologic cycle of precipitation,
evapotransspiration, direct surface runoff, groundwater recharge and delayed
surface runoff. The monthly flow at the damsite for the last 15 years (1957-
58 to 1971-72) is given in Table 2. On the basis of 54 years' data, the
average annual inflow is 41.5 Mm3, with a minimum of 2.7 Mm3 (1931-32 and
1971-72) and a maximum of 105.8 Mm3 (1968-69); the probability of an inflow
of 10.0 Mm3 to 73.0 Nm3 being 86%. The maximum annual upstream abstractions
from the river are about 2.5 Mm3 and the annual reservoir evaporation losses,
for average conditions, are assumed as 1.7 Mm3.
12.       A reservoir operation study was carried out for the past 5 years
with the following assumptions:
(a) first charge on the river flow would be the upstream abstrac-
tions, amounting to a maximum of 2.5 Mm3 (average 2.37 Mm3); and



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(b) the project demand would be met from the existing Mavrokolymbos
reservoir (maximum net yield in above average years 2.0 Mm3,
reducing to 1.0 Mm3 in below average years and 0.5 Mm3 in poor
years), the existing wells in calcarenite aquifer (yield 4.50
Mm3) and the project wellfields (yield limited to 9.0 Mm3); the
balance to be met by releases from the Asprokremmos reservoir.
The results of this study are summarized in Table 3. The reservoir would
function as a carry-over storage and about one-half of the storage volume
would be left unused at the end of each normal water year. This feature
provides security against years of drought. The study shows that if a good
year (inflow greater than about 60 Mm3, like 1968-69) is followed by two
consecutive years of very poor inflow (1970-71, 1971-72 with inflows of
11.0 and 2.7 Mm3), full project requirements could be met without any short-
ages. With lesser security for a second dry year, the reservoir capacity
could be reduced to about 35.0 Mm3, but the incremental cost in increasing
the dam's height to impound 51 Mm3 is rather small (about 15%) and is fully
justified.
13.       On the basis of flow data for the past 54 years, the bed and sus-
pended loads transported by the river flows at the damsite were estimated by
the consultants as 290,000 m3 per year. For the assumed project life of 50
years, sedimentation would reduce the reservoir capacity to about 36.5 Mm3.
This would still be enough to meet full project requirements when a year of
drought follows an average year, but would not fully meet the requirements
in the second drought year, should that follow the first. However, the
probability of occurrence of two consecutive dry years is low.
Sea Water Intrusion
14.       In the region of the project, the base of the gravel aquifers is
wholly below sea level and the base of the calcarenite aquifer is partly so.
Heavy pumpage in areas near the coast could cause local reversals of water
table gradients and consequent movement of saline water into the aquifers.
The water table in the region slopes towards the sea at a gradient varying
from 1 to 2%. During the pre-dam period (1975-78), the irrigation supplies
would be provided by the existing wells in the calcarenite aquifer and the
tubewells in gravel aquifers. The annual extraction from the calcarenite
aquil±- would be about 3.6 1Mm3, wihich is the same as that being extracted
now without any evidence of sea water intrusion. The maximum annual extrac-
tion from the tubewells would be about 10 Mm3 in the ore-dam period and about
9.0 Mm3 in the post-dam period, against the maximum estimated safe yield of
about 17.0 Mm3 and 15.3 Mm3 respectively. The pumpage from the gravel aquifers
would be limited to 16 hours per day and during the post-dam period to only
six months in the year. Under these circumstances, there would be no danger
of seawater intrusion in the two squifers. However, the wells near the
coastline would be continuously monitored by WDD to detect any local intrusion.

Water Quality
15.       Groundwater.  Groundwater from the gravel aquifers of the Dhiarrizos
and the Xeropotamos rivers is of high salinity (total dissolved solids (TDS)
620 to 780 ppm) and low sodium hazard (sodium absorption ratio (SAR) 1.3 to
2.2) and according to U.S. Salinity Laboratory Classification belongs to
C3-S1 class. The Ezousa river groundwater is of high to very high salinity
(TDS 620 to 2,000 ppm) and low sodium hazard (SAR 1.3 to 2.1) and belongs to
C3-S1 and C4-S1 classes. The boron concentration in the groundwater of the
three rivers is low (0.06 to 0.23 ppm), and from the standpoint of boron
hazard, this water belongs to Class I. The high salinity in the Ezousa
aquifer is due mainly to high concentrations of calcium sulphate (gypsum)
(6-18 milliequivalent per liter). The Ezousa river groundwater would be
mixed in the canal with the groundwater from the two other aquifers and
the surface water from Asprokremmos reservoir and the water as a whole would
be of medium salinity and suitable for irrigating all proposed crops. The
calcium sulphate would have no harmful effects on the crops or soils of the
project area. The only adverse effect could be the gradual clogging of tube-
well screens and sprinklers and tricklers, which would be avoided by mixing
Ezousa water with water from other sources.
16.       The groundwater from the calcarenite wells is of high to vary high
salinity (TDS 730 to 2,800 ppm) and low to medium sodium hazard (SAR 1.0 to
9.0), and belongs to C3-S1, C4-S1, C3-S2 and C4-S2 classes. Boron concentra-
tions are medium to high (0.20 to 1.02 ppm) and make this water unsuitable
for irrigating citrus. However, it could be used for other crops, but with
proper care.
17.       Surface Water.  Surface water would be used from two sources:
(a)  Asprokremmos reservoir on the Xeropotamos river, and
(b) the existing Mavrokolymbos reservoir.
The Xeropotamos river surface water is of medium salinity (TDS 310 to 625
ppm) and low sodium hazard (SAR 0.4 to 3.9), and belongs to C2-S1 class.
The Mavrokolymbos river surface water is of high salinity (TDS 465 to 700
ppm) and low sodium hazard (SAR 1.5), and belongs to the C3-S1 class. On
the whole, the surface waters are suitable for irrigating all crops in the
project area.
Water Rights
18.       According to the existing laws, all unused surface water and all
groundwater, except from wells registered before 1928, vests in Government.
Present users of seasonal surface (spate) waters within the project area
would, after the project, receive assured perennial supplies, which would
more than compensate them for the loss of a free source. None of the pres-
ent extractors of groundwater from the river aquifers appears to own water



ANNEX 5
Page 6
rights predating 1928, except the Mandria village, which receives an esti-
mated 1.9 Mn3 from a gallery ('karez') located upstream of the proposed dam
on the Xeropotamos. At present this water is wastefully used for irrigating
mainly cereal and fodder crops. After the construction of the dam, this free
source of supply would be lost to the village, and Government would have to
compensate the village either in cash or by a reduced water charge for the
project water supply.

PAPHOS IRRIGATION PROJECT
Organization, Consultants and Construction of Works
Organization
1.        The Paphos Irrigation Project would be implemented mainly by the
Water Development Department (WDD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources. The on-farm works would be designed and their construction super-
vised by the Water Use Section of the Agriculture Department. In addition,
this department would cooperate in providing agricultural research and exten-
sion services, both after construction is completed and during the construction
period, when irrigation would be developed on a part of the project area.
Other Government departments involved in the project are the Geological Sur-
vey Department (wellfields), Lands and Surveys Department (land acquisition
and consolidation), Cooperative Development Department (credit and marketing),
Finance Department (budgeting) and the Planning Bureau.
2.        Project Policy and Coordination Committee.  In order to coordinate
the activities of concerned departments at the highest executive level and to
lay down policies that would ensure a timely completion of the project, a high
level committee, to be called the Project Policy and Coordination Committee
(PPCC), would be set up under the chairmanship of the Minister of Agricul-
ture and Natural Resources, and the members of this committee would be the
Directors General of the Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
Finance, Commerce and Industry, Interior and Planning Bureau and Commis-
sioners - Cooperative Development Departments. In view of the existing
communal situation in Cyprus, a representative of the Turkish Community
and the Commissioner of Turkish Cooperatives would also be members of PPCC.
The Resident Representative of UNDP in Cyprus (as agreed with UNDP Headquar-
ters) would also be a member, in order to influence harmonious working be-
tween the two communities. The Director of WDD would be the Secretary of
PPCC.
3.        PPCC would lay down the policies to be followed by the project im-
plementing agencies. These would include but not limited to the following:
(a) land acquisition for project works;
(b) compensation for land and property acquisition, including
compensating eligible landowners displaced by construction
of Asprokremmos dam with Government land in project area;
(c) resettlement of persons displaced by construction of dam;
(d) agricultural supporting services;



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(e) charges to be paid to Electricity Authority of Cyprus for
use of power by project works;
(f) recovery of project charges;
(g) medium- and short-term credit to project area farmers; and
(h) coordination among various concerned agencies.
PPCC would also accord approvals to the following:
(a) annual work programs of the concerned agencies dealing with
project works;
(b) staff requirement, chargeable to the project, for concerned
agencies; and
(c) requirement of funds needed by these agencies for project
works.
In addition, PPCC would review the progress of construction and progress of
land consolidation efforts in the project area.
4.        Civil Works.  Planning, design and construction of Asprokremmos
dam, the wellfields and the irrigation network would be the responsibility
of WDD, which is headed by a Director. In WDD, the project activities would
be supervised by a Project Manager, who would report to the Director and would
be an expatriate so that he can have unhampered access to the Turkish areas.
The Project Manager would be assisted by two deputies - the District Agri-
cultural Officer (a Greek) and a senior engineer (a Turk). A consulting firm
would be engaged to assist in the design and construction supervision of the
dam and the irrigation network. Design and construction supervision of the
canal would be carried out by WDD, which would also construct the wellfields
with the assistance of the Geological Survey Department. The distribution
networks would be designed by the firm, but their construction would be
supervised by WDD. Construction of farm roads and buildings would also
be supervised by WDD.
5.        On-Farm Development.  The on-farm irrigation system for each farm
would be designed by the Water Use Section of the Agriculture Department and
would be constructed under its supervision. The on-farm equipment would be
standardized and would be procured by the farmers with or without medium-
term credit.  Land planing would be carried out by the farmers either directly
or through contractors , also under the supervision of the Agriculture Department,
which would also assist the farmers in the design of greenhouses, plastic tunnels
and trellises.
Agricultural Research and Extension.  The Agriculture Department
would be responsible for carrying out necessary research and for providing
extension services to the farmers in the project area, both during and after
the project construction period. The district agricultural staff, under the



ANNEX 10
Page 3
District Officer, would become a part of the project organization, and would
continue to be technically guided by the Director of the Agriculture Depart-
ment.
7.        Project Organization.  The complete project organization, including
the concerned committees with their composition, is illustrated in Chart 7916.
Consultants
8.        Consulting Firm.  Cyprus has no experience of either designing and
constructing a dam as large as Asprokremmos or designing and constructing a
large sprinkler irrigation network. Therefore, an experienced consulting
firm well acquainted with such works would be retained to assist WDD in proj-
ect implementation. The consulting firm would be fully responsible for the
design and construction supervision of the dam and the irrigation network.
Local engineers and other technical staff would be seconded to work with
the consulting firm to gain experience. WDD is competent and has the neces-
sary experience to design and supervise construction of the canal and, with
assistance from the Geological Survey Department, the wellfields. The con-
sulting firm, therefore, would not be involved in design and construction of
the main canal and wellfields, except when WDD needs some special advice.
Proposed terms of reference for the consulting firm are summarized hereunder:
(a) Asprokremmos Dam
(i)  carry out additional investigations and tests neces-
sary to prepare detailed designs. These include in
situ density and grain size profile in the river bed,
permeability of the faults and the surrounding dis-
turbed rocks by inclined holes, strength of chalk under
saturated conditions for rock anchors, etc;
(ii) review feasibility designs prepared by previous consul-
tant and prepare detailed designs and drawings for con-
struction with such additions and modifications as neces-
sary. Special attention will be paid to the selection
and design of cut-off, grout curtains and outlet works;
(iii) evaluate contractors for prequalification;
(iv) prepare technical specifications and contract documents;
(v)  evaluate bids, make recommendations for award and administer
the construction contract after award;
(vi) prepare construction drawings;
(vii) check layout of works, approve contractor's work scheduie.-.
verify work performed each month and certify payments due;



ANNEX 1 0
Page 4
(viii) study and prepare reservoir operating rules;
(ix)  study and interpret all instrumentation data and prepare
instrumentation observation rules; and
(x) prepare instructions for maintenance of works and train
local staff for all 0 and M functions.
(b) Irrigation System
(i) prepare detailed designs for main conveyor system in-
cluding reservoirs and pumping stations but excluding
the canal and wellfields;
(ii)  prepare detailed designs for wellfield conveyors and the
pipeline extending eastward from the canal to feed Kouklia
irrigation unit;
(iii) prepare detailed designs for on-demand sprinkler irrigation
networks for all irrigation units of the project area up to
farm outlets, including the design of all secondary and
booster pumping stations and balancing reservoirs, etc;
(iv)  prepare technical specifications and contract documents
for the main contract for irrigation works, which would
include construction of terminal reservoir at the tail
end of the canal, main pumping station and balancing
reservoir, main pipeline extending westward, pipeline
extending eastward from the canal and all secondary and
booster pumping stations on the distribution networks;
(v) prepare technical specifications and contract documents
for the supply of asbestos cement pipe and fittings re-
required for the distribution networks and wellfield
conveyors;
(vi)  assist WfD in design of tubewells, as requested, and pre-
pare specifications and contract documents for supply of
casing and screen pipe and turbine pumps for tubewells;
(vii) evaluate qualifications of contractors and suppliers for
above contracts (items (iv), (v) and (vi));
(viii) evaluate bids and make recommendations for award of above
contracts, and administer these contracts after their
award;
(ix)  check layout of works, approve contractor's work schedules,
verify work performed each month and certify payments due
for the main contract (item (iv));



ANNEX 1 0
Page 5
(x) verify deliveries under supply contracts (items (v) and
(vi)), and certify payments due;
(xi) coordinate the irrigation system design with the design
of canal and wellfields, to be carried out by WDD;
(xii) coordinate the construction of irrigation system includ-
ing pumping plants with the construction of wellfields
and distribution networks, which will be carried out or
supervised by WDD;
(xiii)  review the study to be completed by WDD not later than
December 31, 1977 on the regulation of project water
sources; and
(xiv) prepare instructions for operation and maintenance of all
pumping stations and the completed irrigation network and
train local staff in these functions.
9.        The consulting firm would prepare quarterly and annual progress re-
ports, as directed, for WDD.
10.       The consulting firm would appoint an experienced and senior engineer
to head its project team. Other experienced engineers and experts would be
employed by the firm, as necessary, in accordance with work requirements.
The proposed manpower requirement for the firm is given in Table 1. As neces-
sary, local engineers would be seconded by WDD to work with the consulting firm
and to receive in-service training on the design, construction supervision,
and operation and maintenance of project works.
11.       Consultants for Extension and Marketing.  Three experts for a total
of three man-years would be employed during 1975 to 1978 to organize the ex-
tension service in the project area and to train the existing extension staff.
One would be a specialist in the field of sprinkler irrigation, while the other
two would be specialists in growing of early vegetables under greenhouses and
plastic tunnels and marketing of such crops. Additional local staff, which
would be trained by these experts in the project development period, would
supplement the existing extension staff. In addition, a number of local
qualified personnel would be given overseas training in project-related
fields.
Construction of Works
12.       Wellfields.  Casing, screen pipes and the turbine pumps for the
tubewells would be procured by international competitive bidding and the
tubewells would be installed by WDD, using the existing drilling rigs, with
assistance from the Geological Survey Department. The conveyance pipelines
would be laid by contractors after local competitive bidding.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 6
13.       Asprokremmos Dam.  A single contract for the construction of the
dam and ancillary works would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding among prequalified contracting firms. The criteria for
prequalification would include contractors' experience and capability to
carry out works of this magnitude, construction of slurry trench or cast
in situ plastic concrete diaphragm, tunnel excavation and concreting,
drilling and grouting.
14.       Conveyance and Distribution System.  The canal would be constructed
under a single contract after local competitive bidding.  The terminal reservoir,
the balancing reservoir, the main pipeline and its eastward extension, the main
pumping plant and all pumping stations of the distribution system would be
grouped into one contract, which would be awarded after international competi-
tive bidding among prequalified contracting firms. The asbestos cement pipe
and fittings for the whole system, except that required for the main contract,
would be procured by international competitive bidding under one or more sup-
ply contracts. The distribution networks for all irrigation units would be
laid by local contractors engaged through local competitive bidding.
15.       Farm Roads, Buildings and On-Farm Works.  The farm roads and build-
ings would be constructed through local contractors after competitive bidding.
The on-farm pipes, fittings and sprinklers would be procured by the farmers
from the local market and would be installed by them, either through local
contractors or by direct labor, under the supervision of the Water Use Section
of the Agriculture Department.

Farm Budgets, Project Charges and Farmers' Income
Farm Budgets
1.        Farm budgets have been prepared for the following typical farm
models:
(a) owner-operated farm of 1 ha, of which 0.5 ha is assumed to be
leased from others (Table 5);
(b) owner-operated farm of 4 ha, of which 2 ha is assumed to be
leased from others (Table 6);
(c) owner-operated farm of 8 ha (Table 7); and
(d) tenant-operated farm of 2.5 ha (Table 8).
These farm models contain a varying percentage of area under rainfed cultiva-
tion under without the project (32% to 81%) and with the project (12-1/2% to
30%) conditions. Production costs, without the project (Table 1), consist of
annual costs, cost of land lease and interest on working capital, which has
been assumed as 10% per annum for a period of 12 months for perennial and six
months for vegetable crops. Production costs, with the project (Table 2),
consist of annual costs, establishment cost of orchards, cost of water (proj-
ect charge), cost of land lease and interest on working capital. The annual
costs (Table 3), include cost of all inputs including family and hired labor.
The establishment cost of orchards (Table 4), takes into account cost of
plantation of citrus, grape and banana plants and their maintenance during
pre-fruit-yielding years. These costs include cost of on-farm equipment and
water, and have been annualized over the life of plants assumed as 40 years
for citrus, 20 years for grape and 6 years for banana. Cost of equipment has
been annualized over 26 years, which is the weighted average life of all equip-
ment. Parmgate prices are given in Annex 12, Table 2.
Project Charges
2.        The total investment cost (including replacement costs) is proposed
to be recovered over the project life of 50 years at 4% per annum interest.
On this basis, the project charge would be 25 mils (LC 0.025) per m3 of water
used. In case Government decided to grant 1.5 Mm3 of water to Mandria village
free of cost in lieu of their existing water right, the project charge would
increase to 26.4 mils. For the purpose of farm budgets, a project charge of
25 mils has been assumed. On this basis, the project charge would amount to
20% (1 ha farm), 25% (4 ha farm), 24% (8 ha farm) and 29% (2.5 ha leased farm)
respectively of the incremental income of these farms prior to payment of the
project charge.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
Farmers' Income
3.        The farmers' net incremental income, after payment of project charges,
would be 404% (1 ha farm), 547% (4 ha farm), 375% (8 ha farm) and 120% (2.5
ha leased farm) of their respective without project income. The income for
the leased farm is low as only short-term crops have been assumed to be cul-
tivated.  In case long-term crops (citrus, grapes) are assumed, after long-
term leases become effective, the income from leased farms would further
increase.

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1.        The economic rate of return of the project, costing family labor
at EC 1.50 per day and hired labor at the market rate of IC 1.75 per day,
would be 19%.  A breakdown of investment cost, and operation, maintenance
and replacement costs as well as total and net benefits over the project
lifetime of 50 years (1973-2023) is presented in Table 1. The bases of
annual production costs are given in Tables 1 to 4 of Annex 11, while the
prices used to evaluate benefits are given in Table 2. Pattern of develop-
ment of various project crops is presented in Table 3. Major assumptions
and bases employed in estimating the initial economic rate of return in-
clude:
(a)  economic life of tubewells would be 30 years and of all other
project works 50 years. Economic life of various equipment
would be as below, after which replacement would be necessary:
(i)  on-farm plastic portable pipe                  - 10 years
(ii) on-farm aluminum pipe, valves and
sprinkler equipment                            - 15 years
(iii)  tubewells pumps                                - 20 years
(iv)  pumps for irrigation network                   - 20 years
(v)  valves and outlets of irrigation network       - 25 years
(vi)  electrical and mechanical equipment of dams  - 25 years
(b)  investment costs, exclude cost of land acquisition and price
contingencies but include cost of existing Mavrokolymbos dam,
being incorporated in the project, in 1973 value;
(c)  value of production foregone due to acquisition of land for
the project works has been taken into account by reducing
net benefits accordingly from 1979 onwards;
(d)  full development would be achieved in 1986 and development
pattern of various crops would be as in Table 3;
(e)  production inputs costed at current prices; and

(f) prices of citrus and table grapes were reduced by 10% and
20% respectively from average farmgate prices to ensure
competitiveness in West European markets, and prices of
vegetables and cereals were in line with world market
prices.
2.        The results of sensitivity tests are summarized below:
Assumption                               Economic Rate of Re$p
(a)  Initial run                                         19.0%
(b)  Project costs increased by 10%                      17.5%
(c)  Output prices decreased by 20%                      14.3%
(d)  Crop yields decreased by 10%                        17.4%
(e)  Development period extended by one year             16.7%
(f)  Combination of reduction in output prices           12.7%
by 20% (c) and extension in development
period by one year (e)
