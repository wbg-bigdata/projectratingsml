                               RESTRUCTING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      Following the GoA formal request of May 16, 2012, this paper is for a Level II of
the Albania Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP) restructuring to accommodate
the following proposed changes: (i) reallocation of credit proceeds (unused funds) to
finance an additional priority section of the Albania Secondary and Local Road Network,
and (ii) a 6 month extension of the closing date until June 30, 2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Albania SLRP is being implemented satisfactorily and is achieving its Project
Development Objective. Components 1 and 2, i.e., Improvement and Rehabilitation of
Regional Local Roads, include works at 11 road sections which are substantially
completed, including five of them handed-over to the regional authorities and the
remaining to follow, once they complete their defect liability period. The outstanding
works include replacement of two small bridges and the restoration/conservation of the
historic bridge in Velabisht. In parallel, the project Component 3 is reflecting the
progress of Components 1 and 2, in financing the Supervision or Works and Institutional
Support to Albanian Development Fund (Implementing Agency). As of October 2012,
the project has disbursed 86.4 % of the Credit proceeds (10.54 million in Special
Drawings Rights), and all year five project monitoring indicators have been met. The
SLRP total cost of US$ 40 million at the time of appraisal, is co-financed by IDA (SDR
12.2 million), OPEC Fund (US$ 15 million), and the Government of Albania (US$ 5
million).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

3.      On May 16, 2012, in a letter signed by the Minister of Finance, the Government
of Albania requested to: (i) reallocate IDA Credit proceeds from the Goods, Consultants’
Services and Institutional Support category to the Works category, in order to use some
of the remaining funds for the improvement and rehabilitation of an additional local road
section, and (ii) extend the project closing date to allow for the procurement and
execution of all road works.

      Financing

4.      The overall project cost will remain the same. The only adjustment will be a
reallocation of SDR 456,000.95 (about US$ 0.7 million equivalent) from Component 3
(Category 1 in FA), i.e.: Goods, Services and Institutional Support, to Component 1 and 2
(Category 2 in the Financing Agreement), i.e.: Improvement and Rehabilitation of
Regional and Local Roads, as reflected in the tables below:

       Closing date

7.    Taking into consideration the time needed to procure and implement the related
road works of the proposed additional section of Secondary and Local Road Network, the
Government of Albania requested a 6 months extension of the original closing date from
December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

       Implementation schedule

8.     The Implementation Schedule would be extended for a 6 months period, to reflect
the additional time of procuring and executing the new road works.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

       Economic and financial analysis

9.     Defining of the priority level for proposed road section, Dajc – Dragushe (in
Shkoder region) was based on the predefined selection criteria, including:
       CRITERION                                   VALUE
    - Area poverty levels                          Low
    - Potentials for economic development          Medium
    - Road importance for the communities          High
    - Provision of access to social services       Low
    - All weather transitability                   Medium
    - Road functional level                        Low
    -
10.    A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) was prepared of the proposed road improvement
works for the candidate section, using the Road Economic Decision (RED) model. The
economic analysis was undertaken by comparing the net economic benefit from the

                                              6
proposed intervention in the specific section, against a “do-nothing? scenario. The net
present value (NPV), in US$ million at 12% discount rate, is 0.081, and the Economic
Rate of Return is 14%, confirming the viability and suitability of the proposed road
section.

      Technical

11.    The estimated cost of works (subject of further detailing), at about US$ 700,000
equivalent, includes pavement works and off-carriageway works such as shoulders and
footpaths, drainages, safety devices and road marking. The design and construction
standard will not change, using the interim-standards and cross-sections agreed with, and
adopted by, ADF at the time of appraisal. The detailed designs and bidding
documents/technical specifications, for Dajc – Dragushe (Shkoder Region) road section,
are under preparation, and will be subject of bank review and clearance.

      Social

12.     A resettlement policy framework (RPF) has been prepared at the time of the
project appraisal, setting out policies that apply to the project, in accordance with OP4.12
and national standards. The works of the proposed section will be within the existing
ROW. However, the ADF will follow the RPF requirements to prepare a site-specific
RAP, in cases that widening of the road in certain locations affects encroachers or
squatters, and provide compensation for the value of assets lost, and/or assistance as
deemed necessary, to restore their living standards to levels prevailing prior to the
improvement of this specific section.

      Environment

13.     The SLR Project is a Category A project, with an Environmental Safeguards
Framework (ESF) in place, that was prepared and disclosed with public consultations
prior to the Appraisal of the Project. The ESF has been fully implemented by ADF on the
completed works and there have been no environmental issues that were left unmitigated.
The ESF continues to be in place, as it includes provisions for all OP 4.01 categories of
projects (A, B or C). The due diligence documentation to be prepared for the additional
road section will follow the procedure outlined in the ESF in order to satisfy both,
Albanian and World Bank environmental requirements.

14.      Since the works of the proposed road section are not expected to cause any major
impacts on environment, during execution and after their completion, ADF will follow
the three-steps screening and ensuring that the ESF-defined procedure is followed:
    (i)     Submit the request to the Albania Regional Environmental Agency on the
            specific process to be followed and category under which fall these works,
            matching the later with the Bank requirements (Category A - Profound EIA,
            or Category B - Summary EIA
    (ii)    Proceed accordingly with the preparation of EA documentation, and submit to
            REA the EA documentation, including the EMP, and application for the
            environmental permission. The REA would, subsequently, issue

                                             7
           environmental consent, with any environmental conditions, monitoring
           requirements, etc.
   (iii)   ADF will forward a copy of all environmental documentation and
           environmental consent for the Bank review, and no objection, before
           continuing with the completion of the detailed designs and application for the
           construction permit.

15.    Finally, the ADF will organize public consultations, for this particular section,
discuss the draft EMP with the respective communities and incorporate their views in the
final EMP. The ADF will translate and disclose the generic EMP for this project, and
observe and monitor the whole process, accordingly, including the EMP implementation.
