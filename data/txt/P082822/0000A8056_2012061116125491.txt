                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved its key objectives by providing access to medium term finance to 733 SMEs so far under the original loan and the two additional finance loans. In total, US
                         $657.7 million equivalent has been approved to SMEs for both working capital and investment purposes. Access to continued medium term finance helped ensure the

                         disbursement went to underserved areas such as the North, East, South East and the Central part. Most of the SMEs that have utilized the funds from the project came from textile
