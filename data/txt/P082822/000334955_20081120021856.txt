I.INTRODUCTION

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an
additional loan in an amount of US$ 200 million equivalent (US$60 million and  109.1
million) to Halkbank guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey for the Access to Finance for
SmallandMediumEnterprises Project, which is being successfully implemented.

2.       The Access to Finance for SMEs project, a financial intermediation loan (FIL) in
Turkey, is implementedby two borrowers: Halkbank and Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi
(TSKB), each supported by a loan of 100 million equivalent Additional financing is
sought only for Halkbank and not for TSKB; reason being that Halkbank has already
completed disbursement of its loan funds to sub-borrowers whereas TSKB has disbursed
about halfof its funds thus far.

3.       The Access to Finance for SMEs project has proven effective in achieving its
objectives by providing financing to 178 small and medium firms so far. The loans are
well dispersed both sectorally and geographically. SMEs representing more than twenty
sectors from varied areas such as printing, plastic processing, solar energy, tourism and
food processinghave utilized funds from the project. The geographicalcoverage extends to
most parts of Turkey with an emphasis on underservedareas such as the North, East, South
East and the Center. The loans have also led to creating more than 3,200 jobs. The
additional financing for Halkbank will enable further expansion of the sectors covered and
broaden the coverage of the project thus enhancing the impact by improving access to
finance for SMEs.

11. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING

Project Background
4.       The existing Access to Finance for SME project is supported by a loan in an
amount of 100 million for TSKB (Loan 7390-TU) and a loan inamount of 100 million
to Halkbank (Loan 7389/7462-TU). The project was approved by the Board in June 2007
andthe loans became effective inJuly 2007l.

Macroeconomic Background

5.       Having performed relatively well through the summer of 2008 against a headwind
of adverse global developments and domestic political uncertainty, Turkey now faces
much lower growth and substantial downside risks as a result of the ongoing full- global
economic and financial crisis.



1The project was originally structuredwith support oftwo loans --lo0 million ( 60 millionand $48.1
million) for TSKB, and -450 millionfor Halkbank, and such was approvedby the Board inJune 2006. Prior
to signing, the banks have requestedcertainchangesto the project and Halkbank has requestedan increase of
the loanamountto 100, so the project was re-submittedto the Board inJune 2007.


                                                    3

6.       Global developments have already affected Turkish markets adversely, in line with
other emerging markets. Spreads on Turkish sovereign bonds have widened from lows in
the 170-180bps range inmid-2007 to 530 basis points as of November 6, 2008. Figure 4
illustrates how Turkish sovereign spreads have approximately tracked the EMBI+ average
of emerging markets: as of November 6, the Turkish EMBI spread was 82 basis points
lower than the EMBI+. On other indicators Turkey has also been affected in line with
emerging marketsas a class. Between end-2007 andNovember 6,2008, the IstanbulStock
Exchange declined by 51 percent, in comparison with 42 percent in Sao Paulo, 67 percent
in Shanghai, and 68 percent in Moscow. Over the same period the Turkish lira has
depreciatedby 31percent against the U S dollar.

7.       Economic growth has begun to show the effects of declining investor confidence
and scarcer finance. September industrial production was 5.5 percent lower than one year
earlier and low growth i s expected to continue into the fourth quarter, possibly mitigated
by the relatively stronger performance of the agricultural sector than in2007, when Turkey
suffered a major drought.

8.       Bank staffs growth forecast for Turkey in2009 has now been revised to around 2
percent, with the possibility o f a significant economic downturn. Furthermore, economic
activity is subject to a high degree of risk given global uncertainty. The main question
facing Turkey i s whether capital inflows can be maintained to avoid a disorderly
unwinding of foreign exchange exposure, which lies mostly in the corporate sector. Were
this to occur, the key mitigationmeasures would be the rapid adoption of financial-sector
measures to protect liquidity and confidence in the banking sector plus fiscal measures to
protect private-sector access to limited domestic credit and limit the impact on economic
activity and employment.

9.       Analysis by Bank staff indicates the wide range of scenarios that are possible for
2009. The main driver of the growth rate i s the external adjustment required by assuming
different rollover ratios on existing external debt amortizations. Current market reports
suggest that corporations expect to roll over a large bulk of remaining 2008 amortizations.
Nonetheless, further shocks to global liquidity could lower this ratio significantly in the
near term, and this potential variability was capturedinthe simulations runby staff. These
scenarios would involve varying adjustments to asset allocations (e.g.,             reserve
accumulation, public versus private debt issuance, and household holdings of foreign
exchange), the exchange rate, inflation, andnominal and real interest rates.

10.      Inthe assessment of Bank staff, the bulk of the probability lies with the Turkish
economy maintaining modestly positive, though much reduced, GDP growth through
2009-reflecting   the underlying strengths in Turkey's financial sector (see below), spot
and forward market trends to date, and provided macroeconomic policies remain strong.
Nonetheless, the high degree of uncertainty facing emerging markets in general, combined
with Turkey's external financing needs, imply that government preparedness to respond
rapidly to a worsening environment is key to risk mitigation.

11.      The government is aware of the extent of downside risk to the Turkisheconomy in
the near term and has prepareda series of measures inresponse. At the institutional level,


                                               4

the government intends to make use o f the Economic Coordination Board to enable swift
decision-making ifneeded inresponse to rapidly evolving circumstances.

12.     In the financial sector, a number of measures have already been taken or
announced, including encouraging banks to retain profits, smoothing liquidity pressures in
the   foreign   exchange    interbank transactions    through CBRT's     intermediation in
the "FX deposit    " market, and increasing banks' FX transaction limits. In addition to
this, it is already announced that CBRT may also enhance FX liquidity by further
increasing   the    limits of banks for        foreign   exchange     deposit    transactions,
reducing FX borrowing rates that banks can borrow directly from the CBRT, extending
the maturity o f FX deposit transactions, decreasing required reserve ratios, and extending
the maturity o f rep0 funding.

13.     Fiscal policy     remains   overall   consistent  with debt sustainability and
macroeconomic stability, but has become more accommodative in recent months. InMay
2008, as part o f the preparation o f Turkey's medium-termfiscal framework (MTFF), the
authorities revised the target for the primary fiscal surplus o f the total public sector for
2008 to 3.5 percent o f GDP (from 4.2 percent o f GDP) and set the 2009 target at 3.0
percent o f GDP. The authorities now forecast a primary budget balance o f 2.7 percent o f
GDP in2008. At the same time, the expected central government's overall deficit, forecast
at about 1.4 percent o f GDP (versus the target of 2.0 percent), will lead to a further fall in
the public debt-to-GDP ratio in2008 (to below 40 percent from 41.5 percent in2007). In
the 2009 budget submitted to parliament, the authorities have kept the public sector
primary budget surplus target at 3 percent, consistent with the MTFF. However, revenue
raising measures or expenditure reductions are expected to become important for Turkeyto
reach this target, and building sufficient flexibility into public spending will be key to
reducing the crowding out o f private-sector access to domestic finance in downside
scenarios. One o f the main measures i s to link spending to revenues in light o f downside
riskto growth andrevenue projections. Furthermeasures aimto reduce the contribution o f
municipalities to the overall public-sector borrowing requirement, including a claw-back
mechanism on transfers from central government.

14.         Public debt has been brought downto manageable levels, with limitedvulnerability
of gross debt to exchange rate risk, and is sustainable. Analysis carried out by Bank staff
indicates that, even under severe stress testing, public debt remains on a stable or
downward-sloping trajectory (see Table 1and Figure 1).

15.         External debt has risen slightly since 2005 (see Figure 1.2). The external debt-to-
GDP ratio declined considerably between 2001 and 2005 but has since increased, driven
by corporate-sector external borrowing. Assuming the continued availability of credit on
external markets, Turkey's gross external debt ratio would increase gradually in the near
term, mainly reflecting continuing current account deficits, now assumed to be of the order
of 4 percent o f GDP given recent falls in oil prices. Gross external financing needs in
2008-12 are projected to increase as private-sector non-bank amortizations increase, and
corporate external borrowing are expected to continue to be the main driver of increasing
external debt ratios (Figure 1.2). A sharp depreciation or a fall in non-debt creating


                                                                6

inflows would place the external debt ratio on a steeper upward path.                  Still, the
composition of external debt has improved, with the share o f short-term debt outstanding
in gross external debt declining to about 16 percent as o f mid-2008 (as o f October 2008,
the private sector accounted for almost 90 percent of short-term external debt).

16.     External debt sustainability depends in the longer term on reducing the current
account deficit. In the longer term, reducing the current account deficit by increasing
aggregate saving-both through strong fiscal policy and through improvements inthe trade
balance -will be necessary to limit the growth o f external debt. The recent fall inthe price
o f oil provides some relief to the current account deficit in the short time: a rise/fall o f
US$10 inthe price o f a barrel o f oil i s estimated to imply a rise/fall by about 0.5 percent o f
GDP inTurkey's current account deficit. Inthe long term, improved energy efficiency and
the further diversification o f energy sources will be important to help reduce the country's
external energy dependence. (Turkey's energy sector reform program, with planned
support by the Bank's upcoming programmatic energy development policy lending, aims
to improveenergy efficiency and security.)

17.     In the short term, while Turkey's total external debt position should remain with
high likelihood at levels consistent with long-term sustainability, rapid currency
movements create the risk o f rapidly increasing external debt ratios. Furthermore, a capital
reversal could both disrupt trade finance and force many firms to turn to scarce domestic
sources for longer-term finance, hurting growth and employment, and highlighting the
need for the government to avoid raising bond finance for additional deficit spending in
downside scenarios.

18.           In conclusion, Turkey faces considerable macroeconomic risks in the near
term, particularly to its corporate sector's ability to maintain investment and growth in
difficult global conditions. But deep structural progress since 2001 and continued strong
economic management should allow the country to weather most external shocks. The
main risk is o f further tightening international liquidity starving emerging markets o f
capital and worsening investor sentiment, leading to an abrupt capital outflow and a
significant economic downturn. Were this to happen, stronger balance sheets inthe public
and financial sectors should help Turkey avoid a systemic crisis, but growth and
employment inthe non-bankingprivate sector would suffer. Key to mitigating this risk i s
preparedness on the part o f the government for downside external financing scenarios.
Banking Sector Background
19.     Turkey's banking sector i s substantially more resilient than before the 2001 crisis
and is in a better liquidity position than banking sectors in many other countries in the
Region. Despite the recent credit expansion, the overall capital adequacy ratio for the
sector, at 17 percent, is well above the regulatory minimum o f 8 percent (Table 1.1).
Return on equity and assets in excess o f 20 and 3 percent, respectively, point to strong
profitability for a sector with solid growth. Asset quality remains good with relatively low
non-performing loans (NPL) at 3.01 percent (Oct. 2008) and high provisioning levels at
87.3 percent (Oct. 2008). Government securities still account for about a third of banks'
total assets.

20.          The banking sector is less exposed to shifts in global sentiment today than several
years ago, while exposure to foreign capital outflows in the non-banking sector is more
pronounced. Capital inflows have mostly come through the government securities market,
investments in the ISE, and more recently directly to the corporate sector (Figure 1.3).
While forty percent of the banking sector's liabilities are in foreign currency, they mainly
stem from domestically collected deposits rather than direct borrowing from abroad. This
modest reliance on foreign borrowingprovides a measureof resilience against areversal of
capital flows. The banking system's net foreign currency position i s now almost in
balance, amounting to about half a percent of capital. Moreover, the banking sector itself
provides the market with more detailed information about on- and off-balance balance
sheet currency positions. There i s market recognition that, contrary to 2001, counterparties
holding a share of the sector's exchange rate risk are more reputable and financially
stronger. A possible shift in investor sentiment would affect the banking sector only
indirectly through a possible deterioration in the banks' loan portfolio and, to a lesser
degree, marked-to-market lossesintheir securities' holdings.

21.         More than 50 percent of banking sector assets is now held by banks with some
degree foreign ownership, and the state remains in control of banks holding more than
third of banking sector assets (Figure 1.4). The new ownership structure is leading to a
more competitive industry, with enhanced transparency and reduced scope for lending to

22.       Domestic bank credit has grown at a good pace since the 2001 crisis, but it has
grown from a small base and, at a modest 29 percent o f GDP, is still well below that o f
similar income level countries (Figure 1S). Also, much o f the recent credit expansion has
beento consumers as opposed to firms. Moreover, involume terms about half o f the credit
expansion has been to consumers rather than to firms, and consumer credit has changed
from being a marginal to a main line o f bankingbusiness2(Figure 1.6).

SMEAccess to CreditBackground
23.       The SME sector remains underserved interms o f credit, and it will be up to Turkish
financial institutions to provide credit to SMEs. As mentioned above, the corporate sector
has benefitted from increased direct borrowing from abroad inthe amount o f 15 percent o f
GDP as an alternative to domestic bank financing. However, as with capital market
funding, this is not an alternative for smaller businesses, and it remains up to the domestic
financial sector to serve this segment.

24.       Evidence has shown that smaller
firms and firms outside the major urban                              ,Figure 1.7: Share of Firms with Loans

areas have less access to credit.            As it is         70


often the case, smaller firms use credit less                 60

frequently than larger ones.             In addition,         50

regardless o f firm size, firms in major cities             E840
are more likely to have a loan than others                  a 30
are. Even when grouping firms by size, it                     20
remains true that firms in cities with
populations o f one million or more have                      10


loans more frequently than do firms in                         0
                                                                          Small                 Medium              Large

2It is recognized that the distinction between small business andconsumer credit is not so clear, because
business owners will often use personal loans to finance their commercial activities. However, even with this
possible bias, the point remains valid that muchofthe credit has gone to finance consumption.


                                                      9

bias may therefore reflect a physical barrier to accessing loans for the firms outside the
cities.

Rationalefor Bank Involvement
25.     An effective financial sector that provides investment credit to firms supports
economic development by enabling firms to invest intechnology and capacity. That raises
output and productivity thereby fueling growth and employment opp~rtunities.~                     In
addition, evidence suggests that a well-functioning financial system enables the poor to
benefit proportionally more from economic growth (Le.; growth i s pro-p~or).~

26.     SMEs remain underserved in terms o f credit and in addition there is evidence of
spatial inequality in the provision o f credit, and the project has been successful in
addressing these issues. Domestic bank credit i s still a modest 29 percent o f GDP and half
o f the expansion has been to consumers rather than firms. The corporate sector has
benefitted from increased direct borrowing from abroad in the amount o f 15 percent o f
GDP as an alternative to domestic bank financing, but SMEs are typically not able to
access this source o f funds and must rely on the domestic financial sector for financing.
The Turkey Investment Climate Assessment showed that firms outside the major urban
areas have less access to credit. Regardless o f firm size, the investment climate survey
showed that firms in major cities are more likely to have a loan than those companies in
smaller towns. The project has proven successful in reaching SMEs, including in the
eastern part o f Turkey, where credit i s less developed. In addition the Bank i s engaged in
systemic reforms inthe bankingsector through the CDEPL series.

Impact of the Current Financial Crisis

27.     The international credit crunch has the most impacts on the Turkish real/corporate
sector. Within the real sector, SMEs are most affected by any increase in overall liquidity.
In addition the increased risk aversion will affect export demand and domestic economic
growth. A large part o f Turkey's businesses rely on European export markets, which are
contracting. Moreover, the capital flows that have contributed to Turkey's economic
recovery will slowdown, domestic demand will decrease thereby reducing demand for
SMEs products. As a result, the growth o f the Turkish SME sector will slow and this in
turn will reduce demand for credit line financing. The credit crunch is exacerbating SMEs
credit constraints thereby makingthe project more relevant.

28.     Halkbank's financial strength i s strong. As explained in detail inAnnex I,the bank
remains instrong condition. It attains the position o f strength due to a mix o f core deposits
that buffers against adverse market movements, limitedmarket exposure and a highcapital
adequacy ratio. Inthe current financial crisis where highly leveraged financial institutions
are finding it unable to lend, Halkbank's past risk averseness has placed Halkbank in a
strong position to remain active in the SME sector whilst other banks are restricting
lending due to liquidity constrains.

Rationalefor Additional Financing

29.     The additional financing will scale-up the project's impact and development
effectiveness and continue to support the project's development objectives Itto increase
Turkish small and medium enterprises (SME) access to medium-term finance". It will
scale-up the achievements of the original project not only during the implementation
period (2008-2012), but also beyond that period as the Borrower will use the reflows
repaid from the initial sub-borrowers to finance new investments before the funds are
returnedto the World Bank.Inaddition, given the reducedfinancing available as a result
of the current crisis, the additional financing will ensure continued access to finance for
SMEs

30.     The project has achievedimpressive results to date with a broad spectrum of SMEs
using the funds as investment loans to improve their productivityandworking capital loans
to complement their investments and scale-up their operations. Fifty seven percent of the
loans made by Halkbank have been for investment purposes. The geographical dispersion
of the borrowers and the wide range of industries included confirm Halkbank's ability to
reach SMEs. Commitments and disbursements since effectiveness have proceeded at a
rapid pace. As of June 2008, less than a year after effectiveness, Halkbank disbursed99.9
million (out of a loan amount 100 million) to 154 SMEs, confirming boththe demand for
credit by SMEs and Halkbank's ability to implement the project. The average loan size for
Halkbank is 650,000 and average maturity 69 months. TSKB has disbursed $13 million
and 20.7 million (out o f a loan amount $48 million and 60 million) to 24 SMEs. The
average loan size for TSKB i s $2 million and the average maturity is 69 months. Total
employment impact of the project to date has been 3243 jobs, with 2411jobs created by
SMEs financed by Halkbank and 832jobs created by SMEs financed by TSKB.

31.     The implementation performance of the existing project is strong. The
implementation performance ratings for all categories are either highly satisfactory or
satisfactory in the last ISR, and Halkbank and TSKB is in compliance with all legal
covenants including prudential and eligibility requirements. There are no outstanding
fiduciary or safeguards issues. The project is currently rated satisfactory on financial
management and procurement aspects as well as on social and environmental aspects.

111. PROPOSEDCHANGES
There are no proposedchanges to the project design.

32.     The additional loan will finance a credit line intermediated by Halkbank. The
SMEs will be the final beneficiaries of the credit line. For purposes of this additional
financing, SMEs will continue to be definedas firms employing fewer than 250 people and
having annual sales of less than US$20 million. To ensure that the project covers
geographical regions in which SMEs are particularly underserved, Halkbank plans to
allocate a portionof the loan to the areas as defined inthe Loan Agreement. The credit line
will finance medium-termworking capital (e.g. raw materials) and investment loans (e.g.,
machinery, equipment, and civil works) with no sector restrictions. Sub-loans will be
provided on the same terms and conditions as stipulated in the original Loan Agreement.

The lending rates would be approximate to what sub borrowers would pay in the market
for similar money, taking into account, as relevant, maturities, risks, and scarcity o f capital.

Institutional and implementation management

33.     The project has a current closing dateofApril 30,2012. The implementation period
for the additional loan will not require an extension, and the closing date will remain
unchanged.

34.     For purposes of the project there is an existing operational manual which will
continue to be usedand will reflect the additional amount. Implementation shall be carried
out through the existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU at Halkbank is fully
staffed and operates under the overall supervision of an Assistant General Manager. The
PIU includes experienced management and staff including representatives of the financial
analysis, financial control, credit, administrative, and operational departments. Annex I
provides a summary evaluation of Halkbank including an analysis of the Bank's financial
soundness, its implementation capacity and specific considerations on the bank's ability to
meet the World Bank requirementincluding OP 8.30 on Financial Intermediation

Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

35.     Halkbank will evaluate progress on the proposed indicators with supervision from
the Bank through regular reporting and through implementationmissions. Halkbank has
agreed to submit yearly reports including output and outcome indicators and semi-annual
financial managementreports to the World Bank. The financial monitoring reports (FMRs)
are included inthe operational manuals. The data will come from internal Halkbank reports
andthe PIUhas sufficient capacityto ensure provisionofthe monitoring data.

IV.CONSISTENCYWITH COUNTRY PARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY

36.     The additional financing is well aligned with the CPS, which calls for improving
access to finance to improve competitiveness and employment opportunities. The CPS
suggests a new credit line for SME productivity and competitiveness in FY10/11 while
also mentioning that the timing ofprojects will be flexible.

V. APPRAISALOF SCALED-UPPROJECTACTIVITIES

Economic andjnancial analyses
37.     As there is no clear way of defining the project costs, a traditional
economic/financial analysis cannot be conducted. The approach taken is to measure the
development results inrelation to the amounts intermediated as shown inthe development
framework.

Technical
38.     Provisions are includedinthe project to ensure that lending rates reflect the cost of
intermediating the funds including an appropriate credit risk margin as required by
OP8.30. The financial condition of Halkbank i s good, it has proven its ability to maintain

low non-performing loans ratios, and the capacity to implement the project is viewed as
strong.

Fiduciary
39.    Halkbank has satisfactory financial management (FM) arrangements for the Access
to Finance for SMEs Project. The FM arrangements were assessed during the July 2008
F M supervision mission and rated as satisfactory. The supervision included the
examination of project accounting and reporting arrangements, staffing, internal control
procedures,planning andbudgeting, financial manual and external audits.

40.    Halkbank is in compliance with the FM provisions of the legal documents of the
Access to Finance for SMEs Project. The semi-annual FMRs have been submitted on a
timely basis in the agreed content and format. Halkbank also submitted the entity audit
report for the year-ended December 31, 2007, and the project audit report for the period
from effectiveness until July 31, 2008 on time. The audit report on entity financial
statements prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) is unqualified (clean). The project audit report has two qualifications on exceptions
to compliance with loan covenants relating to the eligibility criteria, for which the Bank
has grantedwaivers. Bothaudit reports were assessed as satisfactory by the project FMS.

41.     Halkbank will continue to use its existing systems and staff for the financial
management of the additional financing. The same accounting, reporting and internal
control procedures will apply. The financial monitoring report templates will be used
unless additional information i s requested from the task team. FMRs will be prepared
semesterly and will be submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of the
semester. The entity IFRS financial statements and project financial statements will be
audited by private external auditors on an annual basis. The terms of reference of the audit
have to be acceptable to the Bank. Both reports will be submitted to the World Bank no
later than six months after the closing of the year. The disbursement procedures, as
followed under the originalproject, would continue to be usedfor the additional loan.

Procurement

42.     Procurementfor the proposedadditional financing will continue to be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated May 2004 revised in October 2006 (Procurement Guidelines); and the
provisions stipulated in the original Loan Agreement. Anti-Corruption Guidelines
approvedby the Bank on October 15,2006 will applyto this additionalfinancing.

43.     For goods and works contracts below 2.5 million equivalent, established local
private sector commercial practices may be followed inaccordancewith paragraph3.12 of
the Procurement Guidelines. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be required
for individual contracts above 2.5 million for goods and works in accordance with
Section I1of the World Bank's ProcurementGuidelines.

44.     The Ankara basedprocurement specialist carried out an assessment of the capacity
of the Halkbank to implement procurement actions for the project. The assessment



                                            13

reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the existing project and the
interaction between the project's staff responsible from the procurement activities.
Specialists assigned for the procurement arrangements within Halkbank's PIU, established
in the existing SME project, will be responsible for all procurement oversight for the
management o f the additional financing. The overall risk for procurement is average in
Halkbank. In order to reduce the procurement risk, Halkbank plans to support PIU with
additional staff and assist PIU with staff experienced inprocurement.

45.    The World Bank will conduct regular post reviews o f the contracts not requiring a
prior review on a random basis, one in ten contracts. The procurement arrangements will
be reviewedannually

Social
46.    The project does not have any potentially negative social implications. By
increasing access to finance and growth o f SMEs, it is expected that the operation will
have a positive impact on employment.

Environment
47.    Halkbank was found to be in compliance with the environment procedures
described in the loan agreement based on the review done in October 2008. It was
confirmed that (i)the sub-projects files o f Halkbank's branch and beneficiaries' were
conducted with respect to defined methods and environmental screening forms' specified
issues in the loan agreement and, (ii)provisions related the environment (waste
management, hygiene, personal protective materials, etc.) has been satisfactory from
supply o fraw materials to the final products invisited sites.

48.    Halkbank will continue to use its existing systems for the environmental screening
procedures. The project has been assigned "Category FI" in accordance with World Bank
safeguard policy OP/BP/GP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment).

49.    Halkbank has prepared environmental review procedures documents acceptable to
the World Bank. The frameworks define environmental review procedures to be used in
sub-project evaluation. These framework documents have been posted on Halkbank's
websites and i s included as separate chapters inthe bank's operations manual.

50.    Halkbank has decided to include the possibility o f financing sub-projects that may,
by Turkish environmental regulations, require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
report. The environmental review procedures defined by Halkbank i s consistent with
Government     o f Turkey     Environmental Assessment        requirements,  World Bank
Environmental Assessment policies, and procedures utilized in previous Financial
Intermediary operations inTurkey

Safeguard policies
51.    Environmental Assessment Policies will apply to the proposed project. Halkbank
and sub-borrowers will have to comply with these policies. No other policy i s expected to
be triggered by the project. The possibility o f other policies being triggered by specific

a significant share of SMEs slightly over 50%), while the bank extends less consumer
credit (23 percent of loans).

Halkbank has a relatively strong presence in the East and Center of the Country where
credit is less developed. While the Turkish banking system only has 10 percent of its loan
portfolio inthe eastern and central region, Halkbank has 20 percent of its loanportfolio (or
US$ 3.129 billion) inthis area. Details on the loans inthe two relevant parts of the country
are provided inTable 4.2.

Halkbank's sustaining participation in the project is thus well aligned with its strategy.
Halkbank is seeking to further strengthen its position as an SME bank by increasing its
product range and growing its portfolio to that segment. Halkbank's portfolio of non-
tradable investment securities (40% of total securities) weighting USD 5.8 1 billion as of
end-June 2008, shifts towards tradable securities and loans in the recent years. Halkbank
has a low but inreasing loans-to-deposit ratio in Turkey, at 61 percent, compared to an
average loans-to-deposit ratio of 83 percent in the banking system. This suggests that
Halkbank has a large customer base that is currently not exploited in terms of extending
credit. While the loanto asset ratio of the sector is 53%, Halkbank's ratio is slightly below
the average with 49%. By taking into consideration the loan to deposit ratio, loan to asset
ratio displays the strong deposit structure o f Halkbank.

4.3     FinancialSoundnessandRiskExposures

Halkbank is a well-capitalized and profitable bank with relatively small market risk
exposures. The bank's liquidity is strong enough to protect it against adverse market
movements. Furthermore, since the great portion of Bank's liabilities is composed of
deposit which is the stickiest liability item in crisis, strengthens the liquidity structure of
the Bank. The loanportfolio has performed well inthe past four years, and the bank i s run
in a sound manner. Table 4.3 includes Halkbank's financial statements compared with
those of the Turkish banking system. The section below includes a detailed evaluation of
Halkbank's financial and operational performance.

Solvency. With a capital adequacy ratio of 14.08 percent (see Table 4.4)' the bank i s
solvent when measured against risk-weighted assets. The much lower capital-to-assets
ratio of 8.31 percent reflects the bank's large holding of government debt securities with 0
percent risk weighting.

Credit risk and loan porqolio performance. The bank's gross NPL-to-total loans ratio i s
at 4.4 percent (see Table 4.5). However, it largely reflects old non-performing loans that
have been fully provisioned for but not written off. Current portfolio performance is sound.
A substantialportion o f the NPLs are carried over from Emlak Bank, which failed during
the crisis and was merged with Halkbank. Specific provisions are made for 90 percent o f
gross NPLs, and no loans have been written off inthe past five years. New non-performing
loans (including sub-standard) net o f collections during the period 2005 to 2007 amounted
to less than 2 percent o f the bank's current loan portfolio. The recent performance o f
Halk's loan portfolio is thus sound. Halkbank's borrowers are widely dispersed, and
concentrations are not a concern. In contrast to private banks, Halkbank extends 83.5
percent o f loans in local currency and therefore does not expose itself to indirect currency
depreciation risk such as i s otherwise common inTurkey.

Halkbank has a well diversified portfolio in respect of sectors and regions. Current
developments are testing the creditworthiness o f SME clients however separate rating
systems are used for corporate and SME loanportfolio o f the Bank and the loan customers
are subject to internal rating process, so the firms' credibility is assessed correctly. Given
Halkbank's experience with the SME sector it has adequate in house procedures and
expertise to ensure good health o f the SME portfolio. The bank has been generating
default statistics in house and the PD rates are lower than the other banks (peer group) in
the Turkish banking sector, for the last 3 years. The internal rating system i s validated and
the economic capital requirement o fthe Bank i s measured periodically, thus the credit risks
are managed effectively, by the department o f Risk Management.

Profitubility. The bank is highly profitable by both Turkish and international standards,
with real ROA of 3 and real ROE o f 32.6 (see Table 4.6). As the Turkish bankingmarket
evolves, new sources o f profits must be developed. Halkbank's non-marketable securities
are currently being remunerated above would-be-market prices, and as they mature they
will be partially replaced with lower yielding assets. Halkbank has a greater portion of its
assets invested in Government securities than private Turkish banks, and return on this
position is declining. Halkbank's ability to sustain its current highlevel o f profitability will
depend on its ability to shift its portfolio in response to changing profit opportunities.
However, even a lower level o f profitability would not endanger Halkbank's financial
soundness.

Liquidity.Liquidity is monitored bothby the ratios defined by the BRSA andthe ratios set
by the Bank within the context of Liquidity Contingency planning.This planalso includes
early warning indicator ratios that enables bank to define organization and the procedures
to provide commensurate liquidity on time. The Bank's strong core deposit base has been a
good liquidity buffer against adverse market movements. As it can be understood the
tables below (see table 4.7) Halkbank's liquidity ratios are far above the limits defined by

Market risk exposures. Halkbank's market risk exposures are very moderate. The bank
hedged it's on balance sheet foreign currency position with off balance sheet items.(See
Table 4.8). The amount of net foreign currency position i s negligible when we compared it
with the amount o f total assets. Due to the fact that 78 percent of the TRY denominated
securities held by Halkbank i s composed o f floating rate, the Bank carries low interest rate
risk on it's balance sheet. Furthermore, the Bank measures the effects o f interest rate
movements on its P/L and net economic value by using periodical stress tests and scenario

4.4    Subsidized Credits

Halkbank extends two types of subsidized credits; "IF1 credits" and "cooperative credits,"
that account for 18 percent of total loans (see Table 4.9 for an overview of loans by type
and region). The subsidy elements are fully financed by sponsors outside Halkbank, and
the subsidized credits are structured in a way that does not distort Halkbank's credit
decision or interest rate setting for other loans.

Directly subsidized "cooperative credits ''
Cooperative credits are extended to small individual borrowers under credit cooperatives,
and only borrowers organized under these credit cooperatives are eligible. The borrowers
are small, and the scheme is akin to microfinance schemes seen in many other places.
Halkbank receives a 7 percent subsidy from the Government in order to reduce interest on
the loans. Credit risk i s reducedby the joint liability of the cooperative and the borrower.
When payment from a borrower i s late, the amount i s charged directly from the
cooperative's account. This program is only offered by Halkbank, and it i s expected to be
phasedout over time. The loans are carried on Halkbank's balance sheet.

Indirectly subsidized "IFIloans"
Fund loans are financed by below market rate liabilities provided in the form of loans
from, for instance, IFIs includingEIB, CEB, AFD, IBRD,etc. Halkbank i s requiredto lend
the funds according to certain criteria, such as location in specific zones or to special
groups of borrowers such as SMEs. The proposed World Bank credit line will also fall in
this category. The loans are priced fairly close to market prices, and Halkbank earns a
normal spread, carries the credit risk for these loans, and has the loans recorded on its
balance sheet. Some of the fund loans are available to other banks inthe market, including
private banks, andHalkbank does not enjoy a favorable position vis-a-vis other banks with
respect to these loans.

Other loans
The remaining balance of the total loans also includes another type of subsidized loans
such as EXIMandKOSGEB. The sum of these loans is USD 407 million.

4.5     OperationalPolicy8.30 (OP 8.30) Considerations

OP 8.30 applies to Halkbank for the proposed operation. In summary, the conditions are
viewed as being met for Halkbank as an intermediary. Regarding the specific issues for
financial intermediaries under OP 8.30:

(a) Adequate profitability, capital, and portfolio quality, as confirmed by financial
statements prepared and audited in accordance with accounting and auditing principles
acceptable to the Bank

Halkbank is profitable, well capitalized, and its loanportfolio has performed well over the
past four years-sees the section on financial soundness and risk exposures. Halkbank
prepares statements in accordance with regulations, and the statements are viewed as
adequate.

(b) Acceptable levels of loan collections

Although Halkbank used to carry a large stock of old non-performing loans, current loan
collections are good-see   the section on credit risk and loan portfolio performance under
the sectionon financial soundness andriskexposures.

(c) Appropriate capacity, including staffing, for carrying out sub-project appraisal
(including environmental assessment) andfor supervising sub-project implementation

On appropriatecapacity, includingstaffing, see section (Implementation Capacity).

Halkbank has US$3,793 million worth of loans to SMEs inthe targeted region, equaling
more than 20 times the amount of credit to be extended to Halkbank under the proposed
operation. NPLs inthe targetedregion are small-both net and gross NPL levels are less in
the targeted region than for the bank as a whole. This evidence suggests that Halkbank is
able to extend sound credit inthe targetedregion.

(d) Capacity to mobilize domestic resources

Halkbank has US$30.14 billion worth of domestic deposits, proving its ability to mobilize
domestic resources.

(e) Adequate managerial autonomy and commercially oriented governance

Halkbank i s mainly owned by the Government by 75% of shares and about 25% of shares
are privatized through an IPO. The Government will retain control until a private sector
partner takes a majority stake in the bank. Since the Government still owns and controls
the bank, it is clearly not totally autonomous and commercially oriented in its decision
making. However, the team's assessment indicates that decisions are made sufficiently
autonomously and that they are commercially oriented, as also evidenced by the sound
financials of the bank.

                                            25

Halkbank complies with the regulations, and its balance sheet has a low risk profile. Credit
decisions are made on a commercial basis (see section on subsidized credits for details),
and the bank has a risk management unit reporting to the bank's board of directors,
according to international practice.
