1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Despite Chile's advanced stage of educational development, relative to other middle-
income countries, at the time of appraisal four sector issues were identified as hampering
the country's economic and social transformation as well as its productivity and
competitiveness in the international arena. First, educational attainment remained highly
inequitable, especially among the population 15 years-old and over, with approximately
50 percent of adults not having completed their secondary school, including roughly
500,000 illiterate adults (2002). Second, an effective public policy framework aimed at
ensuring the relevancy and quality of technical-professional education was lacking,
resulting in uneven and disjointed technical education at the tertiary level. Third, despite
their substantial needs for training, workers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
were not capitalizing on the training opportunities offered under the government's
earmarked training tax-rebate scheme. Fourth, there was a structural disconnect between
the education, labor and private productive sectors in the provision of lifelong learning
and training opportunities, resulting in insufficient information on job supply and demand,
as well as weak links between education, training and the work place.

To address these issues, the Government of Chile (GOC) requested the Bank's support to
establish the foundations of an articulated lifelong learning and training system with the
participation of the private sector (including employers and workers) to provide
individuals with the opportunities to acquire the general and sector-specific skills and
knowledge necessary to adapt to different stages in life. Consistent with the gradual
approach adopted by the GOC in the implementation of its education reform, the Lifelong
Learning and Training Project--known in Chile as Chile Califica--was conceived as a
first demonstrative step towards the development of a lifelong learning and training
system to benefit, in the long term, a universe of 500,000 illiterate adults, 6.5 million
adults with incomplete secondary education and about 7 million workers in need of high-
quality, relevant training.

 1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Performance
Indicators
  Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
PDO 1 ­ To reduce the social deficit in the provision of lifelong education and training
opportunities for young adults and adults, especially those who are unemployed or living
in conditions of poverty, and those who seek a second chance to improve their
employability and quality of life.
Three KPIs were identified in relation to PDO 1:
 Decrease in the percentage of adults (15 to 65 year-olds) with incomplete basic and/or
   secondary education.
 Increase in the percentage of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making use of the
   tax-rebate for training and education.
 Total of adults that benefited from the project in both adult education and training.




                                             1
PDO 2 - To upgrade the skill level of the Chilean labor force to improve its productivity
and competitiveness
Three KPIs were identified in relation to PDO 2:
 Increase in the enrollment of the technical education centers (Centros de Formación
   Técnica - CFTs).
 Increase in the transition rates from technical secondary education into tertiary
   technical-professional education and/or the labor market within six months after
   graduation in the regional networks financed by the project.
 Increase in the transition rates from tertiary technical education to the labor market
   within 6 months after graduation in the regional networks


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDOs remained unchanged throughout the life of the project. Two of the six KPIs
were found to be not measuring adequately the project's development; therefore their
measurement was not carried out consistently throughout the life of the project. Despite
their lack of accuracy of the two KPI, the project's Result Framework was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
                                 Primary Target Groups
   Adults with incomplete basic and/or secondary education, particularly those in the
   three lowest income deciles, including indigenous groups;
   Workers in need of training, particularly those in SMEs, and those choosing to certify
   and upgrade their work competencies; and
   Students in technical-professional educational paths.
                                    Other beneficiaries
   Employers, particularly those in SMEs;
   Secondary and tertiary technical and professional teaching institutions and their
   teachers; and
   Providers of short technical training courses.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1 - Providing new opportunities for lifelong learning and training (US$59.2 million,
    incl. US$41.1 million of IBRD financing)
This component was organized into three sub-components, with a focus on:
(a) Promoting and increasing private and public supply of basic and secondary education
    opportunities for adults;
(b) Establishing a learning assessment and certification system for adults seeking to
    complete their basic and secondary education; and
(c) Developing new modalities that harmonize adult basic and secondary education with
    training.
2 - Improving the quality and increasing the coverage of technical-professional
    education (US$41.5 million, inc. US$1.3 million of IBRD financing)
This component was organized into two sub-components, with a focus on:


                                            2
(a) Strengthening the articulation of technical education at the secondary level with
    technical-professional education at the tertiary level as well as the labor market; and
(b) Improving the quality and pertinence of the pre- and in-service teacher training for
    technical-professional education.
3 - Establishing instruments to support the provision of a lifelong learning and training
    services (US$33.9 million, incl. US$27.2 million of IBRD financing)
This component was organized into two sub-components, with a focus on:
(a) Establishing a national competency framework system and vocational-professional
    pathways in selected sectors of the economy.; and
(b) Establishing lifelong learning and training information systems (MISs).
4 - Institutional strengthening (US$15.5 million, incl. US$5.4 million of IBRD financing)
This component financed the operation of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).

1.6 Revised Components
N.A.

1.7 Other significant changes
                                      Loan Amendments
      First Loan Amendment: To make it more attractive for eligible suppliers to respond
      to the increased demand for adult education and certification supported under the
      project (i.e., sub-component 1.a), a Ministerial Decree was issued by the Minister of
      Education that: i) changed the pre-financing formula to eligible suppliers from 25 to
      35 percent and; ii) increased the value of the basic education learning module by 25
      percent. The loan agreement was modified to reflect these changes. This amendment
      was approved by the Bank on 11 December 2003.
      Second Loan Amendment: The project's closing date was extended from September
      30, 2008 to December 31, 2009 and US$28.6 million (equivalent to 37.8 percent of the
      original loan amount) were cancelled. The partial cancellation of loan funds was the
      result of a more intensive use of local co-financing than originally planned. This
      amendment was approved by the Bank on 11 September 2008.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) was carried out by a panel of reviewers of the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG). Out of 50 investment projects that were reviewed that
year, Chile Califica was one of only two projects that obtained a highly satisfactory
rating. While there are no doubts about the innovative nature of the project's design and
the soundness of the preparation process, some design weaknesses became apparent
during implementation. Thus, this ICR rates the project's QAE as moderately satisfactory.
The main strengths and weaknesses can be summarized as follows:

                          Assessment of Quality at Entry ­ QAE
Strengths
 Encompassing view of lifelong learning: The project built upon the previous reforms



                                              3
 in basic education, secondary education and higher education as well as various
 experimental initiatives. It effectively knitted them together into an encompassing
 system of mechanisms and incentives to promote lifelong learning and training.
 Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives: The project was
 fully aligned to the objectives of the 1996-1998 CAS (Report No. 14370-CH; April
 1995) as well as the 2002-2006 CAS (Report No. 23329-CH; January 2002), which
 was being discussed at the time of project preparation. Both of them focused on
 continuing to foster social development as well as the country's international
 competitiveness, with an added emphasis on inclusiveness in the latter.
 Balancing of public and private spheres: Recognizing Chile's preference for a
 limited role of the government, the project supported the creation of a lifelong learning
 and training system in which the government plays a quality assurance, financing, and
 light regulatory roles. Recognizing also the significant engagement of Chile's private
 sector in the provision of education and training, the project was conceived as a
 demand-driven system of learning and training and introduced a sound set of
 incentives to induce specific actions among private players.
 Experimental nature: The project was conceived as a pilot experience, to be
 subsequently followed by evaluation and measurement, adjustment, and scaling-up.
 Given the complexities of establishing a sound lifelong learning system, starting small
 and with demonstrative initiatives was an appropriate strategy.
Weaknesses
 Uneven definition of the project's components: While Components 1 and 3 had a
 clear focus (i.e., the implementation of the flexible adult education program and the
 national competency certification framework, respectively), Component 2 lacked
 definition in terms of both its overall objectives and the activities to be implemented.
 It was conceived largely as an incubator to test a series of interventions aimed at
 enhancing coverage and quality of technical education. These interventions tackled
 very difficult challenges, such as the integration the technical education at the
 secondary and tertiary levels and the formal recognition of previously acquired
 knowledge. As a result, this component supported bottom-up initiatives that were
 incremental in nature and of complex implementation. While many of the ideas
 turned out to be implemented satisfactorily and gained political support as a result, the
 initial design did not envisaged the filters or process to determine successful
 innovations or ways to communicate and mitigate the impact of less successful
 interventions.
 PDOs failed to capture the systemic aspects of the project. While the project's
 developmental objective was to assist the GOC in establishing the foundation of an
 articulated lifelong learning and training system, the PDO's did not capture the
 systemic nature of the lifelong-learning and training system supported under the
 project, which is one of the more significant contributions of the project.
 Weak Project Results Framework - PRF: Although the project design identified a
 robust set of intermediate indicators (i.e. output indicators), the KPIs aimed at
 measuring the project's outcomes and overall impact were quite weak. Specifically:
  Two of the KPIs (i.e., decrease in the percentage of adult population with
      incomplete basic/secondary education, and increase in CFT enrollment) lacked
      pertinence, as they measure trends that are mainly affected by factors external to


                                            4
        the project. For example, the decrease in the percentage of adult population with
        an incomplete basic or secondary education is mainly the result of the sustained
        expansion in basic and secondary education coverage over the past decades.
        Likewise, increases in overall CFT enrollment has been primarily determined by
        increased availability of financial aid for tertiary education rather that any action
        implemented under the project.
     Other KPIs, such as the number of adults that benefited from adult education and
        training under the project, focus on outputs rather than outcomes.
     No targets were specified for any of the outcome indicators.
     Frequency of data collection for some of the indicators was inadequate given the
        project's timeline. For example, the household surveys (Encuesta de
        Caracterización Socioeconómica ­ CASEN) on which the indicators rely on are
        only available for the years 2000, 2003, 2006, with the next one being expected for
        2010. 1 Thus, the household survey's time series cannot adequately capture the
        impact at the end of the project.
     Relevant project outcomes, such as improved workers' productivity as reflected by
        their increased income and employability were not included in the PRF Likewise,
        while targeting of the unemployed and the poor was explicitly mentioned under
        PDO 1, no indicators or targets were defined focusing on the beneficiaries' socio-
        economic characteristics.
    Weak framework for systemic evaluation and learning: Although the project was
    conceived as a pilot experience with multiple experimental interventions, the
    mechanisms included in the original design to foster systematic learning and
    evaluation were not sufficiently robust. The project's implementation arrangements
    called for the establishment of a Sub-director for Development within the Project
    Implementation Unit (PIU) to be responsible for contracting out selected evaluation
    and other research-related studies. However, to fully capitalize on the experimental
    nature of the project, such function would have been better conceived as ongoing
    knowledge generation and management rather than as ex-post evaluation, possibly as
    an independent project component.
    Sub-optimal choice of lending instrument: Although the long-term nature of
    developing a lifelong learning system was clearly recognized during preparation, the
    choice of the lending instrument did not effectively support it. As discussed in the
    Project Appraisal Document (PAD), an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) with three or
    four individual phases adding up to a six- to twelve-year implementation cycle would
    have been a more suitable lending instrument to first pilot interventions, and if proven
    successful after their evaluation, scale them up. The Ministry of Finance, however,
    opted instead for a six-year standard investment loan (SIL). As predicted by the Bank
    team, the SIL did not offer the flexibility needed to neatly separate the experimental,
    evaluation and scale-up phases and, consequently, the progression into successive
    phases has been less systematic and more incremental than desired. In addition, an
    APL would have permitted to support the institutionalization process over the medium

2.2 Implementation
Several factors affected project implementation, mainly in a favorable manner, including:
                       Factors Affecting Project Implementation
Factors outside the control of the Government and the implementing agency
 Stable implementation environment: The project has benefited from Chile's
  remarkable political and macroeconomic stability. The government agendas of
  President Ricardo Lagos (2000-2006) and President Michelle Bachelet (2006-2010)
  built upon those of the two preceding administrations of the Concertación coalition,
  providing continuity in the country's overall policy framework across changes in
  political leadership. Enhancing human capital as a way to promote both inclusiveness
  and economic growth has been a high priority in Chile's medium-term development
  agenda. Stable macro-economic conditions, even in the face of the 2008-2009
  international financial crisis, have also contributed to the project's smooth
  implementation.
 Student protests: In April 2006, massive student protests broke up in Chile--the so-
  called "Penguins' Revolution" (la Revolución de los Pingüinos) because of the white
  and dark blue student uniforms. The protests peaked on 20 May 2008, when over
  750,000 students joined marches throughout the country in what was Chile's largest
  student demonstration of the past three decades. The students' demands, which called
  for quality education for all, generated enough momentum to make possible the
  abolition of the Organic Constitutional Law on Teaching (Law Nº 18,962 - LOCE),
  which had come into force on 10 March 1990, the last day of the military regime
  headed by General Pinochet. Despite being widely criticized, the LOCE had remained
  largely intact since the restoration of democracy. Some of its critics questioned not
  just its legitimacy but also the limited role of the state in education.2 Building upon
  the political momentum generated by the student protests, the LOCE was replaced by
  the General Education Law (Law No. 20.370) on 12 September 2009, which provided
  a solid legal foundation for the development of a lifelong learning and training system
  (see further discussion in Section 3.5.b).
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
 Multi-sector approach: The project effectively reflected the priorities and action
   programs of each of the three sector ministries, which contributed to its overall
   relevance and wide acceptance. In the Ministry of Economy, lifelong learning and
   training was seen as one of the cornerstones of innovation and competitiveness--key
   priorities within this ministry. In addition, the development clusters identified by the
   Ministry of Economy as vital to the country's economic development were also given
   priority within the project's interventions. In the Ministry of Labor, the project was
   seen as an important catalyst of the development of a national competency framework
   and enhancing access of relevant, high-quality training, particularly among SMEs.
   Finally, in the Ministry of Education the project was seen strategic in terms of its

   contribution to expanding adult education and enhancing the quality of technical
   education, particularly at the secondary level.
 High rotation of sector ministers: The project's institutional arrangements included a
   policy body at the national level--the so-called Lifelong Learning and Training
   Steering Policy Board (LLTSC), or `Directorio'--that was chaired by the Minister of
   Economy and included the Ministers of Education and of Labor. While this policy
   board was crucial in ensuring the project's multi-sector approach, the high rotation of
   sector ministers made the project's implementation more complex. Over the life of
   the project, there were six different ministers of education, four ministers of
   economy, and four ministers of labor. Every change, understandably, required
   bringing up to speed the newly appointed minister and, in some cases, resulted in
   policy changes or at least changes in emphasis. Fortunately, there was great stability
   within the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) throughout the life of the project, which
   was vital in brining continuity.
 Public-private partnerships: As mentioned earlier under Quality at Entry, the
   project's design effectively reflected a balance between public and private actors.
   During implementation, the GOC maintained its commitment to fostering a high
   private sector involvement in all project activities. With equal representation from the
   public sector, employers and workers, the tri-partite constitution of the National
   Competency Certification Commission established under the National Competency
   Certification Law, offers an illustration of such partnerships.
 Strong territorial presence: The project's implementation arrangements at the
   national level were replicated in each of Chile's 15 regions, including implementation
   of policies, coordination, and linkages with implementation agencies of the various
   project activities. While the regional implementation of the project undoubtedly
   added to its logistic complexity, it was crucial to enhancing its relevance at the
   regional level, ensuring that local players were actively involved in the
   implementation of the various learning and training activities and their articulation,
   thus maximizing their alignment with regional needs and conditions. The soundness
   of the regional strategy adopted by Chile Califica was underscored by the sector
   evaluations conducted as part of the process of Chile's admission into the OECD,
   which recommended their replication in other contexts.3
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
 Collaborative approach: The PCU's commitment to fostering participation and
   inclusiveness was a key determinant of the rich relationships forged under the project
   among public and private actors at both the national and regional levels. Although
   intangible, these relationships are one of the most valuable outcomes of the project, as
   they have served to build trust among a highly diverse universe of players. This trust,
   together with the demonstration of tangible benefits for all the players involved,
   constitutes a valuable seed for the continuous development of a lifelong learning and

    training system over the long run.
    2004 project self-assessment: Two years into implementation, the project's
    authorities4 engaged in a strategic planning exercise aimed at gauging the progress
    made so far and reassessing the organizational structure of the PCU. As a result of
    this self-assessment exercise, the project shifted its overall approach, emphasizing the
    systemic aspects of the project, which had been somewhat overshadowed by its
    operational complexity. One of the most important outcomes of this self-assessment
    was the definition of an institutional footprint for the lifelong learning and training
    system and a strategic plan aimed at achieving the key legislative milestones that
    would ensure its permanent establishment. In addition, some of the project's original
    lines of action were deemphasized, such as the one attempting to articulate adult
    learning with training (sub-component 3.1), while new lines of action were
    incorporated. Moreover, two if the KPI indicators identified in the PAD were found
    to be of little use and lacking in technical rigor, therefore those were deemphasized in
    day to day implementation. This self-assessment and the renewed emphasis on
    institutionalization were critical for the success of the project. Unfortunately, the
    Bank's project was never formally restructured to reflect the more ambitious
    institutional objectives or to strengthen the project's KPIs. Thereafter, there was a
    split between the project's actual implementation, which reflected the newly
    identified priorities, and its original design, which did not capture the full scope of the
    project. It is worth noting that an APL would have offered the flexibility to conduct a
    re-assessment at the end of the first phase and the possibility to adjust the findings
    into the project's overall implementation strategy or adjust some of the KPI to better
    reflect the PDOs.
    Complex implementation of regional articulation networks: These networks were
    aimed at bringing local players together to propose and implement joint initiatives to
    articulate technical education at the secondary and tertiary levels (i.e., vertical and
    horizontal integration) as well as support the development of labor skills relevant for
    the regional economy. Start-up times for these networks were much longer than
    anticipated--in nine out of the 40 network's projects are still under implementation.
    Apart from the logistical complexities, other contributing factors included the need to
    conduct intensive dissemination activities to generate interest at the regional level
    and, in some regions, lack of adequate capacity of the universities, which were at the
    beginning envisioned to play a leadership role in the formation and implementation of
    these networks. These implementation delays made it difficult to extract any
    systematic learning from ongoing processes as well as products that could be applied
    across regions. However, the implementation of the regional networks together with
    the international evidence led to the recognition that a more systematic approach was
    needed to foster vertical integration of technical education and the formal recognition
    of previously acquired knowledge, resulting in the conceptualization of the so-called
    `Qualifications Framework.'

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
                           Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design
 The Project Results Framework (PRF) included a robust battery of intermediary
  indicators aimed at monitoring and assessing the achievement of the project's main
  outputs. However, as mentioned earlier, some of the KPI indicators were not suitable
  for capturing the project's overall impact.
 Given the experimental nature of the project, measuring and evaluating outputs and
  outcomes systematically was critical to `debugging' and ultimately scaling-up. Thus,
  the M&E function should have been given higher profile as part of the project's
  original design, emphasizing ongoing knowledge generation and evaluation as
  opposed to only ex-post evaluation, possibly as an independent project component.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Implementation
 While project's outputs were adequately monitored, the monitoring of project
  outcomes was erratic. After the 2004 self assessment, the monitoring of some of the
  original outcome indicators was more a formality than a substantive task. The
  emphasis with which some of the KPIs were monitored changed depending on the
  specific leadership of the Task Team Leaders (TTLs) responsible for the project.
  Although some KPIs remained relevant, such as impact of the regional networks in
  the generation of vocational and occupational paths, they were not systematically
  measured either, even though they were fully under the sphere of the PIU.
 To complement the project's original PRF, the Bank's supervision team later
  identified a set of complementary indicators to assess the impact of the key
  interventions supported under the program. In addition, a number of impact studies
  were commissioned to measure these indicators. These studies followed a quasi-
  experimental design with two groups: the experimental group constituted by
  randomly selected project participants, and control groups of similar characteristics
  selected ex-post using various matching methodologies. Three of these studies have
  been completed, focusing on: i) the flexible adult education program (i.e., Nivelación
  de Estudios); ii) competency certification; and iii) the vocational guidance. Other
  studies are still underway and the results are expected to be available In late 2010 and
  2011.
 In 2008, the Budget Directorate (DIPRES) commissioned an in-depth evaluation of
  Chile Califica as a whole to determine the project's overall effectiveness. It also
  included a quasi-experimental evaluation of the flexible adult education program and
  competency-based training and certification.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Utilization
 The PRF output indicators proved useful as a basic pulse-taking tool to assess
  progress to implementation. Conversely, the PRF was not useful to measure the
  project's impact. Overall, the project's M&E system was used primarily as a
  mechanism for data compilation, with little or no subsequent analysis of the data and,
  as a result, it did not contribute to improving project management.
 As intended, the impact studies served to measure the impact of the project's main
  lines of action, as well as the perceptions of beneficiaries regarding their satisfaction
  with the program and its usefulness. Overall, these studies have revealed positive


                                             9
   impacts that are relevant to the PDOs; thus, they have been crucial inputs in the ICR
   ex-post evaluation. However, because the majority of them were completed toward
   the end of the life of the project--some of them have not yet been finalized--they
   had limited impact on project implementation.
   The in-depth evaluation conducted by DIPRES has served to provide a thorough
   overview of the project, its outputs, efficiency and overall impact. Although the study
   identifies several shortcomings, the overall recommendation is to continue with the
   task of developing a lifelong learning and training system based on the identified
   positive impacts and its overall economic efficiency.

Environmental and Social Safeguards
N.A. No safeguard policies were triggered.
Financial Management ­ FM
The rating for FM was downgraded a couple of times during the life of the project in
what appeared to be a `protest' to the low level of loan disbursements relative to the
actual implementation pace. Although the low use of project funds was initially attributed
to the slow processing of the disbursement requests, it was in effect the result of a
decision of the Ministry of Finance to increase local financing. The issue was finally
openly addressed in mid-2006, and eventually led to an extension in the project's closing
date together with the cancellation of US$28.6 million of the project funds in 2008.
Over the life of the project, there were some weaknesses identified in FM practices, all of
which were discussed openly with the Borrower and, as a result, addressed promptly and
satisfactorily.
Procurement
Chile Califica' procurement was complex, as it included several implementing units at
both the national and regional levels. Weaknesses in the quality and reliability of
procurement administration were identified during the implementation, including
unsatisfactory compliance with Bank rules concerning selection of consultants by the
project's executing entities. A set of actions were taken to address these weaknesses,
including hiring additional staff experienced in Bank procedures and conducting
workshops in Bank procedures for all the project-related executing agencies. There were
no deviations with Bank's procurement practices during the project's lifetime.
Compliance with DCA Covenants
At closing all covenants had been met, although some of them with delays.




2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The 2010 Budget Law has assigned adequate resources to the various lines of action
previously financed under Chile Califica, including: i) US$1.45 million for the

                                             10
functioning of the National Competency Certification Commission (CNCCL); ii) US$4
million for SENCE to support evaluation and certification of labor competencies; and iii)
US$26.5 million for MINEDUC for the continuous support of: the flexible adult
education program (US$20.1 million); strengthening of adult education (US$3.2 million);
articulation of technical education (US$950,000); vocational and labor intermediation
information systems (US$210,000); and other operational expenses (US$2 million).
Thus, the overall budget allocated to activities previously financed by Chile Califica for
2001 amounts to roughly US$32 million--equivalent to 82 percent of the US$39.3
million budgeted for 2009. The Government of Chile is committed to the continuation,
refinement and successful implementation of the lifelong training program, therefore all
activities that have been deemed successful continue their implementation trajectory.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The establishment of a lifelong learning and training system has perhaps a higher priority
now than when the project was originally designed. The project's high relevance is
reflected in the enactment of several pieces of legislation that provide the foundations for
such system, including the unanimous approval by the Congress of the law establishing
the National Competency Certification System in 2008. Likewise, the 2009 independent
evaluation of Chile Califica sponsored by DIPRES recommended continuing with the
development of a lifelong learning and training system. The development of such system
is also aligned with the Bank's current Country Partnership Strategy for Chile (Report No.
38691-CL, 24 April 2007), which has as its main objective to support Chile's efforts to
converge with OECD income levels and living standards by accelerating sustainable
growth and increasing equality of opportunity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Achievement of the project's objectives has been satisfactory. The project has made a
significant contribution toward laying the foundations for an articulated lifelong learning
and training system with the participation of the both public and private actors. Two of
the project's outcomes are particularly noteworthy, as they represent a change in
paradigms. First, the flexible adult education modality implemented under the program
has effectively expanded coverage among population groups that were no well-served by
the regular adult education program, women and older adults in particular. The same is
true for the literacy program `Contigo Aprendo,' which has expanded coverage by
focusing on small learning groups that meet at mutually agreed times at locations within
their own communities. Thus, by radically transforming the delivery modality, these two
programs have effectively expanded educational opportunities for young and older adults
who had fallen outside the regular education system, giving them a second chance to
improve their employability and quality of life. Second, the establishment of a national
competency framework has drastically transformed the overall structuring of training,
focusing on well defined sets of labor skills that are relevant for key sectors of the
Chilean economy. In this way, the actions supported under the project have probably
contributed to the country's social and economic transformation over the medium and


                                             11
long term by simultaneously reducing the social deficit and improving the country's
productivity and competitiveness in the international arena, as originally envisioned in
the project's PDOs.
Achievement in each of the two PDOs can be summarized as follows:
PDO 1 - To reduce the social deficit in the provision of life-long education and training
      opportunities for young adults and adults, especially those who are unemployed or
      living in conditions of poverty and those who seek a second chance to improve
      their employability and quality of life
The achievement of this PDO is considered to be satisfactory, as the project succeeded in
expanding the provision of relevant lifelong education and training opportunities among
those population groups lagging behind in human capital development. Specifically:
Expanded educational opportunities
KPI 1: The percentage of the overall population with incomplete basic and/or secondary
education decreased from 52.3 percent to 47.3 percent between 2002 and 2006. However,
this reduction does not reflect the actual impact of the project but rather the sustained
improvements in coverage, retention and graduation rates in basic and secondary
education over the past few decades (see Figure 1).5

However, other actions implemented under Chile Califica have significantly expanded
educational opportunities relative to the previously existing ones. In particular, the
Contigo Aprendo literacy program and the flexible adult education program have
substantially expanded enrollment in adult education, particularly women, the
unemployed, and the poor. Specifically:

    Completion rates for basic and secondary education improved substantially over the past few decades.
Specifically, 64.9 percent of the 1980 entering class successfully completed their basic education compared
to 87.1 percent for the 1998 entering class. Likewise, only 66.1 percent of the 1990 entering class
successfully completed their secondary education compared to 79.5 percent for the 1995 entering class
(Indicadores de la Educación en Chile 2007-2008, MINEDUC, 2009).

   Literacy program: A non-traditional literacy program--so-called Contigo Aprendo--
   targeting young adults and adults that cannot read and write or those with less than
   four years of schooling was successfully implemented under the program since 2003.
   It is aimed at developing students' basic competencies in reading comprehension,
   writing, and mathematics, with the ultimate objective of facilitating their social
   integration.
   Between 2003 and 2009, approximately 100,000 adults have benefited from this
   program. In 2008, 17,000 adults participated in the Contigo Aprendo, which is
   equivalent to roughly 74 percent to the adult enrolment in the regular basic education
   program. Between 2003 and 2008, approximately 33,000 adults achieved certification
   in basic literacy competencies (equivalent to 4th grade) under the program--equivalent
   to 6.6 percent of illiterate adults. Females constituted 71.4 percent of the program's
   participants in 2008 (2008 Anuario Estadístico, MINEDUC, 2010).
   Flexible adult education: A flexible adult education modality targeting adults
   seeking to complete their basic and/or secondary education has been successfully
   implemented since 2003. Operating together with an independent learning assessment
   and certification system, this demand-driven, results-oriented model has been effective
   in ensuring that a wide universe of education providers adequately responds to the
   needs of adult students while producing the desired educational outcomes with
   minimum supervision.
   This flexible modality effectively expanded enrollment in adult education by roughly
   46 percent, by adding, an average of roughly 60,000 additional adult students to the
   130,000 enrolled each year in the regular adult education program between 2003 and
   2008--equivalent to over 400,000 additional adult students over the life of Chile
   Califica. It is important to note that the flexible education program did not take away
   students from the regular adult education program (it had an enrollment of 127,000
   students in 2002 and an average of 130,000 students between 2003 and 2008) but
   effectively expanded adult enrolment by offering added flexibility in terms of
   schedules and locations.

The flexible adult education program has expanded enrollment particularly among
women, the unemployed, the poor and older adults. Specifically:
 Lower income groups: While participants' income was not recorded, by targeting
   those who have not completed their basic and/or secondary education, the project
   is highly likely to have benefited those in the lowest income groups.:
    Illiteracy rates are higher among the poor and the very poor, equivalent to 6.8
       and 6 percent, respectively, compared to 3.6 percent for the non-poor.
    While 28.8 percent of the working population within the lowest income
       quintile has not completed their basic education, this percentage is only 4.3 for
       the highest quintile.
    Likewise, while 68 percent of the working population in the lowest income
       quintile has not completed their secondary basic education, this percentage
       decreases to 17.7 percent in the highest quintile (CASEN, 2006).
 Women: Female enrollment in flexible adult education program is higher than
   male enrollment, while the opposite is true for regular adult education program.
   As shown in Figure 3, in 2008, adult female enrollment in basic education was
   only 36 percent in the regular program compared to 63.4 percent in the flexible
   one. The same is true for adult female enrollment in secondary education, with
   42.7 percent in the regular program compared to 55.6 percent in the flexible one.
   Overall, the flexible adult program implemented under the project effectively
   expanded female enrollment by 55 percent, offering the possibility to over 29,300
   adult women each year to continue their basic and/or secondary education in
   addition to the 53,000 female students enrolled in the regular adult education
   program (2008 Anuario Estadístico, MINEDUC, 2010).

   The unemployed: The sample of participants included in the impact evaluation
   study of the flexible education program indicates that the unemployment rate
   among students (i.e., 16.9 percent) was significantly higher than national average
   (9.6 percent) and the comparable regional average (10.3 percent). This difference
   in unemployment rates was higher among females, with 23.3 percent of female
   participants reportedly being unemployed compared to 9.8 percent unemployment

      among women at the national level.
    Older adults: The median age of those who enrolled in the flexible adult education
      program was 35 years old, compared to 24 years old for those enrolled in the
      regular adult education program. This indicates that the flexible education program
      is more responsive to the needs of older adults, who tend to have more time
      constraints as a result of work and/or family responsibilities. Those enrolled in
      basic education were slightly older than those enrolled in secondary education
      (i.e., 37 and 33 years old, respectively).
Expanded training opportunities
KPI 2: Data from the Chile's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows a sharp decrease in
the percentage of all SMEs using the tax-rebate training incentive between 2002 and
2005 (from 16.45 to 8.81%).6 Since the tax-rebate incentive is proportional to the payroll
and, as a result, not particularly attractive to SMEs, modifications were introduced to
enhance its attractiveness among SMEs, including raising the threshold for crediting the
tax rebate on a monthly basis. Estimates from the Chile Califica team suggest that
roughly 13.6% of SMEs were utilizing the tax-rebate training incentive in 2009 (see
Figure 4).

     It is important to note, however, that there were no lines of action under Chile
     Califica that focused on the tax-rebate training activities. Other efforts were made to
     expand access to training among SMEs beyond the tax-rebate incentive, including
     increasing SENCE's funding for training activities focusing exclusively on SMEs that
     provided training to over 12,725 workers. Although of very limited coverage given
     the total number of workers employed by SMEs (estimated to represent over 70
     percent of the country's employment), these training activities exceed the output
     target for this activity (i.e., 12,000 workers; Indicator 6, Intermediate Output
     Indicators; p. vi).

     The project has also provided support for a number of training initiatives that were
     implemented by SENCE (Table 1), including demonstrative experiences aimed at
     articulating adult learning and training (i.e., KPI 3) and ICT-based training. A total of
     102,836 individuals have benefited from these training initiatives.

     The project's most significant contribution, however, has been the establishment of the
     National Labor Competency Framework, which provides the conceptual and
     institutional framework to systematically align training with the specific labor
     demands of key sectors in Chile's economy. A total of 796 competencies
     corresponding to 315 occupational profiles in 12 economic sectors were defined
     jointly by workers and employers in accordance to the methodological standards
     developed by the Fundación Chile in collaboration with SENCE. Over 21,000 workers
     have already certified their competencies under the project. A National Labor
     Competency Certification System was established by law in 2008, permanently
     inserting the competency-based approach in Chile's institutional framework.
     The project has also fostered the alignment of the training provided by SENCE with
     the new labor competency framework. Over 12,000 workers have received
     competency-based training in sector-specific skills and more than 23,000 persons have
     received training in `transversal competencies,' such as basic computer skills and

    English (see Table 1). Moreover, under the new competency law, which created the
    National System of Labor Competencies, all publicly funded training (including the
    tax-rebate incentive and FONCAP) has to be competency-based.
 Opportunities
PDO 2 - To upgrade the skill level of the Chilean workforce to improve its productivity
         and competitiveness
The achievement of this PDO is considered to be satisfactory. Although the KPIs
originally defined for this PDO failed to capture the overall impact (see Section F.b),
evidence from impact studies indicate that the expanded learning and training
opportunities provided under Chile Califica have resulted in measurable impacts in terms
of income, productivity and formal employment among beneficiaries, which reflect their
enhanced work skills and their relevance to Chile's economy. Conversely, there is no
conclusive evidence that completing secondary education or undergoing competency
training and certification has any impact on the likelihood of being employed, at least in
the short run. The specific impacts can be summarized as follows (for a more detailed
discussion of impacts, see Annex 5):
Impact of Flexible Adult Education Program
Positive impacts in terms of income and productivity have been identified among those
who have successfully completed their secondary education under the flexible education
program.7 Specifically:
 Income and productivity
     There was a larger increase in income among adults that successfully completed
       their secondary education relative to those in the control groups, with those that
       participated having between 10-14 percent increase in their income.
     The impact is even more significant among women, younger adults (35-years old or
       younger) and those living outside the Metropolitan Region (MR).
     Productivity (measured as income per hour-week worked) increased for women,
       older adults (35 or older), and those living outside the MR.
 Lifelong learning
     Those who successfully completed their secondary education under the project, as
       compared to the control group, are significantly more likely to continue their
       studies at the tertiary level. This is particularly significant among women and
       younger adults (35 or younger). This result is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests
       that the flexible adult education program has helped promote lifelong learning
       pathways among adults who had previously fallen off the traditional educational
       pathways.
Impact of Competency-based Training and Certification
Positive impacts in terms of income, productivity and formal employment have been


7
    Three different studies examined the impact of the flexible adult education program: i) an impact study
sponsored by Chile Califica in 2003-2004; ii) a second study conducted by the evaluation experts within
the Chile Califica team using the data from the 2003-2004 study but improving among the selection of the
control group; and iii) the independent evaluation sponsored by DIPRES. Likewise, two studies examined
the impact of the competency certification program: i) an impact study sponsored by Chile Califica in
2007-2008; and ii) the independent evaluation sponsored by DIPRES.


                                                    17
identified among those who have received competency-based training and those who
participated in the competency certification program.8 Specifically:
 Income and productivity
    A positive impact on income (i.e., an income differential of roughly 6.2 percent)
      was observed among workers who participated in the competency certification
      program.
    A positive impact on both income and productivity was also observed for all
      workers who received competency-based training and also obtained the
      corresponding certification relative to those in the control group. This income effect
      was not observed for those who just received the training. Thus, it is an important
      result, as it suggests that employers place a value on the competency certification--
      i.e., serving as a guarantee for a set of well-defined skills--that is reflected in an
      income differential.
    Competency-training is particularly useful for older workers (40 and older). Those
      who received competency-based training showed a significant increase in salary
      relative to their counterparts in the control group. A positive impact on productivity
      (measured as income per hour-week) was also found for this group. This suggests
      that competency-based training helps prolong the upward trend in the income
      curve, delaying its flattening and subsequent decline.
 Employment status
    Those workers who participated in the competency certification program are more
      likely to have formal employment (i.e., with a contract) than their counterparts in
      the control group (i.e., 2.2 percent more likely).
    Those who received competency-based training also have a 4 percent higher
      likelihood of having formal employment (i.e., with a contract) than their
      counterparts in the control group. The probability of having a formal work contract
      is even higher (i.e., 7 percent) among older workers (40 and older).
All project components show a satisfactory level of achievement, except for Component
2, where performance is deemed moderately satisfactory. A detailed description of the
outcomes under each of the project's components is included in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
                                           Efficiency
Economic Efficiency
An economic analysis was conducted for the flexible adult education and competency
training and certification sub-components as part of DIPRES' impact evaluation. The
analysis took into consideration: i) the income benefits identified for these two lines of
actions under the same study; ii) the actual unitary program costs per participant,

     One study examined the impact of the competency certification program--i.e., an impact study
sponsored by Chile Califica in 2007-2008. Another study examined the impact of the competency-based
training and certification--i.e., the independent evaluation sponsored by DIPRES.



                                                18
including administrative costs; iii) the opportunity cost for participants; and iv) their
median age. The two sub-components are found to be economically efficient. The main
findings can be summarized as follows:
Flexible adult education: The stream of benefits are estimated at Ch$205,152 (roughly
US$380) per year per adult that successfully completed his/her secondary education until
retirement. In the case that the education and assessment process takes one full-time
month or less, the net present value (NPV) per participant is positive after three years of
subsequent employment. If the time invested increases to two, four, or six full-time
months, the NPV becomes positive only after four, seven and twelve years, respectively.
Given that the median age of participants is 35-years old, the adult education program is
considered to be economically efficient, as participants are expected to remain
economically active for more than twelve years (see Annex 3).
Competency training and certification: The stream of benefits are estimated at
Ch$156,300 (roughly US$294) per year per worker until retirement. In the case that the
training and certification process takes one full-time month or less, the net present value
(NPV) per participant is positive after five years of subsequent employment. If the
training and certification time increases to one-and-a-half, two, or three full-time months,
the NPV becomes positive after six, eight and eleven years, respectively. Given that the
median age of participants is 40-years old, the competency training and certification
program is considered to be economically efficient, as workers are expected to remain
economically active for more than eleven years (see Annex 3).
Financial Rate of Return
The project's financial rate of return was not estimated at appraisal or at project closing.
Fiscal Impact
The fiscal analysis conducted at appraisal focused on whether the expected incremental
recurrent cost of the project was within the capacity of MINEDUC's budget and whether
it could impose an undue financial burden for the GOC. The analysis estimated that the
project would generate an average annual recurrent liability of approximately US$12
million in 2009. As noted under Section 2.5, US$32 million were assigned to the project
under the operating budgets of the MINEDUC and the Ministry of Labor for 2010--
almost three times the amount estimated at appraisal. The 2010 budget allocation is
roughly equivalent to the counterpart funds allocated to the project in 2009, suggesting
that: i) they do not exert any significant fiscal pressures on the GOC's budget; and ii) that
the activities are considered important.

Rating: Satisfactory
Substantial progress was made under the project toward establishing the foundations of
an articulated lifelong learning and training system with the participation of the both
public and private actors. The project has served to coordinate actions between the public
sector and to set in place a system of incentives that sends consistent signals to multiple
actors within the private sector (i.e., students, workers, education and training providers,

teachers) at both the national and regional levels. Key legal instruments are now in
place, which provide the legal foundation for such system, including a new education law
that explicitly recognizes the lifelong nature of learning as well as the importance of
recognizing learning acquired in non-formal and informal settings. In this regard, the
unanimous approval by congress of the law establishing the National Competency
Certification System underscores the widespread consensus regarding the importance and
relevance of a lifelong learning and training system. Benefits derived by project
participants in terms of income differentials attest to the economic efficiency of such
system.
The project's most remarkable contribution was to enhance access and relevance of
learning and training opportunities for young adults and adults, particularly those in more
disadvantaged population groups. Specifically:
 Expanded access: The project has effectively expanded opportunities for life-long
    learning and training by successfully implementing a flexible adult education and
    literacy programs and establishing the foundations for competency-based training and
    certification.
 Enhanced relevance: By introducing, promoting and implementing a competency
    framework with the participation of workers, employers and education providers, the
    project has helped ensure that technical education and training are more responsive to
    the demand for technical skills arising from the country's key economic sectors at the
    national and regional levels, thus enhancing their overall relevance.
The project has also resulted in incremental improvements in technical education and
training in terms of quality, articulation, and information systems, including:
 Enhanced quality: The project has contributed toward strengthening technical
    education and training by implementing an accreditation system for secondary
    technical programs, enhancing teachers' skills through training and new teacher
    education programs at the tertiary level, as well as by implementing the mandatory
    certification of technical training institutions (OTECs).
 Enhanced articulation: The competency assessment and certification framework
    supported under Chile Califica facilitates the horizontal articulation between training
    and non-traditional learning, by providing a framework for the formal recognition of
    skills acquired through at work and self-learning. By bringing together multiple
    actors under the regional networks, the project has also served to demonstrate the
    potential for vertical articulation between technical education at the secondary and
    tertiary levels as well as horizontal articulation between formal education and
    informal learning.
 Enhanced information efficiency: Through vocational guidance and labor
    intermediation systems and programs, the project has helped students, workers and
    those seeking work make more informed educational and occupational choices.
As a whole, the actions supported under the Chile Califica effectively support the
country's economic and social transformation over the medium and long terms by
simultaneously reducing the social deficit and improving the country's productivity and
competitiveness in the international arena.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts



                                             20
                  Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
a) Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
Poverty impacts: The project was not conceived from a poverty reduction perspective but
rather as a human capital development intervention aimed at the dual goal of fostering
social development and improving the country's competitiveness. In this context, it has
helped improved economic conditions of individual beneficiaries of education and
training by increasing their marketable skills, which, as shown in the impact studies, has
increased their incomes and employability as well.
Unfortunately, the project's poverty impact per se was not monitored. However, income,
poverty and education statistics for Chile as a whole indicate that, by targeting those who
have not completed their basic and/or secondary education, the project is highly likely to
have an impact on poverty in the medium and long term (CASEN, 2006). Likewise, by
focusing on enhancing technical educational, the project has indirectly targeted students
in the lowest income groups, as 64.7 percent of students enrolled in secondary technical
education are in the lowest two income quintiles, CASEN, 2006).
Gender aspects: As noted earlier, women were more likely to participate in the flexible
adult education and literacy programs implemented under Chile Califica. These results
indicating higher female enrollment in flexible adult education are particularly
noteworthy, since the opposite is true for the regular adult education program, where
females accounted for less than half of the enrollment. This higher representation of
females should be considered positively, given the relative disadvantages of women in
terms of educational achievements. Specifically, females tend to have fewer years of
schooling than males--i.e., 10 and 10.3 years, respectively. Likewise, illiteracy rates are
also higher among women, equivalent to 4.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent for men
(CASEN, 2006).
The impact assessment studies indicate that women who successfully completed their
secondary education under the program experienced a positive impact on income and
productivity. They are also more likely to continue their studies. The impacts are even
more significant among younger women
Social development: The project was inclusive by nature. It expanded access to lifelong
education opportunities not only to the poor and women, but also to other vulnerable
groups, including those living in remote rural areas, indigenous populations, and prison
inmates. These groups are lagging behind in terms human development. For example,
there is a wide difference in level of education between urban and rural areas: while only
11.4 percent of the urban working population has not completed their basic education,
this percentage increases to 35.7 for the rural working population (CASEN, 2006). The
same is true for indigenous populations:9 while 9.2 percent of the indigenous population
had no formal schooling in 2003 and 37.7percent had failed to complete their primary
education, the corresponding figures for the non-indigenous population were 4.6 percent
and 24.4percent, respectively (CASEN, 2003). The Mapuche population, which was
specifically targeted under the project, exhibits the highest incidence of poverty together
with the Aymará (CASEN, 2003).

(b) Institutional change and strengthening
Remarkable progress has been made toward the establishment of a Lifelong Learning and
Training System and its corresponding legal framework. In this regard, it is important to
note that actual progress on the legislative front has been much more substantive than
anticipated at appraisal. Specifically:
General Education Law (Law No. 20.370; 12 September 2009)
The Chile Califica team contributed to the design of this important piece of legislation,
which drastically changed the conceptualization of education and provides the
foundations for the development of a lifelong learning and training system by:

   Explicitly recognizing the importance and the need to support lifelong learning (Art.
   2);
   Introducing flexible and semi-distance education modalities (Arts. 23 and 32);
   Explicitly acknowledging different types of learning, including formal, non-formal
   (i.e., training) and informal obtained through work experience, self-instruction, etc.
   (Art. 2);
   Requiring the development of certification mechanisms to recognize knowledge
   acquired through informal learning (Art. 41);
   Creating a new level in technical adult education--i.e., occupational education or
   `oficios' (Art. 43).
National Competency Certification System - NCCS (Law No. 20.267; 3 January 2008):
Chile Califica was a critical catalyst in the development and implementation of Chile's
National Competency Framework (NCF). The NCF provides the foundation for the
definition of sets of skills-based competencies that are needed to adequately perform
specific jobs in various economic sectors. In addition, these skills-based competencies
provide the curricular foundations of lifelong learning that begins in an educational
setting and continues with life-long education, training and experience. Further, by being
collaboratively defined by employers and workers, the NCF can help align the demand
and supply dimensions of labor skills, thus maximizing the potential benefits for both
employers and employees and the overall relevance of learning and training processes.
The Chile Califica team played a key role in the design of the NCCS legislation, which
received unanimous approval by Congress in January 2008. This law defines the process
of competency certification as well as the responsible institutional actors under the newly
established National System of Competency Certification (Sistema Nacional de
Certificación de Competencias Laborales - SNCCL). In addition, this law:
 Regulates the process of certification of competencies, independently of the manner in
   which these competencies have been acquired;
 Establishes the National Competency Certification Commission , its constitution,
   financing mechanisms, and functioning;
 It defines a set of transparent evaluation and certification mechanisms, as well as an
   overall methodology;
 It requires that publicly funded training programs be based on competencies when
   these have been already defined.
 It explicitly recognizes the competencies that were defined under Chile Califica as
   well as the workers who obtained competency certification.


                                             22
c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts
Cross-fertilization at the international level: This project has generated international
interest. Chile was one of seven countries to be included in an OECD-financed study to
assess labor intermediation and vocational orientation management information systems
(i.e., sub-component 3.x). There has been collaboration with the Korea Research Institute
for Vocational Education and Training. Likewise, there has been substantial interest in
the independent learning and certification assessment system among other countries in
the region, sparked in part by the International Seminar on Learning Assessment that that
took place in Santiago in December 2008.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys were included under the impact studies focusing on the adult flexible
education program, competency-based training and certification, and vocational guidance.
Participants report high levels of satisfaction in all cases. They also report substantial
perceived benefits from these three lines of action (see Annex 5 for a more detailed
description).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
         Factors Affecting the Sustainability of Chile Califica's Achievements
Rating: Moderate
Overall, the risk that the progress made under Chile Califica toward developing a lifelong
learning and training system might not be maintained is considered to be Moderate. The
closing of the project takes place at a time of particular fluidity in Chile, as the 2010
presidential election ended twenty years of Concertación governments, which were give
continuity to major reforms across changes in political leadership. With the victory of the
opposition, the Alianza por Chile, the transition in political leadership might be less
seamless than previous ones; thus, generating additional uncertainties regarding the
sustainability of the actions supported Chile Califica. However, the broad support
generated for the development of a lifelong learning and training system among various
constituencies and within each of the sector ministers is expected to contribute to its
overall sustainability. The sustainability risks for the various components of the lifelong
learning and training system can be summarized as follows:
 Adult education activities ­ Low risk
   MINEDUC is working on ensuring the technical, financial and institutional
   sustainability of the various initiatives that were implemented under its orbit,
   including the flexible modality for adult education, the learning assessment and
   certification system, the Contigo Aprendo literacy program, the certification of
   technical specialization programs, the dual technical education program, vocational
   guidance, etc. This institutionalization process is taking place under the umbrella of
   the ongoing Adult Education Reform, which is affecting the organization of
   MINEDUC as a whole; thus, its final form is still to be defined.
 Training-related activities ­ Low risk
   The project lines implemented under SENCE are also being mainstreamed into its
   permanent structure. Some examples of this institutionalization process include: i) the


                                             23
   requirement that all training financed through public funds, including the training tax-
   rebate, utilize the competency framework adult education services, as mandated by
   Law No. 20.267; ii) the administration of the Chilean standard No. 2728 to ensure
   quality of training providers (OTECs) paid by the tax-rebate incentive; iii) the training
   fund for SMEs administered by SENCE (i.e., FONCAP). More importantly, the
   competency framework now permeates all SENCE's actions, as reflected by the new
   organizational structure which places it as a transversal function under the orbit of
   strategic planning.
   National Competency Certification System ­ Moderate to high risk
   The NCCS' permanent insertion ultimately depends on the acceptance of workers and
   employers. As established by Law No. 20.267, the financing formula for the newly
   established NCSS calls for a 49/51 percent mix of public and private resources. This
   financing formula makes it critical that a demand for competency certification is
   generated among both employers and workers, which, in turn, depends on the ability
   to demonstrate positive benefits for both groups in the near future. For employers, the
   potential benefits from competency certification are associated to a more efficient
   human resource management in the areas of hiring, promotion and training as a result
   of improved information on workers' labor skills and gaps. For workers, the potential
   benefits from competency certification are associated to increases in income and
   employability as a result of both of the formal accreditation of the labor skills they
   posses and the possibility to further enhance them more effectively through
   competency training paths. Although the impact studies have provided some evidence
   of these benefits, they are far from being widely recognized.
   Thus, although the NCCS is now established by law, its ultimate sustainability
   depends on its social acceptance, which is still to be achieved. Moreover, there are
   significant barriers that limit the insertion of competency certification among SMEs,
   which are vital for the country's economic and social development.
   Vertical and horizontal articulation ­ Moderate to high risk
   One of the sector issues identified at appraisal was the lack of vertical curriculum
   articulation between secondary and tertiary technical education, which continues to be
   a challenge. Private and public tertiary technical-professional institutions, especially
   those operating in a two-year track system, function in a context void of any state
   education policy and strategy. Therefore, there is a lack of a curriculum articulation
   and pedagogical progression for students graduating from secondary schools
   continuing their technical-professional education in tertiary education institutions.
   Likewise, there are very few `bridges' to facilitate progression within the tertiary
   system, as it is difficult to move from lower tertiary technical training to university
   study in the same discipline without starting again from scratch. The same is true
   regarding horizontal articulation, as there are no systematic mechanisms to formally
   recognize learning acquired in non-traditional learning settings. Moreover, the
   curriculum at some technical institutions is outdated and lacks relevance in relation to
   the needs of the private sector.
   While some demonstrative initiatives were implemented under Chile Califica's
   regional networks, the need to foster vertical and horizontal articulation remains as
   one of the most important challenges of developing a lifelong learning and training
   system. In this regard, the creation of a National Qualifications Framework (NQF) has


                                             24
   been identified as a potentially effective institutional response to this problem. Such
   Framework would embrace all qualifications, academic and vocational, from
   secondary level up to doctoral levels, possibly building upon competency framework
   developed under Chile Califica. This Framework could be designed to facilitate access
   to tertiary institutions for students from all backgrounds, including vocational
   secondary schooling, work and previous tertiary study, as well as to facilitate transfer
   between institutions and progression from lower to higher level degrees within the
   tertiary system by including arrangements for credit accumulation and transfer. To
   support this, credits from all tertiary education institutions should be made compatible.
   The Framework could also provide for recognition of equivalent qualifications
   nationally and internationally, and for accreditation of previous learning.
   Qualifications should be based on outcomes and competencies achieved rather than on
   time/hours of study put in. In this way, a National Qualifications Framework could
   help and encourage lifelong learning. Developing such Framework is a major
   challenge, as it requires coordinated actions from a wide set of actors, including
   tertiary education institutions, which are highly independent.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
                              Bank's Performance
a. Bank's Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
 The Bank's preparation team worked in close partnership with the Borrower,
   contributing its expertise in the education sector gained in previous projects. It also
   brought the stat-of-the-art knowledge to project preparation, building upon similar
   systems developed in countries such as United Kingdom and Australia that were at the
   forefront in the development of lifelong learning systems.
 As underscored by the QAE review, the project was well prepared. Its design was
   highly innovative, as it creatively integrated knowledge about effective learning,
   credible certification of that learning, and the incentives that would encourage players
   to deliver and make good use of market-relevant training.
 Some of the shortcomings were the lack of a robust results framework, particularly in
   terms of outcome indicators as well as of instruments for systematic learning and
   evaluation to fully capitalize on the experimental nature of the project. In addition, the
   design of Component 2 lacked enough clarity and focus.
b. Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
 The project was well supervised, with regular field missions and in-depth supervision
  reports. Sector managers followed project implementation closely, as reflected by their
  detailed comments in ISRs and PSRs. Missions lasted up to two weeks and often
  included visits to the regions where the project was being implemented. A wide array
  of specialists was included in the supervision missions, contributing valuable expertise
  on adult education, technical education, labor-based competency assessment and
  certification systems, as well as procurement and financial management. The Bank's
  team also made it possible for the Chile Califica team to have first-hand exposure to


                                              25
    other relevant international experiences through study tours and other cross-
    fertilization activities.
 The first Bank TTL, who was also responsible for the project's design, was also
    responsible for its supervision until late 2005. This continuity permitted an in-depth
    involvement with the project in both conceptual and implementation matters.
    Although the subsequent TTLs (i.e., the project had a total of four TTLs) put
    significant energies in the project and supervised it effectively, their increasingly
    shorter tenures made it difficult to maintain the same level of involvement. The
    complex nature of the project made it challenging for both the Bank staff and the Chile
    Califica team to cope with the high rotation of TTLs.
 With the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that a formal restructuring of the
    project was warranted to reflect the shift resulting from the 2004-2005 self-assessment
    exercise and to strengthen the PRF. In this regard, advancing the date of the Mid-Term
    Review (MTR) from 2006 as originally planned to end-2004 was not beneficial, as the
    MTR would have provided a good opportunity to restructure the project to introduce
    the needed adjustments. Sector managers and TTLs emphasized the importance of
    enhancing M&E activities throughout the life of the project and substantial efforts
    were made to complement the weak PRF, including identifying complementary
    indicators, requesting a set of impact evaluation studies, and providing TA to the Chile
    Califica team in terms of evaluation.
c. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank's Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 Overall, the Bank's performance is considered satisfactory, as it effectively supported
   the GOC in the complex task of establishing the foundations of a lifelong learning and
   training system while exhibiting the flexibility needed to support the Borrower's own
   vision.
                               Borrower's Performance
a. Government's Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 The GOC provided its full support to the operation, as evidence by its funding of the
   project that was more than twice the amount originally anticipated.
 The three line ministries (i.e., MINEDUC, Labor, and Economy) provided their
   sustained support for the project throughout its implementation.
b. Implementing Agencies' Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 The Borrower was intensively involved in the design of the project. Throughout the
  project's lifetime, it exhibited strong ownership of the project, clear strategic vision, a
  sense of self-direction, willingness to learn by doing, and ability to reflect. Given the
  project's conceptual and logistical complexity, sound project management was a
  necessary condition for its successful implementation. As mentioned above, stability
  within the PCU's management brought much needed continuity in the overall's
  strategic vision. The PCU's ability to bring multiple stakeholders on board and build
  consensus among a wide spectrum of actors with a very diverse set of interests was
  one of its main strengths.


                                              26
    The self-assessment exercise conducted in 2004 resulted in a more systemic approach
    and a more ambitious institutionalization agenda, which proved critical to the success
    and sustainability of the project.
 The implementation of the project at the regional level added complexity. The PCU
    effectively coordinate these efforts, effectively balancing the empowerment of
    regional actors, both from the Chile Califica teams as well as MINEDUC and SENCE
    with its own coordinating and normative role.
 The implementation of regional networks in particular posed substantial management
    demands on the PCU, which hindered the possibility to systematically learn from such
    a broad spectrum of experiences at the regional level. For future operations, it might
    be useful to separate the M&E functions from those of project management to ensure
    that systematic M&E and learning can provide feedback during implementation.
 Monitoring of KPIs was uneven and generally weak. The outcome KIPs in the PAD
    were not systematically monitored, even those that were under the sphere of the PCU.
    This weakness was somewhat offset by the PCU's willingness to contract several
    studies (of which three are already completed) to assess the performance and impact of
    key lines of action under the program.
 SENCE also exhibited a sound performance in its role as co-implementing agency,
    despite slow start-up and implementation pace at the onset.
c. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower's Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 Overall, the Borrower's performance was satisfactory, as illustrated by the substantial
  progress achieved toward the implementation of a lifelong learning and training
  system and the supporting legal instruments.

6. Lessons Learned
            Lessons Learned from the Implementation of Chile Califica
Lessons of wide general application
   Lifelong learning and training is crucial both from equity and efficiency
   perspectives.
   In the context of Chile's lifelong learning and training system, the development of
   human capital is solidly grounded in the country's needs to support its integration into
   the world economy as well as its social deficit. By better aligning technical education
   and training with the labor demands from key economic sectors, this system is
   expected to enhance the country's international competitiveness as well as the
   employability and income of technical workers.
   The inter-sectoral, multi-actor nature of lifelong education and training systems
   poses significant challenges to their successful implementation.
   An adequate lifelong learning and training system necessarily involves diverse players
   that are in themselves heterogeneous, both in the public and private spheres. In the
   case of Chile Califica, it required the coordinated action of three line ministers (i.e.,
   MINEDUC, Labor and Economy). It also required close interactions with the private
   sector (i.e., in Chile, much of the education is privately provided) as well as among
   various private actors (including workers, firms, and economic sectors in the case of


                                             27
   labor competencies).
   Given the high level of coordination required, a highly participatory approach
   that includes pilot experiences to demonstrate the potential gains to the various
   players appears to be crucial.
   The success of Chile Califica was not the result of having a strong `champion' with
   high visibility within the public or private spheres who advocated for the development
   of a lifelong learning and training system. Rather, it was the result of gradually
   introducing an overall framework that addressed many of the weaknesses in the
   existing educational and training system in a comprehensive and integrated manner.
   Individual stakeholders were incorporated early on into the process, offering them
   opportunities to capitalize on the potential benefits of such system through pilot
   experiences. Moreover, the `marketing' of the lifelong learning and training system
   was framed in terms of economic incentives for the various actors within the private
   sector.
   Balancing sound public policy at the central level with an effective territorial
   insertion is of critical importance to successfully address local conditions.
   Although the implementation of the project at the regional level resulted in added
   complexity, it ensured its relevancy at the regional level. The PCU effectively
   balanced the empowerment of regional actors with its own normative role.
   A sound system of incentives is crucial to the successful implementation of
   education programs. Chile Califica's flexible adult education program was
   conceived as a demand-driven, results-oriented program. These characteristics were
   crucial determinants of the program's success and served to keep supervision at a
   minimum. Specifically:
     Demand-driven nature (i.e., students signed up at individual education providers
        of their choice): It served, among others, to: i) maximize the enrollment of
        motivated students; ii) ensure a good match between educational providers and
        the student in terms of location, schedules, etc.; iii) ensure the students'
        satisfaction with the services provided, as they could `vote with the feet' and
        change providers for subsequent courses; and iv) promote competition among
        education providers.
     Results-oriented nature (i.e., an independently administered examination and
        certification system was used to determine: a) whether students passed and, b)
        whether the educational provider received payment--i.e., payment was contingent
        upon individual students passing the exam): It served to, among others, to: i)
        ensure a minimum level of competency among all students that successfully
        passed the corresponding examinations; and ii) motivate providers to ensure that
        students achieve the minimum level of competency required to pass the exam. In
        this way, providers devised multiple strategies to minimize absenteeism and drop-
        out rates and to maximize learning. In some cases, monetary incentives were also
        provided to teachers who achieved a certain success rate.
   Models for lifelong learning and training systems are country-specific and,
   therefore, are not easily transferable.
   Chile's lifelong learning and training system effectively responds to the roles played
   by the public and private sectors in the country. Specifically, the government tends to
   play a limited role, which, in the case of the lifelong learning and training system is

                                            28
  limited to quality assurance, financing, and light regulation. Concomitantly, there is a
  significant engagement of the private sector in public life, including the provision of
  education and training. While other developing countries can certainly learn from this
  innovative project, Chile's special characteristics mean that these ideas cannot be
  exported easily or wholesale.
Project-specific lessons
   Having a sound Results Framework in place makes supervision and the final ICR
   evaluation a lot easier.
   The various attempts made during implementation to improve the PRF by dropping
   and adding some KIPs to overcome this weakness in the project's design. In
   retrospect, it would have been better to re-design the PRF as part of the mid-term
   review.
   Projects with a strong experimental nature, such as Chile Califica, lend
   themselves for the utilization of more flexible lending instruments, such as APLs.
   To some extent, the project's weak PRF, its enormous logistical complexity, with
   numerous lines of actions that were piloted and subsequently dropped or modified, and
   the deviation from the Borrower's own implementation strategy from 2004 onward
   were the result of the rigidities of the lending instrument and the cumbersome
   procedures to restructure them.
   The design of ongoing learning and evaluation instruments cannot be an after-
   thought, particularly in the case of innovative projects with substantial learning
   by doing.
   The knowledge generation and management functions need to be a high priority from
   the onset of the project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

ChileCalifica was created with the objective of solving problems related to Human
Capital development in Chile by implementing different courses of action, which
articulated as a whole, set the basis of a Lifelong Learning System (LLS). This system
aimed to expand opportunities for the adult population to access basic or middle
education, and to contribute to the generation of training pathways that link the various
levels of technical training more effectively, providing further mechanisms of learning
recognition, which are gateways for people from the labor market to start or continue
their education, taking their acquired skills as a starting point.

ChileCalifica considers that the LLS should improve national relevance of learning
supply and guarantee access to learning opportunities throughout life with a minimum
cost in terms of time and budget. Thus, people are able to acquire increasing levels of
skills which will allow them to develop and enter productively into the labor market,
contributing to business and to the national economy.

The LLS also sought to generate a more permanent link between the sphere of education,
employment and regional development by motivating the implementation of a curriculum


                                            29
based on the concept of skill in different levels of educational institutions, and also by
establishing a new institutional environment that would contribute to strengthening
capabilities in the market labor. Additionally, the system intended to foster the
recognition and certification of skills, regardless of how they were acquired.

These important and complex challenges taken on by the Program in 2002 were crucial
for social equity ­around 48% of people aged between 15 and 65 had less than 12 years
of schooling- as well as for competitiveness and economic insertion. For this reason, the
LLS under construction aims at providing leveling of studies, higher and mid level
technical education, training, and certification of skills.

ChileCalifica represents an unprecedented effort in terms of public policy following a
proposal to contribute to setting up the basis of a new education policy which involves
coordination between three ministries over a relatively short period of time. In this
respect, we want to highlight the World Bank's input; the Bank accompanied us
throughout the Loan's validity period, providing recommendations and materials,
facilitating execution of commitments in the Loan Agreement and new ones that arose as
a result of the work carried out.

Given the positive lessons learned from ChileCalifica, it is hoped that the launch of the
different areas can be undertaken by national institutions. Training Quality Assurance,
Skills Based Training, SME Training and Certification of Skills are already part of the
SENCE, the Skills Framework is under the National Skills Certification System
Commission and the Initial Training and Updating of Technical Instructors in the
Improvement, Experience and Pedagogical Research Center (CPEIP) which depends on
the Ministry of Education. During 2010, Adult Education components and others related
with technical education will be taken on by the Ministry of Education.

During 2010, as well as continuing to strengthen institutions which manage components,
a conceptual, methodological and strategic proposal of institutionalization including
public and private actors, will be developed for the Qualifications Framework (the
organizing and integrating subsystem of the LLS) in order to have the Lifelong Learning
System functioning in 2011. In addition, the following challenges: functioning of the
Skills Certification System; strengthening of industrial capacities; strengthening of Basic,
Middle and Higher Technical Training supply quality; development of the LLS's
capacity to achieve territorial equity and adjustment of public institutions to meet the
requirements of the multi-sectoral LLS.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 - Providing new opportunities for lifelong learning and training
Description: This component aimed to reduce the social deficit which impacts 4.5
million adults who have completed less than the eight grades of basic education as well
as another 2 million adults who have completed basic education but have not completed
their secondary education. Whereas the new opportunities generated by the project were
to be generally available to all the 6.5 million adults lacking basic and/or secondary
education in Chile, the project was targeted to adults belonging to the three lowest
income-deciles and to workers from small and medium enterprises (SMES).
Level of achievement: Highly Satisfactory
Strengths      A more flexible, demand-driven adult education modality (so-called
                 Nivelación de Estudios), was effectively scaled-up under the program.
               Approximately 448,960 adult students were enrolled in the flexible
                 adult education program, exceeding the original target of 120,000
                 students by 3.7 times.
               A total of 149,346 adult students completed their basic and/or secondary
                 education, exceeding the target of 120,000 students by roughly 25%.
               The flexible education program effectively expanded enrollment in
                 adult education--equivalent to an expansion in enrollment of 40% in
                 2008.
               An independent learning assessment and certification system has been
                 effectively developed and implemented, constituting the first of its kind
                 in Latin America.
               The flexible adult education model has also been adapted to specifically
                 target vulnerable population groups, such as female household heads,
                 indigenous population, population in remote rural areas, and convicts.
               The Contigo Aprendo program is successfully supporting over 100,000
                 adults in developing basic reading and writing skills.
               Pilot activities aimed at linking adult education and training were
                 implemented as planned.
               Several initiatives were implemented in an effort to apply information
                 and communication technologies (ICTs) to learning with roughly
                 250,000 beneficiaries.
Pending        While the overall number of adult students exceeded the original target
challenges       (i.e., 120,000 students), the proportions for basic and secondary
                 education were inverted. Only 39,830 students completed their basic
                 education as opposed to the 71,500 students that were anticipated.
                 Conversely, 109,516 adult students completed their secondary education
                 as opposed to the 48,500 that were expected. This indicates that the
                 demand for completing the secondary education is higher than
                 anticipated, while the reverse is true for basic education.
               The flexible adult education program still needs to incorporate the new
                 adult education curriculum adopted in July 2009 (Decree No. 257 of
                 July 2009).


                                            32
                  It would be important to find alternative mechanisms (including
                  financial mechanism for providers) to further expand enrollment, which
                  seems to have reached a plateau.
                Retention and completion rates still require further improvement.
                The learning assessment and certification system could also be applied
                  for those seeking to complete their basic and secondary studies by
                  taking equivalence exams--i.e., without attending the regular or flexible
                  education programs.
                None of the pilot activities aimed at linking adult education and training
                  evolved into permanently institutionalized interventions.
Specific outputs defined in the PAD for this component
   Offering the opportunity for about 71,500 adults to complete their basic education
   and to another 48,500 adults their secondary education.
   Achieved. A total of 149,346 adult students completed their basic and/or secondary
   education, exceeding the target of 120,000 students by roughly 25%. The
   proportions for basic and secondary education graduates, however, were inverted.
   Only 39,830 students completed their basic education as opposed to the 71,500
   students that were anticipated. Conversely, 109,516 adult students completed their
   secondary education as opposed to the 48,500 that were expected. This indicates that
   the demand for completing the secondary education is higher than anticipated, while
   the reverse is true for basic education.
   Ensure that about 120,000 adults complete and certify their basic and/or secondary
   education.
   Achieved. Approximately 448,960 adult students were enrolled in the flexible adult
   education program, exceeding the original target of 120,000 students by 3.7 times.
   About 12,000 workers of approximately 6,000 SMES are being trained by the
   project.
   Achieved. A total of 600 courses benefiting 12,725 SME workers were provided by
   SENCE under the program. These courses were designed in collaboration with
   SMES, as a direct response to their training needs.
   About 18,500 adults incorporated in pilot projects that articulate adult education with
   training.
   Not achieved. This line of action was not implemented.
   Develop about 75 distance adult training modules benefiting about 250,000 adults
   using these learning materials and means.
   Achieved. Several initiatives were implemented in an effort to apply information
   and communication technologies (ICTs) to learning, including: 270 digital
   alphabetization courses in eight regions of the country, 227 courses on basic
   computer skills--i.e., International Computer Driver License (ICDL) certification
   throughout the country; and 1,354 e-learning courses.
   About 2,500 adults will benefit from pilot programs articulating adult education with
   training.
   Partially achieved. A total of 1,980 adults benefited from 120 courses offered in
   ten regions of the country as pilot programs that offered both education and job
   training. This was an experimental line of action, which was not scaled-up given the
   logistical complexities that became apparent during the pilot..

In-depth analysis of initiatives under Component 1 to expand learning
opportunities
 Flexible Adult Basic and Secondary (i.e., Nivelación de Estudios - Decreto Supremo
   de Educación N° 131/2003)
   Description:
   The flexible adult education program targets young adults and adults seeking to begin
   or complete their basic and/or secondary education. It provides an alternative to the
   regular adult educational modality, responding more flexibly to the needs of working
   adults, including:
     More flexible schedules in terms of hours, frequency, and duration of the
        courses, which better respond to the needs and lifestyles of adult students.
     More flexible pedagogical strategies, which take into consideration previous
        learning and learning patterns of adult students.
     More flexibility in terms of the venues, which are located in the proximity of
        places of residence and work of the adult students as a result of the demand-
        driven section of providers.
     There is now a public and open register of providers located throughout the
        country (i.e., 1,100 entities as of Dec. 2009). They include a wide variety of
        institutions, including municipalities, non-governmental organization, OTECs,
        and educational institutions.
     Students are evaluated through a newly established National Evaluation and
        Certification System (i.e., Sistema Nacional de Evaluación y Certificación de
        Estudios). Students have three opportunities to pass the exams. Exams are
        offered four times per years for each educational level.
     Providers are paid based on results (i.e., number of students who successfully
        pass the evaluation and certification tests).
     Students are provided with educational materials.
    Specific Outputs:
     Its implementation began in 2003 in 13 regions of the country. By 2008, its
        territorial coverage had extended all the 15 regions in the country.
     Approximately 427.861adult students were enrolled in the flexible adult
        education program during the life of the program.
     A total of 149,346 adult students completed their education under the flexible
        adult education modality, including 39,830 in basic education and 109,516 in
        secondary education.
     Chile Califica's flexible adult education has effectively expanded coverage. In
        2008, enrollment in adult education expanded by 40%, as Chile Califica's
        flexible modality added over 50,000 adults students to the 130,000 ones that are
        enrolled in regular adult education (see Table 2.1).
     The expanded coverage has varied across regions. In some regions, such as the
        Region II, it has more than doubled overall enrollment in adult education (see
        Table 2.1).
     In 2008, Chile Califica's flexible adult education represented roughly 28 percent


                                           34
   of the total enrollment in adult education (Table 2.1).
   In some regions, such as Regions II and XIV, the flexible modality represented
   almost half of all adult enrollment in 2008 (see Table 2.1).
   The contribution of Chile Califica's flexible modality has been roughly the same
   for both basic and secondary education--expanding adult enrollment by
   approximately 40% and representing 28% of total adult enrollment (Tables 2.2
   and 2.3).
   Adult enrollment in basic and secondary education was around 20% and 80%,
   respectively, in 2008, for both regular and flexible modalities. This is inversely
   proportional to the percentage of adults with incomplete basic and secondary
   education--i.e., estimated at 70% and 30%, respectively. Thus, it indicates that
   those with incomplete secondary are more likely to seek to complete their studies
   than those with incomplete basic education.

   `Contigo Aprendo' literacy program
   Description:
   This is a non-traditional literacy program targeting young adults and adults that cannot
   read and write or those with less than four years of schooling. It is aimed at developing
   students' basic competencies in reading comprehension, writing, and mathematics,
   with the ultimate objective of facilitating their social insertion.
   During six months, students attend classes for a minimum of six hours per week
   distributed in two or three sessions at days and times mutually agreed by participants
   and instructors. Classes are held in places that are conveniently located close to the
   students' places of residence, such as schools, community centers, and churches.
    Specific Outputs:
     Its implementation began in 2003 in six regions of the country.
     By 2009, its territorial coverage had extended to ten of the country's 15 regions.
     Between 2003 and 2006, approximately 90,000 adults have benefited from this
        program.
     The program has benefited females in particular, which constituted 71.4 percent
        of the program's beneficiaries in 2008.

Component 2. Improving the quality and increasing the coverage of technical-
professional education
Description: This component aimed to achieve four objectives: i) a curricular (i.e.,
vertical) articulation between grades 11 and 12 of all the technical secondary schools and
the tertiary technical-professional institutions; ii) to ensure that the secondary and tertiary
technical education provided in a given region of the country is relevant to the labor
market demands of the region and of appropriate quality (i.e., horizontal alignment); iii)


                                                    37
the validation by the education system of the skills acquired on the job and/or in the
training institutions; and iv) to increase the coverage and improve the quality of tertiary
technical education.
Level of achievement: Moderately Satisfactory
Strengths        A total of 25 articulation networks were implemented and an additional
                   nine are under implementation. These networks have been beneficial in
                   terms of binging regional actors together to promote the curricular
                   integration of secondary and tertiary technical education programs in
                   areas that are relevant to the regional economies.
                 These networks have generated 26 vocational pathways (itinerarios) in
                   ten economic sectors.
                 An accreditation system is now in place for technical secondary
                   education programs. A total of 2,050 programs were audited during the
                   project's lifespan, of which 1,430 were accredited.
                 Over 3,500 technical teachers received training under the project.
                 A pilot experience is being implemented to support the development of
                   mechanisms to formally recognize individuals' previous knowledge and
                   skills experience and give them the corresponding credit hours toward
                   formal education programs.
                 A university consortium has developed a competency-based technical
                   teaching program that will be implemented in five universities.
                 A pilot experience in dual education (i.e., a technical education
                   modality that combines in-class learning and job internships as part of
                   the curricula) that was initially supported by GTZ has been scaled-up
                   under the program. Presently, a total of 222 technical secondary schools
                   have adopted the dual education modality, with a total enrollment of
                   25,151 and the participation of 9,629 firms.
Pending          This component lacked definition in terms of its overall objectives and
challenges         the activities to be implemented from the onset. In practice, it
                   functioned as an incubator to test a multiple interventions that had, as a
                   common denominator, the objective of enhancing coverage and quality
                   of technical education. Although these interventions were overly
                   ambitious--for example, they tackled the difficult challenge of
                   integrating the technical education at the secondary and tertiary levels,
                   as well as promoting the formal recognition of previously acquired
                   knowledge--they lacked the corresponding political support or
                   authority. As a result, bottom-up initiatives were generated, resulting in
                   implementation process that was slow, incremental in nature, overly
                   complex and difficult to monitor systematically.
                 Itineraries to be applied universally (i.e., across regions) have not yet
                   evolved from the implementation of the regional articulation networks.
                Competencies defined under the articulation networks followed a different
                methodology than the ones developed by Fundación Chile in collaboration
                with SENCE under Component 3. As no competencies were certified
                under the articulation networks, it is still pending whether these
                competencies will be recognized under the new National Competency

               Framework. A study regarding the validation of standards developed by
               the regional networks is ongoing and would be delivered to the National
               Competency Framework for its evaluation.
                Accreditation of secondary technical programs is not mandatory at this
                  point.
Specific outputs defined in the PAD for this component
   40 proposals aligning technical secondary schools with technical-professional
   education (through technological curricular pathways) and with the employment and
   labor sectors being implemented in regional networks constituted under the project.
   Partially achieved: A total of 34 articulation networks are to be implemented under
   the program (i.e., 25 networks have been implemented and an additional nine are still
   under implementation). This is equivalent to roughly 85 percent achievement. These
   networks have been demonstrative in nature, generating 26 vocational pathways
   (itinerarios) in ten economic sectors. While these networks have been beneficial in
   terms of binging regional actors together to promote the curricular integration of
   secondary and tertiary technical education programs in areas that are relevant to the
   regional economies, no results have emerged that could be applied universally.
   Moreover, the actual impact of these articulation networks in terms of the number of
   new programs established, enrollment, graduation, and transition rates is unknown,
   although these variables were to be systematically tracked under the project.
   About 65,000 students enrolled in pertinent technical-professional education
   programs of appropriate quality in the 40 regional networks.
   N.A.: Information is not available.
   Reduction in the repetition and dropout rates in grades 11 and 12 of technical
   secondary schools and tertiary technical-professional education.
   N.A.: Information is not available.
   Increase in the transition rates from grade 12 to tertiary education, in particular in the
   technical branch.
   Achieved: Data from the first set of regional networks show that secondary technical
   education graduates have increased their share of enrollment in tertiary technical
   education institutions--from 31.6% to 50.9% between 2003 and 2008. This trend,
   together with the overall increase in enrollment in tertiary technical education
   indicate higher transition rates from secondary to tertiary technical education.
   Approved graduation standards in 662 technical secondary schools in the entire
   country benefiting about 142,000 students.
   Achieved: Previously characterized by its curricular disorder, secondary technical
   education has now only 46 approved programs. An accreditation system has been
   implemented for these 46 programs. A total of 2,050 programs were audited during
   the project's lifespan, of which 1,430 were accredited. Accreditation remains
   voluntary at this point.
   Improved system of Technical Tertiary Institutions (Centros de Formación Técnica ­
   CFTs).
   N.A.: No specific actions were implemented under the project to improve the CFT
   system. Although enrollment in CFTs has increased by 78% over the life of the
   project, this was mainly as a result of massive increases in financial aid for tertiary
   education as a whole.

    About 5,000 technical education teachers benefiting from improved pre and in-
    service teacher training programs.
    Partially achieved: A total of 3,564 technical education teachers were trained,
    including 2,402 through teacher training and 1,162 through teacher development
    networks.
Component 3. Establishing instruments to support the provision of a lifelong
learning and training services.
Description: This component aimed at developing a national competency certification
system--that is, a system of flexible vocational-professional pathways based on the
general occupational standards) and sector-specific competencies required by the labor
market in selected sectors of the economy, providing at the same time opportunities for
certification and complementation of the individual's knowledge regardless of the means
and sources of learning acquisition. This component also supported the development of
an integrated lifelong-learning management information system.
Level of achievement: Satisfactory
Strengths       The National Competency Certification System was established by law
                   in 2008.
                A total of 796 competencies corresponding to 315 occupational profiles
                   in 12 economic sectors were defined jointly by workers and employers
                   in accordance to the methodological standards developed by the
                   Fundación Chile in collaboration with SENCE.
                Over 20,000 workers have certified their sector-specific competencies.
                Over 12,000 workers have received competency-based training in
                   sector-specific skills and more than 23,000 persons have received
                   training in `transversal competencies,' such as basic computer skills and
                   English.
                Certification is now mandatory for training institutes (OTECs),
                   requiring them to meet the operational standards defined under Chilean
                   Standard No. 2728. A total of 2,294 OTECs have already obtained this
                   certification.
                Vocational guidance plans developed under the program were
                   implemented in 1,380 secondary schools with an enrolment of 670,000
                   students.
                Training has been provided to 419 staff members of the municipal
                   Labor Intermediation Offices (OMILs).
                Three websites have been developed as a first step toward the
                   development of an integrated labor intermediation and vocational
                   guidance information system, with more than 2.7 million visitors.
Pending         While the websites and vocational and career guidance activities
challenges         constitute a solid first step, the development of an integrated lifelong-
                   learning management information system is still pending.
Specific outputs defined in the PAD for this component
    Establishing in nine sectors of the Chilean economy: (i) a set of generic skills and
    transferable competencies; (ii) an assessment system of the competencies acquired by
    graduates of the training modules provided by the accredited providers; (iii) a system


                                             40
  to certify assessed competencies; (iv) vocational-professional pathways; (v) an
  accreditation system of private and public providers of skill-training and (vi)
  graduation standards.
   Achieved: Actual achievements have amply surpassed expectations. A National
  Competency Certification System has been established by law in 2008. Under the
  project, a total of 796 competencies corresponding to 315 occupational profiles in 12
  sectors of the economy (i.e., mining, tourism, construction, wine production, food
  processing, mechanics, logistics and transport, fishing, fish farming, export
  agriculture, gas and electricity) have been defined jointly by employers and worker
  representatives according to the standards defined by the Fundación Chile working in
  collaboration with SENCE.
  About 29,000 workers in the nine economic sectors included in the project will certify
  their competences and will be offered the opportunity to upgrade their skills in the
  selected economic sectors included in the project.
  Partially Achieved: A total of 20,198 individuals have certified their competencies
  under the program, out of 29,400 that underwent the certification process.
  A system to monitor the quality and pertinence of the services provided by technical
  secondary schools.
  Achieved: An accreditation system is now in place for all 46 technical secondary
  education programs. This activity was implemented under Component 2.
  A system to monitor the quality and pertinence of the services provided by training
  institutions.
  Achieved: Certification is now mandatory for training institutes (OTECs), requiring
  them to meet the operational standards defined under Chilean Standard No. 2728. A
  total of 2,294 OTECs have already obtained this certification.
  Four management information system (MIS) to be implemented under the program,
  including: (i) labor intermediation; (ii) vocational orientation; (iii) project-related
  services available to the general public; and (iv) findings of labor market studies and
  related research.
  Partially achieved: Three websites have been developed as a first step toward the
  development of an integrated labor intermediation and vocational guidance
  information system, including: i) the Chilecalifica's website (www.chilecalifica.cl);
  ii) a site focusing on labor intermediation and that presents labor market studies
  (http://www.chilecalifica.cl/califica/mLaboral/index.html; and iii) a site focusing on
  vocational guidance (http://www.chccm.mineduc.cl/Orientador/orienEdu.html). In
  addition, vocational orientation plans developed under the program were
  implemented in 1,380 secondary schools with an enrolment of 670,000 students.
  According to the results of an impact studies, students in participating schools have
  had significant more access to vocational and career counseling than their
  counterparts in non-participating schools. Training also was provided to staff of the
  municipal Labor Intermediation Offices (OMILs). These outcomes provide the
  foundations for the future development of an integrated lifelong-learning
  management information system, which is still pending.
  About 1.5 million adults will consult the above-mentioned MISs.
  Achieved: These sites had traffic of more than 2.7 million visitors.
Component 4. Institutional Strengthening


                                            41
Description: This component provided support to: i) the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU); ii) the strengthening of SENCE; and iii) the project's communication and
dissemination strategy.
Level of achievement: Satisfactory
Strengths       High effectiveness of the PCU was one of the factors determining the
                   project's success.
                SENCE's performance has improved as a whole. In particular, training
                   that is provided through SENCE is aligned to the newly established
                   National Competency Framework. Moreover, the implementation of an
                   electronic course catalog has resulted in enhanced transparency and
                   efficiency in SENCE's service delivery.
                The project benefit from a strong commitment to collaborative
                   approaches on the part of government authorities and the project's
                   management.
                The impact studies have revealed positive impacts that are relevant to
                   the PDOs; thus, they have been crucial inputs in the ICR ex-post
                   evaluation.
                The in-depth evaluation conducted by DIPRES has served to provide a
                   thorough overview of the project, its outputs, efficiency and overall
                   impact. Although the study identifies several shortcomings, the overall
                   recommendation is to continue with the task of developing a lifelong
                   learning and training system based on the identified positive impacts
                   and its overall economic efficiency.
Pending         Since the majority of the impact studies were completed toward the end
challenges         of the life of the project--some of them have not yet been finalized--
                   they had limited impact on improving the project's implementation.
Specific outputs defined in the PAD for this component
    A highly effective PCU.
    Achieved: The performance of the PCU was satisfactory as a result of an adequate
    allocation of resources, a highly capable team of professionals and consistent and
    effective management.
    A strengthened national and regional SENCE responding timely and effectively to the
    different project demands.
    Achieved: SENCE's performance has improved as a whole. The most notable
    achievement has been the shift from a content-based to competency-based curricula
    for all training provided with public funds. In addition, the implementation of an
    electronic catalog for contracting training courses targeted at lower income groups
    (i.e., Fondo Nacional de Capacitación ­ FONCAP) has been a key factor in
    improving SENCE's service delivery. In 2008, this electronic catalog was used to
    contract roughly 90 percent of all training financed by SENCE. It has resulted in
    enhanced transparency (i.e., it utilizes Chile's e-procurement system `Chile Compra')
    as well as cost and time reductions of up to 25 percent due to the utilization of ICT
    tools.
    An effective project communication and dissemination strategy.
    Achieved: The PCU's commitment toward fostering participation and inclusiveness


                                            42
   was a key determinant of the rich relationships forged under the project among public
   and private actors at both the national and regional levels. Although intangible, these
   relationships are one of the most valuable outcomes of the project, as they have
   served to build trust among a highly diverse universe of players. This trust, together
   with the demonstration of tangible benefits for all the players involved, constitutes a
   valuable seed for the continuous development of a lifelong learning and training
   system over the long run.
   A set of project-related impact evaluation studies.
   Achieved: To complement the project's original PRF, a set of complementary
   indicators to assess the impact of the key interventions were also supported under the
   program. These studies followed a quasi-experimental design with two groups: the
   experimental group constituted by randomly selected project participants, and control
   groups of similar characteristics selected ex-post using various matching
   methodologies. Three of these studies have been completed, focusing on: i) the
   flexible adult education program (i.e., Nivelación de Estudios); ii) competency
   certification; and iii) the vocational guidance. Other studies are still underway. As
   intended, the impact studies served to measure the impact of the project's main lines
   of action, as well as the perceptions of beneficiaries regarding their satisfaction with
   the program and its usefulness. Overall, these studies have revealed positive impacts
   that are relevant to the PDOs; thus, they have been crucial inputs in the ICR ex-post
   evaluation. However, because the majority of them were completed toward the end
   of the life of the project--some of them have not yet been finalized--they had limited
   impact on project implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
a. Economic Analysis
The economic analysis conducted at appraisal was highly innovative. Based on data from
OECD's International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) on the performance of 15-65 year
olds and the skills needed in modern workplaces, the analysis derived potential benefits
from the project in terms of increased productivity, faster economic growth and lesser
income inequality. In addition, based on the costs estimated for each project sub-
component as well as the expected number of beneficiaries, unit costs per potential
beneficiary were derived to give a rough idea of the benefits per beneficiary that would
be required to make the project economically viable. Results indicated that, given the
large number of beneficiaries, relative small increases in annual income per beneficiary
would result in the project being economically efficient. Actual benefits derived for the
flexible adult education program and the competency training and certification amply
exceed those estimated at appraisal.
A similar economic analysis was conducted for the flexible adult education and
competency training and certification sub-components as part of DIPRES' impact
evaluation. The analysis took into consideration: i) the income benefits identified for
these two lines of actions under the same study; ii) the actual unitary program costs per
participant, including administrative costs; iii) the opportunity cost for participants; and
iv) their median age. The two sub-components are found to be economically efficient.
The main findings can be summarized as follows:


                                             43
Flexible adult education: The stream of benefits are estimated at Ch$205,152 (roughly
US$380) per year per adult that successfully completed their secondary education. In the
case that the education and assessment process takes one full-time month or less, the net
present value (NPV) per participant is positive after three years of subsequent
employment. If the time invested increases to two, four, or six full-time months, the NPV
becomes positive only after four, seven and twelve years, respectively. Given that the
median age of participants is 35-years old, the adult education program is considered to
be economically efficient.

Competency training and certification: The stream of benefits are estimated at
Ch$156,300 (roughly US$294) per year per worker until retirement. In the case that the
training and certification process takes one full-time month or less, the net present value
(NPV) per participant is positive after five years of subsequent employment. If the
training and certification time increases to one-and-a-half, two, or three full-time months,
the NPV becomes positive after six, eight and eleven years, respectively. Given that the
median age of participants is 40-years old, the competency training and certification
program is considered to be economically efficient as workers are expected to have a
longer work time horizon.

b. Financial Analysis
The financial rate of return was not estimated at appraisal.
c. Fiscal Impact
The fiscal analysis conducted at appraisal focused on whether the expected incremental
recurrent cost of the project was within the capacity of the ME's budget and whether it
could impose an undue financial burden for the GOC. The analysis estimated that the
project would generate an average annual recurrent liability of approximately US$12
million in 2009. As noted under Section 2.5, US$32 million were assigned to the project
under the operating budgets of the MINEDUC and the Ministry of Labor for 2010--
almost three times the amount estimated at appraisal. The 2010 budget allocation is
roughly equivalent to the counterpart funds allocated to the project in 2009, suggesting
that they do not exert any significant fiscal pressures on the GOC's budget and that the
activities are considered important.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
Beneficiary surveys were conducted under the impact studies focusing on: a) the flexible
adult education program; b) competency certification; and c) vocational guidance.
Results from these studies indicate a high level of satisfaction among beneficiaries as
well as measurable impacts, particularly in the case of the first two lines of action.
Specific findings from each of these studies are summarized below:
a. Flexible adult education program
A sample of 1,350 students that successfully completed their secondary studies was
interviewed as part of the impact study focusing on the flexible adult education program
(Consultores en Economía y Desarrollo, 2002). In addition to questions aimed at
measuring the impact of the program in terms of income and employment status,
questions were also included aimed at portraying the profile of the student population, the
motivation to complete their secondary education, and their overall satisfaction with
various aspects of the flexible adult education program.
Results indicate that: i) adult students enrolled to complete their secondary studies under
the flexible education program are characterized by: a stronger representation of females,
an average age of 30 years, having previous work experience. Notably, there is a higher
incidence of unemployment among the student population, particularly among women,
than in the population as a whole--both at the national and regional levels; ii) most
students report work-related reasons as the main motivation to complete their secondary
education; and iii) students report a high level of overall satisfaction with the flexible
adult education program (see Table 5.1).

                            secondary education program

                       Unemployment rate among students (i.e., 16.9%) higher than
                         national average (9.6%) and the comparable regional average
                         (10.3%).
Employment status
                       The difference in unemployment rates is higher among, with
                         23.3% of female adult students reportedly being unemployed
                         compared to 9.8% unemployment among women at the
                         national level.

Positive impacts have been identified for those who have successfully completed their
secondary education under the flexible education program by three independent impact
studies: i) an impact study sponsored by Chile Califica in 2003-2004; ii) a second study
conducted by the evaluation experts within the Chile Califica team using the data from
the 2003-2004 study but improving among the selection of the control group; and iii) an
independent evaluation sponsored by DIPRES in 2004-2008. The impacts reported here
reflect significant differences between the experimental group (i.e., those who
successfully completed their secondary education under the program) and the control
group. The results from the three studies can be summarized as follows:

Notes:
    Study 1 does not use statistical comparisons and, instead, relies solely on averages.
    (1)
        Highly robust statistical results.

In addition to the impact on income and employability, Study 3 identified two other ones:
 Productivity (measured as income per hour-week) increased for women, older adults
   (35 or older), and those living outside the MR between 2004 and 2008.
 Those who successfully completed their secondary education under the program are
   significantly more likely to continue their studies at the college level. This is
   particularly significant among women and younger adults (35 or younger). This result
   is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the program helped promote lifelong
   learning paths among participants.

b) Competency certification
A sample of 884 workers that certified their competencies in the logistic sector was
interviewed as part of the impact study focusing on the competency certification
(Guernica Consultores, 2009). In addition to questions aimed at measuring the impact of
the program in terms of income and employment status, questions were also included
aimed at portraying the profile of the participants, the motivation to certify their
competencies, and their overall satisfaction with various aspects of the program.


                                                  54
Results indicate that: i) as expected, all participants were formally employed by the
logistic firms that participated in the program; ii) participants' specific characteristics in
terms of gender, age, educational attainment are not particularly relevant as they might be
unique to the logistic sector; iii) participants saw the competency certification program as
an opportunity to expand their employment opportunities both beyond and within their
current employment; iv) most participants see the program positively and perceive it as
personally beneficial.

                           competency certification program.
                         The remaining participants reported various positive aspects,
                           including enhanced labor opportunities (24%) and enhanced
Level of satisfaction      self-confidence and self-improvements (31.8%).
                         While 34.7% of participants saw no negative aspects, others
                           pointed to some organizational weaknesses, such as delays in
                           the distribution of the certification certificates (12.2%) and not
                           having enough time available with the evaluators (7%).
               Perceived impact of the competency certification program
                         Over 70% of participants report that their participation in the
                           competency certification program has served to enhance their
                           résumé.

c) Vocational and career counseling
A sample of 3,462 students in secondary technical educational institutions was
interviewed as part of the impact study focusing on the vocational and career counseling
networks implemented under the program (Guernica Consultores, 2008). In addition to
questions aimed at measuring the impact of the vocational and career guidance, questions
were also included aimed at portraying the profile of the students and the benefits of the
program.
Results indicate that: i) students in educational institutional institutions participating in
the vocational and career networks implemented under the program had more access to
these services than their peers in non-participating institutions; and ii) there were no
significant differences in the perceived ability to make future educational and career
choices between students in participating and non-participating institutions.

1.    Sobre la naturaleza del Programa

Chilecalifica fue creado con el objetivo de actuar para solucionar los problemas relativos
al desarrollo del Capital Humano de nuestro país, llevando a cabo diversas líneas de
acción, que en su conjunto y articuladamente, sientan las bases de un Sistema de
Formación Permanente (SFP). Se trata de un sistema que, junto con ampliar las
oportunidades de acceso de la población adulta a la educación básica o media,
contribuyera a la generación de itinerarios de formación que vinculasen de manera más
efectiva los distintos niveles de la formación técnica, estableciendo además, mecanismos
de reconocimientos de aprendizajes, que fuesen pasarelas para que personas provenientes
del mundo del trabajo pudieran iniciar o continuar sus trayectorias formativas, partiendo
de la base de sus competencias ya adquiridas.

Para Chilecalifica el SFP debe mejorar la pertinencia nacional de las ofertas formativas y
garantizar el acceso de las personas a oportunidades de formación a lo largo de la vida, a
un menor costo temporal y económico. De este modo, pueden adquirir niveles crecientes
de cualificaciones que les permitan desarrollarse e insertarse productivamente en el
mercado laboral, siendo un aporte a las empresas y la economía nacional.

Asimismo, dicho sistema debía contribuir a una vinculación más permanente entre el
mundo de la formación, el trabajo y el desarrollo regional, estimulando en las entidades
formativas de distintos niveles la aplicación de un currículum basado en el concepto de
competencias y estableciendo, además, una institucionalidad nueva que contribuyera al
levantamiento de ellas en el mundo del trabajo. Igualmente, debía tender a su
reconocimiento y certificación, independiente de la vía por la cual fueron adquiridas.

Estos desafíos que se planteó el Programa el año 2002, cuya complejidad y envergadura
saltan a la vista, eran imprescindibles de abordar, tanto por razones de equidad social-
alrededor de un 48% de las personas entre 15 y 65 años tenían menos de 12 años de
escolaridad-, como por razones de competitividad e inserción económica. En esa
perspectiva, el SFP que se está construyendo apunta a generar ofertas articuladas de
nivelación de estudios, educación técnica de nivel medio y superior, capacitación, y
certificación de competencias laborales.

Chilecalifica constituye un esfuerzo inédito en materia de política pública al proponerse
contribuir a instalar las bases de una nueva política de formación, que involucraba la
acción coordinada de tres ministerios, en un plazo relativamente breve. Desde esa óptica,
queremos destacar el aporte del Banco Mundial, que nos acompañó durante toda la
vigencia del Préstamo, entregándonos recomendaciones e insumos, facilitando la
ejecución de las acciones comprometidas en el Contrato de Préstamo y aquellas nuevas
que surgieron producto del trabajo desarrollado.

2. Avances en la Instalación del Sistema de Formación Permanente(SFP)

Se validó, por medio del Directorio de Ministros, una propuesta de institucionalización
del SFP, donde se identifican sus subsistemas esenciales y donde se estableció la
necesidad de un Marco Nacional de Cualificaciones, como el elemento articulador del
sistema.
Los seis subsistemas que forman el SFP en construcción (Nivelación y Certificación de
Estudios Básicos y Medios, Capacitación basada en Competencias Laborales, Evaluación
y Certificación de Competencias Laborales, Marco Nacional de Competencias Laborales,
Sistema de Formación Técnica y Marco de Cualificaciones (MC)) están conceptual y
operativamente diseñados y probados, lo cual significa que cada uno cuenta con un
diseño conceptual y de procesos para su operación, que incluye instrumentos y
procedimientos técnicos, administrativos y financieros, además de haber sido puesto en
práctica y se conozca cuán bien funciona y cuáles son sus debilidades.

En consecuencia, podemos decir que el avance en la instalación del SFP es sustantivo, y
de gran valor considerando lo breve del tiempo en que se lograron. La experiencia en
otros países en llevar a cabo iniciativas de reformas de gran envergadura como la del
Programa Chilecalifica han requerido diez a doce años y un gran esfuerzo de ejecución,
dado que se trata de producir cambios de visión y de prácticas asociadas.

En cuanto a avances específicos sobre cada uno de los subsistemas, a continuación se
describen algunos, a modo de ejemplos del trabajo realizado por el programa:

   a) Contribuyó a relevar la educación permanente en la actual Ley General de
      Educación, la que ­en su Artículo 2º- la establece como uno de sus principios. La
      ley incorpora una serie de materias que contribuyen a la instalación del SFP, entre
      ellas: el reconocimiento, junto a la enseñanza formal, de aquellas no formal e
      informal (Art.2); la entrega de facultades para el desarrollo de una oferta
      educativa de adultos flexible y semi-presencial (Arts. 24 y 32); el otorgamiento de
      facultades al Estado en materia de validación/reconocimiento de aprendizajes
      adquiridos fuera del sistema formal, por experiencia personal o en el mundo
      laboral (Art. 43); la disposición de facultades al Estado en materia de certificación
      de aprendizajes y competencias adquiridas en procesos no formales de educación
      (Art. 41); y la estipulación de facultades para el Estado en el otorgamiento de
      títulos en la formación en oficios para la educación de adultos (Art. 43).

   b) Lideró el proceso de creación del Sistema Nacional de Certificación de
      Competencias Laborales (SNCCL) y la redacción del proyecto de la Ley 20.267
      que regula el proceso de reconocimiento formal de las competencias de un (a)
      trabajador (a), sin importar la forma en que las adquirió; determina la constitución
      y funcionamiento de la Comisión Nacional de Certificación de Competencias
      Laborales, así como mecanismos transparentes de evaluación y certificación de
      competencias laborales y una metodología para el Marco Nacional de
      Competencias Laborales. Del mismo modo, establece la obligatoriedad de la

                                            61
   aplicación de programas basados en competencias en aquellas áreas donde
   existan estándares levantados para todas las acciones de capacitación financiadas
   con recursos públicos y perfecciona el Estatuto de Capacitación y Empleo.

c) Sentó las bases para la institucionalización del Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de
   Aprendizajes de Personas Jóvenes y Adultas, único de este tipo en América
   Latina y que ha tenido un amplio reconocimiento internacional. A modo de
   ejemplo destacamos la realización del Seminario Internacional de Evaluación de
   Aprendizajes, convocado por la Secretaría General Iberoamericana de Gobierno
   (SEGIB), la Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos (OEI) el Ministerio de
   Educación de Chile y el Programa Chilecalifica, realizado en diciembre de 2008.

   La legitimación de esta línea de trabajo se refleja también en la participación de la
   Unidad de Educación de Adultos en el Comité Técnico del PIAAC (Programme
   for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) impulsado por la OCDE
   y coordinado en Chile por el Consejo Nacional de Innovación para la
   Competitividad.

d) Aportó al aseguramiento de la calidad de los liceos de Enseñanza Técnica Media
   Profesional (EMTP), poniendo en funcionamiento un sistema de acreditación de
   especialidades EMTP -en plena operación en la actualidad-, que establece
   estándares y requisitos técnicos para la evaluación de las ofertas educativas
   técnicas de este nivel. Igualmente levantó una propuesta de marco legal para su
   funcionamiento, la cual actualmente está en proceso de ajustes para su
   vinculación con la nueva institucionalidad de aseguramiento de la calidad de la
   educación, actualmente en discusión en el Congreso.

e) Desarrolló, sistematizó y tiene en proceso de validación con actores públicos-
   privados las orientaciones para el diseño de itinerarios de formación técnica, que
   incluye mecanismos de reconocimiento de aprendizajes previos (RAP) y que ha
   recogido los aprendizajes de las redes de articulación, quienes han sido las
   entidades que han liderado su diseño e implementación.

f) Creación de un conjunto de procedimientos para RAP en las entidades de
   Educación Superior que ofrecen programas técnicos de nivel superior y en las
   entidades de educación de adultos. Estas definiciones son la base para el
   desarrollo de una de las medidas presidenciales anunciadas para enfrentar la
   crisis económica iniciada a principios del 2009.


g) Propició la capacitación por competencias, enfoque que considera la capacidad de
   vincular los conocimientos teóricos de las personas (saber) con ciertas destrezas
   prácticas (hacer), en un "saber hacer". De esta forma preparó la institucionalidad
   SENCE para dar soporte al recientemente creado SNCCL.




                                         62
   h) En su página web ofrece información sobre estadísticas y mercados laborales
      regionales, planes y servicios de Orientación Vocacional y Laboral; adaptó a la
      realidad nacional y a la oferta del país en formación técnica, un programa
      computacional de orientación, originalmente diseñado en Alemania, llamado
      Joblab. Su versión 1.0 llegó a todos los liceos subvencionados y la 2.0 está en
      proceso de entrega. En este mismo aspecto, referido al uso de TIC's en
      Orientación Vocacional y Laboral, se encargó a la Universidad Católica del Norte
      la creación de una aplicación WEB llamada: "Orientador en Línea" que permitirá
      la autoaplicación de tests de intereses y competencias, y el acceso a información
      sobre la oferta formativa de formación técnica disponible en cada región e
      información de mercado laboral y condiciones de salud ocupacional.

   i) Se diseñó un nuevo modelo de formación de orientadores en base a competencias,
      considerando especialmente los ámbitos de la orientación vocacional y laboral,
      según estándares de los países que conforman la OCDE, entre los cuales resaltan
      el uso de tecnología, la consideración de mercado laboral, el desarrollo de redes
      de trabajo con instituciones afines y otros. Dicha propuesta ha sido entregada a
      todas las universidades del país, con el objeto de presentarla como una nueva
      malla curricular en las ofertas de formación de postítulo.


   j) Desarrollo, en conjunto con 5 universidades del país, una oferta de formación
      inicial de docentes técnicos. Desde 2009, nuevos docentes están siendo formados
      con un nuevo currículum, más pertinente a las necesidades de la formación
      técnica.


En cuanto a los avances referidos al Marco de Cualificaciones (MC), subsistema
ordenador e integrador del SFP, los avances son los siguientes:


   a) Se desarrolló una propuesta conceptual, metodológica y estratégica para un Marco
      de Cualificaciones (MC), por la vía del trabajo de un comité directivo técnico y
      consultivo integrado por todos los actores públicos vinculados a la formación de
      recursos humanos.

   b) Puesta en marcha de una experiencia de aplicación del MC en el sector minero
      (principal sector productivo del país) con la participación del sector público y
      privado.

   c) Se desarrolló una propuesta para la formación técnica de nivel superior que
      incluye el desarrollo de Marco de Cualificaciones, incorporada a las
      recomendaciones finales realizadas por el Consejo Asesor para la Educación
      Superior.




                                          63
Estos esfuerzos y avances en la construcción de Marcos de Cualificaciones han tenido
una serie de reconocimientos, tanto de instancias nacionales como internacionales, a
modo de ejemplo podemos citar la OCDE, que en su documento Revisión de Políticas
Nacionales de Educación; La Educación Superior en Chile (2009), en su capítulo
Articulación y vías del sistema (pág. 162) dice: "Se podría desarrollar un Marco Nacional
de Calificaciones que incluya todas las calificaciones, tanto académicas como
vocacionales, desde el nivel secundario hasta los doctorados. Sería conveniente crearlo
sobre las bases del marco de calificaciones adoptado por Chilecalifica".



3. Evaluaciones de Impacto

Durante el desarrollo del programa se han realizado una serie de evaluaciones de impacto, en
general la mayoría cuasi-experimental, las que han servido para la retroalimentación del
programa y la validación de las distintas acciones realizadas, a continuación se destacan algunos
resultados significativos de la última evaluación de impacto, contratada por un agente externo a
la Unidad Ejecutora del programa.




    a) Modalidad Flexible de Nivelación de Estudios, una de las puertas de entrada al
    SFP. El estudio mostró que produce efectos positivos en los ingresos de las personas
    y en la probabilidad de realizar estudios post-secundarios, comparados(as) los(as)
    beneficiarios(as) con los integrantes de un grupo de control.

    La consultora concluye: "La estimación del efecto promedio de las actividades de
    nivelación a nivel medio sobre los participantes, muestra que genera efectos positivos
    sobre los ingresos laborales (...) y sobre la probabilidad de acceder a educación post
    secundaria, particularmente entre las mujeres. Los resultados indican que los
    aumentos de ingresos se asocian a aumentos de productividad en los mayores de 35
    años, y a más horas trabajadas en los menores de esa edad. El aumento de la
    probabilidad de acceder a educación post secundaria, también se da particularmente
    en el grupo de menores de 35 años. Este último efecto es consistente con la lógica de
    la relación entre estas intervenciones y el sistema de formación permanente, toda vez
    que la educación post secundaria es un importante espacio de formación permanente
    articulado por el Sistema, pero al que las personas con escolaridad media incompleta
    tienen restringido el acceso". Estos resultados, además, coinciden con la evaluación
    de impacto encargada por Chilecalifica en 2004 y con las estimaciones realizadas el
    año 2007.

    b) El subsistema Capacitación y Certificación de Competencias Laborales también
    presenta impacto positivo: los ingresos laborales de los(as) beneficiarios(as) que han
    participado en cursos con currícula basadas en competencias -y que lograron
    certificar las mismas- comparados(as) con su respectivo grupo de control, muestran
    un impacto positivo, extendiendo el período de ingresos crecientes de los(as)



                                                64
   trabajadores(as) y atenuando la curva de obsolescencia que se experimenta conforme
   avanza la edad del(a) trabajador(a).

   Asimismo, el Programa tiene un impacto positivo y estadísticamente significativo en
   la probabilidad de emplearse formalmente, es decir, tener un contrato de trabajo. La
   Consultora concluye que "la estimación demuestra que la capacitación basada en
   competencias ligada a un proceso de certificación de las mismas logra efectos sobre
   los participantes que son consistentes con los objetivos finales de un sistema de
   formación permanente".

   c) En relación al cambio cultural que Chilecalifica debía promover para conseguir
   instalar el SFP, la Consultora opinó que "el Programa ha contribuido de manera
   importante a introducir en el ámbito de la educación técnica, y de manera más amplia
   en la educación en general, la capacitación y el sector productivo la visión de
   competencias laborales y ha ayudado a visualizar a los distintos actores su utilidad
   para integrar los conocimientos adquiridos por los trabajadores en su vida laboral, lo
   cual beneficia a trabajadores y también a las empresas". Es decir, consiguió instalar la
   importancia de integrar conocimiento como un factor de cambio cultural prioritario
   para la instalación de una política pública.




4. La estrategia como elementos a considerar en el logro de Chilecalifica

Dada la complejidad y magnitud de los desafíos del programa nos permitimos describir
brevemente la estrategia asumida por el programa, y que, a nuestro modo de ver y del
Banco Mundial también, provocó los positivos resultados alcanzados.

La estrategia de intervención, aún cuando contempló una institucionalidad que
involucraba la participación de las autoridades de los tres ministerios vinculados con el
Programa, fue del tipo "Bottom-up" y, por ello, inductiva. Más que definir una política
desde arriba hacia abajo, se procuró ir concertando actores y probando estrategias que
hicieran viable la implementación de iniciativas que, en el mediano y largo plazo, fueran
susceptibles de institucionalización, lo que condujo a que éste tuviera un carácter
demostrativo. Esta estrategia visionaria debió vencer numerosos obstáculos y remontar
escenarios adversos, surgidos de la contingencia política que, en algunos casos,
obligaban a cambiar de manera temporal las prioridades políticas de algunos de los
ministerios involucrados.
Más que un ejercicio de instalación de un determinado sistema, la perspectiva que
movilizó la ejecución del Programa exigió conocer las diversas formas en que la
experiencia internacional abordó la solución de los problemas que dificultan el desarrollo
de trayectorias formativas de las personas y que impiden satisfacer la demanda de las
empresas por trabajadores en una economía cada vez más competitiva. Se realizó un
análisis estratégico el año 2004, que tomó este insumo y concluyó que era necesario
centrar los esfuerzos en determinar la aplicabilidad de dichas experiencias, o sus


                                            65
componentes, a la realidad y condiciones del país. Ese ejercicio, debía tener en especial
consideración el rol preponderante del sector privado en la provisión de servicios
formativos, hecho que marca una diferencia significativa con lo que ocurre en aquellos
países en que dichos sistemas tienen niveles mayores de avance y de los cuales se puede
recoger la mayor experiencia internacional.

Por ello es que, lejos de constituir experiencias piloto basadas en un determinado modelo,
cuyos resultados positivos garantizarían su posterior instalación en régimen, el Programa
debió abocarse a la búsqueda de respuestas pertinentes y adecuadas a sus niveles de
gobernabilidad y a las particularidades de nuestro Estado. Esta estrategia fue
directamente alentada por el Banco Mundial, cuestión que puede observarse si se revisan
con acuciosidad las Ayuda Memoria de las diversas misiones realizadas por este
organismo. Esto permitió el desarrollo de experiencias demostrativas que, junto con
acumular información para el diseño, permitían avanzar en los imprescindibles consensos
para la instalación de las bases del SFP.

Por otra parte, en proceso de planificación partió de un diagnóstico que indicó las
dificultades que enfrentaba la construcción de las bases un SFP. Siendo el principal de
ellos, el insuficiente reconocimiento del problema central que el Programa debía abordar
y que requería ser reconocido como un problema de alta prioridad pública. Asimismo, en
una simple y rápida enumeración podemos consignar que a sus inicios, la capacitación no
recibía una alta valoración de parte de las empresas como herramienta importante para
mejorar la formación de su personal. Ningún actor privado había planteado la necesidad
de construir un sistema de formación permanente y la institucionalidad pública,
fragmentada entre diversas instituciones muchas veces autárquicas, desarrollaba
esfuerzos aislados de provisión de servicios sin niveles de integración. No existían
experiencias, significativas, donde empresas e instituciones formativas se encontraran de
modo de mejorar la pertinencia de ofertas formativas a los requerimientos del mundo del
trabajo. Los esfuerzos de formación general de adultos mostraban importantes niveles de
rigidez y magnitud limitada para abordar la importante población que no había
completado estudios.

Este escenario, bastante adverso y presente a comienzos de la ejecución del programa, ha
sido modificado por la acción de éste, contribuyendo de manera importante a introducir
en el ámbito de la educación técnica, y de manera más amplia en la educación en general,
la capacitación y el sector productivo la visión de competencias laborales y la necesidad
de la formación permanente de las personas y ha ayudado a visualizar a los distintos
actores su utilidad para integrar los conocimientos adquiridos por los trabajadores en su
vida laboral. Esto en beneficio de los trabajadores y también de las empresas. El haber
conseguido estos avances en un período relativamente breve, constituye un hecho
singular e inédito en materia de construcción de una política pública.

5. Futuros Pasos

Durante la ejecución del proyecto se han ido institucionalizando algunos componentes,
cuyos procesos de diseño y experimentación y buena evolución permiten que sus
próximos desarrollos y puesta en marcha en régimen puedan ser asumidos por instancias
estables del país. Es así, como el Aseguramiento de la Calidad de la Capacitación, la
Capacitación Basada en Competencias, Capacitación de las MYPEs y la Certificación de
Competencias Laborales ya forman parte del trabajo habitual del SENCE, el Marco de
Competencias Laborales está instalado en la Comisión del Sistema Nacional de
Certificación de Competencias Laborales, la Formación Inicial y Actualización de
Docentes Técnicos en el Centro de Perfeccionamiento, Experimentación e
Investigaciones Pedagógicas (CPEIP) que depende del Ministerio de Educación. Durante
el año 2010 los componentes de Educación de Adulto y los relacionados con educación
técnica serán asumidos por el Ministerio de Educación.

Durante el 2010, además de seguir fortaleciendo las instituciones donde queda la
responsabilidad de los componentes institucionalizados, para el Marco de Cualificaciones,
subsistema ordenador e integrador del SFP, se desarrollará una propuesta conceptual,
metodológica y estratégica de institucionalización, con la participación de actores
públicos y privados, a fin de tener en funcionamiento el Sistema de Formación
Permanente durante el 2011.
A lo anterior se suman los siguientes desafíos: el funcionamiento del Sistema de
Certificación de Competencias Laborales; fortalecimiento de las capacidades de la
industria de la capacitación; fortalecimiento de la calidad de la oferta de Formación
Técnica Básica, Media y Superior; desarrollar la capacidad del SFP para lograr
pertinencia y equidad territorial y la adecuación de institucionalidad pública para atender
requerimientos del SFP en su carácter plurisectorial.
