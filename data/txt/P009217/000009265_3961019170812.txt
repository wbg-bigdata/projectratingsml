IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND SUBSTITUTION PROJECT
(Loan 2790-YU)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Energy
Conservation and Substitution Project in Slovenia (formerly Yugoslavia), for
which Loan 2790-YU in the amount of US$90 million equivalent was approved
on March 31, 1987 and made effective on January 4, 1988.
Following the establishment of the Republic of Slovenia, three separate
loans were distinguished, Loan 2790-0 covering repayments prior to June 30,
1993, Loan 2790-7 covering the amount outstanding with respect to a
subborrower in Macedonia, Loan 2790-8 covering the amount outstanding on
subloans in Slovenia, and Loan 2790-9 covering the amount outstanding on a
subloan in Croatia.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1994, compared with the original closing
date of December 31, 1992. Final disbursement took place on July 7, 1994. The
remaining balance of US$2,009,965.64 equivalent was cancelled on July 26,
1994.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Richard Hamilton, Energy, Environment,
Transport and Telecommunications Division, Central Europe Department, and
John Mulckhuyse, Consultant, and reviewed by Mr. William Hayden of this
division and Ms. Jane Loos, Project Adviser, Central Europe Department. The
Borrower's contribution is in Annexes A and B.
Preparation of this ICR is based on material in the project file and the
Bank's completion mission from October 31 to November 4, 1994.






EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The original main objectives of the project were to:
(a)   promote energy efficiency in industry, primarily in Slovenia, through subloans for energy
conservation and substitution; and
(b)   support the development of technical capabilities for energy audit work.
The project was later amended to include two new objectives to:
(c)   promote environmental conservation and improvement (added by amendment of 6/12190;
and
(d)   restore infrastructure damaged by flooding which occurred in November 1990 (added by
amendment of 5/20/91).
2.    The fall in the international crude oil price from $27 per barrel at the time of appraisal
in mid 1985 to $12 per barrel in December 1986 created the risk of a smaller demand for
subloans than was originally foreseen. Bank staff accepted the risk on the basis of estimates that
the subprojects under consideration had satisfactory economic rates of return when evaluated
with the $12 oil price. Ultimately only 61 % of the loan was used for energy conservation and
substitution projects. The shortfall was due not only to low oil prices, but also to withdrawal
of several loan applications due to deteriorating financial conditions in the companies and the
overall Yugoslav economy and to political uncertainty. Later Ljubljanska banka and the Bank
responded effectively by broadening the loan to include objectives (c) and (d). By project
closing the loan had been nearly fully utilized.
Achievement of Objectives
3.     One of the subloans was used for investment in energy savings equipment production.
The remaining 17 energy conservation and substitution subloans were used for process changes
intended, among other things, to yield reductions of at least 10% in per unit energy
consumption. There were no subprojects intended solely for energy conservation or substitution,
nor were there any subprojects for investment in local energy resources.  The energy
conservation subprojects were nearly all successful in improving energy use and increasing
efficiency. An unexpected benefit consisted of improvements in product quality, which allowed
some subborrowers to compete in export markets. Economic rates of return could be calculated
for only some of the subloans and some of the estimates are misleading, partly because of heavy
financial losses incurred by the subborrowers during the breakup of former Yugoslavia and
establishment of independent Slovenia.



- ii -
4.    The objective of developing a technical capability for energy audit work in Slovenia was
not achieved, partly because separate energy audits were not required for the types of
subprojects that the subborrowers chose.
5.    With respect to institutional development within Ljubljanska banka, additional engineers
and economists were employed, but a separate supervision division originally agreed to was not
established. Ljubljanska bank credits the project with enabling it to strengthen its capabilities
in project appraisal, procurement, monitoring, disbursement and repayment procedures and loan
supervision.
6.    The environmental subprojects achieved their goals, although one subborrower
experienced severe difficulties with its chosen technology.
7.    The flood repair subprojects achieved their goals.
8.    Ljubljanska banka has experienced financial difficulties caused largely by the political
breakup of former Yugoslavia and the breakdown of the former Yugoslav economic system.
It was unable to meet some of the financial covenants and is currently being restructured with
assistance under the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan 36360-SLO).
9.    Apart from the borrower's financial difficulties, the project successfully survived the
separation of Slovenia from the rest of former Yugoslavia (declaration of independence was on
June 25, 1991). Agreements were reached under which the Governments of Croatia and
Macedonia accepted responsibility for the debt service for subloans to enterprises in those
countries. The Republic of Slovenia guaranteed repayment of the portion of the loan used in
Slovenia.
Project Sustainability
10.   Given Slovenia's large exposure to international trade, its good macroeconomic policy
and active environmental programs, there are good prospects for sustainability of the energy
conservation and environmental objectives.
11.   The flood repair projects not only repaired damages but in many cases improved
protection against future floods, and in other cases the Ministry of Environment and Regional
Planning is continuing the program using its own funds. Sustainability is therefore likely.
Bank Performance
12.   Bank performance was satisfactory except that there were no visits to subborrowers
during the critical implementation period.



- iii -
Borrower Performance
13.   Borrower performance was generally satisfactory. However, as noted in paragraph 8,
some financial covenants were not met.
Future Operation
14.   The borrower's normal monitoring procedures focusing on financial performance of its
subborrowers will be continued until the subloans are repaid. These procedures are acceptable
in lieu of a future operation plan.
Key Lessons Learned
15.   The loan succeeded because of the commitment of the borrower to succeeding in its
function as a commercial bank of making and monitoring loans to industrial borrowers. Another
reason for success, which may not have been fully appreciated during project preparation, was
that subprojects involving process changes serving other goals than just energy conservation or
environmental improvements were made eligible for subloans. It turned out that nearly all
subprojects (other than for flood repair) were of this type. Moreover some of these process
change investments enabled the subborrowers to survive the breakup of former Yugoslavia and
compete in export markets.
16.   A credit-line project to meet narrow  objectives such as energy conservation or
environmental improvements, with a commercial bank as implementing agency, would benefit
from support from specialized agencies to handle technical evaluation, technical supervision and
related matters, but may bring about targeted improvements in subborrower performance without
this support. However, if the objectives are narrowly defined, there is a risk of failure to fully
disburse the loan.
17.   The loan was not a satisfactory instrument for financial strengthening of the borrower,
partly because of its focus on unrelated technical objectives, and partly because it was disbursed
during a period of major political and economic restructuring.
Assessment of Outcome
18.   The project's overall outcome is rated satisfactory.






PART I
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.    The original main objectives of the project were to:
(a)   promote energy efficiency in industry, primarily in Slovenia, by reducing
energy consumption through conservation and lowering the cost of energy
consumed through substitution by lower-cost energy sources; and
(b)   support the development of technical capabilities for energy audit work in
Slovenia, thus providing examples of viable energy-saving investment in
manufacturing industry, and strengthen the financial and institutional
aspects of the borrowing bank.
The project was later amended to include two new objectives to:
(c)   promote environmental conservation and improvement (added by
amendment of 6/12/90); and
(d)   restore infrastructure damaged in flooding which occurred in November
1990 (added by amendment of 5/20/91).
2.    The project was adequately justified at the time of appraisal for
contributing to two of Yugoslavia's economic priorities, exports and energy
efficiency, as set out in the Republic's Long-Term Program for Economic
Stabilization, which the Bank's country assistance strategy supported. As the
SAR showed, Yugoslavia's per unit energy consumption levels were high
compared to an efficient industrialized country such as Germany.  Under
Yugoslavia's unique economic system based on socially-owned means of
production, there was limited incentive to conserve energy and, at the time of
loan preparation, no properly staffed agencies existed at the central or republic
government levels to promote energy conservation. In these circumstances, a
Bank-supported project was an appropriate initiative to draw attention to the
profitability of energy efficiency gains and enable companies to invest to realize
these gains. The high share of energy used in industry and the relatively large
amounts of industry and exports accounted for by Slovenia relative to the total
former Yugoslavia justify the focus of the project on industry in Slovenia.
However, the primary focus on Slovenia was not originally intended, and
occurred as a result of additional potential borrowers in Macedonia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina deciding not to participate in the project. The subsequent inclusion



-2-
of environmental subprojects was appropriate given the high priority assigned by
the Republic of Slovenia and the Bank to environmental protection and given the
need for a number of Slovenian companies to meet Western European
environmental standards in order to maintain access for their products to Western
European markets. While the subprojects to repair flood damage were unrelated
to the original project objectives, their inclusion under the project was acceptable
since they enabled Slovenia to respond quickly to a natural disaster.
3.    The energy conservation, energy audit, environmental and flood damage
repair objectives were all clearly defined and given sufficiently precise selection
criteria to permit satisfactory determination of the eligibility of candidate
subprojects.
4.    The fall in the international crude oil price from $27 per barrel at the time
of appraisal in mid 1985 to $12 per barrel in December 1986 created the risk of
a smaller demand for subloans than was originally foreseen. This risk was
recognized prior to conclusion of negotiations of the project in February 1987,
but Bank staff accepted the risk on the basis of estimates that the subprojects
under consideration had satisfactory economic rates of return when evaluated with
the $12 oil price. Indeed, the loan amount was increased from an earlier figure
of $70 million to $90 million. Ultimately only 61 % of the loan was used for
energy conservation and substitution subprojects. The shortfall was due not only
to low oil prices, but also to withdrawal of several loan applications due to
deteriorating financial conditions in the companies and the overall Yugoslav
economy, and to political uncertainty. Later Ljubljanska banka and the Bank
responded effectively to the shortfall by broadening the project to include
subloans for environmental improvements and to repair flood damages.
5.    The project required Ljubljanska banka to find subborrowers wishing to
carry out the eligible activities under the project, to evaluate and monitor the
technical aspects of candidate subprojects to determine their eligibility and ensure
their successful implementation, and to acquire expertise on the Bank's
procurement and disbursement procedures.  While Ljubljanska banka had
experience in evaluating feasibility studies for investments undertaken by large
borrowers, the number of appraisal staff was insufficient at the time the present
project was appraised and special measures were agreed to increase the number
of technical specialists. It was hoped that the technical enterprise SMELT (a
large company with international as well as domestic activities largely in
construction) would develop the capability for carrying out energy audits, and
provision was made under the project for technical assistance for this purpose.
Since neither Ljubljanska banka nor SMELT had an intrinsic interest in energy
conservation, it would have been desirable during project preparation to provide
additional institutional arrangements, for example by involving the Slovenian
government. An appropriate government entity could have taken over the tasks



-3-
of promoting energy audits, helping identify potential subborrowers and carrying
out the technical evaluation and supervision of the energy conservation
subprojects. These tasks had been successfully carried out by a government
agency in Hungary for two Bank credit-line industrial/energy conservation
projects (HU-2317 and HU-2709).
6.    The contracting of all but two of the subloans to borrowers in Slovenia
turned out to be an advantage which permitted smooth continuation of the project
after the breakup of former Yugoslavia.
B. Achievement of Objectives
7.    Subloans for energy conservation or substitution were available for four
categories of investments. These categories, with the number and total value of
subloans disbursed under each shown in brackets, are as follows:
(a)   energy conservation and substitution investment subprojects, for
which energy savings benefits should not be less than 55 % of total
benefits (0 subloans);
(b)   energy savings equipment investment subprojects, for investments
in energy saving equipment or materials (1 subloan, $1.8 million);
(c)   local energy resources investment subprojects, for substitution of
non-local energy resources with local energy resources (0
subloans); and
(d)   other energy related investments, for reductions of not less than
10% in per unit energy consumption (17 sub-loans, $52.7 million).
8.    A technical evaluation shows that the energy conservation subprojects in
Slovenia were nearly all successful in improving energy use and increasing
efficiency (Annex C). An unexpected benefit consisted of improvements in
product quality, which allowed some subborrowers to compete in export markets.
9.    It is difficult to give a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the
energy conservation subprojects. Reasons are that four subprojects had not yet
been fully implemented as of late 1994, five subprojects started up either in the
second part of 1993 or in 1994, and some subprojects were adversely affected by
external difficulties. In particular, most of the subborrowers are only now
recovering from  heavy financial losses incurred from  1989-92.   Some
subborrowers could not provide economic rate of return estimates because of
difficulties in separating the effects of the subproject investments from the effects
of other investments made at the same time. The energy savings and economic



-4-
rates of return for subprojects for which estimates could be made are shown in
Table 9. These estimates are compared with estimates made at the time of
subproject application.
10.   The objective of developing a technical capability for energy audit work
in Slovenia was not achieved by the project. After project appraisal SMELT
made some valuable contributions through feasibility studies for subborrowers,
including some elementary energy auditing. However, the enterprise did not
follow up on this work and did not use funds available under the loan for training
for energy auditing. A likely reason is that separate energy audits were not
required for Category (b) and (d) subprojects, which accounted for all of the
energy conservation subprojects. Although the project did not develop an energy
audit capability, in 1990 the Slovene Ministry of Energy introduced an energy
conservation program which included financial support for energy audits.
11.   With respect to institutional development within Ljubljanska banka,
additional engineers and economists were employed, but a separate supervision
division, which had been agreed to at the time of project negotiations, was not
established. Ljubljanska banka credits the project with enabling it to strengthen
its capabilities in project appraisal, procurement monitoring, disbursement and
repayment procedures, and loan supervision (Annex A).
12.   Subloans were available for five categories of environmental investment
projects. The categories, with the number of subloans and total disbursements
in brackets are as follows:
(a)   pollution control or waste treatment investment subprojects, for
add-on equipment or systems (0 subloans);
(b)   production line upgrading or replacement investment subprojects,
for process changes (3 subloans; $3.3 million);
(c)   pollution or noise control materials and equipment investment
subprojects, for investments in local production of materials or
equipment used in local production of pollution control systems (0
subloans);
(d)   solid waste disposal site investment subprojects (1 subloan, $0.2
million); and
(e)   noise control investment subprojects (0 subloans).
13.   The environmental subprojects achieved their goals, although one
subborrower (Titan Kamnik) experienced severe difficulties with the chosen



-5-
technology. These difficulties might have been avoided if the company had
carried out sufficient trial runs with its product in an installation that operated
with this technology.  The evaluations for the individual environmental
subprojects are given in Annex C.
14.   The loan provided $30 million for partial financing of 232 flood repair
subprojects.   They were mostly small, and included repairs of river
embankments, damaged road sections, damaged or destroyed bridges, repair or
replacement of pipelines (mainly sewer and water), and repair of water treatment
facilities. The mission to prepare the ICR visited two of the more important
subprojects, and found that they had been successfully implemented (Annex D
provides detailed evaluations). Annex B contains a detailed description of the
subprojects financed and the work done. Most but not all of the damages caused
by the 1990 flood were repaired, with remaining works being carried out using
domestic resources. This annex was prepared by the Ministry of the Environment
and Regional Planning, which was responsible for proposing the flood repair
program and supervising its execution. The full involvement of the Ministry
avoided a defect in the handling of the energy conservation and environmental
subprojects, namely the need to involve Ljubljanska banka in technical evaluation
and supervision activities which fall outside the normal functions of a commercial
bank (see para 5).
15.   The objectives of financial strengthening of the borrower began to be
achieved only towards the end of the implementation period, and progress was
due to special initiatives (unrelated to the project) designed to deal with a crisis
situation. During the early years of implementation the borrower experienced
increasingly serious financial difficulties associated with malfunctioning of the
system of social ownership and the subsequent breakup of former Yugoslavia.
Despite restructuring in 1990-91 Ljubljanska banka was technically insolvent in
1992. A rehabilitation process was begun at the end of 1992 and supported by
a Bank loan for an Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (see paras
18-20).
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.   The impact of the oil price fall is discussed in paragraph 4. As noted
there, it was only one of several causes of the limited demand for energy
conservation subloans, which led to amendments of the loan agreement to provide
for subprojects for environmental investment and to repair damages caused by a
flood.
17.   The project successfully survived the separation of Slovenia from the rest
of former Yugoslavia. Agreements were concluded under which the Governments
of Croatia and Macedonia accepted responsibility for the debt service for subloans



-6-
to enterprises in those countries. The Republic of Slovenia guaranteed repayment
of subloans given to entities in Slovenia.
18.   The economic changes following the establishment of Slovenia as a
sovereign nation affected the project in two ways. First, the loan turned out for
a brief period to be among the few sources of foreign financing available to
Slovenian industries. This partly accounts for the demand for subloans for
process changes having positive environmental effects. From early 1992 the loan
was fully committed. However, second, many enterprises, including applicants
for subloans, were in process of being restructured and uncertain of their future.
This led to cancellation of several subprojects after they had been approved and
in a few cases when procurement was far advanced. The need to put new
subprojects in their place led to delays which were the main cause of extension
of the closing date from December 31, 1992 to June 30, 1994. The uncertainty
faced by enterprises and the resulting cancellation of subloans late in the
implementation stage of the project also accounts for the 2% shortfall in
disbursements.
19.  In 1990 the banking sector in Slovenia began to be transformed from the
prior system of socially-owned associated and basic banks. The Ljubljanska
Banka System (LBS) was created in 1991 consisting of Ljubljanska banka dd
(Lbdd) and 12 smaller, largely autonomous, member banks. All of these entities
became joint-stock companies. LBS accounted for 82% of total assets of the
banking sector. In 1991 Lbdd was formed from the merger of Ljubljanska banka
and Gospodarska banka. A majority of its shares were owned by shareholder-
enterprises. These changes were not, however, sufficient to rescue Lbdd from
serious financial difficulties. The bank had many problem loans on its books to
enterprises weakened by the loss of traditional markets and maladapted to
compete in new markets. It also had unsettled claims against the National Bank
of Yugoslavia for foreign currency deposits belonging to Slovenian households.
In 1992 Lbdd was technically insolvent.
20.   In late 1992 the Republic began a rehabilitation process for Slovenia's
troubled banks, including Lbdd. It wrote off a portion of the losses of Lbdd; the
newly-established Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) acquired Lbdd's net worth
in exchange for conversion of the equity stake of previous owners into a
subordinated debt of this agency; and some potential losses were exchanged for
BRA bonds guaranteed by the State. Plans were adopted for Lbdd to achieve a
4% capital adequacy ratio and a positive operating cash flow. A Board was to
be appointed by the BRA, and performance indicators and recovery targets were
to be adopted. Plans to strengthen credit and financial risk managment and
systems of control and management were to be implemented. The Government
provided bonds to enable Lbdd to repay or compensate depositors for frozen
foreign currency deposits in the National Bank of Yugoslavia. It designed actions



-7-
to reorganize LBS so that no institution would hold more than 40% of the
system's total deposits. The Bank supported these reforms through an Enterprise
and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan 36360-SLO).
21.   By the time of closing of the Energy Conservation and Substitution Loan
steady progress had been made in restructuring Lbdd. By end-1993 the BRA had
completed carving out DM  1.0 billion of LBdd's problem  assets.  Lbdd
substantially reduced its operating and net income losses and made a small net
operating profit in October-November 1993. It had a positive cash flow and a
capital adequacy ratio of +5.4% if problem assets in its branches in Zagreb and
Sarajevo are not taken into account, but a ratio of -2.5% if these assets are taken
into account. Lbdd had been recently reorganized and was actively implementing
an institutional development program  with assistance from  abroad.   A
privatization plan had been approved for Lbdd. On July 27, 1994, Nova
Ljubljanska banka d.d. was established by legislative act of the National
Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia. The assets, liabilities and operations of
Lbdd were transferred to the new bank with the exception of certain liabilities and
guarantees incurred during the existence of former Yugoslavia on behalf of or
relating to entities located within former Yugoslavia outside the territorial
boundaries of the new Slovenia.
D. Project Sustainability
22.   Sustainability under the project would require that the subprojects continue
to meet their respective energy conservation, environmental and flood damage
repair objectives throughout their lifetimes, that the capability established under
the project for carrying out energy audits continues, and that Ljubljanska banka's
financial performance continues to be satisfactory.
23.   Given Slovenia's large exposure to international trade, its good
macroeconomic policy and active environmental programs, there are good
prospects for sustainability of the energy conservation and environmental
objectives. While many of the subborrowers experienced financial difficulties
following the breakup of former Yugoslavia, the fact that nearly all of these
companies survived the transition is a sign of Ljubljanska banka's good choice of
clients. Some of the subloans contributed to financial recovery through product
quality improvements and cost reductions leading to enhanced competitiveness in
export markets, and most of the subborowers visited are now enjoying financial
improvements. Sustainability is therefore likely.
24.   The flood damage repair subprojects not only repaired damages but in
many cases improved protection against future floods. The $30 million lent by
the Bank was insufficient to complete all the needed works, but the program is



-8-
being continued by the Ministry of Environment and Regional Planning.
Sustainability is therefore likely.
25. The objective of establishing an energy audit capability was not achieved by
the project (para. 10). However, the Ministry of Energy, now merged into the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, has been financing energy audits since 1990 and
is preparing a new national energy conservation policy with funding from the
EBRD and European Union (PHARE). The financial reform program stands a
good chance of ensuring the long-run financial viability of Ljubljanska banka.
E. Bank Performance
26.   Bank performance was satisfactory at the identification stage. The energy
conservation and substitution objectives were appropriate, as discussed in
paragraphs 2 - 5, particularly since at the time of identification international
energy prices were expected to remain high. Unfortunately, efforts to include
borrowers from Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as Slovenia
prolonged project preparation and turned out to be unsuccessful.
27.   Bank performance was satisfactory at the preparation stage, particularly
for arranging the energy audits that were carried out prior to appraisal.
However, Ljubljanska banka feels that loan utilization would have been faster if
more detailed assistance on the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures
had been given to the borrower at this stage (Annex A).
28.   Bank performance was partly satisfactory at the appraisal stage.
Assurance of adequate interest rates on subloans provided an incentive to
reinforce Ljubljanska Banka's commitment to the project.  However, more
attention should have been given to invo!ving a specialized energy conservation
institution to handle technical aspects of the project after effectiveness.
Admittedly, if a national Yugoslav agency had been created for this purpose, this
arrangement would have ended prematurely with the breakup of former
Yugoslavia. At the time of appraisal it would have seemed logical to involve a
national agency since the loan was intended to serve other republics as well as
Slovenia. In view of the large fall which occurred in international energy prices
at this stage, some attention might have been given to developing a fall-back
strategy for dealing with a possible shortfall in demand for energy conservation
subloans, e.g., by broadening the definition of allowable subprojects.
29.   Bank performance was satisfactory at the supervision stage in some
respects. The Bank dealt promptly with procurement, disbursement and other
requests. Bank performance was unsatisfactory in one respect, namely that
supervision teams did not visit subborrowers during the critical implementation
stage. Supervision missions were also too few and of too short duration, which



-9-
is only partly explained by the difficulty of visiting Slovenia at the time of the
breakup of former Yugoslavia.
F. Borrower Performance
30.   The loan was first negotiated from June 9-17, 1986, but disagreements
over interest rate levels on energy loans to be made by Ljubljanska banka from
domestic resources and over the program for writing off foreign exchange losses
were not resolved until February 1987. A delay between loan signing on June
3, 1987 and effectiveness on January 4, 1988 was accounted for by the need to
obtain approval from the National Assembly of Yugoslavia.
31.   Despite limited demand for subloans for energy conservation and
substitution, and major political and economic changes in Slovenia during the loan
implementation period, the borrower managed to achieve almost full utilization
of the loan amount as a result of implementation of its proposal to broaden the
loan to include environmental and flood damage repair subprojects.
32.   The borrower's onlending procedures were satisfactory. The interest rate
on subloans is the rate on the IBRD loan plus 2 percentage points.  The
repayment period is 8 years for all subloans and the grace period was 2 years for
all subloans except one for which the grace period was 1.5 years. The subloans
were in foreign currencies defined in each subloan contract on the basis of the
countries from which goods were procured in accordance with IBRD procurement
procedures. Energy subloans made from domestic resources had interest rates
adjusted periodically to achieve positive real rates. Eight subloans, including the
subloan to the Ministry of Environment for flood repair, were made directly by
Ljubljanska banka to the subborrowers. Fifteen subloan agreements were signed
between the borrower (parent bank) and subsidiary basic banks. While some of
the former basic banks are no longer subsidiaries of Ljubljanska banka, the
subloan agreements are still in force. The basic banks in turn arranged onlending
agreements with subborrower companies.
33.   The subloan applications sent to the Bank by the borrower were generally
satisfactory. Handling of procurement by the borrower and subborrowers was
also satisfactory. Progress reports were provided on time, but were confined to
progress on procurement. Disbursements and loan accounting were handled
carefully. Supervision of subborrowers covered only financial matters, omitting
the technical aspects relating to energy conservation and environment. This
omission is understandable, given that these technical tasks are not within the
normal functions of a commercial bank. The financial supervision has been
carried out by Ljubljanska banka for the eight subloans made directly by
Ljubljanska banka and has consisted of analysing annual and semi-annual balance



-10-
sheets and income statements with occasional field visits. Supervision of the
other subloans has been performed by the basic banks and their legal successors.
34.   Some financial covenants were not met for the reasons given in paragraphs
20 and 21.
35.   Overall the borrower's performance was satisfactory.
G. Assessment of Outcome
36.   The loan was almost fully utilized and the subprojects have largely
achieved their energy conservation, environment and flood damage repair
objectives as of November 1994 (paras 8, 9, 13 and 14). There are good
prospects for sustainability of subproject performance (paras 23 and 24).
37.   The project was not successful in establishing a capability for carrying out
energy audits (para 10).
38.   Ljubljanska banka has experienced financial difficulties caused largely by
the political breakup of former Yugoslavia and the breakdown of the former
Yugoslav economic system.  It was unable to meet some of the financial
covenants and is currently being restructured with assistance under the Enterprise
and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (paras 19 and 20).
39.   Overall the project's outcome is rated satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
40.   Ljubljanska banka's normal monitoring procedures (para 33) focusing on
financial performance of its subborrowers will be continued until the subloans are
repaid. These procedures are acceptable in lieu of a future operation plan.
I. Key Lessons Learned
41.   The loan was successful in financing subprojects for the purposes set out
in the loan agreement relating to energy conservation, environmental
improvement and flood damage repair. It was successful mainly because of the
commitment of the borrower to succeeding at its inherent specialty of making and
monitoring loans to industrial borrowers. Giving eligibility to process change
subprojects as well as those limited solely to energy conservation, substitution or
environmental improvements also contributed greatly to the project's success.



-11-
42.   As a commercial bank, the borrower had the adaptability to adjust readily
to making subloans for environmental improvements and flood repairs after the
demand for energy conservation loans fell.
43.   A  credit-line project to meet narrow  objectives such as energy
conservation or environmental improvements, with a commercial bank as
implementing agency, would benefit from support from specialized agencies to
handle technical evaluation, technical supervision and related matters, but may
bring about targeted improvements in subborrower performance without this
support. However, if the objectives are narrowly defined, there is a risk of
failure to fully disburse the loan.
44.   The loan was not a satisfactory instrument for financial strengthening of
the borrower, partly because of its focus on unrelated technical objectives, and
partly because it was disbursed during a period of major political and economic
reform. The ongoing EFSAL is likely to be more appropriate, since it focusses
on financial reform issues.

FINAL EVALUATION REPORT
Energy Conservation and Substitution Project
(Loan 2790-8 SLO)
Date: December 20, 1994
This is the Final Evaluation Report on the Energy Conservation and Substitution Project in
Slovenia (originally Yugoslavia), for which Loan 2790-8 SLO (originally Loan 2790-YU) was
approved and Loan Agreement was signed on June 3, 1987 between International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Ljubljanska banka.
Ljubljanska banka as the borrower and IBRD as the creditor have had a successful working
relationship since signing the Loan Agreement and we evaluate the performance of both parties
through all stages of the Loan as satisfactory. We asses that the project was carried out with due
diligence and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, General
Conditions and other IBRD rules and procedures, except for the unusual duration of the
disbursement period. Therefore, for the purpose of this report, i.e. evaluation of the execution of
the project, we would like to give hereby our explanation of the underlying causes and reasons.
In our opinion the extension of the disbursement period was caused by circumstances connected
directly to the Loan and by the changes in the economic and political environment of former
Yugoslavia and Slovenia.
Circumstances connected directly to the Loan:
During the preparation stage of the Loan  Ljubljanska banka, acting as a direct
borrower towards IBRD for the first time, did not perceive the full complexity of the
IBRD procurement procedures (appraisal of the projects, preparation of the tender
documentation) and disbursement procedures (disbursements, opening and
maintaining of the Special Account). As we believe this an important reason for the
slow loan utilisation, we would like to suggest to IBRD to provide future borrowers with
detailed instructions and explanations at early stages of loan preparation already.
Changes in the economic environment in former Yugoslavia and Slovenia:
* The first year of the operation of the Loan was marked by several withdrawals of the
loan applications linked to unfavourable investment environment. The main reason
was the deterioration of the financial condition of the companies, which had viable
projects.

Slovenia became an independent state in 1991 by dissolution of former Yugoslavia. The
processes of restructuring of the economy and privatisation of socially owned
enterprises have been in place since then. In the transition period after the dissolution of
the former state the investment capability of the companies was affected by the loss of
the Yugoslav market. In addition to that the interest of the companies in new
investments was also diminished by privatisation plans, which were not an incentive to
raise the value of the company by new investment.
Due to all this facts Ljubljanska banka had suggested to IBRD to extend the purpose of the
Loan. IBRD extended the purpose of the Loan by including Environmental Projects in 1990 and
the Flood Rehabilitation Project (catastrophic flood in Slovenia in 1990) in 1991. Very significant
for further utilisation of the Loan was the last extension of the purpose which introduced the
Republic of Slovenia as borrower for more than one third of the originally approved amount of
the Loan.
We would like to conclude our evaluation report with the following estimation:
1.  We assess the performance of IBRD as a creditor as satisfactory during all the stages of
the Loan.
By having the opportunity to work closely with IBRD Ljubljanska banka has acquired
specific knowledge such as:
. appraisal  of energy conservation, substitution, environmental and flood damaged
projects,
* monitoring of procurement procedures,
. disbursement and repayment of funds,
* opening and maintaining the Special Account,
* monitoring of accomplishment of investment and supervision of it.
IBRD all the time guided Ljubljanska banka in managing the Loan and helped solving the
above mentioned problems which occurred during the disbursement period of the Loan .
2.  On the other side we also assess the borrower's performance through all the stages of the
Loan as satisfactory.
Ljubijanska banka has had some financial difficulties in the past caused largely by
dissolution of former Yugoslavia and the breakdown of the former Yugoslav economic
system. On January 1, 1993 Ljubljanska banka entered the rehabilitation process and on
July 27, 1994 Nova Ljubljanska banka was established by legislative Act of the National
Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia.
Although Ljubljanska banka went through several changes in economic and political
environment and institutional changes we are assessing that Ljubljanska banka managed to
fulfil all the obligations under the Loan Agreement completely and in due time in
accordance with IBRD procedures.

Ljubljana, Oct. 30, 1994
RESULT ESTIMATION OF INVESTMENTS INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMME TO
ELIMINATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DAMAGE AFTER THE FLOODS IN NOVEMBER
1990
The Ministry of the Environment and Regional Planning has prepared a two-year rehabilitation
programme which includes the elimination of dire flood consequences in November 1990, caused
on hydrological and municipal buildings and plants.
On June 12, 1991 the Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Act on raising a loan
for elimination of the consequences of floods in the central Slovenia in 1990 (Off. Gaz. of RS
No. 26/91). Based on the above-stated act the Republic of Slovenia raised the loan in the
amount of 30 mio USD in tolar countervalue at Ljubljanska banka, d.d. Ljubljana; the amount
was drawn down from the loan assets of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.  Immediately after the adoption of the Act at issue the Ministry of the
Environment and regional Planning began with intensive realization of the rehabilitation
programme, particularly with the activities required to start the draw down of the loan assets
granted by the International Bank.
The Commission appointed to audit and estimate the projects related to the elimination of the
dire consequences of the flood in 1990, which had operated within the Ministry of the
Environment and Regional Planning since November 1990 on, received 89 claims from 17
communities for rehabilitation of municipal buildings and plants, whereas for the rehabilitation
of hydrological buildings and plants 250 claims from 8 hydrological regions were addressed to
the above Commission. The Commission audited the claims and projects and stated that in most
cases projects met the terms and conditions of the loan granted by International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The technical documentation related to the rehabilitation of
the damaged hydrological buildings and plants was preliminary audited by the Commission for
expert monitoring of rehabilitation programmes for the damaged hydrological buildings and
plants and natural waters at the time of the floods in November 1990.
The submitted claims and projects related to the hydrological and municipal economy obtained
approvals granted by the World Bank for Loan Draw Dawn.
By the granted IBRD loans, the municipal budget assets and the state budget most of the flood
consequences in hydrological and municipal planning were eliminated within the period of three
years, i.e. up to December 31, 1993. Within this period it was not possible to eliminate
damages caused by the floods in November 1990 in whole.

Page 2 of 5
In the current year the rehabilitation programme to eliminate the damages caused by floods in
November 1990 continues within the assets provided by the state budget programme of the year
1994 amounting to SIT 246.445.600,00.
For the completion of the rehabilitation programme in the field of hydrological economy at least
a USD 5 mio loan would be required, whereas in the field of municipal infrastructure the same
amount would be sufficient only for the first stage of the rehabilitation programme related to the
flooded deposit sites of municipal wastes.
In the field of municipal economy the rehabilitation programme was successfully completed
except in cases of flooded deposit sites.
In the field of hydrological economy the range of the necessary rehabilitation programme to
eliminate the damage caused by floods in November 1990 was not completed in whole and will
continue at least through the following year.
The implementation of the rehabilitation programme of the damages caused by floods in
November 1990 was carried out in all of the eight water regions; the relevant reports were
prepared.
On the bases of the above reports the below estimations of the results of investment into the
rehabilitation programme to eliminate the consequences of the damages of floods in November
1990 were submitted.
THE SOCA WATER REGION
In this water region the safety against floods has been essentially improved in the valley of the
Reka river, in the towns of Idrija and Cerkno.
By the rehabilitation of landslides the expected results were not realized. Only the urgent works
were performed in order to prevent further sliding. Therefore, it would be necessary to
eliminate mainly the causes of land sliding in the first stage and take care of the hinterland and
drain its waters.
The destroyed transversal constructions were rehabilitated or replaced by more corresponding
ones and in most cases they were also more environment-friendly.
THE UPPER CARNIOLA WATER REGION
The rehabilitation programmes of landslides, transversal constructions, embankment
preservations were suitably carried out. Within the range of regular maintenance of the relevant
waterflows it will be necessary to perform the rehabilitation of minor landslides and
reconstruction of individual dams and fences. Also on torrents, where allowed by terrain
conditions, it will be necessary to plan transversal constructions to prevent floating of wood and
wood-wastes, which was one of the main reasons of floods and damages.



-33-                          ANNEX B
Page 3 of 5
The flood safety of the torrents included in the rehabilitation programme was improved except
in the downstream of the torrents Lusa and Hotaveljscica (above Marmor) where major control
works were required.
THE LOWER CARNIOLA WATER REGION
The rehabilitation programme did not improve the degree of safety against high waters as the
rehabilitation constructions do not have the function of preservation of the existing river bed of
the Sava in order to transfer the medium waters as well as mastering of the water regime. The
rehabilitation programme provided only preservation at individual locations. On the other parts
of the Sava the conditions of the constructions and preservation thereof are of unstable balance
and the next high waters may cause dam.ages at different parts of the Sava river.
Consequently larger investments into the rehabilitation programme of the Sava river would be
imperative.
THE SAVA - IJUBLJANICA WATER REGION
The rehabilitation measures were performed suitably and successfully, which was proved during
high waters of lesser intensity a few times after 1990. The safety against floods on the torrents
included in the rehabilitation programme was considerably improved.
Within the following years it will be necessary to monitor, maintain and complete all the
constructions at issue. At the same time it will be necessary to establish planning of all torrents
beds which were not included in the rehabilitation programme, due to the relevant minor
damages caused up to now. Quite a lot of measures are urgently required in hinterlands of some
torrents where vase erosion centers and landslides are encountered.
With regard to the natural waterflows the emphasis was given to the stability of the conditions
and prevention of further damages. By the improvement of individual parts the safety against
floods was obtained. Within the period between 1992 and 1994 the constructions have
successfully resisted high waters.
THE DRAVA WATER REGION
By the rehabilitation measures taken on the Mislinja river the previously existing safety against
floods was established relative to a ten- to 30-year period and an increased safety of the river
bed against erosion.
In the upstream torrent part of the natural river bed of Suhadolnica the flow did not increase by
the rehabilitation programme, nevertheless the safety against erosion improved considerably.
By the embankment preservation, the stability of water level and building of fences against
floods at the Javor stream the safety against the side and depth erosion increased, which reflects
in the reduction of floatings from the springs. The rehabilitation programme relative to indents



-34-                          ANNEX B
Page 4 of 5
on the river Pesnica reestablished a 30-year period water flow, whereas the rehabilitation
programme relative to indents on the river Dravinja increased the safety against erosion.
As the rehabilitation of the damaged part on the river Dravinja in whole was not performed, the
high waters in November 1992 increased the damages in the upstream of the same part and the
rehabilitation programme is being carried out in this year.
THE SAVINJA-SOTLA WATER REGION
Within the water region of the river Savinja the rehabilitation programmes and measures taken
reestablished the basic flow profiles of the river beds and therefore floods are prevented already
at lower high waters.- The so-established embankments are not in condition to resist erosions
caused by high waters.
Due to the vastness of the damaged regions it was not possible to execute all the measures. The
rehabilitation included mainly the river beds of major torrent affluents and the most endangered
slid hillsides, by which the range of centers and the danger of floats sweeping away are reduced.
The existing dikes against floods, which protect major urban regions in the valley of the river
Savinja and its major affluents, were included in the rehabilitation programme, whereas local
preservation of urban regions and measures to improve the exploitation of retention of high
water areas and the reduction of high water wave peaks were not included.
Indents at the most endangered parts were included in the rehabilitation programme in order to
prevent a further increase of erosion, which would result in the global change of high water
regimes of water flows.
On the individual parts in the territory of larger residential areas the programme tended to
increase the present safety against floods and to the improvement of the conditions. The planned
measures are not completed, which may result in the danger to partially annulate the already
taken measures.
Nevertheless the up-to-date measures have improved the conditions, which was reflected during
the high waters in autumn 1992 and 1993.
On the river Savinja, most of all in its midstream, it would be necessary to improve the
destroyed areas in 1990 such as the dams Marinckov jez, Nazarski jez, Spodnji Letuski jez,
Polzelsld jez, the chute at Sempeter, which were not carried out due to the high costs. These
constructions are of global importance because they control the gravel flow (in the upstream) on
the one hand, and on the other their rehabilitation would stop dire erosion and deepening of the
Savinja river bed, which already seriously endangers the safety against erosion of the Savinja
river embankments as well as some of the traffic communication constructions (bridges).

THE MURA WATER REGION
From the planned necessary rehabilitation of the high water preservation dikes within the length
of 26 km the programme included only the part of the dike Lendava - Kot and partially Lendava
- Petisevci in the total length 5,428 km or 1/5 of the total embankment length.
The other planned and required improvements on natural waterflows and water collectors were
performed only in the part of the Scavnica river bed in the area of Ljutomer - Grabe within the
length of 4,892 km in order to increase the safety against floods of the town Ljutomer.
The degree of safety against floods has increased only slightly so that the conditions relative to
the danger of floods in this region with regard to the year 1990 is unchanged.
THE PRIMORJE WATER REGION
In 1990 the torrent waters flooded the entire length of the river Reka from Zabic to Ilirska
Bistrica and further on. The damaged embankments, major and minor indents appeared on
several locations.
The rehabilitation programme - with regard to the available finances - included only the largest
and the most critical indents.
The rehabilitation programme was successfully carried out as the performed works offer stability
against high water floods and sufficiently stable conditions of the water beds.
In the following period it is urgent to take measures concerning withholding on the Reka river,
particularly in the upstream part above Zabic.

REPORT OF VISITS TO IMPLEMENTED SUBPROJECTS
a. Report of visit to the Mozirie Sewage System
Subproiect: The Mozirje Sewage System in the Savinja Valley
(project X-9)
Project type: flood rehabilitation: municipal projects
Cost:     Actual cost  SIT 94,125,175
IBRD Loan    US$    318,991
Date of Completion: End 1992
Date of visit: 11-09-94
People met: Danilo Beden, Director PUH (main contractor)
Ales Horvat, Chief Engineering PUH
Discussion: This subproject is the rehabilitation of the
Mozirje Sewage plant and sewer pipeline systems feeding the
plant from Mozirje and from Nazarje. The contractor for this
project was PUH (Podjetje ZA Urejanje Hudournikov p.o. =
Torrent and Erosion Control Service) from Ljubljana. The
existing sewage treatment plant that was only a few years old
was partly destroyed and replaced by a new, biotreatment
installation (biodiscs system). It was operating well and in
good working condition. Existing pipelines were repaired and
partly replaced. Waste water leaving the plant is in
compliance with Slovenian pollution standards: there is no
industry in these towns that discharges polluted water. The
treated water is discharged in the Savinja river.
Conclusion: this is a good rehabilitation project with
improved environmental water control.
b. Report of visit to the Lucnica Vallev
Subproject: The Lucnica river regulation and landslide in
Podveza: phase II: chute control (subproject F 25/2)
Project type: flood rehabilitation: repair and stabilization
of Lucnica river banks
Cost:     Actual cost  SIT 54,856,991
IBRD Loan    US$    198,934
Date of Completion: Not yet completely finished
Date of visit: 11-09-94
People met: Danilo Beden, Director PUH (main contractor)
Ales Horvat, Chief Engineering PUH
Discussion: Located upstream from Mozirje at the Lucnica
river, feeding into the Savinja river. A severe landslide
blocked the whole valley and destroyed the road. The blockage



ANNEX C
37                             Page 2 of 17
caused extensive flooding upstream where all bridges (35)
were destroyed. River banks were widely damaged. The
rehabilitation work for the riverbanks and steep hill slopes
was done by PUH. To open the valley and road 120,000 m3 of
soil had to be removed. This soil was used in landfills that
were afterwards very well landscaped and transformed in
cattle grazing meadows.
The slope surface was balanced and consolidated. Natural
vegetation is being restored to improve the consolidation of
the slope. The area is now closely monitored on soil
movements at ten measuring points. No further movements after
consolidation have occurred.
Conclusion: this is a successful rehabilitation of the river
valley with awareness of the requirements of the environment.
c. Report of visit to Iskra Industriia Kondenzatoriev in

Actual            5,275,280
IBRD Loan         1,830,000
Disbursed         1,826,702
Date of Completion: October 1990
Internal rate of return: expected 30.8%, actual 22.7%
Enerqv Conservation: not applicable for category 2 projects
Procurement: Price quotations
Date of visit: 11-10-94
People met: Drago Crnic, Director Mechanical Division
M.Klopcic, Manager Technology
Stanislav Golobic, Investment Manager
Discussion: This is the only category 2 subproject of the
Loan. Iskra, Semic manufactures electrical capacitators
partly used to improve the power factor in existing
industrial and other installations. Other product lines are
capacitators for use in electronic equipment, for radio
interference prevention, and for power electrical appliances.
Further their production program includes several electrical
appliances and industrial electrical equipment. The
subproject loan was used for purchasing a winding machine for
their power capacitor line, equipment to manufacture tools
and machines such as electrostatic filters, equipment for
waste water pre-treatment (degreasing and pH correction),
precision milling and grinding machines and instruments for



ANNEX C
38-                       Page 3 of 17
their R&D department. In fact, only the winding machine is
part of a direct production line. All other equipment is
either used in R&D or is a side line of their main production
that is only loosely connected with energy conservation.
The company sold before independence an important part of
their production on the Yugoslavian markets. Due to improved
quality of their products they were able to replace fully
these markets in export. Important clients are now in
Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and Hongkong!
Finance: Although the bank that serves Iskra indicates a
present IRR of 22.76 it is impossible to allocate this to the
investments made within the scope of this subproject. This is
due to the diversity of equipment purchased of which only a
part was used in production and to the lack of profit centers
or allocation of costs and profits to the different product
lines.
Environment: during the mission's plant visit waste water
treatment sample analyses were checked in the laboratory. It
showed that the purification of waste water from inorganic
solids and ammonia was not as successful as indicated and
several contaminants were well above the limits regulated by
the Government of Slovenia
Conclusion: Given the circumstances, the enterprise did an
impressive marketing and sales effort in securing new markets
and neutralizing the effects of the severe inflation. The
World Bank funding promoted directly product quality
improvements, environmental improvement (waste water pre-
treatment) and indirectly energy conservation through the
production of electrical equipment used in other products.

Discussion: This metal foundry manufactures locks, fittings,
foundry products of malleable steel and car components. The
environmental problems that confronted Titan were the
following:
(i) generation of dust from the electric smelting furnace
containing large amounts of iron and zinc oxides
(capacity furnace is 5 ton scrap per hour, zinc is
mainly from galvanized iron scrap). This exhaust gas
was scrubbed with water and the resulting suspension
of metal oxides was filtered. But the waste water
after filtration still contained too high amounts of
zinc. The filtered solid waste was dumped at a waste
disposal site endangering ground water contamination;
(ii) air pollution at the work place of the foundry was
above allowed limits;
(iii) air pollution with trichloro-ethylene (TCE) from open
air degreasing installation with a workplace pollution
of over 700 mg TCE/m3;
(iv) air pollution from lacquer burning installation to
remove lacquer from metal parts;
(v) air pollution from a degreasing installation using
freon 11.
Electric furnace: a dry air filtering unit was installed and
dust emissions are now well within permitted limits (was
112.3 mg/m3, present 1.13 mg/m3 exhaust gas, limit is 15
mg/m3). It was originally the intention to send the
collected dust containing 30-401 zinc (about 30 ton zinc per
year) to a zinc production plant in Macedonia. However, this
cannot be done anymore. A local zinc producer asks DM 1/kg to
take over the dust and a local brick manufacturer asks DM
0.50/kg. According to Titan this is too much. The dust is now
bagged in polythene bags and stored. Inspection of the
storage in the open showed many bags were broken and dust was
spilled all over the place contaminating storm water. Also
laboratory measurements of dust in the air after filtration
showed still 29 mg Zn/m3 and 1.1 mg Pb (lead)/m3.
It is clear from our site visit that the environmental
mitigation measures are only partly successful and steps
should be taken by Titan to improve this situation. E.g. the
price that the brick manufacturer asks for taking over the
dust to use it in bricks is not too high compared with other
companies that sell the dust to brick manufacturers. The
emissions of zinc and lead are also worrying especially for
the people working at this plant.
DecreasinQ: for degreasing Titan replaced TCE with perchloro-
ethylene (PCE) in a closed circuit degreasing and washing
installation. This system does not work properly and requires



ANNEX C
Page 5 of 17
about ten times more PCE than anticipated. The result is that
some metal parts have still to be degreased with TCE (their
annual use of TCE has decreased from 40 ton to 10 ton). The
PCE contaminated with oil and grease is sold to a petrochem-
ical company that distills the solution and sells back the
pure PCE to Titan. The very disappointing results with the
PCE installation cannot be blamed on the manufacturer: the
experiments that Titan did before purchasing the equipment
were too superficial and not sufficiently detailed. The whole
installation will have to be replaced and a new detergent
technology will be installed.
Lacauer burninq: This installation that was built to replace
open air burning was out of production due to the collapse of
the market for ski bindings. It is now only used a few times
a year to burn lacquer from locks, the main product of Titan.
Degreasing with freon 11: this process was used to degrease
plastic parts of ski bindings. As already stated above this
market has collapsed and the installation is not used
anymore.
Conclusion: In general it can be concluded that this project
was a failure, although several improvements in environmental
pollution were achieved. Inspection of the plant also showed
that maintenance status was not optimal. The defective
operation of the air filtration in the electric furnace plant
could well be caused by insufficient maintenance.
e. Report of visit to Slovenijavino, Liubliana
Subproject: Slovenijavino, Ljubljana, subproject 1-Y
Project type: energy conservation, category 4
Cost:     Planned      US$  937,428
Actual         1,041,263
IBRD Loan        515,000
Disbursed        513,109
Date of Completion: May 1992
Internal rate of return: expected 51.5%, actual at present
28.6% but a production curve to 100% capacity was planned for
4 years; it is expected that the predicted IRR will be
achieved in 1996.
Energy Conservation: total energy savings are 38.4% for
electricity and natural gas. However, energy savings cannot
be allocated to this subproject investment alone. See for
explanation the following evaluation.

Discussion: This investment was made primarily for the
production of sparkling wines, improvement of wine quality
and increase in bottling efficiency. A byproduct was an
increase of energy efficiency for the whole plant.
Energy savings are in the use of natural gas and electrici-
ty. Natural gas savings are 4.15 GJ/1000 cartons (one carton
unit contains 12 bottles of 750 ml each or 9 liters of wine)
and electricity savings 208,608 kWh/1000 cartons.
Electricity savings were achieved by renovating and partly
replacing the bottling lines. This decreased the use of
compressed air from 53.5 m3/h to 1.94 m3/h or with 247,968
m3/1000 cartons. Besides bottling of sparkling wines, the
bottling includes now also 187 ml bottles (that are very
popular with airlines).
It is not possible to calculate or measure the energy savings
that can be allocated to the subproject investment. The most
important part of the subproject investment was in fact a new
production line for sparkling wines which did not contribute
to energy savings at all. Besides this several other changes
outside the subproject were made at the same time. The
indicated energy savings are for the whole operation.
Finance: This enterprise was before the break-up of
Yugoslavia one of the big wine traders and bottlers with a
participation in world trade of about 1%. For 1993 total
sales of 18 million liters of wine were based on local grape
production. The bottling capacity of the plant has been
increased by the investment for the subproject and by other
investments from 2500 bottles to 3500 bottles/hour. The IRR
that has been calculated by the company is for 1993 and the
first 10 months of 1994 is 28.6 W. Management expects,
however, a substantial increase for 1994/1995.
Environment: The waste water contains small amounts of
organic products from wine depots and a very low amount of
sulfur dioxide (S02) of <1 promille. Water usage is 4,000
m3/month of which 3800 m3 is waste water. The balance is used
in soft drinks production. The waste water is discharged in
the municipal sewer system after mechanical screening.
Conclusion: the subproject was successfully installed and
operated. It achieved energy savings, efficiency improvements
and better quality control. It is, however not clear what
percentage of these achievements can be allocated to the
subproject. This would require more detailed measurements
that the company is not able to do.

(1) New jersey line      659,795         559,148

(5) Boiler improvement   16,976           14,030
The new investments do perform in saving energy as predicted.
Specific energy savings for each subproject are given in the
section about energy conservation. 1993 was the first year
of normal production; production achieved was well above the
production in 1988.
Employment has decreased from 840 to 660 people and 640 next
year. Management is convinced that thanks to the new
investments the enterprise can survive: auality was greatly
improved and the company can compete now in export markets.
Without the investment it would have been bankrupt and closed
in 1993. Productivity has increased by 25%.
The company is at present also modernizing other parts of the
plants. Lack of new employees limits now the production and
will require further automation in the near future. For wool
spinning (not part of the subproject) a joint venture was
formed with a Belgian company and wool spinning production
was increased from 120 tons/month in 1989 to 200 tons/month
in 1994.
Energy Conservation: This company carefully measured its
energy consumption before and after the investment.

Finance: The collapse of the Yugoslavian market has inflicted
heavy losses on the enterprise. The total loss of internal
markets and an unrealistically high exchange rate made
competition in export in 1990 impossible. In 1991 the short
war with Serbia caused a new set-back. In 1990 the decrease
in production was 40%, in 1991 80%. The year 1992 showed
recovery and in 1993 more than 90% of the production capacity
was reached. Former Yugoslavian markets are now fully
replaced by export markets, however, at appreciably lower
prices. In 1993 the enterprise was still loss making partly
due to the heavy capital charges caused by new investments.
It is clear that an IRR calculation, which was not done,
would show a negative return.
Environment: Environmental pollution by the enterprise is
minimal: water pollution is prevented by pre-treatment of
waste water (containing dyes) and discharging the water to
the local water treatment plant. Air pollution is very low:
the boiler is based on natural gas combustion (sulfur content
of the gas is < 0.1%). The only noteworthy workplace
pollution is the very high noise levels (95 - 100 dBA) caused
by old spinning machines. Although ear protection is
provided, this was not always used. During the visit the
mission found also air borne dust (fine fibers) rather high.
This could be improved by better focused air recirculation
and filtration.
Conclusion: The investment, although delayed, achieved its
goals in energy conservation, quality improvement, increase
in productivity and environmental control. The enterprise has
successfully reoriented itself to export. The financial
situation is, however, not very good but could be further
improved by increasing productivity and probably forming more
joint ventures to focus on profitable specialties.

Mineral has not calculated the actual
specific energy consumption, but total
energy use decreased by 30% from
3,135,486 kwh in 1991 to 2,217,293 kWh
in 1993.
Procurement: Price quotations
Date of visit: 11-14-94
People met: Miroslav Zajc, Director Production and Technical
Department
Discussion: The following equipment was purchased through
Bank funding for the Podpec location:
one gater saw mill for granite
one circular saw for granite
for the Lesno Bdro site:
one drilling machine
one diamond band saw
one pneumatic hammer
for the Ljubljana site:
one bridge grinder
one precision grinder, computer driven
The locations at Ljubljana and Podpec were visited.
All machines inspected were in full production and performing
as guaranteed.
Like most enterprises in Slovenia Mineral suffered heavily
from the breakup of Yugoslavia: the main import of raw stone
was in 1988 from Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia only 10% came
from inside Slovenia. Total production in 1988 was 13,000 m2
granite and 60,000 m2 marble. There is still some import from
Macedonia (5%) through Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. About
10% is coming from Croatia. The balance comes from other
countries: e.g. Brazil, Zimbabwe, Russia, India, Malaysia,
Ukraine.
In the last few years the market for granite and marble has
completely reversed: now 70% of the production is sold as
granite slabs and 30% as marble. Due to the new granite



ANNEX C
45 -                     Page 10 of 17
sawing and finishing machines Mineral was able to follow this
market reversal and plans now to buy additional granite
processing equipment.
Energy consumption was reduced by 77% for granite processing,
and 53% for marble.
Environment: Mineral has taken several steps to suppress dust
formation; it now applies only wet cutting, grinding and
polishing. Used water is filtered through a filter press and
recirculated. The wet filter cake consisting of water
insoluble, inert dust is deposited in the municipal deposits
(Due to the high water content cement or brick manufacturers
refuse to use it).
Note: Mineral would be interested in an additional World Bank
loan of US$ 2 million. We pointed out possibilities with IFC
or suppliers credits.
Conclusions: This is one of the most successful subprojects
in the Loan. The cause of this success is not only the
efficient production and intensive use of the equipment
installed under the sunproject, but the fact that MINERAL was
not too severely affected by Slovenia's independence and
subsequent war and was able to replace raw material supply
rather quickly.

Note: 1) The project is not yet finished due to some
guarantee claims of Impol on agreed tolerances of the end

product. Difference is estimated by Impol between US$ 200,000
and $300,000.
Discussion: The project was delayed by 1.5 years due to a
collapse of the financial resources of Impol because of high
inflation. In addition losses were incurred by export on
fixed contracts in US$ during the large depreciation of the
US dollar in relation to the German Mark (imported raw
materials were all priced in DM).
Although the war in Slovenia was very short it upset totally
the progress of the project: orders for equipment to be
imported were not honored by the suppliers because the
governments of the countries of the suppliers refused to
guarantee payments due on purchase of equipment by Impol.
The investments were made in the profiles and extrusion
departments, which were visited and inspected. The production
in 1994 is now running on full capacity:
rods and tubes    1000 t/month
profiles            630 t/month
wire                 60 t/month
The related specific energy consumptions are as follows:
1994           1992            Savings
Electr.  Gas      Electr.  Gas   Electr. Gas
kWh/kg    GJ      kWh/kg    GJ
Rods and tubes    1.07   1,000.9  1.392   no gas   23         -
Profiles           0.46   2,664.0  0.506          3,639.1   26.7
A high percentage of Impol's products are now exported: 95%
of rods and tubes and 60% of profiles. In fact the export of
profiles is much higher because Montal, a 100% subsidiary of
Impol, exports an important part of its production of windows
and other products where profiles are used. Exact figures
were not available.
The quality of the products is greatly improved due to the
investments: Impol was granted the ISO 9001 certificate. This
improvement of quality has greatly contributed to the
increased exports (in 1988 only 25% of the production was
exported).
Financial losses in 1993 were US$ 4 million (depreciation was
$ 8 million), and in 1994 the expected loss will be $ 1.5
million (depreciation $ 6 million). Impol expects to make a
profit in 1995. Losses in 1993 and 1994 were mainly incurred
by heavy interest payments and low aluminum product prices.



ANNEX C

Page 12 of 17
These prices have now greatly improved.
Environment: Impol has reduced water and air pollution
substantially. Water is now recycled in a closed system
without any discharge in the river, and air pollution caused
by the use of hexa-chloro-ethane for degassing aluminum smelt
has improved due to process changes. Degassing is now
performed with a gas mixture of argon, nitrogen and chlorine
followed by gas cleaning with an ALPUR filter that absorbs
all chlorine (filters developed in France).
Conclusion: Technically the project is a success, meeting
expected energy conservation goals and quality improvements.
Environmentally the plant has g:reatly improved compared with
our last visit in 1988. Also workplace environment was
improved by the subproject investments. Financially Impol had
a difficult time for reasons out of its control and unrelated
to the project.

Discussion: Before project implementation Iskra ERO exported
45% of its production and 55% went into the Yugoslavian
market generating 70% of its revenues (1988). After project
completion 85% is exported, 5% goes to former Yugoslavian
Republics and 10% is sold on the Slovenian market.
After the short war with Serbia Iskra ERO was practically
broke and was taken over by the Republic Development Fund.
ERO was restructured. The new production line (the
subproject) started up in 1993 and reached full production as



ANNEX C
* 48  -                   Page 13 of 17
planned in 1994.
The project consists of the replacement of manual stator
production for electric motors by a practically fully
automated line to produce high efficiency motors. Energy
savings in this new production are better than expected (from
21% to 35%). The efficiency has increased by 10  compared
with motors from the old production line. This is an extra
energy saving achieved by the ultimate users of the motors
(mainly drilling, sanding and sawing appliances). The
production line was inspected and found satisfactory.
Ouality was improved to such an extent that an ISO 9002
certificate was granted. This quality improvement is such
that Iskra sells now its know-how to Poland and India. And a
new factory was founded in Ecuador. Iskra owns a Swiss
company, Perles, under which name it exports its products. It
is now in direct competition with Black and Decker, the
globally biggest manufacturer of these tools. Iskra has a
cooperation agreement with the Netherlands company Skill,
another producer of electrical tools. Privatization of Iskra
ERO is being actively pursued.
Financially Iskra made losses in 1993 and 1994. These losses
were, according to Iskra, mainly due to the heavy interest
payments that had to be made on loans.
Environment: According to management there are no important
environmental problems: due to lack of time the mission had
no opportunity to discuss this subject further.
Conclusion: The new production line achieves results as
planned. However, Iskra was badly hit by the political
upheaval of Yugoslavia and it is expected that it will take
at least another year before financial results will be
satisfying. Quality improvements play an important role in
the recovery of Iskra ERO

Discussion: This subproject consisted of the replacement of
an old electroplating unit for nickel electroplating of
binder mechanisms. The objectives were: (1) electrical energy
savings, (2) mitigation of environmental pollution, (3)
quality improvements, (4) increase in production. The old
method used for electroplating produced product with inferior
quality, high nickel losses and high electricity use. The
inferior quality caused difficulties in the export (75% of
the production was exported). The investment comprises a new
automatic electroplating unit costing US$ 832,677 and a waste
water treatment to recover nickel costing US$ 177,209.
In the new production line the energy consumption decreased
to 0.128 MWh/l million binder mechanisms, saving about 40%
(85 kWh/1 million binder mechanisms). The new process allows
also much lower nickel use (30%).
The planned production increase was achieved: from 20 million
in 1989 to 30 million binder mechanisms in 1994. Employment
was curtailed from 362 to 317 employees.
Ouality has substantially improved and is matching qualities
from competitors in export.
Environment: The old technology produced waste water
containing 2-5 mg nickel/liter, 1-2 mg iron and 10-20 mg oil
and grease. The new process now discharges 0.5-0.8 mg
nickel/liter (allowed maximum 1 mg), 0.2-0.6 mg iron (allowed
2 mg) and 5-10 mg oil and grease (allowed 10 mg). All the
water emissions are now under the allowed limits. Total waste
water discharge is about 60,000 m3/year with average 0.6 mg
nickel/liter. The water is discharged in a river. River water
is not used as drinking water anywhere downstream.
Recovered nickel containing sludge is used in a brick factory
where the nickel ions are converted in insoluble silicate
compounds. Niko pays the brick company DM 0.50/kg sludge that
contains about 60% dry matter.
Conclusion: Technically the project achieved its goals
(although energy savings are slightly less than predicted).
Financially the company went through a deep recession (the

loss of Yugoslavian markets, the very high interest rates and
the completion delay with 6 months): profit in 1993 was,
however, already 1i; the expected profit in 1994 was 4%. It
is expected that the actual IRR will be zero or negative.

Procurement: Direct contracting with Cremona and Babcock
Date of visit: 11-17-94
People met: Mrs Valerija Kokosar, vice president financing
Igor Milavec, Project manager and Head Quality
Control Department
Discussion: Javor operates 8 plants for wood processing and
has 1,200 employees. Total revenue is US$ 50 million of which
70% is from export, mainly to Western Europe, USA and Russia.
Besides wood products and intermediates Javor also
manufactures wood processing machinery. Privatization of
Javor will be finalized at the end of 1994: the company will
be bought by its employees.
The energy conservation projects, also covering product
quality improvements, are of three types:
(1) drying kilns for solid wood products;
(2) drying kilns for wood veneer;
(3) steaming of blockboards; and
(4) transport system for waste products to boilers (saw
dust, wood chips, bark, etc)
Javor operates 20 drying kilns, of which 6 had to be
renovated: one kiln was fully replaced, five were renovated.
Drying in these kilns is now fully computer controlled. This
has resulted in a very much improved quality and less waste.
Three of four veneer kilns were renovated and installed with
a computer controlled automatic system.
Ten steam chambers for steaming wood blocks were of old

design without insulation. They have been renovated and
provided with adequate insulation.
Pneumatic saw dust and wood chips transport from the wood
processing sites to the boilers were replaced by closed
conveyor belt systems, which reduced electricity use.
In total ten energy conservation projects were implemented,
only one proposed project was not done due to a decreased
demand for the specific product.
The actual investments were lower than planned due to import
tax exemptions and exchange rate differences between the US$,
DM and SIT (Slovenian tolars)
Energv savinQs: The predicted energy savings were as follows:
1990        after project        savings
implementation
1993
Heat energy (steam) 228.5 TJ        179.1 TJ          49.4 TJ
Electricity           53.0           44.4              8.5
Total savings were not achieved in 1993 because of project
delays (lack of own funds). Changes were finished in January
1994 and at present no figures were available to calculate
specific energy consumption savings. It is expected that
results will be only slightly below the predicted ones. The
situation is a bit confused by the fact that in the same time
some electricity savings projects were implemented that were
not financed from the World Bank credit: e.g. cos phi was
improved from 0.80 to 0.98-0.99.
Ouality: The project has improved the quality of several
products visibly: Javor is now applying for an ISO 9001
certificate.
Javor will try to make an IRR calculation: not much can be
expected from it because in 1993 a loss was made of SIT 100
million (US$ 670,000). In 1994 a profit of SIT 100 million is
expected.
Environment: as long as logging is in accordance with a
planned tree replanting the Javor enterprise is
environmentally friendly. All wood waste is used as fuel,
dust formation has been practically eliminated in the new
system.

Conclusions: The project is technically a success: energy
savings are expected in the predicted range, quality of the
wood products has improved which has given Javor a
competitive edge in its export markets. Financially the same
negative factors as for the other subprojects have been
causing a severe decrease in profitability. For 1994 profits
seemed to be recovering.

Environment: The new process generates less waste mud
containing lead (with 51%), solid particles in the exhaust
gas is lowered from 565 mg/l to 20 mg/l.
Note: the higher gas consumption reflects the fact that the
company has chosen another combination of fuels for the
smelting bath as originally planned (less electricity and
more gas). This project does not only decrease energy
consumption per kg glass but is also quite beneficial to the
environment.
