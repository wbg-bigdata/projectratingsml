CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a project to promote energy savings in Yugoslav
industry by improving the efficiency of energy utilization through
conservation and substitution by lower-cost energy reso'rces. The main
objective of this project is to improve Yugoslavia's balance of payments by;
(a) a reduction of Yugoslavia's energy import bill; and (b) an improvement in
the cost competitiveness of export-oriented industries by fostering energy
rationalization. The project focusses primarily on Slovenia, which has a
relatively high concentration of industrial activities and accounts for a
significant share of export earnings.
1.02     Energy imports now account for about 29 percent of Yugoslavia's total
commodity imports, or about twice the level of Yugoslavia's present trade
deficit. The high dependence on imported energy, particularly oil, is due to
the slow-growth in the production of domestic substitutes as well as low
investment in imported fuel-oil based electricity generation. Until recently,
the lack of an appropriate domestic price policy response to the oil price
shocks of 1974 and 1979 kept demand at high levels and discouraged
rationalization in energy use. The rapid increase in energy import costs
between 1973 and 1981 contributed significantly to the balance of payments
deterioration and the build up of the external debt. Energy price adjustment
is now underway under the Long-Term Program of Economic Stabilization (LTPES)
supported by the Bank's Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). This has brought
prices of traded energy products generally well above international levels
(para 2.29). These price revisions have created significant incentives for
conservation, as well as encouraging substitution of domestic solid fuels for
imported oil and gas.
1.03     The proposed project is designed to build up a local capability for
identifying energy conservation/substitution opportunities in industries, as
well as provide financing for investment projects to promote energy efficiency.
For the industrial sector as a whole, total potential savings through
conservation alone are estimated at about 20 percent of the industrial energy
bill (paras 2.17 and 2.21). While the project will cover only 13 percent of
the total required investment in Yugoslavia-54 percent in Slovenia (paras
2.21 and 2.22)-it is expected to have an important demonstration effect
toward energy rationalization. The project also has an important institution
building objective in its expected impact on the operations, appraisal
stand&rds and financial strength of the borrower, Ljubljanska Banka, Ljubljana
(LBL).
1.04     At the time of appraisal (mid 1985) the international oil price was
$27 per barrel; by December 1986, it had declined to $12 per barrel. Despite
this dramatic change the project remains viable. This statement is based on
sensitivity analysis of the 37 subprojects with detailed energy audits
(Annex 4). Energy benefits were reduced by 51 to 70 percent below appraisal
levels; but, the vast majority of subprojects remained viable. As a result of
the existing highly energy-intensive industrial processes, the size of
available energy savings in the average subproject is large. The new, less
energy-intensive technologies also contribute worthwhile non-energy related
benefits (scale economies, improved quality, faster processing, etc.) which
boost viability.

CHAPTER H
ENERGY AND THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Energy and Industry in the Economy
Energy in the Ecnnomy
2.01     Energy Resources.  Yugoslavia's indigenous energy resources, in order
of importance, are: lignite, oil and gas, coal and hydro-power. Shale oil
deposits, while extensive, are not economically exploitable with current
technology. Lignite reserves are estimated at about 13,000 million tons
(2,600 million tons oil equivalent (mtoe)), but are generally of such quality
that they are optimally developed in open pit mining operations in conjunction
with nearby consuming units. Proven economically recoverable reserves of oil
and gas are estimated at about 70 million tons and 3 million cubic feet (70
mtoe) respectively. Proven reserves of hard coal are about 61 million tons
(40 mtoe), but only 60 percent is exploitable; proven reserves of brown coal
are about 1,278 million tons (437 mtoe), of which 100 percent is exploitable,
with 30 percent suitable for open pit mining. Economically viable hydro-power
potential is estimated at about 55 terawatthour (TWh), of which 27 TWh (49
percent) has already been developed, with another 3.4 TWh (6 percent) to be
developed by 1990.
2.02     Energy Production.  Gross energy production in Yugoslavia amounted to
29 mtoe in 1984 (Table 2.1), an 83 percent increase over the 1975 level. Coal
(including lignite) is by far the major source, (51 percent of the total),
followed by primary electricity (29 percent), crude oil (14 percent), and gas
(6 percent). Due to the dominance of coal, there has been no major cha-ige in
the structure of energy production in the past decade. Coal and primary
electricity have increased their shares since 1975 at the expense of crude oil
and gas, whose production has increased much more slowly. In 1984, domestic
production of energy accounted for about 63 percent of gross supply, a small
increase over the corresponding 1975 level (62 percent). Conversion and
distribution losses as a share of gross supply increased from 24 percent to 29
percent between 1975 and 1984. This increased level of losses is the
inevitable result of the increased share of domestically produced electricity
in net domestic consumption of energy in Yugoslavia.
2.03     Energy Consumption.  Gross energy consumption (gross supply of
primary energy) in the economy was just over 45 million toe in 1984 (Table
2.1), or 1.38 toe per capita. This is over 1-1/2 times the average for upper
middle-income countries, but only 60 percent of the average for neighboring
Western European market economies. This relatively high level of energy
consumption among upper middle income countries is partly explained by: (i)
the high share of low grade coals and lignites, which have low end-use
efficiencies, i.e., high conversion losses; (ii) the large share of heavy
industry in the economy; and (iii) the relatively cold winters, whic'i require
large expenditures for heating. In 1984, industrial energy consumption
accounted for the single largest share of net domestic energy consumption with
49 percent; the household sector was next with 17 percent, followed by
transportation with 15 percent, chemical feedstocks with 12 percent, and
others with 8 percent (Table 2.1). This clearly points to a strategy of
concentrating major, nation-wide, cost-reduction efforts in the industrial
sector.

2.04     Energy Imports.  In 1973, the year preceding the first oil crisis
(1974-76), the level of energy imports in Yugoslavia's total imports was
8 percent (US$361 million).  By 1978, prior to the second oil crisis
(1979-81), this level had increased to 14 percent (US$1,425 million) and
continued to increase throughout this second crisis (Table 2.2). Energy
imports peaked at US$3.8 billion in 1981, declining in the following two
years. In 1984, the value of energy imports increased once again to US$3.5
billion, but declined to $2.1 billion in 1985. Over the entire 12 year
period, energy imports as a share of both total imports and industrial imports
increased steadily from 8 percent to 29 percent. Exports of energy continued
to be negligible (Table 2.1).

2.05     Energy imports represent about 29 percent of the value of all
commodity imports (Table 2.2) and about 18 percent of current account
expenditures. As such, they are the single largest commodity import group.
Almost two-thirds of energy imports consist of oil; the remainder consist
mainly of coking coal and gas. The growth in the physical volume of oil
imports has been 1.4 percent annually between 1973 and 1985; but, in terms of
current value, they have grown at a rate of 23.4 percent annually. In 1984
and 1985, the value of energy imports was about twice the level of the trade
deficit.
2.06     The 1981-83 decline in energy imports was due principally to
short-term import restrictions aimed at correcting balance of payments
difficulties. In the long-run, a more structured adjustment is necessary,
principally demand-management policies through appropriate pricing. Price
increases should lead to both increased domestic energy production and greater
efficiency in consumption. The increased dependence on imported energy,
particularly oil, is the result, on the supply side, of slow development of
expanded domestic substitutes and also of increased electricity generation
based on imported oil. On the demand side, the continued rapid increase in
consumption was the result of a lack of domestic price-policy response, until
recently, to the international oil crises. Yugoslavia's resultant energy
intensity (Table 2.3) is high relative to similar income countries and even
more so in comparison to the industrialized market economies; this is despite
the 40 percent lower per capita consumption (para 2.03). Price adjustment has
now taken place for most energy sources, including petroleum products
(paras 2.28-2.29), which aided the decline of imports in 1985.

2.07     Energy, Trade and Payments.  The two oil crises between 1974 and 1981
resulted in a substantial deterioration in the terms of trade of all oil
importers. Most countries sought to adjust by passing on energy price
increases to consumers, and by reducing domestic expenditures and imports to
offset the resulting inflation.  In Yugoslavia, following the first oil crisis
(1974-76), no such adjustment was attempted; the administered pricing system
maintained stable domestic energy prices, rather than passing on the price
increases to consumers. This policy was designed to minimize disruption to
the economy, in response to what was perceived at the time as a short-term
external disturbance. The volume of oil imports remained largely unchanged,
but their cost escalated. Neither were there offsets elsewhere, as total
imports rose between 1973 and 1977 (Table 2.2). The gap was financed from
external sources and initiated a deterioration in the external liquidity
position.
2.08     The second oil crisis (1979-81) had a similar effect; but, the
deterioration in the terms of trade was more pronounced, as, by this time,
energy accounted for a much greater share of total imports (Table 2.2).
External financing was expanded continuously to meet import needs. Another
world trade recession, coupled with many poorly performing, domestic
investments and growing overcapacity, put further strain on the external
account. Adjustment is now underway, with economic stabilization and gradual
restructuring under the long-Term Program of Economic Stabilization (LTPES)
and the Bank's Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). As part of the programs,
energy prices are being adjusted to international levels (paras. 2.28-2.29).
2.09     Future Energy Balance.  Yugoslavia's dependence on imported energy in
1990 is projected to remain at above the same level as in 1984 (37-38 percent)
(Table 2.1). This will be achieved through increased energy production,
reforms in energy pricing and other demand management policies, initiated
under the Program of Long-Term Measures for the Rationalization, Substitution
and Conservation of Energy (MCRSE) (para. 2.25). However, success in meeting
18Z7:.

this goal will depend upon the timely completion of well-chosen projects and
maintaining the momentum for increasing energy prices to reach their economic
values. Based on the Yugoslav 1986-90 Five-Year Plan, by 1990, production of
brown coal and lignite are projected to be 37 percent, natural gas 56 percent,
and hydro and nuclear electricity 78 percent above their respective 1984
levels. Final consumption of energy is projected to increase at an average
rate of 3.4 percent p.a. during the period 1984-90, but the gross supply of
energy will need to increase slightly faster at 4.7 percent p.a. to sustain
this increase. This is due partly to the lower efficiency in end-use of
lignite and brown coal, compared to petroleum, and partly to the increasing
use of electricity, which increases from 20 percent of final energy
consumption in 1984 to about 30 percent in 1990. The lower efficiency of
domestic energy sources also serves to explain why per capita energy
consumption is seen to increase substantially by 1990. The projected 1990
transformation can only occur if conservation and substitution is encouraged
and financed, so that greater use of lover cost domestic energy sources and a
reduction in energy intensity will result in a decline in average unit cost.
B. The Industri  Sector and Energy Use
Industry - Role and Structure:
2.10     Industry 1/ is the leading sector in the economy with 42 percent of
social product (GDP), 39 percent of employment and 94 percent of exports and
imports in 1984, as well as 55 percent of fixed assets in the social sector.
Comparative figures for 1972 were: social product 35 percent, fixed assets
55 percent and exports 85 percent. Indeed, industry has been the engine of
economic growth in Yugoslavia. Between 1972-84, the average annual growth
rates for industrial social product and exports were 6.0 and 5.6 percent,
compared to 3.4 percent and -4.9 percent for agriculture.
2.11     Yugoslav industry is highly diversified and includes large scale
extractive and processing industries (ferrous and non-ferrous metals),
intermediate goods (cement, paper, chemicals) and a large range of consumer
goods (Table 2.4). The fabricated metal products subsector, the most diverse
and sophisticated of all industrial subsectors, is by far the largest
contributor to industrial social product, followed by textiles, food,
beverages and tobacco and chemicals.
2.12     The structure of industry differs somewhat between the Republics and
Autonomous Provinces (RAPs) in the Less Developed Regions (LDRs) and the More
Developed Regions (MDRs). Although more recently industrialized, the LDRs
have a relatively higher share of large-scale basic industries in their
industrial sectors compared to the MDRs
1/ In Yugoslav statistics, industry is restricted to the social sector.
Although the private sector produced 14 percent of the social product in
1984, manufactured goods produced in the private sector are classified as
arts and crafts. In addition to manufacturing industry, aggregate
industrial statistics in Yugoslavia include both extractive industries
(mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction) and electricity production
and distribution.

wtich have a greater proportion of manufacturing, and are also more broadly
based. Slovenia, the principal regional focus of the project is an MDR.
Industry is more important in Slovenia's economy relative to its importance in
the Yugoslav economy. Industrial social product accounts for about 47 percent
of total social product in Slovenia, compared to 38 percent for the whole of
Yugoslavia; of this, manufacturing industry accounts for about 90 percent in
Slovenia and about 86 percent in Yugoslavia. Slovenia's industrial structure
is very similar to that of Yugoslavia as a whole (Table 2.4); except that
chemicals rank third in importance among all subsectors.
2.13     Manufacturing industry V/ accounts for almost all industrial exports
and 71 percent of industrial imports (Table 2.5). Fabricated metal products
dominate both exports and imports of manufactured goods, with about 40 percent
of the total of each, followed by chemical products, with 15 percent and
30 percent respectively; after that comes textiles on the export side and
basic metal industries on the import side.
2.14     Industry and Energy Consumption.  Energy represents a cost of
production in industrial production; energy conservation and substitution, on
the other hand, are cost-reducing activities. It is, therefore, important in
the context of the proposed pro.;ect to identify activities which are intensive
in energy use. Cost data for energy consumption in Yugoslav industry are not
available, making it necessary to look at physical consumption. A breakdown
of social product and actual energy consumption by industrial subsector is
given in Table 2.6.

2.15     Th^ major energy intensive subsectors are:  non-metallic mineral
products, (25 percent); basic metal industries, (24 percent); and food,
beverages and tobacco and chemical products, (12 percent) each. Together,
these four subsectors account for 73 percent of manufacturing industry energy
consumption. The most important energy consuming subsectors, non-metallic
mineral products and basic metal industries, are less directly connected with
exports. But, indirectly, they are connected through provision of inputs to
exporting subsectors; and, because of their high energy use, their efficiency
is very important to the balance of payment position. Greater energy
efficiency is also clearly possible in the fabricated metal products and
textiles subsectors, the two leading export subsectors. While these are not
the major energy consuming subsectors, it is vital that they improve cost
competitiveness to sustain Yugoslavia's exports. Thus, investments to promote
energy efficiency also offer significant potential for increasing the
competitivenez of Yugoslavia's industrial exports.
2.16     Analyzing subsectors in terms of total energy consumption alone is
insufficient to identify areas where gains from energy conservation can be
found. For this, it is necessary to determine the potential for reduction in
energy consumption in each subsector.  One approach is to compare Yugoslavia' s
industrial energy consumption efficiency with that of another country which
has a well developed and energy efficient industrial sector.  The Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) is a reasonable comparator because of its nearby
location, similarity in resources and role as a major source of industrial
technology and equipment for Yugoslavia. Since the FRG's level of development
is well above that of Yugoslavia, and its market oriented industrial sector
more efficient, it provides a benchmark for estimating the potential energy
efficiency level attainable in the future. Industrial energy intensity
coefficients (EICs) for both social product (value added) and total production
value for Yugoslavia and for the FRG are given for each subsector in Table 2.7.

2.17     The energy intensity coefficients of Table 2.7 indicate that there is
substantial room for improvement in energy efficiency of a number of important
subsectors. The EICs based on value added show that, in nine of the ten
subsectors compared, the FRG is substantially more efficient. The niae
subsectors include eight manufacturing industry subsectors, plus mining and
quarrying (including oil and gas extraction). Other manufacturing is very
diverse and thus not comparable; comparative data are not available for
electricity. The EICs based on total production, however, show that the FRG
is more energy efficient in six of the nine manufacturing industrial
subsectors. Surprisingly, the EICs based on total production show that
Yugoslavia's chemical and basic metals industries are relatively more energy
efficient. This may, however, reflect the differences in output mix of these
industries in the two countries as well as Yugoslavia's exchange rate policy
that prevailed in 1982, and which overvalued the Dinar, thus lowering the
value of FRG industry output expressed in Dinars and raising its energy
intensity estimates.

C. Potential for Energy Conservation and Substitution in Yugoslavia
2.18     A macro approach to assessing potential energy savings is to compare
present energy consumption levels in selected industrial subsectors with
corresponding levels of consumption prevailing in an efficient industrialized
country. As discussed above, the FRG is a suitable comparator. Energy
intensity expressed as toe per unit of gross production, for eight major
industry sectors in both Yugoslavia and Federal Republic of Germany, is given
1527L



- 11 -
in Table 2.8. These eight manufacturing industry subsectors account for 96
percent of the industrial energy use in Yugoslavia (Table 2.6). Applying the
FRG's energy coefficients to Yugoslav industrial output, and comparing the
resulting energy consumption level with actual consumption in Yugoslavia
(Table 2.8), it is estimated that it is possible to realize energy savings of
7.6 million toe per annum or 22.5 percent of total energy use.
2.19     At the project level, the potential for energy savings through
conservation and substitution has been estimated on the basis of data gathered
from 16 energy audit reports and 7 related feasibility studies. Most of the
nearly 40 potential investments in Yugoslavia, which have been subjected to
energy audits so far, emphasize energy conservation; only two projects involve
substitution.
2.20     These reports, as well as proposals on energy conservation
investments submitted by individual firms, indicate substantial opportunities
for energy conservation and substitution in Slovenia. In 1983, the most
recent year for which comprehensive data was available, industrial energy
consumption in Slovenia was as fol'lows:
Table 2.9: Industrial Energy Consumption in Slovenia (1983)
Total Annual Energy Used                             Hydrocarbon   Solid
Peta Joules    toe (000's) of which:   Electricity  Based Fuels  Fuels
56           1,311                    34%           55%        11%
2.21     The energy saving estimates for the potential subprojects
(para. 4.10, Table 4.1) are very consistent; i.e., savings of 18-20 percent of
current energy use in industry appear feasible if prudent conservation
measures and process changes are adopted.l/ These figures show a good
correlation with the estimates of 20 percent energy savings calculated using
the macro approach para (2.18) and indicate that the estimated savings have a
firm basis. On this basis, the potential energy saving in industry in
Slovenia is estimated at approximately 260,000 toe per year. To achieve these
savings, an investment of about $200 million, with a foreign exchange
component of about $130 million would be required based on an investment cost
of $800/toe saved. Taking the border price of heavy fuel oil (HFO) at the
time of appraisal of $160 per ton as the value of a unit of energy (toe)
saved, the corresponding savings in foreign exchange would be in the order of
$40 million annually.
1/ Due account has been taken of the difference in energy saving of fuels
used in direct combustion, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), and energy
savings in power consumption. In these estimates, one Joule of electric
energy saved at the factory is equated with three Joules saved in fuel oil
at the power plant, using a convenient fuel-to-power conversion ratio of
3:1. Diminished electricity demand would give a comparable reduction in
the output of an oil-fired power station, while hydro-power plants and
those fueled by domestic fuels (e.g. lignite) would maintain capacity
operations.
1827 L



- 1.2 -
2.22     Extrapolation of these results to the whole of Yugoslavia gives a
very rough estimate of the potential national energy saving in manufacturing
industry. In 1982, manufacturing industry in Yugoslavia used Z.9 million toe
(Table 2.5); a 20 percent reduction would give a savings of about 1.6 million
toe per year. The investment required to achieve these savings would be
$1,360 million, and the foreign exchange component $542 million. Potential
savings in foreign exchange would amount to $256 million annually (giving a
5.3-year payback period).  These savings amount to 15 percent of the 1984
trade deficit.
2.23     The precipitous decline in the world oil price in early 1986
substantially reduces the estimated savings. But, the current volatility and
uncertainty in the world market makes point estimates of future prices
hazardous. The reduction in world oil prices has caused a decline in the
price of oil based energy sources of 50 to 75 percent. This is also true in
Yugoslavia, where prices of oil based fuels has reached world levels. But, in
Yugoslavia this has not been the case either for coal which has only a minor
oil related cost element, or for electricity, which is largely based on coal
(including lignite) fixed steam generators. Consequently, changes in these
prices have been negligible (Annex 4). Energy prices at tne time of appraisal
were based on a crude oil price of $27 per barrel. A crude oil of $20 per
barrel would reduce the benefits from conservation of oil based energy inputs
estimate by almost 50 percent, while a $10 per barrel price would reduce these
benefits by 75 percent. Sensitivity analysis on available subproject energy
audit data shows that, even with a 70 percent reduction in benefits, as many
as 80 percent of the 38 energy audited subprojects remain viable (Annex 4).
Allowing for some associated benefits of a non-energy nature, this increases
to 95 percent, while, adjusting for zero decline in benefits from non-oil
based energy conservation (i.e. electricity) bring this to about 98 percent
(Annex 4). The Bank Cormodity Price Projections (Aug. 12, 1986) show the 1995
crude oil world price at over $17.5 per barrel in 1985 terms ($25 per barrel
in current terms) by the mid 1990s. By 2000, the projected price increases to
$21 per barrel (in 1985 terms) or $36 in current terms. Thus, a 70 percent
reduction in energy benefits is a realistic estimate of the decline likely to
be experienced over the life of any subproject. While the level of savings
will be below the estimate at the time of appraisal, because of the prevailing
degree of inefficiency in energy use, the project remains highly viable.
D. Industrial Enerr-Y Demand Management
2.24     The Institutional Framework.  Under the Federal Constitution, each
Republic and Autonomous Province (RAP) is responsible for ensuring its own
energy supply. The responsibility for balancing energy demand and supply in
Yugoslavia rests jointly with the Committees for Energy and Industry (CEI) 1/
at both the Federal and RAP levels, but their responsibility does not include
pricing. These committees have an input on pricing matters; but, their role
is largely consultative. Until quite recently, the respective Federal and RAP
Committees for Prices have had the main responsibility for price
determination. But, the CEIs' are the main channels of communication between
11 In Slovenia, this committee is divided into two: one for energy, and the
other for industry.

energy suppliers, consumers, planners and the legislature. The various
producer and consumer representative groups, known as Communities of Interest,
(CI) present their views, including proposed annual energy budgets, to their
local CEIs for review. The CEIs then harmonize the proposals by energy
source, for their respective RAPs and with the Federal Government CEI's
aggregate balance. Because of Federally imposed global import quotas, the
national balance is not simply the sum of the RAP's proposed balances;
instead, the RAP CEI's must harmonize the RAP's proposed import levels with
the Federally approved energy import ceiling. All these balances are based on
planned output and past coefficients, together with agreed reductions in these
coefficients, resulting from conservation efforts in response to ceilings on
energy imports, particularly oil.
2.25     Planning.  In March 1983 a program of priorities and objectives in
the energy sector was adopted by the Federal Assembly as part of the overall
Long-Term Program for Economic Stabilization (LTPES). This program is based
on proposals contained in "The Program of the Long-Term Measures for the
Rationalization, Conservation and Substitution of Energy" (MRCSE), adopted by
the Federal Assembly in 1980, which is the result of an extensive review by
the Federal and RAP CEIs. The MRCSE takes a comprehensive approach, involving
all aspects from primary energy supply to final consumption. 11 However, both
the program and the subsequent LTPES program are quite general, comprising
primarily a list of priorities and proposals, rather than an integrated time
bound program of specific actions.
2.26     The Federal Government has laws restricting the use of certain fuels,
light oils gas and overall energy imports. Although there are no regular
ongoing conservation activities at the Federal level, the Federal CEI does
promote energy efficient technology through fairs, exhibitions and symposia,
held on an ad hoc basis throughodt Yugoslavia.
2.27     Pricing Policy.  The rarrent price law 2/ promulgates a system of
'ocial pricing," whereby individual enterprises set their own prices in
accordance with their costs and market conditions. In effect, with the
exception of four groups of goods and services (including energy), all prices
have been completely decontrolled. Under the law, price agencies have been
set up to monitor and advise on price developments. These replace the Federal
Executive Council (FEC), which formerly determined prices. The price agencies
provide price and market outlook information to assist in price-setting by
individual enterprises and monitor for collusive practices. However, setting
the actual prices of crude oil and petroleum products still remains the
responsibility of the FEC. In the long run, the success of the new system
will depend on the actual freedom granted to enterprises in setting prices and
the amount of competition fostered in the economy.

2.28     Energy Prices.  Energy prices are one of four groups to receive
special treatment under the law. Energy is to be priced by its producers and
importers, but, with the restriction that such prices are set in accordance
with "common elements" as specified in the Federal Government's "plans and
other elements." Energy prices must also take into account international
price levels, movements in commodity price levels and changes in relative
energy prices. The common elements are set out in the (1986-90) Five Year
Plan. While some Federal control remains, these controls are pragmatic
efficiency-type considerations and in the nature of procedural guidelines,
rather than the over-determined systems of previous price regimes. This
approach should provide the appropriate price policy environment necessary to
promote and sustain energy-efficiency investments.
2.29     Due to the 1983 reforms, domestic prices of petroleum were adjusted
for changes in international prices and the depreciation of the Yugoslav Dinar
up until the end of 1985. With the fall in international oil prices, domestic
prices of petroleum continued to be adjusted through 1986 to offset domestic
inflation and to restrain consumption as well as to mobilize resources for the
Government. Petroleum prices are therefore well above international levels.
Significant increases were made in 1986 in the prices of domestic natural gas
(43 percent) electricity (140 percent) and coal (90 percent). Domestic gas
price, traditionally well below international levels is now almost at parity
with that of imported natural gas, which is also linked to the price of heavy
fuel oil. Electricity prices are now, on the average, about 80 percent of
economic cost, and coal prices are about 80 to 83 percent of economic costs.
According to the "common elements" (para 2.28) for electricity and coal, their
prices are to reach economic levels by December 1988. The gradual adjustment
of the prices to economic levels will act as a major incentive for investment
in conservation by energy users. The danger is that the current gains in
pricing may be whittled away, as they have been in past years, by domestic
inflation and increases in economic costs and world energy prices, without
corresponding adjustments to domestic prices.

The previous 21 loans, totalling $532 million, or 12 percent of total Bank
lending to Yugoslavia, include seven lines of industrial credit (15 loans) for
a total of $446 million, all to less developed region republics and autonomous-
provinces. These lines of credit, initially for financing general development
of small and medium scale industry, have become more specialized over time,
focussing on new national priorities, such as export industry, and regional
priorities, such as employment. Project Completion and Audit Reports on the
first line of industrial credits (Loans 1012/1013-YU) indicate satisfactory
use of Bank funds, improvement in the quality of appraisal work and
substantial progress with respvLt to developing external auditing
capabilities. Institutional development of the financial intermediaries was
slow and more modest than expected. The Project Completion Report on the
second, third and fourth industrial credit lines (Loans 1277 and 1611-1614-YU
- not audited by OED) show continued satisfactory achievement of financing
objectives; but, institutional progress was varied and generally
unsatisfactory. Subproject appraisal and supervision remain inadequate in
scope and depth. Auditing arrangements did improve; despite this, the
financial position of the borrowers remains unclear and appears weak. Data
availability and management information systems continue to remain
unsatisfactory. Six industrial loans were free standing and enterprise
specific, to suprort programmed development of large scale industry in key
subsectors, including cement, steel and chemicals. IFC has made 22
investments in a cross-section of manufacturing industries in Yugoslavia since
1970 and now has a portfolio of $314.6 million gross ($234.8 million net of
participants and repayments). IFC promotes industrial development in
Yugoslavia, principally through: (a) encouraging foreign joint-venture
investment; (b) technology transfer; and (c) mobilizing financial resources in-
addition to its own. In contrast to previous Bank operations, IFC has
focussed mainly on the MDRs, including Slovenia.
2.31     Under SAL, the Bank initiated a new approach to address more
directly the priority issues in key industries (textiles, cement, steel,
chemicals, and engineering industries) through the preparation of subsector
studies. These studies aim at identifying areas of comparative advantage,
factors presently constraining growth and efficiency and articulating a
strategy for the subsector's dev-lopment.  Also under SAL, the Government is
committed to undertake energy conservation and industrial restructuring
studies in large scale industries - steel, cement and chemicals - to identify
priority investments. The latter studies will provide the framework for
energy efficiency investment in large scale industry. The proposed project,
which is the first operation of its type, is expected to meet the investment
needs of mainly small and medium scale industrial enterprises throughout
Yugoslavia for energy conservation and substitution.
2.32     The project aims at addressing two of Yugoslavia's current economic
priorities, exports and energy efficiency, as set out in the Government's
Long-Term Program for Economic Stabilization. The focus on Slovenia, an MDR,
is justified since MDRs are the location of manufacturing industries which are
also the major contributors to export earning. Reducing their energy costs
and improving export competit-veness is thus of great importance.  The Bank's
involvement in the proposed project is thus planned in the context of natior
wide sector strategies and needs. The project explicitly addresses the
specific financial and managerial problems of the borrowing bank, which are
now well known from exprience with other Yugoslav banks (paras 3.42-3.62).

CHAPTER m
THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY
A. The Banking Structure
3.01     The banking sector in Yugoslavia is governed by three basic laws:
(i) Law on Monetary System, (ii) Law on National Bank of Yugoslavia and
Uniformity of Monetary Operations of National Banks of Republics and
Autonomous Provinces, and (iii) Law on Foundations of the Credit and Banking
System.
3.02     The Law on Monetary System:  The Law on Monetary System describes the
principal instruments governing the country's monetary system, the commcn
monetary, credit and foreign exchange policies applicable throughout
Yugoslavia. The common policies require an agreement between the Federal and
Republican authorities. Further, the law describes the role of the banks and
other financial institutions, which are responsible for implementing the
agreed common policies, and the relationship between these institutions and
other participants in the monetary system including the Basic Organizations of
Associated Labor (BOALs) and their associations, self-managed and socio-
political communities and private individuals.
3.03     The Law on the National Bank:  The central banking system comprises
the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), located in Belgrade, and the eight
national banks of the six republics and two autonomous provinces. This system
of national banks is responsiDle for implementing the common monetary
policies. The Governor of the NBY at the Federal level is appointed by the
Federal Assembly, and the governors in republics and autonomous provinces
(RAPS) by the local assemblies. Collectively, the nine governors, each with
an equal vote, constitute a board which makes operational decisions, inter
alia on the amount of money in circulation (since NBY has the exclusive right
to issue currency), credit ceilipgs, internal and external liquidity, the
value of the domestic currency, and reserve requirement for enterprises. This
organization ensures uniformity of decision-making between RAPS. The national
banks also handle all foreign exchange transactions and act as bankers to the
Federal and RAP governments and socio-political communities. The Federal
Government guarantees all liabilities of NBY.
3.04     Law on Credit and Banking System:  The commercial and investment
banking system is set out in the Law on the Foundations of the Credit and
Banking System of 1976 and further developed in the Law on the Premises of the
Banking and Credit System of 1986. The 1976 Law created three classes of
banks-internal, basic and associated--and strengthened the position of BOALs
(and other organizations of associated labor and communities of interest) in
bank policy-making and management. The 1986 Law endeavors to return some
executive functions to the full-time professional management, while leaving
the basic structure unchanged.
3.05     Internal Banks:  Internal banks are those established by enterprises
which are mutually linked through the production process or trade. Members of
internal banks are BOALS or work organizations within the same composite
1827 L



- 17 -
organization of associated labor akin to conglomerates and generally referred
to as kombinats; initial resources are provided by member enterprises. Using
internal banks as an institutional device, part of the banking needs of member
BOALs are met through the collection of available internal funds. There are
191 interral banks and their coordination of internal financial resources for
investments by large kombinats represents an important banking activity.
3.06     Basic Banks:  As independent, local-level banks, these are the core
of the banking system. Their founder members are organizations of associated
labor (enterprises), internal banks and social entities of their region.
Members are liable to the full extent of their assets for the debts of their
respective banks; they operate in the area of their founder members, usually a
district within the republic. Basic banks located in the capital cities tend
to be the largest and most sophisticated. The objective of the 181 basic
banks is to meet members' banking and investment needs. On the basis of their
five-year plans, implemented by annual plans, they undertake domestic
currency, long- and short-term lending for fixed asset investment, working
capital, and personal loans for industry, agriculture and other sectors of the
economy; they accept deposits and can borrow long- and short-term resources in
Dinars. They carry out all forms of commercial banking transactions involving
letters of credit, bills of exchange, certificates of deposit, etc. Unlike
their respective associated banks, they are not authorized to deal in foreign
currency.
3.07     The charter of basic banks is the self-management agreement among the
members, defining its terms of association, its objectives, and the province
of the bank's work; the bank's statute elaborates particular aspects of the
self-management agreement, e.g., the bank's organization, the general
manager's authority, rights and duties of members, etc. The assembly,
consisting of member enterprise nominees, manages the bank. and devolves some
of its powers to the executive board and credit comittees, all of whose
members are drawn from the assembly; they are elected to office for two
years. The banks' own staff, headed by a general manager appointed by the
assembly for a four-year tenure, attends to the bank's day-to-day business,
reporting and obtaining directives from relevant management bodies (executive
board or credit committees) whose meetings they attend; but no staff member,
including the general manager, has any voting power. This organizational
pattern conforms to the basic banks' objective of meeting the banking and
investment needs of its members, but it does not encourage rigorous evaluation
of credit and loan applications by economic and financial standards.
3.08     Associated Banks:  Basic banks combine regionally among themselves to
form an associated bank, in order to pool assets for financing large
development projects going beyond the financial and technical capability of a
single basic bank. Each republic and autonomous province has developed its
own banking complex with one associated (except Serbia which has three) and
several basic banks; there are ten such associated banks. Although it is the
associated bank that coordinates inter-bank relationships, it is the basic
banks that manage the associated bank. Their representatives, nominees of
enterprises, constitute the assembly, executive board and credit comuittees of
the associated bank. Associated banks are managed by, and belong to, basic
1327L



- 18 -
banks' member enterprises. Republics and autonomous provinces frequently
process their development projects and programs through associated banks. On
behalf of member basic banks, an associated bank undertakes financiaL
transactions in the international markets, which basic banks cannot do. Thus
its principal functions are the pooling of assets for specific purposes in
which several basic banks participate. These purposes include borrowing in
Yugoslavia and abroad, and other foreign exchange transactions; granting
credits; providing guarantees; and, on behalf of member banks, operating
foreign currency savings accounts. Associated banks are the window to the
outside world. They open foreign branches and representative offices, and
participate in joint-banking ventures abroad. World Bank and other foreign
loans are generally negotiated with the concerned associated bank in its
capacity as the financial intermediary.
3.09     Through their operations, banks earn a surplus which is distributed
to members who, in turn, are required to pay their member banks sufficient
funds to meet the legal reserve requirements. Members have tended to postpone
this contribution and, as a consequence, reserves relative to total assets
have declined.
3.10     Other Banking Institutions.  A large specialized bank, the Yugoslav
Bank for International Economic Cooperation, has been established to grant
credit and insurance for exports, and to monitor joint venture banks. There
are also a few saving banks. The principal one is the Post Office Savings
Bank established to mobilize household savings; its resources are held by
banks specified by the governments of republics/provinces. All banks are
members of the Yugoslav Banks' Association, which coordinates banking policies
and procedures across Yugoslavia, including, in particular, interest rate
policies. Three regional bank associations help to organize bank-to-bank
lending and a quasi-money market. The Social Accounting Service (SDK)
performs the function of social control (audit), monitors and analyzes current
economic trends, and is also in charge of money transfers between all legal
entities in the socialized sector. Audit of enterprises and banks are gaining
increasing importance for SDK; it has launched a program to enlarge its staff
and further improve its audit standards.
3.11     Strict adherence to socialist principles in the past has left the
Yugoslav capital market undeveloped. Financial transactions are relatively
simple, limited to borrowing and lending; the absence of a dynamic financial
sector inhibits the use of more complex financial instruments; the use of
bonds and similar securities is insignificant. Without share capital,
enterprises depend excessively on borrowings, commonly 85 percent of total
resources. As a result, banks are the only institutions serving the capital
market, and as such must bear the entire burden of all adjustments in the
financial sector.
3.12     Business Goals and Results of the Banking Sector.  Banks are
non-profit-making organizations. Without assets of their own, they are
expected to meet the banking and investment needs of enterprises at least
cost.   In the past, banks endeavored to keep interest rates as low as
possible. Under the LTPES and SAL, interest rates have risen sharply over the
past three years (para 3.19) but it still is the aim of banks to charge their
1427L



- 19 -
members the lowest possible lending rates. Consequently, interest spreads and
earnings have been squeezed and reserves have been insufficient, reflecting
the reluctance of members to contribute their share of earnings to reserves
(para 3.09). Many Yugoslav banks now face serious problems arising from Dinar
devaluation, and subsequent losses from past practices of accepting the
foreign exchange risk. This practice has changed and, since 1983-84, banks
invariably pass the exchange risk to client enterprises. Yet, problems
continue to arise from devaluation, due to the lack of foreign exchange
liquidity. The impact of this on LBL, the proposed borrower, is addressed in
paras 3.55 to 3.62.
3.13     Future Developments:  Partially in response to these problems, new
banking legislation was introduced in 1986. Up to then, banks had been
largely at the service of member enterprises. The new law is designed to
strengthen the independence of banks through the provision of their own share
capital and higher reserve and liquidity requirements. This is an important
step to improve financial intermediation. The immediate object is to give
banks a limited liability structure, enabling them to exercise more
independent judgment and decisions on operational issues, particularly in
investment selection and the provision of adequate reserves to ensure their
financial strength. These measures would balance the self-interest of member
enterprises, exerted through their control of bank management. The new law
also provides for a much more flexible, commercially oriented banking system.
B. Resource Mobilization and Allocation
3.14     Resource Mobilization.  Yugoslavia's domestic savi-ngs rate, estimated
at about 30 percent of GDP in 1984, is satisfactory. Basic banks and post
office savings banks are the main channels for the collection of savings in
the form of deposit accounts. The social sector makes the largest
contribution to savings, but, since 1981, its share has declined from
71 percent of total savings to 55 percent in 1983, resulting from the
financial stringency faced by Yugoslav enterprises during this period.
Between 1981-83, social sector savings increased by 50 percent and household
savings by 200 percent.
3.15     Besides their reserve funds (about 1 percent of total assets in
1984), the resources of banks are made up of sight and term deposits,
resources from regional funds, and from the Federal Fund in the case of banks
in the LDR, borrowings from other Yugoslav banks, and foreign borrowings.
Borrowings and deposits were about equally divided in 1984, with foreign
borrowings amounting to $9.9 billion (Dinars 2,096 billion) or 20 percent of
banks' total assets. Maturities of foreign borrowings from commercial sources
falling between 1983 and 1988 have been rescheduled and new foreign borrowings
are to be severely curtailed.
3.16     Resource Allocation.  Yugoslavia's resource allocation system
involves a process of intensive consultations between all groups in society,
resulting in a five-year plan and social compacts and self-management
agreements. The five-year plan contains designated investment priorities and
overall allocations based on agreed development strategies. The results
emerge from a politico-economic process and frequently contain very broadly
1827L



- 20 -
defined priorities, covering many sectors and activities, and thus do not
always provide clear signals. The banks' five-year plans Eor allocating funds
in priority sectors are syntheses of federal, regional and enterprises'
plans. In 1984, fixed investment was allocated between the main sectors, with
industry receiving 46 percent, housing and public utilities 14 percent,
transportation 12 percent and agriculture 6 percent. This sectoral allocation
has remained largely unchanged during the 1981-84 period; although,
transportation declined by 3 percent, while industry and agricul-ture increased
by 3 percent each over the period.
3.17     Banks' Role in Resource Allocation.  Project identification and
preparation are the responsibility of individual economic entities, the BOALs,
and social political communities. Being the sole source of non-enterprise
financing, banks are usually involved early in the project cycle on an informal
basis, although the actual credit application is submitted to the concerned
banks only after satisfying the Economic Chambers that it is socially justified
and included in the Five-Year Plans. Banks appraise project viability using
criteria contained in regulations and social compacts, and their commercial
judgment. Appraisal standards vary, but, apart from IBRD World Bank financed
projects, generally involve only a cursory market review, virtually no
technical examination, and limited financial assessment based on projected
income statement for one year with the plant working at full capacity. Since
all enterprises are members of banks and bank management policy is affected by
the members, the investing enterprise exerts pressure to ensure a favorable
decision. During the past two years, this practice ha; started to change with
projects being better appraised, partly because of the banks' and their
founders' new awareness of- the risks of growing loan arrears and partly
because of the credit ceilings imposed by NBY, making it worthwhile for banks
to select projects on their merit. However, appraisal criteria still need
strengthening; this issue, addressed under SAL, resulted in a Social Compact
on Uniform Investment Criteria, which was approved by the Federal and
Republic/Province assemblies and other concerned bodies in June 1985. If
implemented satisfactorily, it is expected that the investment allocation
process will be substantially improved and standardized.
C. Interest Rates
3.18     During the 1970s, interest rates in Yugoslavia played a marginal
role. Rates were low and unvarying. In domestic currency, rates for both
long-term as well as short-term loans were between 7.5 to 11.5 percent p.a.
The domestic lending rates were low compared with inflation rates which were
around 15 to 18 percent until 1978, and which sharply increased to 38 percent
by 1981. For foreign currency loans, rates were based on the cost of debt
plus a Dinar commission levied by the concerned banks (para 3.21). The
deposit rates for both local and foreign currencies were also low during the
1970s. Throughout that decade, the sight deposit rate remained unchanged at
7.5 percent for both local and foreign currencies. Tine deposit rates for
local and foreign currencies were changed only once in 1973 from 7.5 to 10
percent and remained unchanged until 1981. The lack of adjustment in interest
rates during the 1970s reflected Yugoslavia's policy at that time that
interest rates should not be a constraint on investment decisions as this
would preempt the role of social planning and group consensus in determining
investment allocation.
1*27 L



- 21 -
3.19     In the early 1980s, in the context of growing domestic and inter-
national financial difficulties and unprecedented high domestic inflation, and
following consultations with the IMF and the World Bank, the economic role of
interest rates gained acceptance in Yugoslavia and made its way into the
1981-85 Federal Plan. Under SAL in 1983, the Government agreed to increase
gradually the lending rates to positive real levels by 1987-1989. The aims of
the new policy were to stimulate savings, improve resource allocation and
quality of investments, and influence consumption. Preferential rates were
allowed for certain priority activities, such as primary agricultural
production and energy. The Federal Fund resources and export credits were
excluded from the SAL agreements.
3.20     From 1982 the Government began to adjust interest rates, slowly at
first and more frequently since 1984. The short-term Dinar lending rates
increased from 9-16 percent in 1982, when inflation was 25 percent, to 16-85
percent, the average being 59 percent, in the first quarter of 1986, when the
annualized rate of inflation was 85 percent. During the same period, the
long-term average Dinar lending rates increased from 7.5-11.5 percent to 21-80
percent, the average being 52.5 percent. These lending rates are still below
the inflation rate. The Dinar deposit rates also substantially increased; for
short-term Dinar deposits the rates increased from 12-15 percent in 1982 to 42
percent in the third quarter of 1986. The long-term Dinar deposit rates
increased from 11 to 15 percent to 56-61 percent in the third quarter of
1986. As regards foreign currency, the past policy of lending at the
borrowing cost and charging a Dinar commission (para 3.21) has continued. The
foreign currency long-term deposit rates increased marginally from 9-10
percent in 1982 to 9-12 percent in 1986, payable in foreign exchange to
nonresidents only. The exact rate is the deposit rate in the country of the
currency on deposit.
3.21     Lending Conditions of Banks.  Lending conditions in Dinars differ
from lending conditions in foreign exchange. On the former, banks normally
charge an interest spread over and above the average cost of Dinar resources.
According to banking regulations, however, no interest rate spread is allowed
on foreign exchange loans and the associated banks onlend their foreign
borrowings to subborrowers at the borrowing interest rate. The foreign
exchange risk is fully passed on to the subborrowers; but, in accordance with
the new (1986) Foreign Exchange Law, payable in Dinars only. To cover
administrative costs and build up reserves, the associated banks charge
foreign currency loans a "commission", paid in Dinars, which is based on the
outstanding Dinar equivalent of the loan and equal (in percentage terms) to
the spread charged on Dinar loans. The implication of this policy for the
proposed loan to LBL are described in paras 3.55-3.62.
D. LJUBLJANSKA BANKA, LJUBLJANA (LBL)
1. Overview
3.22     LBL is an efficient bank with good financial and operational
management. Arrears on loans and losses on guarantee operations are lower
(para. 3.38) than in most other Yugoslav banks, reflecting stringent loan
recovery procedures. Reschedulings are small (para. 3.39) and are governed by
1727L



- 22 -
normal lending and supervision policies of the bank, including linking such
actions with the adoption of rehabilitation programs and even bankruptcy for
non-viable enterprises (para. 3.61), which is not common in Yugoslavia. All
this is partly due to the relatively more developed and primarily export-
oriented industrial environment in Slovenia, as well as to LBL's stable and
experienced senior management that has capitalized on its extensive relations
with foreign financial institutions (para 3.27). At the same time, LBL has
serious areas of difficulty, similar, though less acute, to those of many
other Yugoslav banks. They emerge largely from the policy framework within
which the banking sector has had to operate and are not a reflection on LBL's
management. The main areas of difficulty relate to foreign exchange loans
(para 3.57), which subborrowers have not been able to repay in foreign
exchange due to the foreign exchange constraints in Yugoslavia. The bank's
low reserves position (para 3.52) is also an issue. Under the project,
measures will be taken to write-off deferred foreign exchange losses and to
improve LBL's reserve position. Both financial objectives would be achieved
under the project by increasing the onlending mark-up (para 3.55). Achievement
of these objectives would ensure LBL's profitability and liquidity and its
financial soundness and creditworthiness for Bank lending. In addition, LBL
would undertake several institutional measures to strengthen its appraisal
work (para 3.44), subproject follow-up (para 3.45), corporate planning (para
3.47), and internal auditing capability (para 3.46).
2. Structure and Organization
3.23     LBL is the third largest bank in Yugoslavia and the principaz. bank in
Slovenia. The associated bank was incorporated in 1955. The self-management
agreement and statute (available in the Project File) set out objectives,
nature of operations and organization. Twenty-two basic banks, 14 within
Slovenia and eight outside the Republic, hold LBL's share capital in the form
of a founder's fund. The basic banks are, in turn, owned by over 7,000
business enterprises representing all economic sectors. LBL has about 350
offices in Yugoslavia and 15 representative offices and 4 affiliates abroad.
The bank also has numerous correspondent arrangements with foreign banks,
while an offshore subsidiary has recently been established in New York to
further expand international activities.
3.24     Assembly and Boards.  The highest decision making body of LBL is the
Assembly, which is made up of five delegates from the assemblies of each of
the member basic banks. The Assembly approves the bank's five-year plans,
annual plans and business policy statement (para 3.25). The Assembly also
appoints several boards from among its members. The Executive Board, elected
for a two-year term, consists of two members from each basic bank and is
responsible for supervising the execution of the five-year plans of the bank
and for implementing the policies approved by the Assembly. The Credit and
Control Board, also elected for two years, consists of one member from each
basic bank and controls the lending and borrowing operations. The Management
Board consists of the President of the bank and five of the nine vice
presidents. It is responsible for the day-to-day operations. The Management
Board is appointed for a four year term. The top decision-making structure is
appropriate, taking into account the size and diversity of the bank's
operations.

3.25     The annual business policy statement, prepared on the basis of
Slovenia's five-year development plan and approved by the Assembly, covers
mobilization and allocation of resources, lending and deposit rates, distribu-
tion of surplus and write-offs for the past year and budget for the forthcoming
year. The current statement has been reviewed and found satisfactory. The
highest lending priority is for export-oriented industry, energy and
agriculture, which account for over 80 percent of the present and projected
total lending operations of LBL. This is consistent with the Slovenian plan.
The sectoral lending policies and priorities of Slovenia are aligned with
those of the Federal government. The lending iates are revised frequently
(para 3.20). The resource mobilization policy emphasizes long-term foreign
exchange deposits, particular'ly from emigrants. Long-term deposit rates have
been increased significantly (15 percent in 19a2 to 60 percent in 1985) to
achieve the resource mobilization goals. In addition to the above policies,
LBL has formulated investment appraisal financial and economic criteria (para
3.43). These criteria are sound. Appraisal procedures have been considerably
strengthened during the past two years, and proposed investments not
fulfilling certain financial requirements are now either modified or
rejected.
3.26     Organization and Management.  LBL, with a total staff of 1200, is
divided into nine sectors and five special units. The sectors are organized
along functional lines, each headed by a vice president; Planning, Resource
Management, Investment Promotion and Analysis, Personal Banking, Foreign
Transactions, Foreign Relations, Accounting, Personnel and Administration and
Electronic Data Processing.  The sectors are further divided into departments
and divisions. The special units, which report to the Management Board, are
task oriented and include an information center, secretariat, Office of the
Belgrade Representative, legal and technical services. Aside from some
improvements which are to be undertaken as a part of this project
(paras 3.42-3.49), LBL's organization is satisfactory for the needs of its
operations.
3.27     Over the years, LBL has developed a stable and competent cadre of
senior and middle management. In developing such management, LiL has profited
from its extensive relationship with foreign financial institutions, where
many of the senior managers have been trained. LBL has also successfully
recruited persons having broad experience in industry and Government. The
progressive outlook of senior management is indicated by the considera'ole
emphasis given on training, new analytical techniques and office technology.
3. Operations
3.28     LBL's main area of operations are long- and short-term loens and
guarantees.   Loan commitments are summarized in Table 3.L below.  Guarantees
are described in para. 3.31.
3.29     Long-term Loans. Long-term loan commitments nzsber about 700 per
year. They are generally for medium and small size investment projects. In
1985, about 400 loans were below Din 10 million ($70,000) and another 250
between Din 10 and 50 million ($330,000); only five were more than Din 400
million ($2.6 million). Most of the smaller loans are processed by the basic

banks, while LBL processes the larger loans (para 3.42). Manufacturing
industry accounts for about 50 percent of the long-term loans, and within
this, electrical equipment, textiles and chemicals are the dominant
subsectors. This is consistent with the industrial pattern in Slovenia.
Since 1982, the long-term lending operations have increased by 41 percent p.a.
in nominal terms. This however reflects a decrease of 5.6 percent in real
terms as a result of slowdown in the economy. Following Federally determined
policy, priority sectors, such as exports, energy, and agriculture, have been
granted credits more liberally; these sectors have received over 80 percent of
the long-term approvals in 1984-85.
3.30     Short-term Loans.  The short-term loans are mostly revolving credits
for financing working capital needs of enterprises. Such loans are normally
granted for three months. New loans are not granted to an enterprise prior to
repayment of due loans or rehabilitation programs are in process. LBL's
policy here is to continue to provide resources, but only in conjunction with
rehabilitation (para. 3.61). Between 1982 and 1985, short-term loans
increased in real terms by 55 percent p.a.
3.31     Guarantees.  These transactions constitute an important component of
LBL operations. At the end of 1985, the outstanding guarantees were
Din 1,237 billion ($4.0 billion) or approximately equivalent to 40 percent of
lending operations. The guarantees are given for import, export and
project-financing activities. About 35 percent of the guarantees are in
foreign exchange for import-export operations and the balance in local
currency. Of the foreign exchange guarantees, 86 percent are guarantees given
to overseas suppliers of commodities and services, bid bonds on behalf of
Yugoslav exporters and operations of Yugoslav companies operating abroad. The
local currency guarantees are for project financing operations: under
Yugoslav law, banks are required to guarantee that sufficient funds are
available to finance investment projects. These guarantees are liquidated as
credits are disbursed to subborrowers. Between 1982 and 1985, the guarantee
portfolio increased by a factor of ten in nominal terms (or about five times
in real terms). The guarantee operations have been profitable: in 1985,
guarantee income accounted for about 3.6 percent of the total income (Din 8.7
billion), and losses have beer, minimal, due to strong export performance of
subborrowers and tight enforcement procedures.
4. LBL's Financid Situation
3.32     Financial Position.  LBL's audited balance sheets and income
statements for the 1982-85 period are given in Annexes 10 and 11,
respectively. Total assets increased from Din 476 billion in 1982 ($7.7
billion in 1982 terms) to Din 1,915 billion ($6.1 billion in 1985 ter= ). The
long-tenm loan portfolio increased from Din 158.4 billion ($2.6 billion) in
1982 to Din 500.6 billion ($1.6 billion) in 1985, an increase of 33.3 percent
p.a. The long-term debt/reserves ratio increased from 1.8 in 1982 to 3.9 in
1985. The share of reserves in total assets declined from 3.9 percent to 3.3
percent during the same period. These last two changes are largely due to
rapid devaluation of the Dinar vis-a-vis foreign resources, which account for
a high proportion of LBL's financial structure, as well as the slow growth
1827L

of reserves (para 3.52). Like other Yugoslav banks, the unlimited liability
of LBL's founder members (para 3.50) and the absence of share capital does not
permit the specification of a debt/equity ratio limit. A minimum cushion of
reserves however is deemed necessary to protect LBL against short-term risks
and demonstrate the ability and willingness of the founders to protect LBL
(para 3.52 through 3.54).
3.33     At the end of 1985, LBL carried a deferred foreign exchange loss of
Din 172.4 billion in its balance sheet, shown as assets. The loss is related
to the foreign exchange loans provided by LBL to subborrowers during the
1981-1985 period (para 3.57). Under Yugoslav banking regulations, a bank must
write-off financial losses actually incurred during a fiscal year from its net
income for that year or, if this is insufficient, from its Joint Liability
Fund (JLF) (para 3.52). After reviewing the nature of the "deferred foreign
exchange loss" and seeking court ruling on the obligations of subborrowers,
LBL has established that this amount is not a loss account, but instead a
legal obligation of the subborrower, i.e., an account receivable, and as such
no deduction from income or JLF is required. LBL has therefore not
written-off the deferred foreign exchange loss from the JLF. Instead, LBL,
assisted by the SR Slovenia authorities, instituted a scheme for stabilizing
this loss through dinarization (purchase of foreign exchange from household
(private) accounts to be used to transform the foreigr exchange losses into
Dinars), with subsequent write-off of any Dinar (local currency) losses
against income (paras 3.57-3.59). Subsequently, changes in foreign exchange
legislation have caused amendments to the dinarization scheme (paras
3.59-3.62). But, the overall situation remains satisfactory.
3.34     Short-term deposits increased from Din 123.1 billion ($2.0 billion at
the end of the year exchange rate) in 1982 to Din 494.4 billion ($1.6 billion)
in 1985, an increase of 59 percent p.a. Of these, 52 percent were from
enterprises, 23 percent were in foreign exchange and 29 percent in local
cur -ncy. The remaining 48 percent were from personal deposits, 28 percent in
foreign exchange and 20 percent in local currency. Long-term deposits
increased from Din 110 billion (1.8 billion) in 1982 to Din 465.2 billion
($1.5 billion) in 1985, an increase of 62 percent p.a. Of these, 84 percent
were personal deposits, including 63 percent in foreign exchange and 21
percent in local currency. The remaining 16 percent were from enterprises,
mostly in local currency. The share of long-term deposits in the total
personal deposits increased from 38 percent in 1982 to 47 percent in 1985.
For enterprises, the same ratio declined from 27 percent in 1982 to 13 percent
in 1985. LBL intends to continue its emphasis on increasing long-term
deposits, to stabilize its resource base.
3.35     Liquidity.  The overall current ratio has been in the acceptable
range of 0.9 to 1.1. Dinar liquidity has actually improved due to domestic
credit restrictions. However, the bank's foreign currency liquidity was hard
hit by closure of the domestic foreign exchange market in 1981. LBL had to
reschedule foreign debt maturities (medium- and long-term) totalling $432
million equivalent, which fell due in 1983 and 1984. Foreign exchange
liquidity is expected to remain tight in the next few years. An additional
rescheduling of $220 million equivalent for 1985-86 with international
comnercial banks has also been completed.  With the exception of these
reschedulings, LBL has been able to service all of its domestic and foreign
debt.

3.37     LBL had a surplus resource position of Din 31.2 billion at the end of
1985. In 1984 it was negative, amounting to Din 24.4 billion or $119
million. The 1985 surplus is the result of a sizeable increase in long term
deposits of local currency relative to long-term loans. This surplus
liquidity in Dinar terms is acceptable given that the overall cash to
Dinar-disbursement ratio is about 3 percent. However, it is on the foreign
exchange side that deficits are expected.

3.39     The arrears are low, but have increased slightly from 0.28 percent of
the outstanding portfolio in 1984 to 0.39 percent in 1985. Arrears reportedly
remained low in 1986. The low level of arrears are primarily due to strong
collection performance; the collection ratio, as measured by the ratio of the
amount of principal collected to the principal falling due during a period,
including arrears at the end of the previous year, was over 100 percent in
1984, indicating that some of the 1983 arrears were also collected; in 1985
the collection ratio fell below 100. It is reported to have improved again in
1986. A small amount of rescheduling (Din 400 million, or 0.13 percent of
long-term portfolio in 1984) was done for valid cases. The above figures do
not include an imbalance of $431 million (Din 172.4 billion) in foreign
exchange. This foreign exchange imbalance is treated separately, because of
its special origin and the proposals made by LBL to liquidate them (paras
3.57-3.62).
3.40     Financial Surplus.  LBL's net income after taxes (Annex 11) increased
from Din 2.3 billion in 1982 ($36.5 million in 1982 terms) to Din 42.4 billion
in 1985 ($135.9 million in 1985 terms), an annual growth rate of 164 percent
in Dinar terms. The increased surplus reflects the recent rapid increase in
the portfolio (Table 3.1). In relation to total assets, the net income
increased from 0.48 percent in 1982 to 2.22 percent in 1985. The large
inc-ease in the net income in Dinar terms is the result of increase in the
spread and Dinar commission on foreign loans from 3.0 percent p.a. in 1982 to
6.0 percent p.a. in 1985 and about an eight-fold increase in the other
operating income, which has increased with inflation. The ratio of
IL&2  L



- 29 -
interest-paying liabilities (borrowings and customer deposits) to
interest-earning assets (loans and deposits) decreased from 1.03 in 1982 to
0.88 in 1985, reflecting a xelatively faster growth of loans portfolio over
customers deposits. On the other hand, the cost of borrowing as a proportion
of interest earned increased from 77 percent in 1982 to 85 percent in 1985,
which was offset by the increase in other income. LBL's administrative
expenses as a ratio of average total assets have remained low at about 1.15
percent.
3.41     Interest Rate Spread.  In accordance to Yugoslav lending rate policy
(paras 3.18-3.20), LBL sets the spread on local currency subloans and Dinar
commission on foreign currency subloans (para 3.21) in relation its projected
administrative expenses 1/, write-off of financial losses, and additions to
rcserves. Each year, LBL sets the spread and the Dinar commission on foreign
exchange loans at about the same level. For example, in 1985, the average
spread on the local currency subloans was 6 percent p.a., the average Dinar
commission on the foreign currency subloans was also 6 percent p.a.
Differences in these charges are found in previous years, sometimes favoring
domestic currency borrowers and sometimes foreign currency borrowers. The
differences are always small, particularly whe, considered in relation to the
total cost of a loan to the final investor. The number of uncontrollable
variables and their volatility, principally domestic and international
inflation and exchange rates, does not permit LBL to precisely equate the
two. Further consideration of this policy for the project is made in
para 3.55.
5. Evaluation of LBL's Performance
Institutional Performance
3.42     Project Appraisal.  The Investment Promotion Sector (IPS) is
responsible for appraisal. IFC has assisted LBL in improving its project
appraisal capability. It is now satisfactory. IPS's apprais-' .s based on
standard information formats, which investors must complete as a part of the
loan applications. Feasibility studies by external consultants are normally
required for larger applications (investment costs of over $3.0 million).
Preliminary review of the applications is carried out within five days and,
depending upon the additional information required, appraisal is normally
completed within one to two months. LBL uses several financial, operational
and social indicators to appraise projects. The principal financial and
economic indicators are the rates of return, which must be above 15 percent
and 12 percent respectively (in constant terms). The debt/own funds ratio is
usually 1; grace and maturity periods, depending upon the cash flow, are 1 to
3 years and 6 to 15 years respectively.
1/ Administrative expenses are almost totally in local currency, as foreign
expenditure, related only to foreign offices of banks, is small compared
to the total administrative expenses and is normally financed through
purchase of foreign exchange by banks.
5927 L



- 30 -
3.43     The average size of investment project reviewed by IPS is about $2.5
million, with an LBL loan amount of about $1.0 million. Subprojects below
these limits are normally reviewed and approved by the basic banks. IPS
processes about 150 projects each year, which is about 21 percent of the
number of projects and 25 percent of the total long-term loan amount approved
by the LBL system as a whole. IPS's importance in LBL's system is, however,
considerably greater than indicated by these numbers; it appraises all
projects requiring borrowed foreign-exchange funds or pooled resources of more
than one basic bank.
3.44     IPS currently has a staff of 24 professionals including 17 economists,
six engineers and one lawyer. While the appraisal staff is competent, their
number is inadequate to handle the present workload of over 150 appraisals per
year, particularly in the engineering field. IPS has covered the shortfall by
utilizing engineering staff of other divisions. But this arrangement has not
always worked satisfactorily, due to conflicting priorities of respective
divisions. Also, IPS's workload is expected to increase with the proposed
project.  To avoid the staffing situation from becoming a constraint for IPS's
activities, and following the recommendations during the appraisal of this
project, LBL has decided to increase IPS's staff by December 31, 1987 from the
existing 24 professionals to 34 (19 economists, 14 engineers and one lawyer).
Agreement was confirmed during negotiations that LBL will carry out an
adequate staffing program in IPS. This would enable IPS to maintain a
reasonable ratio of number of projects to staff.
3.45     Project Supervision.  Project supervision, which is the
respons-ibility of the Resource Management Sector (RMS), was initiated about
two years ago, but the supervision function needs to be further strengthened.
The function is currently spread among RMS's three departments, whose primary
responsibilities include identification and pooling of domestic and foreign
resources for short- and long-term lending and also assistance to subborrowers
in procurement. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the
basic banks are the normal primary source of contact with enterprises, while
coordination between the basic banks and RMS is weak. Except for very large
projects, supervision is mostly on an ad-hoc basis, with inadequate reporting
and review procedures. LBL with the Bank's assistance has begun to develop a
supervision system which would include preparation of a list of projects to be
supervised, rating of problem projects, preparation and execution of field
visit plans every six months and reporting and review procedures. The system,
which would cover about 350 projects involving Associated bank and foreign
funds, would permit LBL to supervise large projects every 3 to 6 months and
medium projects every 6 to 12 months. The system would be gradually
implemented starting from July 1, 1987 and fully operational by
June 30, 1988. To implement the system, LBL has decided to establish by
March 31, 1987 a separate supervision department under RMS, with an initial
staff of five engineers and economists each, to be recruited by
September 30, 1987. The proposed functions and responsibilities of the
department and an initial work program are described in Annex 8. During
negutiations agreement was obtained from LBL that it will implement an
adequate project supervision program.

3.46     Internal Audit.  This activity has diminished in importance over the
past few years and its staff reduced to one internal auditor. Following the
recommendations during appraisal, LBL has appointed four new auditors in this
division and decided to recruit four additional auditors by June 30, 1987.
These appointments were reconfirmed during negotiations and agreement was
obtained during negotiations, that LBL will carry out the necessary staffing
program to maintain adequate staff in this division.
3.47     Planning and Analysis Sector is responsible for operational and
financial planning and analysis for the bank. Its major activity in the past
has been to prepare, prior to the beginning of a fiscal year, operational
projections, resource requirements, administrative budget and interest rate
policies for that year. Also, upon completion of a fiscal year, PAS prepares
analysis of actual results of the bank. The yearly production of these reports
is proving increasingly inadequate, given the economic uncertainties in
Yugoslavia, the high domestic inflation, Dinar devaluation, uncertainty about
the availability of new foreign resources and domestic credit ceilings.
Recognizing this problem, LBL has decided to considerably strengthen its
planning process. It has recently elevated the planning and statistics
activity to the sector (vice-presidential) level, appointed a new
vice-president in charge of the sector and is to recruit seven additional
personnel by June 30, 1987, to bring the number of professionals on the
planning side to 12 and on the statistics side to 15 (an increase of four and
three respectively). This should be adequate to undertake the work program
which this sector has set for itself. According to that program, LBL would
introduce the preparation of short-term plans of 3 to 6 months as well as
multi-year rolling plans in current prices, whereby detailed financial
projections would be prepared and critical operational and financial ratios
would be calculated and reviewed by the top management, so as to spot emerging
problems and to permit prompt corrective actions. The statistical data base
required for bank-wide planning would be strengthened by centralizing accounts
and other information from the associated and basic banks and by processing it
on computers (para 3.49). The new planning procedures (short-term and
multi-year plans) are to be implemented during 1986 and 1987. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that, starting with the 1987 calendar year, LBL
will prepare its three year operational and financial projections in current
prices and send these to the Bank by March 31 of each year and that LBL would
also carry out the staffing program necessary to maintain adequate staff in
the Planning and Analysis Sector.
3.48     Operational Management Information System (MIS)  In early 1984, LBL
appointed an internal working group to review alternative means to improve the
MIS and procedures. Following the group's recommendations, LBL has divided
the MIS tasks into two phases. The first phase would address the information
requirements up to the department directors and their sectoral vice-presidents.
Most of these sectoral sub-systems are in operation, but rely on manual
data-processing, which lacks timeliness and quality. TIhe most urgent priority
is, therefore, to computerize these subsystems (para 3.49) and to train
operators for them. The second phase of the MIS would address the
requirements of the top management and across the sectors such as planning and
supervision. LBL plans to develop this phase of the MIS in 1986 and 1987,
possibly with the assistance of a local consultant. External financing is not
envisaged for this phase.

3.49     Equipment for Data Processing.  In 1985, LBL prepared a 3-year
development plan to mechanize the information system. The plan envisages
installation of personal computer work stations in about 30 divisions, with
capability to access a mainframe computer, to be purchased in 1988, when the
sectoral subsystems become operational. Plans are also under way to
progressively install on-line communications network with basic banks, many of
which have their own computers. The priority would be given to computerization
of accounting, financial records, consumer banking and to special applications
such as planning, appraisal and supervision. LBL has requested World Bank
financing of the imported computer equipment. The appraisal mission has
reviewed and endorsed LBL's proposal to include under this project the
acquisition 13 personal computers and software for information processing and
for special applications in planning, appraisal and supervision departments.
The total cost of this component is estimated to be $300,000. LBL has
initiated a sound training program for equipment operators. Procurement of
the PCs would be by international and local shopping. Availability of local
servicing and training facilities would be taken into account.
Fincal Performance
3.50     Creditworthiness.  The assessment of LBL's creditworthiness is based
on a review of LBL's financial position and prospects. LBL has demonstrated
its ability to maintain a high quality of portfolio reflecting sound resources
management and investment selection. Considering this record together with
the measures proposed under this loan (paras 3.53 through 3.62), LBL is
creditworthy for Bank lending. As noted in para 3.12, Yugoslav policy makers
recognize the need to strengthen the independence of banks, through the
provision of their own share capital, with the object of transforming banks
into limited liability enterprises and giving them the discretion to create
reserves and provisions above the legislated minima. The 1986 Banking Law
would allow for this. LEL's creditworthiness for Bank lending is reinforced
by the argument advanced for the previous lines of industrial credit to
Yugoslavia; which is that LBL's basic banks and, in turn, their founder
members, have tnlimited liability for the associated bank's LBL's obligations.
3.51     Audit.  Since _ts initiation over ten years ago, SDK's audit of
Yugoslav banks, including LBL, has made progress in gradually broadening the
scope of its work and in applying with some exceptions however, generally
accepted accounting and auditing standards. At the same time, given the
considerably greater fiuancial uncertainties in Yugoslavia, further improve-
ments in audit have become necessary to gain a comprehensive insight into
financial strengths and weaknesses of banks. Under study are needed
improvements which include separation of domestic and foreign assets and
liabilities, assessment of the quality of portfolio, reschedulings and
arrears, treatment of foreign exchange risks and losses, adequacy of reserves
and provisions and the auditor's opinion on these. SDK, and most banks with
whom the Bank has credit relationships, agree that such improvements would
greatly enhance the quality of the audit. This matter would require changes
1627L



- 33 -
in the audit law, issuance of new guidelines on audit policy and formats for
all banks, as well as considerable strengthening of SDK through new
recruitment and training. Discussions on this are under way with the
Government and SDK. In the meantime, the information necessary for this
project, and which was not available through the audit reports, has been
supplied by LBL in satisfactory accuracy and detail. During negotiations,
reporting requirements were discussed in detail and agreed to, ensuring that
LBL will continue to report to the Bank on its financial situation in a
comprehensive way.
3.52     Reserves Position.  In accordance with Yugoslaw regulations, loan
losses during a fiscal year are estimated by SDK and LBL and are written-off
from LBL's income for that year or, if this is insufficient, from the Joint
Liability Fund (JLF). LBL's policy-is not to make separate provisions for
writing-off loan losses. As a result, the size of the JLF, which is used for
writing off loan losses and the Reserve Fund (RF), for maintaining LBL's
liquidity, are very important to provide the bank with the necessary cushion
against the risk it incurs on its portfolio. As regards the JLF, the 1986
Banking Law requires that, by 1990, each bank must attain a JLF of not less
than 5 percent of its assets at risk (approximately equal to all short and
long term loans) at the end of the previous year, with a minimum annual
build-up of .1 percent of this amount. As regards the RF, the 1986 law
requires that a bank should pool resources in this fund so that the amount
added each year is not less than 1 percent of the assets at risk, until the RF
reaches 5 percent. Thereafter, the 5 percent level should be maintained. The
previous banking law, (The Revised Law on the Credit and Banking System -
1984) contained similar requirements. But, the JLF and RF-of LBL did not
reach the prescribed levels.l/ At the end of 1985, LBL's JLF of Din 26.5
billion ($84.9 million) was about 80 percent of the level required by the law
and RF of Din 16.0 billion ($51.3 million) was 53 percent of the level
required.
3.53     During appraisal, it was estimated t-hat the currently legislated JLF
level of 5 percent is indeed necessary in LBL to build up a cushion against
the normal business risks faced by LBL and because of the arrears on repayment
of foreign exchange loans provided by LBL to subborrowers, who are the net
users of foreign exchange (para 3.57). While the entire amount of these
foreign exchange arrears is eventually legally recoverable (because of the
borrower's legal obligations), LBL needs an additional cushion in the
short-term against these arrears, so as to avoid liquidity problems and to
further improve creditworthiness. Development of such cushion is quantified
in Table 3.4.
3.54     At the time of appraisal the Banking Law in force required a
3 percent level of RF (the JLF level was 5 percent). Analysis by the
appraisal mission showed that, to increase the JLF to 5 percent and RF to 5
percent (from the 1985 levels of 2.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively),
LBL would need to increase its spread and dinar commission on foreign exchange
loans (para. 3.41) above the existing weighted average of about 6.0 percent.
1/ Neither the 1984 nor the 1986 law specifies any penalty for non-compliance.
1S27L



- 34 -
The annual targets for the JLF and RF, concomitant with 5 percent levels for
each by 1990, are shown in Table 3.4. The targets for 1986 are expected to be
exceeded. In line with the appraisal mission's discussions with LBL
management, agreement was reached during negotiations that LBL would increase
its JLF to 5 percent by no later than 1990 according to the schedule in Table
3.4. Concerning the RF, LBL indicated that this would be increased to the now
legally required level of 5 percent by no later than 1990.

3.55     LBL's interest rate policy is in line with the Yugoslav policy as  -
described in paras 3.18 to 3.21. LBL currently charges 49 to 80 percent,
depending upon the priority status of the project (para 3.20)  Under SAL,
policy changes were introduced by Yugoslav banks, including LBL, to bring
interest rates to positive levels in real terms by 1989. Positive real
interest rates remain the firm policy objective of LBL. Steps to reach this
objective for energy loans would be taken under the project (para 4.20). On
foreign loans, the foreign exchange risk is fully passed to subborrowers and
the interest rate is equal to the borrowing rate. As a result the interest
rate is positive and no subsidization is implied. 1/  The added commission in
dinars (para 3.21) is appropriate considering the scarcity of foreign exchange
and the active role LBL plays in mobilizing these resources.  During
negotiations, agreement was obtained that every year LBL would set its
interest spread on domestic operations and dinar commission on foreign
exchange at a level not less than that necessary to generate earnings after
taxes sufficient to meet all of LBL's anticipated expenses, including loss
write-offs (paras 3.57-3.62) and increases in the JLF and RF. To achieve
this, LBL will need to make projections of the outstanding balances of the
loan portfolio, deposits and borrowings at the end of each fiscal year.
1/ Until SAL is fully implemented, dispdrities could be found if subborrowers
could borrow dinars at negative interest rates in real terms and purchase
foreign exchange with the proceeds of their loan. This however is not
possible because of the overall scarcity of foreign exchange.
1827L



- 35 -
The required addition to the JLF and RF will be estimated by LBL, as well as
resources required for elimination of the deferred foreign exchange loss
(paras 3.57-3.61), write-off of current foreign exchange losses and other
financial expenses of LBL during the year to remunerate deposits and other
resources. On this basis, LBL will then be able to derive the minimum level
of financial income required to cover the increase in the JLF and RF and
eliminate deferred foreign exchange losses. Since part of the portfolio
(20 percent) is made up of long-term loans with fixed conditions, LBL will
have to analyze the portfolio to determine the spread and commission levels
corresponding to the minimum income target. During negotiations, agreement
was also obtained that LBL will submit, by September 30 of each year to the
Bank, a draft plan, including data, calculations, and proposed spread and
commission levels, for the spread and commission to apply in the subsequent
year's lending operations and, by December 31 of each year, a final such plan
both acceptable to the Bank. The level of both the spread and commission
would be reviewed annually by LBL and the Bank, to ensure its adequacy. The
dinar commission would be charged on all foreign exchange loans provided by
LBL, including Bank funds.
3.56     Under the 1986 banking law, a bank must allocate its net income to
its members before appropriation to JLF and RF. It is the General Assembly's
responsibility to determine the contribution to the JLF and RF. In 1985, LBL
allocated 100 percenit of net income to its JLF and RF. LBL's 1986-90
Five-Year Plan, approved by its General Assembly, detailing proposed future
contributions to these funds, has been reviewed and found satisfactory
(para 3.61).
3.57     Deferred Foreign L.xzhange Loss.  As of December 31, 1985, LBL's
foreign exchange position showed an imbalance (foreign exchange liabilities.
minus foreign exchange assets) of about $431 million. The sources of this
foreign exchange imbalance can be grouped into three categories as follows:
(i)    Loan repayments on behalf of
subborrowers without foreign exchange           $210 million
(ii)    Short-term loans in foreign exchange
outstanding as of December 31, 1985
that would have to be settled in
Dinars in accordance with the new
foreign exchange law                            $105 million
(iii)   Foreign exchange sold in the Yugoslav
market for Dinars to strengthen
liquidity of other banks                        $116 million
$431 million
3.58     Category (i) represents the foreign exchange repayment obligations of
the net importing subborrowers, which LBL paid on their behalf during
1982-85. The enterprises, which, through exports, earned sufficient foreign
exchange, repaid their foreign debt obligations from export earnings. But,
enterprises which are net users of foreign exchange depended on LBL to meet
their foreign debt repayment obligations. About 57 percent ($120 million) of
1827L



- 36 -
this amount was due from enterprises in infrastructure sectors, mainly energy,
railways and roads and the remaining 43 percent ($90 million) from commercial
and social enterprises, such as theatres and hospitals. Categories (ii) and
(iii) arose in 1985. Category (ii) represents the short-term loans to
enterprises in foreign exchange which were outstanding at the end of 1985.
Under the Foreign Exchange Law of 1985, Yugoslav enterprises are required to
pay their repayment obligations in equivalent Dinars. Thus, while LBL's
liability to external creditors in respect of these loans is in foreign
exchange, LBL's assets (repay.ient from enterprises) are in equivalent Dinars.
Category (iii) arose due to the fact that, at times LBL exceeded its maximum
foreign exchange liquidity limit set by NBY and had to sell the excess amount
in the Yugoslav foreign exchange market. LBL carries the full foreign
exchange risk on the three above categories. As a result, at the end of 1985,
LBL carried a foreign exchange loss of Din 115 billion ($431 million
equivalent).
3.59     In 1985, LBL initiated corrective measures to reduce its foreign
imbalance. It required all Slovenian exporters to sell to it 6 percent of
their annual receipts. As a result, category (i) above (para 3.57) which
amounted to $280 million at the end of 1984 could be reduced to $210 million.
In addition, in FY85, LBL wrote off deferred foreign exchange loss of Din 10
billion from its income.
3.60     In 1986, the 6 percent scheme could not continue, since the 1986
Foreign Exchange Law requires that exporters surrender to NBY 100 percent of
their receipts in foreign exchange. While the new law gives priority to the
repayment of external obligation from 1986 onwards, it does not permit
recovery by LBL of the foreign exchange due by enterprises prior to that
time. The law also prevents LBL from passing to enterprises the foreign
exchange loss incurred before 1986 and deferred by LBL. After considerable
discussions with the National Bank of Yugoslavia and LBL founders, at the LBL
Assembly of November 1986, LBL decided to absorb the entire loss from future
income.
3.61     LBL has agreed to purchase from its household account the foreign
exchange it needs to eliminate its imbalance of $431-million kara 3.57) as
follows: 1986, $165 million; 1987, $187 million; and 1988, $82 million. It
also decided to write-off the loss from annual earnings over a five-year
period, 1986-90. Other foreign exchange losses occurring from post-1985
maturities would be dinarized and written-off in the year in which they
arise. Achievement of these targets would strengthen LBL's fix.ancial position
by 1990. The setting of LBL's earnings spread to ensure adequate funds to
implement this plan is critical (para 3.55).  LBL's Five Year s'an (FYP) for
1986-90, approved by LBL's General Assembly on November 6, 1986 has been
reviewed by the Bank, particularly as it relates to the issues of JLF and RF
build-up, elimination of all deferred foreign exchange losses, and generation
of the resources necessary to achieve these financial targets. Achievement of
these targets is included in the FYP and are the same as those given in
Table 3.4 for the JLF and RF and as noted above for the write-off of foreign
exchange losses.
'827L



- 37 -
3.62     Resources to finance these actions would be generated from LBL's
earnings spreads and commissions. The FYP provides adequately for these. The
estimated weighted average spread on LBL loans is planned to average
8.0 percent over the 1986-90 period, as compared with 6 percent in 1985. The
1986 level is expected to average 13 percent (15 percent was the level
actually set for the final quarter of 1986), while the 1987 level is planned
at 12 percent. This level of earnings can be expected to provide a generous
cushien of resources with which to achieve the financial targets. During
negotiations, LBL agreed that, in respect to these financial targets, the FYP
shall not be amended or abrogated unless agreed to by the Bank. This,
together with the annual review and agreement on interest rate spread and
commission (para 3.55) gives adequate assurance that the program will be
followed.
6. Forecast of LBL's Operations and Financial Performance
3.63     LBL's operational and financial projections are based on its
medium-term plans for the 1986-90 period and take into account the regional
investment targets. During this period, short-term lending operations are
projected to increase by 17 percent annually in real terms, and by 96 percent
p.a. in nominal terms, to reach Din 4,125 billion in 1980. The projected
long-term lending ope:-ations are summarized in Teble 3.5 below. The long-term
lending operations are expected to decrease by 3C percent p.a. in real terms
in 1986 and 1987, 20 percent in 1988 and 5 per^Ant in 1989. In 1990 they are
expected to increase by 20 percent in real terms to reach Din 3,580 in nominal
terms.  The -hare of industry is expected to remain aboub 50 percent of LBL's
total long-term loan approvals.

requirement from new borrowing and the remainder from long-term deposits
(45 percent) and internal generation (6 percent). The Bank group (khrough
this project and the two IFC loans) would meet about 40 percent of the foreign
exchange requirements on a disbursement basis.

3.65     Financial Results.  The projected Income Statements, Cash Flow
Statements, and Balance Sheets for the period 1986-90, and the underlying
assumptions are shown in Annexes 13, 14, 15 and 16, respectively. Net profit
is projected to increase by 78 percent p.a. in real terms, i.e., 95 percent
annually in nominal terms, to reach Din 818 billion in 1989. This is
satisfactory. The increase is primarily due to the increase in the weighted
average of spread and comission (para. 3.61). This spread would be
sufficient to cover administrative expenses, which are projected to decrease
as a ratio of total assets from 0.71 percent in 1986 to 0.46 percent in 1990,
as well as to build up the Joint Liability and Reserve funds to 5 percent each
loan portfolio by 1990.
3.66     The projected financial position is satisfactory.  The total assets
would increase by 5.7 percent annually in real terms, an increase of
77 percent p.a. in nominal terms. The long-term loan and investments
portfolio is projected to decrease by 16 percent p.a. in real terms or
increase by 41 percent p.a. in nomin-I terms. On the other hand, the
short-term loan portfolio is projected to increase by 17 percent p.a. in real
terms (96 percent p.a. in nominal terms). As a result, the percentage of
short-term loans in the total portfolio would increase from 62 percent in 1986
to 82 percent in 1990. The borrowings portfolio would increase by 15 percent
p.a. in real terms or 92 percent p.a. in nominal terms, which would be faster
than the rate of growth in the loans portfolio of 2 percent p.a. in real
terms. Partly as a result, the ratio of total debt to total assets would
increase from 46 percent in 1986 to 64 percent in 1990. The debt/reserves
ratio is projected to decrease from 16.3 in 1986 -to 15 in 1990, due to
strengthening of the JLF and RF. Cash and deposits are expected to increase
from Din 1,526 billior. ($2.9 billion) in 1986 to Din 14,346 billion
($4.1 billion) in 1990. This rapid increase in cash and deposits, in Dinar
terms, reflects the high level of domestic inflation, liquidation of
foreign-exchange overdue repayments, increase in deposits and increases in the
JLF and RF. Excluding the JLF and RF, which may not be used for disbursement,
cash and deposits, as projected, represent one to two months of LBL's annual
disbursement requirements.  This is s- isfactory, given the high proportion of
short-term loans (90 perceat) in LBL's total disbursement, which requires
large amounts of cash and liquid assets. If necessary, LBL uses short-term
borrowings to meet its disbursement and liquidity requirements. The liquidity
ratio would remain around 1.2, which is acceptable. LBL would be able to
service its foreign debt; the foreign receipts to foreign payments ratio is
about 1.6.

CHAPTER Iv
THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The major objectives of the project1'are to:
(a)    promote energy efficiency in industry, primarily in Slovenia, by
reducing energy consumption through conservation and lowering the
cost of energy consumed through substitution by lower-cost energy
sources. This would improve industrial competitiveness and reduce
energy imports, thus helping to improve the balance of trade;
(b)    support the development of technical capabilities for energy audit
work in Slovenia, thus providing examples of viable energy-saving
investment in manufacturing industry. The demonstration effect for
other investments in the whole of Yugoslavia, is expected to be a
significant indirect benefit of the project, and strengthen the
financial and institutional aspects of the borrowing bank (LBL).
B. Project Components
4.02.    In support of these objectives the project will finance investments
in:
i)    energy conservation and substitution subprojects in industry in
..Yugoslavia;
(ii)    energy audits, as a basis for assessing the potential of proposed
energy conservation and substituAtion projects;
(iii)   domestic production of energy saving material or equipment;
(iv)    development or expansion of proven substitute local energy resources;
and
(v)    other energy related investments resulting in a reduction in energy
consumption per unit of output.
4.03     Subprojects in energy conservation and substitution are expected to
form the majority of the investments financed under the line of credit.
Conservation projects may generate energy savings through process change, as
well as through improvements in metering, flow control, insulation, etc.
Process changes can provide quanititative or qualitative benefits. In aidition
to energy conservation and substitution, quantitative effects can be either:
(i) increased output volume with no increase in non-energy inputs (other
inputs); or (ii) no change in output volume, but a decrease in non-energy
1/ The project was identified by the Sixth Industrial Credit (IC VI)
appraisal mission in the Fall of 1981. A small allocation (US$0.3
million) was included in IC VI to finance technical energy audits at the
enterprise level to initiate project preparation.

inputs. Qualitative effects of process change will be reflected through an
increase in the product price as a result of improved quality. In order to
maintain the focus of the project on energy savings, non-energy benefits
credited to any investment may not exceed 45 percent of the discounted value
of the total benefit stream of any energy conservation and substitution
subproject.
4.04     Energy Audits are a necessary part of the appraisal of subprojects in
energy conservation and substitution and also of appraisal of subprojects in
reduction in unit output energy consumption. They are primarily a means of
identifying potential investments and assessing needed inputs and economic and
financial benefits. Most energy audits would be carried out by local
technical enterprises, requiring local currency financing. Energy audits of
the larger or technically complex enterprises may require foreign consultant
input, involving direct foreign exchange costs. Such costs would be eligible
for financing from the Bank loan. Criteria for acceptability of energy audits
are given in Annex 17.
4.05     Subprojects for Producing Energy-Saving Materials or Equipment.
These subprojects are expected to reduce imports of such equipment and expand
overall energy conservation and substitution efforts in Yugoslavia. Typical
investments would be in the production of insulation materials, controls, and
fuel-burning equipment. Some of these are manufactured in Yugoslavia; but,
the need for improvement, as well as expansion, is present.
4.06     Subprojects for Substitute Local Energy Resource Development.  Areas
that depend heavily on imported oil offer greater potential for investments in
energy substitution. Many of these are in the LDRs; but, many possibilities
also exist in MDRs. Availability of domestic substitute fuel is low; but,
proven lignite deposits are available. These are generally developed in
conjunction with energy substitution projects in nearby plants. In many
cases, it will also be feasible to switch to lower cost fuels which are
imported. Some geothermal energy sources are also being reviewed, with a view
to possible financing of such investments under the project (para. 4.13).
4.07     Subprojects for Reduction in Unit Energy Consumption.  In some
instances, scale economies and technology may combine to give rise to a
minimum size investment in a new process, which results in an increase in
overall energy consumption due to the increased output, but, which may
significantly reduce energy use per unit of output. Such investments are
eligible for financing under the project. In order to ensure that energy
saving is a major investment incentive, at appraisal all such investments must
demonstrate the capacity for a reduction of not less than 10 percent in
consumption of energy per unit of output.
Subproject Pipeline
4.08     Substantial preparatory work has been done in Slovenia on subproject
identification for energy conservation and substitution projects. A total of
20 energy audits had been completed at the end of October 1985, of which
sixteen were in final form, permitting detailed analysis; seven feasibility
studies, some in draft form, were also available for review, as well as one
IZ27L



- 41 -
draft appraisal report. By negotiations, five additional draft subproject
appraisal reports had been reviewed and commented upon. All but two
subprojects concern energy conservation. Of the 20 audited subprojects in
Slovenia, 17 are aggregated in Table 4.1 to show investment costs and payback
periods; three other audits, which are still in a very early stage, are
excluded.
4.09     Eight of the energy audits were conducted by a foreign consultant
firm, assisted by engineers from SMELT, a local, but internationaily known,
engineering and construction firm (Annex 3). A further nine audits were
performed by SMELT, using the same foreign consultant firm to review and
comment on their findings. Three other energy audits were performed by IBE, a
Slovene engineering company in the power sector; IBE also used the assistance
of a foreign consultant firm for a review of the data. The feasibility
studies have been prepared by the companies themselves, with LBL guidance,
using the energy audits as the basis. The appraisal reports were prepared by
LBL.
4.10     A list of 17 energy-audited subprojects in Slovenia, together with
relevant data on project cost, foreign exchange component, and benefits to be
achieved, is given in Annex 4, Page 5, and summarized in Table 4.1. Elsewhere
in Yugoslavia, twenty one enterprises have had energy audits, conducted by a
foreign consultant firm with local assistance (Annex 3). No feasibility
studies are as yet available. The twenty one enterprises, together with total
project cost, foreign exchange and benefits requirements are also summarized
in Table 4.1 (Item "C" - Other Yugoslavia) and detailed in Annex 4.

- 42 -
4.11   The energy audited pipeline comprises 42 subprojects, with a total cost
of about $95 million and a direct foreign exchange cost of about $40 million.
There are three other potential subprojects in Slovenia which have had an
energy audit, but for which cost data are not yet available
(Annex 4, Page 4). A further 40 companies 1/ in Slovenia have confirmed to
LBL their interest in energy audits, the prerequisite for participation in the
energy conservation loan.
4.12   In the energy savings and equipment area, two insulation materials
subprojects in Slovenia are under preparation. Elsewhere, two possible
investments in open-pit lignite mines have been identified in Macedonia, while
two known geothermal energy sources, one each in Macedonia and Slovenia are
under investigation. If financed, these latter would be small investments,
for direct utilization of geothermal heat. Finally, 77 subprojects for
reduction in unit energy consumption have been identified in a variety of
industrial activities, including metal working, small scale electrical
equipment manufacturing and woodworking. The estimated foreign exchange
content of the total pipeline is US$110 million.
4.13   Based on the pipeline review to date, about 30 percent of the
subprojects by value are expected to be appraised by April 1987, and at least
a further 35 percent pre-identified by _BL. The average foreign exchange cost
is currently estimated to be about US$0.5 million; however, the range is
wide. The proposed loan amount is US$90 million, including a technical
assistance program of US$0.6 million. At the time of appraisal, almost 65
percent ($40 millior) of the amount of the proposed loan had been firmly
identified (para 4.11). The total amount of the proposed loan is based on
estimates of the potential demand for industrial energy related investment in
Slovenia and Yugoslavia as a whole (paras 2.14 - 2.22), together with
indications of keen interest on the level of enterprises in these investments
as confirmed by LBL and the Slovene Chanber of Commerce.
Technical Assistance
4.14   Technical assistance in the amount of $0.6 million will be provided to:
(i) promote domestic capability in energy auditing techniques and provide
ad-hoc consultant and assistance for complex technical subprojects; and
(ii) assist in upgrading the capabilities of the borrower, LBL, with emphasis
on investment analysis, management information systems, and supervision.
4.15   Energy-Audit Technical Assistance.  During project preparation, foreign
consultants were retained to execute energy audits related to proposed
subprojects. They worked with a local technical enterprise, with the aim of
progressively transferring the energy audit capability to the staff of these
enterprises. In Slovenia, where there is a long industrial tradition, six
technical institutes/enterprises, headed by SMELT and IBE, two leading local
consultant engineering groups, have participated. This has resulted in high-
quality energy audits and a rapid initiation of the technical transfer process
(Annex 3). As a result, SMELT is now capable of independently executing all
but the most complex energy audits.

- 43 -
4.16   To consolidate these newly acquired capabilities and to provide
training to enhance them, the borrowing bank and the technical
enterprises/-institutes have requested financing under the loans for
specialized training, some equipment and access to foreign consultants for
audits of complex subprojects. Details of the program, whose foreign exchange
costs are estimated to amount to $0.3 million, are contained in Annex 5.
4.17   Technical Assistance to LBL.  The foreign exchange cost of computer
equipment of $0.3 million is included in the project to upgrade LBL's
capability in MIS, supervision and investment analysis (para 3.49).
C. Allocation of Loan Proceeds
4.18   The proposed loan would be for US$90.0 million and will be used for
financing subproject investments, with US$0.6 million to be used for financing
the technical assistance program (paras 4.15 and 4.16). ILL, assisted by its
basic banks, will onlend the loan proceeds to qualifying enterprises in both
Slovenia and the rest of Yugoslavia. In addition to energy conservation and
substitution, the loan will support suitable investments in the areas of
production of energy saving equipment and materials and local energy resource
development. There have been strong indications of interest in energy
conservation and substitution investments by enterprises in Croatia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. A separate allocation of US$10 million would
be reserved, for up to 18 months following effectiveness, exclusively for
financing suitable investments under the project elsewhere in RAPs other than
Slovenia. Thereafter, any uncommitted portion of this amount would be
available for financing suitable investments also in Slovenia. This
allocation will ensure adequate access to project funds by entergrises outside
Slovenia, thus promoting the important demonstration effect throughout
Yugoslavia.

- 44 -
4.19     The proposed loan is estimated to comprise about 10 percent, on a
disbursement basis, of LBL's long-term industrial lending program and
30 percent of LBL's foreign currency requirements for the industrial lending
program in the two year period from mid-1987 to mid-1989. The final date for
submission of subprojects to the Bank for financing under the loan will be
Dec. 31, 1989; the closing date will be Dec. 31, 1992. The borrowing bank
(LBL) will ensure availability of all the local funds needed for execution of
the project, including the technical assistance program.
D. Main Features of the LoFun
4.20     Subloan Foreign Exchange and Interest Risk.  The foreign exchange and
interest risk on all subloans financed with Bank funds will be borne entirely
by the subborrowers. Also, for subloans financed with Bank funds, LBL will
charge subborrowers a variable interest rate, equal to the Bank's variable
rate plus the onlending Dinar commission (para 3.55) at a level sufficient to
permit the subloans to contribute pro-rata to the borrowers' expenses,
including reserves and loss write-offs. Beginning 1987, each February,
interest rates charged on local currency loans made from LBL's own resources
for energy related investments (55Z in 1986) would be adjusted. This
adjustment would ensure a minimum reduction in negativity each year of
3 percent in real terms from the 1986 level of minus 18X, and will include an
onlending spread sufficient to cover, on a pro-rata basis, LBL's costs,
including reserves and loss write offs. The adjustments will be made until a
positive real rate is achieved. Thereafter, adjustments will be made to
maintain a posit:ve rate. The level of negativity of the interest rate for
any year would be measured by the rate of inflation as given by the Yugoslav
Producer Price Index for that year. This was agreed during negotiations.
4.21     Subloan Size and Distribution.  Subloans will be limited to a maximum
of US$6.0 million per subproject and per enterprise (generally a BOAL). Not
less than 50 percent of the total number of subloans would be for amounts not
to exceed US$3.0 million. These limits, agreed during negotiations, will have
the benefit of providing for the wide range of subprojects already identified,
while ensuring that the loan will not be monopolized by a small number of
projects. Within these limits, the smaller subprojects and enterprises will
be fully represented, thus providing for both their needs and furthering the
demonstration effect of the project.
4.22     Subloan and Loan Maturities.  Since the energy conservation and
substitution subprojects and reduction in unit energy consumption subprojects
are incremental and are expected to have rapid payback periods, the maximum
subloan repayment period will be ten years, including a maximum grace period
of two years. Subject to these limits, the actual subloan repayment periods
for individual subprojects will be set by the borrowing bank on the basis of
projected cash-flow data and the estimated payback period for the subproject.
4.23     Energy audit loans are expected to be quite small (generally not
exceeding US$10,000). These will have a maximum repayment period of three
years, including not more than one year's grace.
1527 L



- 45 -
4.24     For energy equipment and materials subprojects and energy-resource
development subprojects, the maximum subloan repayment period will be 15
years, including a maximum grace period of three years. Again, within these
limits, the actual repayment period of these subloans would be determined by
the borrower, as for energy conservation and substitution subloans.
4.25     Subloans to local technical enterprises and institutes for technical
assistance in energy audits will have a maximum repayment period of ten years,
including two years grace. The foreign exchange cost of the technical
assistance to LBL will be repayable, under a fixed amortization schedule, over
a period of 15 years, including three years grace.
4.26     The loan to the borrower will be made on the Bank's normal terms and
conditions as applicable to DFC loans, including the standard commitment
charge. Loan repayment will be in accordance with the normal Bank terms for
Yugoslavia (15 years including three years grace) under a composite
amortization schedule, except for the technical assistance component, which
will be repayable over 15 years including three years grace.
4.27     Subprojict Appraisal.  The borrower will prepare acceptable appraisal
reports for all subprojects. Appraisal reports of subprojects under $500,000
equivalent will contain a description of the subproject including goods and
services procured, details of procurement and: (i) technical, economic and
financial evaluations of the subprojects, including estimates of the economic
rate of return and the financial rate of return (ERR and FRP.) in constant
terms; (ii) an analysis of the investing enterprises' financial statements for
the past three years covering past performance and trends in production and
sales, financial efficiency and profitability; (iii) a review of the annual
energy intensity of the enterprise for the most recent three year period, and
projections for the coming five-year period; and (iv) a financing plan for the
investment, the estimated investment payback period and, based on this, the
subloan amortization schedule.
4.28      For subprojects with Bank financed subloans of US$500,000 or more,
appraisal reports should contain the following additional information:
five-year projections of the investing enterprises' financial statements
(including cash flow statements) in current terms, with analysis of financial
performance, and trends in these and also the ERR and the FRR of the entire
enterprise 1/ in constant terms. Appraising both the enterprise, as well as
the subproject, will safeguard against incremental investments in non-viable
enterprises. The standards to be met in these appraisal reports have been
discussed extensively with LBL by the Bank appraisal mission. LBL is fully
capable of meeting these standards.
1/ In these cases, an enterprise is considered to be the lowest level dis-
tinguishable independent commercial entity; generally, but not necessarily
a BOAL, in some instances it may be a segment of a BOAL. Availability to
the entity of independent markets (external to the enterprise) for all
inputs and outputs is the deciding criterion. The entity may be part of a
group of enterprises or be separate. Where there is interdependence of
entities, such as characterized by non market-determined transfer pricing,
all concerned entities may need to be aggregated for the IRR analysis of
th.- enterprise.

- 46 -
4.29     All subprojects concerned with energy conservation and substitution
and reduction in unit energy consumption will be required to have professional
energy audits, acceptable to the Bank (Annex 17), as the basis for their
appraisal (para 4.03). All appraisals of local energy-resource development
subprojects must demonstrate the necessity for such investment taking into
account the energy balance of the republic or autonomous province (Annex 1)
and also demonstrate that such investment provides the least-cost alternative
for substitution in comparison with all other available energy sources,
domestic or imported.
4.30     Subproject Acceptance Criteria:  The minimum acceptable ERR will be
12 percent, the currently estimated opportunity cost of capital to Yugoslavia.
The minimum acceptable FRR will be the Bank's variable lending rate at the
time of subloan approval plus the borrower's onlending commission, both to be
adjusted in accordance with by the Bank's current Manufacturing Unit Value
Index of International Inflation.
4.31     Free Limit.  The subproject appraisal process (for both energy
conservation and substitution and reduction in unit energy consumption
subprojects) has been standardized, as permitted by the fact that the
principal benefits (energy) are generally homogenous, competitively traded and
having extensive, independent market price forecasts available. In addition,
past experience has shown that LBL is fully capable of producing good quality
appraisals. It is therefore proposed that a free limit of US$2.0 million
would apply to energy conservation and substitution projects and also to
energy-saving and materials subprojects. In the latter case, investments may
need to be large to avail of scale economies. There will be no free limit for
local energy resource development subprojects, as it is necessary to closely
scrutinize these on an individual basis. Notwithstanding these free limits,
the borrower will be required to submit the first five energy conservation and
substitution subprojects, the first five energy audits, the first two
energy-saving equipment and material subprojects and the first two reduction
in unit energy consumption subprojects to the I nk for approval prior to
making any financing commitment of Bank funds. Under these conditions, it is
expected that about 25 percent of the subprojects financed-under the loan will
be over the free limit and reviewed in detail by the Bank.
4.32     Procurement.  The procurement procedures employed for goods and
services financed from Bank funds will be in accordance with the World Bank
Guidelines for Procurement. ICB procedures will normally be employed on all
contracts estimated to exceed US$2.0 million equivalent. Prior review of ICB
bid documents by the Bank will not be required on contracts whose estimated
value does not exceed US$3.0 million equivalent. If, under ICB, a Yugoslav
supplier is awarded a contract, the ex-factory cost of the goods will be
eligible for financing with Bank funds. Exceptions to, or modifications of,
ICB for special reasons (e.g. standardization of equipment) will require prior
approval by the borrower and the Bank and be based on adequate justification
for such action. This justification will be provided through LBL by the
subborrower. For goods estimated to cost less than US$2.0 million and more
than US$750,000 and which are to be financed from Bank funds, limited
international bidding, as set out in the World Bank Guidelines for
Procurement, may be used. Items or groups of items estimated to cost $750,000

or less may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of
price quotations obtained from at least three commercially independent
sources. It is estimated that 15 percent of the number and the 20 percent of
the value of the loan would be procured under ICB. The personal computers and
software to be financed under the technical assistance component would be
procured through international shopping, taking account of local servicing and
training facilities.
4.33     Disbursement.  Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed loan
would cover up to 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants'
services and training, and 100 percent of foreign expenditures and in the case
of ICB awarded to local suppliers, up to 100 percent local expenditures
(ex-factory) for materials and equipment. With the exception of contracts
valued at less than the equivalent of $50,000, all applications for withdrawal
will be fully documented. Given the estimated average size of contracts,
disbursements against contracts valued at less than $50,000 will be made on
the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Documentation to support
these applications will be retained by LBL, audited by auditors acceptable to
the Bank and made available for review by the Bank upon request. To
facilitate the borrower's access to the loan funds, and expedite
disbursements, LBL will establish a Special Account into which the Bank will
deposit $7 million, representing about four months expenditures. LBL will use
these funds to finance the Bank's share of eligible expenditures. Retroactive
financing of goods and services for subprojects up to a total of $3.0 million
and of equipment ($125,000) and services for technical assistance ($75,000) up
to a total amount of US$200,000 procured, in accordance with Bank Guidelines,
on or after November 15, 1985, will be eligible for financing under the loan.
The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 18. This is based on
the actual disbursement profile of IDF projects in Yugoslavia for FY76-85.
Although the pipeline is strong, the lack of familiarity of the borrowers and
enterprises in designing and appraising these types of subprojects may result
in a somewhat slower rate of disbursement than in the historical profile.
4.34     Reporting.  LBL will submit to the Bank, semi-annual and annual
reports on the status and progress of the project. The reports will include,
inter alia, a summary of lending operations (approvals, commitments and
disbursements), resource position, portfolio information, arrears data, data
to permit review of LBL's spread and commission, progress on the utilization
of the loan, execution of energy audits, a summary of procurement activities
and copies of their annual reports and audits. The detailed content and format
of these were agreed upon during negotiations. -
4.35     Environment:  In general, the project can be expected to improve the
environment through the provision of more efficient energy transformation and
utilization equipment. In the case of energy substitution projects, where
coal and lignite are substituting for other energy sources, LBL will obtain an
undertaking from the investors that appropriate anti-pollution equipment would
be installed in accordance with Yugoslav and Slovene environmental laws and
regulations and in keeping with Bank environmental guidelines. Compliance
with these undertakings would be closely monitored by Bank and LBL staff.

4.36     Project Benefits.  The project is timely, in view of the current
difficulties in the economy and the deficit balance of payments situation, due
in substantial part to energy imports (paras. 2.04-2.08), the project is
timely. It will make a direct contribution to reducing energy imports,
principally in Slovenia, as well as improving the competitiveness of
enterprises in export markets. This is particularly important in Slovenia,
which is responsible for a sizeable (21 percent) share of Yugoslav export
earnings. As important as its direct contribution is the project
demonstration effect, which can be expected to be strong, as Yugoslav firms
endeavor to retain viability in a time of rapidly increasing domestic energy
prices and recessionary domestic markets. Successful implementation can be
expected to generate additional demand for similar projects with (or without)
the use of Bank funds in Slovenia or elsewhere. The technical assistance
component of the project will have the effect of transferring an important new
technique, energy auditing, to Yugoslavia. While the project is likely to
have its major impact in one republic (Slovenia), the energy-auditing
technique will be available to all investors in Yugoslavia, as the technical
enterprises acquiring this technique are commercial consultant engineering
enterprises well known in Yugoslavia. By having the technical competence of
developing eaergy cost saving projects, as well as a comercial incentive to
develop them, the energy-auditing enterprises should in time develop into
conduits for further subproject promotion. At the same time, technical
assistance to LBL will strengthen its appraisal and supervision capacity.
Project Risks:
4.37     Lack of availability of comple-entary local funds is not a major risk
to this project, given the liquidity of LBL in respect of domestic funds.
There is some risk regarding LBL's financial condition. This risk is
acceptable in view of the traditional support given LBL by its founders.
Close monitoring by the Bank will be an integral part of project
implementation.
4.38     The decline in the international price of crude oil to $12 per barrel
at the end of 1986 from the high level of $27 per barrel attaining at the time
of appraisal inevitably reduces the viability of some subprojects. But, as
noted earlier (para 2.23), the number of these so affected (as seen from the
subprojects already having an energy-audit-Annex 4, Table 2 and 3) is not so
large as to call the project's viability into question. With some adjustment
in design and content of the affected subprojects the impact is much reduced,
and, when associated (but non-energy specific) benefits are included, the
number of non-viable subprojects declines to just 5 percent of the total
energy audited to date. Related non-energy benefits in many cases may be
substantial, up to 45 percent of total benefits (para 4.03). This will reduce
the energy price decline risk. Also, given the current very low level of
energy prices internationally, the downside risk for these prices must be
considered as small.

CHAPTER V
AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations, agreements and understandings were obtained on
the following points:
A. Subproject Apprais
(1)    subproiect appraisal reports:
a. The borrower will provide the Bank with acceptable appraisal
reports for all subproiects, comprising a description of the
subproject and satisfactory technzical, economic and firnacial
evaluations (paras 4.27 and 4.28);
b. all energy conservation and substitution subproject appraisals
will be based on an acceptable energy-audits and feasibility
studies (para 4.29);
c. all appraisals of local energy-resource development subproiects
will demonstrate (i) their priority in terms of republican energy
balance, and (ii) that the investment provides the least-cost
alternative (para 4.29).
(2)    non-energy benefits credited to subprojects may not exceed 45 percent
of the present value of the total benefit stream of any energy
conservation and substitution subproject financed under this loan
(para 4.03);
(3)    reduction in energy consumption per unit of output, as estimated in
appraisal of reduction in unit energy consumption subprojects, may
not be less than 10 percent (para 4.07); and
(4)   minimum subproiect IRR levels will be: (i) ERR - 12 percent; and
(ii) FRR - the Bank's variable lending interest rate at the time of
subloan approval plus the borrower's onlending commission, both
adjusted in accordance with the Bank's Manufacturing Unit Value Index
of International Inflation (para 4.30).
B. Sublmn Features
(1)    subloan size will be limited to maximum Bank financing of US$6.0
million per subproject and per enterprise; at least 50 percent of the
total number of Bank financed subloans will be for amounts of US$3.0
million or less (para 4.21);
(2)   maturities for loans for (i) energy conservation and substitution
subprojects, reduction in unit energy consumption subprojects and to
technical enterprises and institutes for energy-audit technical
assistance will have a maximum repayment period of ten years,
16 2? L



- so -
including two years maximum grace period; (ii) energy audit loans
will have a maximum repayment period of three years, including a
maximum grace period of one year; and (iii) all other subloans will
have maximum repayment periods of 15 years, including three years
maximum grace period. Within these limits, actual repayment terms
for all individual subloans will be set by the borrower, based on
project cash flow data and estimated payback periods for the
subprojects, with the aim of attaining the most rapid repayment
schedules feasible (paras 4.22 - 4.25);
(3)    the onlending interest rate on (i) Bank funds will be at a variable
rate, equal to the Bank's variable rate, plus an onlending commission
in dinars at a level sufficient to permit the subloans to contribute
pro rata to all the borrower's expenses, including reserves and loss
write-offs, and on (ii) local funds for all energy re'ated
investments will be the rate established annually throu-h adjusting
the rate on energy related loans in the previous year to a level
which is 3 percent less negative in real terms. When this rate
becomes positive, all future annual adjustments would ensure that it
remained positive. The Yugoslav Producer Price Index will be used as
the measure of inflation for the purposes of these adjustments (para
4.20);
(4)    the foreign exchznge and interest risk on all subloans financed with
Bank funds would be borne by the subborrower (para 4.20);
(5)    procurement will be in accordanice with current World Bank
Guidelines. Contracts exceeding US$2.0 million will be procured
through ICB procedures; contracts between $2.0 million and $750,000
will be procured through limited international bidding; while,
contracts for less than $750,000 may be procured on the basis of
comparison of price quotations from three commercially independent
sources (paras 4.32 and 4.28); and
(6)    disbursement for contracts of $50,000 or more will be made against
standard documentation and for less than this against statements of
expenditure. Goods and services for subprojects up to an aggregate
value of $3.0 million and equipment and services for technical
assistance up to a maximum of US$200,000, which are procured in
accordance with Bank Guidelines, on or after November 15, 1985, will
be eligible for reimbursement (para 4.33).
C. The Borrower (LBL)
(1)    the borrower would reserve US$10 million of the loan amount, for up
to 18 months following loan effectiveness, for financing acceptable
subloans under the project in republics and provinces other than
Slovenia (para. 4.18).
(2)    the borrower will undertake to provide all necessary local funds
needed for execution of the project (para 4.19);
1627 L

(3)    the borrower's Joint Liability and Reserve Furds will each be brought
up to 5 percent of invested resources by 1990, under programs and
schedules acceptable to the Bank (para 3.54);
(4)    the borrower would establish annuall1 both its interest spread on
domestic operations and its dinar commission on all foreign exchange
loans at a minimum level necessary to provide incomz2 to meet all of
the borrower's expenses including loss wr,te-offs taxes and increases
in the JLF and RF as agreed, and to write-off defecred and future
foreign exchange losses (para 3.55);
(5)    the borrower would submit by September 30 of each year data and
calculations showing levels of spread and commission,.acceptable to
the Bank, to apply to the subsequent year's lendintg operations
(para 3.55);
(6)    the borrower would nct amend, without the agreement oi the Bank, the
LBL FYP of November 6, 1986 as relates to financial targets for build
up of JLF and RF, write-off of deferred foreign exchange losses,
development of spread and commission levels adequate 'o meet these
and all other expenses and the policy of eliminatiorn of future
foreign exchange losses in the year incurred, (para 3.61);
(7)    the borrower would require installation of appropriate anti-pollution
equiLment in all energy substitution erojects involving coal or
ligrite in accordance with Yugoslav and Slovene environmental laws
and regulations and World Bank environmental guidelines (para 4.35).
(8)    the borrower would prepare its three year opere.tional and financial
projections in current terms starting in 1987, and furnish these to
the Bank by March 31 of each year (para 3.47);
(9)   semi-annual and annual reports on the status and progress of the
project will be submitted by the borrower to the Bank (para 4.34);
(10)    the borrower would strengthen its appraisal capacity by employing an
additional economists and engineers in its Investment Promotion
Sector (IPS) by December 31, 1987 (para 3.44);
(11)    the borrower would establish a separate supervision department in its
Resource Management Sector (RMS) oy March 31, 1987 and recruit
additional engineers and economists to staff it by September 30,
1987. (para 3.45 and Annex 8);
(12)    the borrower would staff its Internal Audit Department as necessary
with additional professional internal audit6rs by June 30, 1987
(para 3.46);
(13)    the borrower would increase total professional staff in the PLanning
and Analysis Department by recruiting additional professionals
(economists, financial analysts and statisticians) by June 30, 1987
(para 3.47);
5.02    The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan totalling US$90
million on the terms and conditions outlined above.

International Crude Oil Price Variations and Subproiect Viability
1.       Analysis of subproject costs and benefits data from available
consultant energy audits (38 - Slovenia 17, Macedonia 21) shows the following:
Table 1. IRR WITH FULL BENEFITS
TOTAL             SLOVENIA            MACEDONIA
VIABILITY          Subprojects   S    Subprojects   S    Subprojects    S
IRR 122 or over        38      100         17      100        21        100
Although subproject investment costs are both economic and financial (the
difference between the two being negligible), the associated benefits are
based on actual energy prices paid by enterprises thus; these IRRs are FRIa.
In a static sense all subprojects were financially viable at the time of audit.
2.       These energy prices paid by audited enterprises are compared with
current international equivalents (adjusted to the factory gate) iv the
Attachment (Tables 1, 2, and 3). To allow for current price instability,
prices of oil-related fuels are based on a range of crude oil prices (US$20,
15, and 10/barrel). At US$lObbl for crude oil internationally, the energy
audit prices of oil based energy would need to decline by 50 to 802 to equal
world prices; while, at-US$20tbbl for crude oil the decline is from 10 to
60. The actual prices paid for solid based fuels and electricity at the time
of audit, with the exception of coke, are seen to be well above current
international levels.
3.       To test for these price adjustments in an aggregate fashion, each of
subproject benefit streams was reduced by 502. This is a reasonable
expectation of the upper bound in the downward adjustment of benefit streams,
particularly in view of the positive adjustment required in electricity prices
and the volatility of the international crude oil market. The overall effect
of this adjustment on subproject viability is:

4.       Following the adjustment these are now ERRs.  Despite the severity of
the adjustment, half of the subprojects remain viable: while another 181
(8-11Z IRR) can be made viable. with relatively m4nor modifications in design
and content: Slovenia is more affected by the adjustment; but, individual
reviews of each of the eight subprojects with IRRs below 81 shows that three
are acceptable upon deletion of the poorer components, while the fourth
involves 1001 electricity conservation and would not in actual fact be subject
to the 50S reduction, as the oil price decline has not affected the estimate
of the economic price (LRMC) of electricity in Yugoslavia. In Macedonia, none
of the four subprojects with IRRs below 8S appear to be even potentially
viable. The net result is that, even with a 501 benefit reduction, not less
than 50S and perhaps as much as 801 of the pipeline is economically viable.
This is surprisingly high, suggesting that energy use efficiency is very low
in Yugoslavia even in the more developed regions i.e. Slovenia. Such as
explanation is credible when energy pricing practices in Yugoslavia are
recalled.
5.       In addition to energy benefits, up to 45Z of the total subproject
benefits may come from non-energy sources. This was combined with an even
greater decrease in energy benefits. Simulation of this gives the following
results:

6.       Again these are ERRs.  Now economic viability has increased to
between 80 and 951 of the pipeline. Although the approach taken is somewhat
mechanical and the data base crude, it is quite clear that the project remains
viable and relevant. (rndividuals subproject IRRs and Payback periods are
given in the Attachment Tables 4 and 5).

YUGOSLAVIA
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND SUBSTITUTION PROJECT
Technical Assistance in Energy Auditing
Energy audits are a critical requirement for the development of
energy conservation or conversion projects and it is thus important to quickly
build up a domestic capability in this nev field of application of otherwise
basic engineering principles. Even in the industrially more advanced
countries, the approach to and implementation of energy auditing is not a
widely diffused knowledge, and is limited to a small number of companies.
It was agreed at the outset that energy auditing would be undertaken
initially by a foreign specialist, with the support of Yugoslav engineers from
the banks and from engineering companies which expressed an interest in
becoming specialist in this field. The Yugoslav engineers would receive
training while observing and assisting the foreign technical personnel. In
all cases, of course, full cooperation of the enterprise technical staff was
required, and was freely given. Terms of Reference for the initial energy
audits by foreign consultants were prepared by Bank staff.
In Slovenia, where there is a long industrial tradition, several
institutions requested to be including in the energy audits. They included
Institut Jozef Stefan, Institut Milan Vidmar, the Energy Unit of the Slovenian
Productivity Institute, the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of the University
in Ljubljana, IBE-Elektroprojekt, and SMELT. A more detailed description of
these organizations is given in Annex 3.
SMELT, a large international engineering and contracting firm,
coordinated the efforts of all the other organizations except IBE; the latter
remained independent. SMELT signed the contract with the foreign consultant,
Fichtne- of Germany, and also contracted with the individual companies
concerned. This coordinated effort, involving as many as seven Yugoslav
engineers sharing work experiences with one German expert, has proved very
successful. On completion of the first eight Fichtner audits, the consortium
led by SMELT performed a further 8 audits which were reviewed by Fichtner; the
quality of these reports was good. Work executed by the Institutes, and iu
almost all cases supported by the staff of the mobile thermal measuring unit
of the university, was reviewed and the findings edited and translated by
SMELT engineers.
IBE pursued an independent line, and performed two energy audits with
the assistance of a Swiss consulting engineering company, Motor-Columbus
(MC). Final reports are under preparation.
The arrangements to effect transfer of technological capabilities and
to ensure that competent energy audits are performed by local companies, are

considered satisfactory. This is particularly so in Slovenia, where such
technology transfer E s already partly been achieved in the preparation of
this project. To further strengthen the domestic effort to achieve energy
auditing capability, LBL and the organizations have requested foreign exchange
funds for training purposes, and for equipment.
In Slovenia, SMELT has proposed to send three staff abroad for a
3 months training period each, and intends to engage foreign consultants to
assist with appraisals for a total of three man-months. Institut Jozef Stefan
intends to purchase measuring and automatic recording equipment for energy
audits, as does the Institute Milan Vidmar, the Energy Unit of the
Productivity InsLitute, and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Ljubljana
University. In addition, they as well as IBE and LBL are also considering
training abroad for their technical staff, while IBE wants to secure funds to
have ready access to foreign consultants to assist in difficult energy
audits. The amount requested is approximately US$0.25 million in Slovenia, as
suo.arized in Table 1.

LJUBLJANSKA BANKA WUUBLJANA
Outline of the Proposed Supervision System
1.       Supervision activity involves assistance to enterprises during
implementation and operation of LBL financed investment subprojects. It would
begin after the approval of a subproject by LBL's Board and end after the
subloan for that project has been fully repaid.
2.       To strengtheu its follow-up activities, LBL nas established a
supervision department reporting to the vice president of the crediting
sector. The department initially has seven professionals, including head of
the department.
Objectives
3.       The objectives of the department are two fold (i) to develop timely
information and recommendations during implementation and operation of
subprojects in LBL's portfolio to overcome problems as taey develop and
(ii) to provide information (feedback) to allow better project preparation and
appraisal in future.
Scope of Follow-up Activities
The scope of supervision is determined by the general objectives
described para 3 above. The supervision activities are a means for enhancing
the partnership between subborrowers and LBL to achieve subproject goals. The
activities should cover not only superviLsion of physical works but also all
other areas which are necessary for success of a subproject, including
organi:ation, angement, technical aspects, finance and marketing.  The
approach is not to blame those responsible for failures but to anticipate
problems and to seek prompt measures to resolve them.
Functions and Responsibilities
-5.      The functions and responsibilities of the supervision department are:
i)  to periodically review subprojects in LBL's portfolio,
ii) to ensure that subprojects are being implemented in-accordance with
descriptions in their appraisal reports, including compliance with
subloan conditions and LBL's procurement procedures,
iii) to report status of subprojects to LBn mainagement, identify key
problems, make recoumendations and to obtain managemnt decisions,
iv)  to convey to subborrowers, decisions of the LB3 management.

Procedures
6.       Organization of Information.  The supervision department would
prepare a list of all subprojects to be supervised, including important
information. The list would be updated every three months. Each subproject
would be designated by a serial number and all correspondence with respect to
a subproject would be kept in a separate subproject file in a chronological
order. The supervision department would 1ceep the subproject files up-to-date.
7.       Supervision Planning. The key to supervision planning is the
'Category/Rating' system. All subprojects would be classified in four
categories:
Large projects under construction   -  A
Small projects under construction   -   B
Large projects in operatio-   C
Small projects in operation         -  D
All subprojects would also be classified by two ratings:
Minor problems     - 1
Major problems     = 2
Thus, a subproject category/rating of AI2 would denote that it is a
large project under construction and has major problems.
8.       The frequency of supervision would depend upon the category/rating of
subprojec tS.

9.       The supervision department would plan its activities by preparing
work problems every six months. The planning statement would identify
subprojects to be visited, dates on which.visits are to be made and persons to
visit. Normally, a team consisting of two supervision officers would visit
subprojects: one of the officers would be designated as the leader. However,
supervision could vary in intensity, composition of supervision teams, and
frequency depending upon the needs of individuals subprojects. The follow-up
planning statement would be prepared by the director of the supervision
department prior to the beginning of the six monthly planning period and
submitted to the vice president, crediting for approval. The existing
manpower in the supervision department should permit supervision of between
132 and 198 subprojects every six months (3 teams x 22 weeks/half year x 2 or
3 projects per visit). The supervision teams would trevel 2/3 days per week
and spend the remaining time in the head office writing reports.
10.      Field Visits.  During field visits, the supervision teams would
collect data summarizing the status of subprojects. During cons- truction
stage, particular attention would be paid to planned versus actual
implementation schedules for equipment procurement and physical works, project
costs, recruitment of technical assistance and local staff, availability of
utilities and project finances. During operations, focus would be on
production, marketing, and profitability.
11.      LBL would initially prepare the information needed for reporting.
But, it would aim to progressively transfer this task to subborrowers as much
as feasible, with the supervision teams checking the accuracy of information
provided.
12.      During field visits, the supervision teams would also review with
subborrowers major problems and possible solutions.
13.      Reporting and Management Review.  Supervision teams would prepare
summary reports for LBL's management within three days after the completion of
field visits. The reports would identify key problems facing subprojects,
their current status and recomuendations.  The reports would be reviewed by
the supervision department director, vice president crediting and LBL's top
management, as appropriate.
14.      All decisions would be promptly communicated to subborrowers and
progress in the implementation of these decisions would be followed up during
subsequent field visits.
15.      Procurement and Disbursement.  The ultimate responsibility for
procurement would rest with subborrovers. Suppliers and contractors are
normally identified at the appraisal stage. But, supervision department would
assist subborrowers in procurement.
16.      Supervision department would review and certify for disbursement by
LBL, withdrawal applications submitted by subborrowers, to ensure that goods
and services are in accordance with subloan agreements.

ENERGY COL!SERVATIOX AND SUBSTITUTION PROJECT
Yugoslavia - Energy Pricing
1.       Under the LTPES and SAL I, energy prices have been substantially
restructured in Yugoslavia. To bring about this restructuring, the system of
price setting itself had to be changed. Such change is quite common in
Yugoslavia. Since the adoption of the constitution in 1946, Yugoslavia has
had nine major pricing laws. These have ranged from: accountiag
prices (1946); to cost-plus pricing (1949); to a dual price system - some
administered and some quasi free =rket prices (1951); to domestic cost-plus
and domestic market forces in association with self-management (1952); back to
administered pricing (1968); to further decentralized part-national,
part-regional pricing (1980), with emphasis on equity rather than efficiency;
and now to "socially-controlled" pricing (January 1985). At no time have
prices been unregulated, either from direct intervention, or from indirect
intervention via internal and exLernal trade policies, industrial structure
and a variety of taxes and subsidies more common in market economies.
Combined with the strictly domestic focus and generally inflexible nature of
all the various price regimes, caused the development of stresses and strains
necessitating periodic reforms.
2.       Through January 1985, jurisdiction over price determination was
divided betweeu the Federal and RAP governments; the former being responsible
for goods and services classified as essential. In energy, the essential
goods and services, petroleum products, coking coal and natural gas, were all
imported. At the RAP level prices were determined for hard and brown coal,
lignite, electricity and domestically produced natural gas. This
determination was carried out within the local communities of interest,
embracing producers and major consumers under the general sanction of the RAP
Committee for Prices.
3.       Criteria for price determination contained in the 1980 law included
both social and economic considerations, such as market clearance, efficiency,
productivity, distribution, development and inflation control. These gave
rise to an over-determined price system with very conflicting results. For
instance, simultaneously prices could be frozen in favor of equity and
inflation control, or raised in the interests of efficiency and market
clearance. The 1980 price law was suspended for two consecutive six month
periods through January 1983, in favor of Federally established price ceilings
aimed at controlling inflation. Subsequently, Federal and RAP authorities
progressively freed 55Z of industrial output from all price controls and
agreed upon an overall long-range price policy under the LTPES/SAL.
4.       For energy products this long-range policy took the shape of an
agreement to, at a minimum, retain the existing price structure, for domestic

levels (crude oil and petroleum products), except for domestically produced
natural gas whose price is to be increased to reach import parity by January
1987. The policy agreed upon for non-traded energy products, i.e., lignite,
coal and electricity is to allow their prices to achieve parity with their
long-run marginal costs (LRMCs) over a four to five year period. Under SAL,
studies are to be conducted to estimate actual Yugoslav LMRCs for these
non-traded products. A study on lignite and coal has now been completed and
is uMder review, while the study for electricity, which required the lignite
and coal study as input, is expected to be completed by July 1986.
5.       The ninth major price law 1/, which took effect on Jan_ary 1, 1985,
stresses the role of individual enterprises in setting their own prices based
on market conditions and border prices, while providing for input from
consumers on actual price determination. The law forbids: (i) collusive
activities by producers of the same product; and (ii) price discrimination by
anyone. It establishes price agencies to monitor and advise on price
developments. The Federal and RAP Committees on Pricing, who actually
finalized prices under the previous law, will now become Price Agencies. As
such, they will no longer have executive or administrative authority, but
instead will be responsible for dissaminating price-related information as
input to individual enterprise price setting. The role of the Co-mmunities of
Interest under the law is not clear; their past activities may now clash with
the restrictions on collusion and discrimination. This has implications for
coal and thus electricity pricing. The success of this pricing system will
depend upon the level of independence afforded the enterprises and the amount
of competition permitted in the economy. One benefit is already being felt;
the provision of liquidity needed for enterprise foreign-exchan"e debt
repayment in a time of high inflation and rapid devaluation. As usual, the
law also provides for continuous six-month suspensions in favor of direct
price controls by the Federal Authorities.
6.       Energy is one of the few groups of prices which are singledlout for
unique treatment under the new law. 2/ Energy is to be priced by its domestic
producers and importers:
"in accordance with the common elements for the formation of these
prices, as such elements are set forth in the plans and other
enactments of the Federations used for the formulation o, economic
policy and in accordance with the levels of World prices and
long-term economic motivation of producers and consumers for
continuous and stable production -      -   of such products." 3/

Also, energy price setting must take account of both overall and industrial
commodity price movements, as well as shifts in relative energy prices. Thus,
energy pLices appear to remain under the general guidance of the Federal
Government.
7.       The "comon elements", which are not yet promulgated are to be set
out initially in the next (1986-90) Five Year Plan, to be finalized in late
1985. However, Federal Authorities strongly indicated that these will be
pragmatic efficiency-type considerations, together with some procedural
guidelines, rather than any elements which might render this price reform
over-determined and ineffective.
8.       An exception occurs, in each category.  Among the traded products
group, the hard coal price fell relative to its economic value. The reason is
not know, but, with about 95% of Yugoslav hard coal consumption imported this
direction of relative prive movement is surprising. However, hard coal is
only IOZ of gross annual supply of energy and thus not a major source of
misallocation. By contrast, among the non-traded products the relative
domestic electricity price increased from 43% to 74Z of its economic value.
Electricity prices are far easier to observe and monitor than those of coal.
The non-produccive sectors (mainly households) consume nearly 40X of all
el-ectricity and these are readily responsive to demand management measures.
Electricity, which amounts for 20% of all energy consumption in Yugoslavia and
consumes one-third of the annual primary energy supply, is a prime demand
management target.
9.       In Slovenia, energy prices are well above the economic cost, except
for lignite. But, even here the price level is substantially greater than the
national average, both in absolute terms and relative to its economic price.
This can be expected to greatly encourage conservative activities in Slovenia
under the project. For example, two insulation material investments are under
appraisal.
10.      In Macedonia, prices are also well above economic costs of the energy
products, with the exception of electricity which is 5% below the national
average. Although comparative data was not available it was stated by
enterprises that electricity prices have been substantially increased, even in
real terms in the past two years in line with general increases in the
republic's energy prices.

ENERGY CONSERVATION AND SUBSTITUTION PROJECT
Yugoslavia - Energy Audit Acceptability Criteria
To be acceptable for Einancing the energy audit should be executed by
persons having demonstrated technical ability and experience in energy
auditing relevant to the particular subproject and also have some familiarity
with conditions in Yugoslav industry, either directly or through association
with a Yugoslav enterprise. Energy audits should result in detailed reports
with energy flow diagrams and heat balances, detailing major operations
involving energy in the plants and recommendations how energy consumption
could be reduced and whether economically feasible possibilities exist to
convert oil, or oil-based gas burning equipment, to other lower cost sources
of energy, either imported or domestic, in particular the abundantly available
lignite/brown coal.
These'detailed reports should include:
(a)    A description of energy saving measures which could be implemented
immediately, requiring little or no expenditures (e.g. adjustment of
controls and burner equipment, organizational measures, imrpoved
house keeping etc.).
(b)    Details of energy saving measures which involve only small or
moderate expenditures (e.g. better insulation, installation of
additional control equipment, modification to burners, etc.).
(c)    Details, schematic diagrams, and approximate costs and benefits of
major process or equipment modifications, energy recycling schemes,
etc.
(d)    Details and cost/benefit analysis for energy conversion
(substitution) schemes, either as part of (c) above, or as an
additional proposition. Special emphasis should be given to
minimizing imported energy sources (crude oil and its derivatives,
imported natural gas, and high grade coal), and the possibility to'
switch to locally available energy sources (lignite, and to a lesser
extent electric energy) where economically viable.
(e)    An estimate of energy savings in units/year (and in Dinars and USg)
under prevailizqg output conditions, and under plant design capacity
operations.
An important function of the audit will be to enhance the knowledge and
undorstanding of the engineers and other technical personnel of the plant
being audited concerning energy consumption, conservation, and substitution.
The auditors are, therefore expected to work freely with the technical staff
of the plant under audit and inforul them of the proper methodology and
practices associated with energy conservation and substitution.
