made as follows:
    (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or

     (b)   (i) For replenishment of the Special

          (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such
               request, the Borrower shall furnish to
               the Bank the documents and  other
               evidence  required  pursuant to

               shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
               withdraw from the Loan Account and
               deposit into the Special Account such

payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account;
     (a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have
determined that all further withdrawals should be made
by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of
this Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories less the amount of
any outstanding special  commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized
in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was
made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit  into  the Special Account
(or,  if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the
portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by
the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
    (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to
paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be
credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal
or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant
provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
