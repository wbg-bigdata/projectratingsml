MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
NATIONAL BANK OF POLAND
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Poland for US$260 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity including five-years
of grace and help to finance expansion of industrial exports to convertible
currency markets.
2.          Background.  Industry is the leading sector of the Polish economy
and contributes 23% of employment, 44% of GNP and 74% of exports. Following a
sharp decline of output between 1978 and 1982, recovery has been slow and
continues to be constrained by (i) the industrial policy framework within which
enterprises operate, including price distortions and central administration
interference; (ii) technical constraints, in particular outdated technology and
lack of access to imported equipment and intermediate inputs due to a chronic
shortage of foreign exchange; and (iii) weak enterprise management, specifically
in areas of planning, financing and marketing. Results of the reform process
which began in 1982 have been disappointing, at least in part because of a lack
of commitment on the part of elements of the bureaucracy and a lack of confidence
in the fundamental commitment of the Government to the reform process.
3.           As noted in the latest Country Brief, the environment for effecting
real reform has recently greatly improved tnd the new Government has initiated
measures aimed at moving towards a market-oriented economy with a view to
improving the efficiency and productivity of the economy, promoting growth, and
im,proving socioeconomic conditions.   In this context,  deposit and lending
interest rates have been liberalized. On January 1, 1990, the zloty was devalued
and exchange rates unified, and administrative price controls were removed on
most goods and services. Major progress on tax reform is expected in the first
quarter of 1990.  These measures are part of a comprehensive macroeconomic/
stabilization program that has recently been agreed with the IMF. In the short
term, high priority is being accorded to sharply reducing the rate of inflation,
mitigating the country's severe external debt problem and beginning the process
of restoring the country's creditworthiness. In the longer term, priorities in
the industrial sector will focus on restructuring, including the development of
a strong private sector both through fostering new private sector initiatives
and through privatization of existing public-sector enterprises.
4.          Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's overall
strategy and long-term objective in Poland is to support the Government's reform
program and related efforts to improve the efficiency and productivity of the
economy. In the short term, Bank involvement also focusses on helping to improve
the balance of payments and the country's creditworthiness. The major thrust
of the investment financing component of the proposed project is to assist this
short-term objective by effecting a quick increase in the level of production
and of exports to convertible currency markets. The longer-term objective is
being addressed through the technical assistance component of the project which
on the one hand will help the Government develop and initiate the necessary
strategies for restructuring the industrial sector with a larger role foreseen
for the private sector, and on the other hand to improve the capacities of
various institutions to implement this strategy effectively.



* 2 -
S.          Support to the development of the financial sector is also an
integral part of the Bank's overall strategy for assistance to Poland.  Such
support waa initiated as part of the preparation of tho proposed Project and the
ongoing policy dialogue. The Project, through the participation of a numbor of
banks and the technical assistance to be provided to them and to the banking
supervisory agency, the National Bank of Poland (NBP), continues this support
by strengthening the commercial banking system and competition therein. In line
with the high priority the Government attaches to the further development of the
financial sector as a part of its current reform effort, it has now requested
urgent, expanded Bank and 1MF assistance in this area. A joint review was begun
in December, 1989 to deepen the understanding of the issues facing the sector
and recommend needed reforms. The insights gained will provide timely input into
a proposed policy-based loan to be followed by support for the development and
modernization of banks and other financial institutions.  These efforts will
facilitate effective financial intermediation including for future Bank
operations.
6.          Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are
to contribute to: (i) improving the convertible currency trade balance of Poland
by increasing the volume, quality and value-added of industrial exports to
convertible currency markets; (ii) improving the project financing and other
capabilities of selected banks; (iii) identifying restructuring needs and
preparing restructuring programs in industry; and (iv) supporting development
of the private sector. These objectives are in line with the country's efforts
to enhance rapidly its creditworthiness by improving its balance of payments,
and to launch effective industrial restructuring programs that fit in with the
ongoing implementation of reforms and changes towards a market economy.
7.          Project Descrigtion.   NBP will be the borrower of World Bank
resources and will coordinate overall project activities for the two components:
financing of exNort oriented investments and technical assistance. NBP will
refinance loans (US$ 245 million) made by selected participating banks to
enterprises undertaking high priority and high return investments to expand
exports to convertible currency markets. Seven subprojects in the chemicals,
engineering and wood-based industrial subsectors have already been appraised.
Loan proceeds would finance direct foreign exchange costs of needed physical
improvements to production facilities, including machinery, equipment and spare
parts, permanent working capital, technology transfer and technical assistance
and training at the enterprise level.
8.          Market and marketing prospects for all products appear good.  Most
of the increased output which will be obtained is in products which Poland is
already exporting, thus minimizing the risk normally associated with entry into
new markets.  As in the past, some of the products will be exported through
specialized Foreign Trade Companies. However, taking advantage of the new and
more liberalized export trading regime, most enterprises have also begun to
investigate the possibilities for direct exports.
9.          Environmental degradation is a serious problem in Poland and the
Bank is working closely with the Government to develop an environment technical
assistance project which would provide specific support for long-term solutions
in this regard. Under the present project, preparation of subprojects includes
an assessment not only of the environmental impact of the facilities t.o 1wv



- 3 -
installed in the various enterprises, but also of the existing operations of the
enterprises concerned.   Subloan covenants will require that subprojects not
contribute to environmental or safety hazards, and in more than half of the
subprojects already selected, there will also be a reduction in polluting
discharges from existing operations. The project is thus introducing standards
which are expected to be replicated by the participating banks for their other
lending operations.
10.         The project includes substantial technical assistance, not only to
provide direct support to the investment component of the project, but also to
assist financial institutions and other agencies to begin the process of
adjustment to the new economic and political environment.  Specifically, the
technical assistance component (US$15 million) will be used for programs designed
first to strengthen the banking system, enhancing the capabilities of NBP and
financial institutions in Poland, including the participating banks. Terz.s of
reference have been agreed for programs which will assist Polish banks to develop
and implement programs to improve their operations, and also for an advisor to
NBP who will help to develop a comprehensive plan for strengthening bank
supervision.  Second, technical assistance will support the restructuring of
industry through the development of subsectoral restructuring strategies and
the introduction of international accounting standards and auditing practices.
In this context studies are proposed and terms of reference have been agreed for
determining the restructuring needs in the packaging and components industries
and the steel subsector.   Considerable progress has already been made in
introducing improvements to accounting and auditing practices with the Project
Preparation Facility (US$ 1.5 million), approved by the Bank in June, 1988.
Third, technical assistance financed under the project is aimed at helping to
stimulate rapid development of the private sector through both the development
of new private enterprises and the privatization of existing public sector
companies. Astivities envisaged under this component include a program to help
determine the assistance needs of ailing and financially distressed enterprises,
assistance to the development of small-scale enterprises, and a program to
support the transformation and privatization of state-owned enterprises.
11.         Total project cost is estimated at US$455 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$276 million (61%). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7143-POL, January 3, 1990 is also
attached.
12.         Agreed Actions.  NBP has agreed to the following for the operations
of the onlending component, to be implemented via Subsidiary Financing Agreements
with participating banks: (a) signing of a Subsidiary Financing Agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, with at least one participating bank would be a
condition of loan effectiveness; (b) each participating bank would undertake a
special external audit of its operations in order to develop and implement plans
to improve its operations and financial condition, with explicit measures to
achieve adequate ratios for capital to risk assets, concentration of portfolio,
and loan loss reserves; and (c) onlending to final beneficiaries would be in US$
at market-determined interest rates.



* 4 -
13.         For the selection of subprojects eligible for refinancing from the
Bank loan, the participating banks would ensure that, among others: (a) the
selected subprojects would demonstrate financial and economic rates of return
of at least 18X; (b) the subprojects would be completed within at most three
years and earn net additional foreign exchange in the first four years after
completion at least equal to the foreign exchange cost of the subproject; and
(c) the subprojects would not contribute to a safety hazard or to environmental
deterioration.
14.         For the implementation of the technical assistance components, NBP
has agreed to: (a) coordinate overall arrangements; (b) onlend to commercial
banks, through Subsidiary Lending Agreements satisfactory to the Bank, funds
needed to develop and implement action programs to improve their operations and
financial conditions; and (c) onlend to the Government, through a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank, funds needed to implement technical
assistance and training activities executed by Government agencies. Conclusion
of these subsidiary agreements would be a condition of disbursement for such
activities.
15.         Benefits. Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from: (i) convertible currency earnings derived from the increased availability
of quality products for exports; (ii) upgrading of the project preparation and
supervision capabilities of banks; and (iii) environmental and other benefits,
as described below. The economic rates of return of pre-identified investments,
the preparation and appraisal of which have been made jointly by Polish and Bank
staff, are expected to average 32X. The selection of further investments is to
be made on the basis of similar criteria and similar benefits are anticipated
for the other investments to be financed, with a minimum required economic rate
of return of 18Z. The benefits of technical assistance, though not quantifiable,
will be significant in such areas as banking capabilities and initiatives to
expand the role of the private sector. In addition, the project will contribute
to the strengthening of Polish institutional capabilities to develop
restructuring programs, and to identify and meet further restructuring needs in
industry. It will also support efforts to stimulate private sector development
and privatization efforts in the ongoing move towards a market economy.
16.         Risks.  In the short term, possible uncertainties associated with
the transition period might delay the implementation of the project and
adversely affect some of its expected direct benefits.  To safeguard against
this risk, the selection of the pre-identified enterprises has been focussed on
those enterprises which are financially healthy under the current environment
and can be expected to remain so during the course of reform. To accelerate
project implementation, procurement has been initiated for the pre-identified
projects, for which retroactive financing of up to US$25 million is proposed.
Furthermore, the project includes stringent financial and economic rate of return
criteria to be met by all investment projects to be financed. Another short-term
risk concerns the operations of the new banks created from existing NBP branches
which could induce delays in identifying and appraising projects. To minimize
this risk, project appraisal training courses have been conducted for staff of
potential participating banks, and joint appraisal by participating banks, NBP
and the Bank is being arranged for the larger subprojects. Furthermore, under
the project, action plans to strengthen both NBP and the participating banks will
be developed and implemented.   A longer-term risk stems from the ambitious
program of adjustment and stabilization that the Government is implementing.



- 5 -
While the Government's current plans are satisfactory, the major institutional
and systemic reforms are unprecedented in Poland and may take longer than
currently planned. The Bank's on-going economic and sector work dialogue will
be important in helping to identify weaknesses in implementation of the reform
and to support the Government's overall industrial policy reform program.
17.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
