SU1MARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of an engineering design and
preliminary works project (hereinafter referred to as "the Project") for
a larger infrastructure project (hereinafter referred to as "the Main
Project") to support a proposed copper/nickel mining development in north-
eastern Botswana. The Main Project covers the provision of a power, water
and transport infrastructure together with water storage, township and
associated medical facilities. This infrastructure is required to service
a proposed copper/nickel mining development and later other industrial
development in northeastern Botswana, all of which are important to the
country's development. An IDA credit of US$2.5 million has been requested
to cover the estimated cost of the Project. The Borrower would be the
Government of Botswana.
ii.       On the basis of present information the Main Project is estimated
to cost US$510. million. A return of about 18% is expected, which is con--
sidered sufficiently satisfactory to justify going ahead with the engineeriag
design and preliminary works which are the subject of the present proposed  _
credit.  The_urzan-g   thi.9_4 credit arises from          toco 12nza-
paratory-wQrk_i1itsain. p   artrocs  by .uly 1970
This will be necessary if the mining project is to be completed and in pro-            -
duction by February 1973 as presently planned. Sufficient information has
only recently become available to facilitate an identification of the Main
Project and an appraisal mission visited Botswana in November/December this
year. It is for this reason that a loan for the Main Project cannot be made
at this time.
iii.      An important factor determining the viability of the mining develon-
ment will be the price of electric power. The Botswana Government requires
that power be generated within the country using locally mined coal although
the feasibility report on the Main Project showed that imported power from
South Africa would be cheaper than locally generated power and that use of
imported coal would permit lower cost generation in Botswana than domestic
coal. The Government has taken this position partly because of its lack
of confidence in the security of imported power supplies and partly in the
hope that development of local coal deposits will stimulate domestic develop-
ment and in particular create additional employment.
iv.       The mining interests (represented by Bamangwato Concessions Ltd.
(BCL)) state that the mining development would still be financially attrac-
tive at the price of power resulting from the Government's decision to use
local coal. In view of this it would be appropriate for the Association
also to accept the use of local coal. However since BCL made this statement,
it has decided to reduce the size of its proposed development by refining



- ii -
outside Botswana and deferring development of some of the ore deposits.
Because of these decisions the demand for energy will be less and the
cost per kWh to the mining project will be some 14% higher than the figure
BJL originally said would be acceptable. During negotiations BCL confirmed
that it will be prepared to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase
of power and water at a price which would cover all costs and permit a rea-
sonable return on the investment in power and water facilities.
V.        The Project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.5 million
provided the conditions of effectiveness detailed in paragraph 5.03 are
met. A period of 50 years with a ten-year grace period is recommended.  It
is anticipated that if Bank financing of the Main Project is applied to the
power and water supply facilities, that part of the credit related to engi-
neering design of the power and water supply facilities would be refinanced.

ENGINEERING AND PRELIIIMARY WORKS CREDIT
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1. INTRCDUCTION
1.01      The Government of Botswana has requested assistance in financing
an engineering design and preliminary works project (hereinafter referred
to as "the Project") which is required to precede an infrastructure project
(hereinafter referred to as "the Main Project"). The latter, in turn, is
required to support a proposed copper/nickel mining development estimated
to cost about US$100 million in northeastern Botswana. The estimated cost
of the Project is US$2.5 million, covering US$1.8 million for engineering
design and US$0.7 million for preliminary works and staff expenses during
the design period.  The estimated foreign exchange cost is about US$2.1
rnLllion._ Since the Government  s dependent on-external aidafor its develop-
ment budget and for about 50% of its recurrent budget the Association has
been asked to finance the whole cost of the Project amounting to US$2.5
million. The Borrower would be the Government of Botswana.
1.02      The works contained in the Project were started in November, as
they have to be carried out in advance of the Main Project in order that the
latter may proceed without delay as soon as the final details have been
settled and agreed upon by the Government, the Bank and the mining interests
represented by Bamangwato Concessions Ltd. (BCL) or its successor, and finance
has been obtained. If detailed design work had not started in November 1969,
it is probable that commissioning of the Main Project would have been delayed
by up to six months (see paragraph 1.15). In the circumstances some retro-
active financing will be involved.
1.03      In this report BCL has been treated as the mining company.  BCL
is a subsidiary of Botswana Roan Selection Trust (BRST) and is in fact an
exploration company. BRST is owned by American Metal Climax (30%), Roan
Selection Trust (30%) and small shareholders (mainly in the U.S.). .Unt.-ni
,such time as a mining company is formed (with 15% Government participation).
to develop the copper/nickel deposits, BCL is acting as the representative
of the mining interests.
1.04      This report has been prepared by Messrs. A. E. Bailey and T. B.
Russell. It is based on the Feasibility Study undertaken during 1968 by
Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, together with information in the consultants'
supplementary report dated June 1969, and on information submitted to the
Bank by the Borrower.
Background
1.05      Botswana is an arid, landlocked country with a population of about
600,000 and an area of some 222,000 square miles. It is bounded by Rhodesia,
Zambia, South Africa and South West Africa. The Kalahari Desert, consisting
of rolling sandy country with some semidesert and grassy areas, covers much
of the south and west. The eastern region has the best agricultural land
and the most favorable rainfall.



- 2 -
1.06      The economy is based on cattle-raising and subsistence agriculture.
The principal exports are cattle and cattle products. The GNP was estimated
at $55 million, per capita income at $95 in 1966.
1.07      Established industry is virtually nonexistent apart from an ab-
batoir and meat-canning factory at Lobatse in the south. However, mineral
prospecting activity in the north has led to the discovery of a diamond
:orospect at Orapa near Lethlekane and copper/nickel deposits at Selebi-Pikwe
and at Matsitama (see map). Geological investigations have established coal
resources of about 550 million tons in the Morupule and Mamabula areas(see
map). Further mineral orebodies are known to exist, probably in substantial
quantities, including nickel and copper. Exploratory work is continuing.
Genesis of the Project
1.08      BCL commenced explorations around 1960 in the Selebi-Pikwe and
Matsitama areas. Potentially economic copper/nickel deposits of about
31 million tons were subsequently proven in the Selebi-Pikwe area with a
further probable reserve of about 10 million tons. Smaller reserves of
about 8 million tons but with a higher average copper content were proven
in the Matsitama area.
1.09      BCL assembled a study team in Johannesburg in 1966 to consider
and cost the various possible methods of mining, mineral dressing, smelting
and refining copper and nickel and the Government meanwhile sought the
assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
Ministry of Overseas Development, London for advice on infrastructure,
mining and taxation.
1.10      In 1967 the UNDP granted the Botswana Government US$357,000 (later
increased to US$361,800) to carry out a feasibility study of power, wTater
and transport facilities principally to service the development of the copper/
n_ckel deposits in the northeastern region. The Bank agreed to act as
Ex.ecuting Agency and engaged Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners of London as con-
ziultants on December 5, 1967 to undertake the required feasibility study.
1.11      Field work for the feasibility study was completed in October
2.968, and the report was distributed in January 1969. This had subsequently
to be revised to take account of reduced demand estimates for power and
water which were given to the Bank by BCL in April 1969 following a decision
to refine outside Botswana and to defer development of the Matsitama deposits.
The ccnsultants' supplementary report showing their revised conclusions was
distriLuted in July 1969 (see Annex 1). The town planning report for Pikwe
township which was financed by the Ministry of Overseas Development, London
and was also carried out by Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners was distributed in
January 1969, and a copy of the report on the health aspects prepared by
thie World Health Organization (W4HO) was sent to the Bank in August 1969.



- 3 -
1.12      The Board of ECL approved expenditure of $700,000 at a meeting on
November 11 to keep the mining program on schedule, and the company plans
to raise its equity and loan capital for the construction of the Project at about
the same time as the financing for the Main Project is arranged since the
two financing operations are interdependent. It is presently anticipated
that this will be about May 1970 and BCL plans to start production by
February 1973. The Board of BCL also agreed at the above-mentioned meeting
to guarantee payments to the consultants up to R100OO00 (US$1h,000) to
enable essential infrastructure design to commence in November (see paragraph
L.02).
1.13      The Government intends to seek finance from the Bank Group and
other sources for the infrastructure which will consist of power, water
and transport facilities together with a mining township and medical facil-
ities estimated to cost about US$51 million. Discussions with respect to
the organization to administer the construction of the Main Project and
later the operation of the power and water facilities were held during
negotiations. The Government representatives agreed in principle that it
will be necessary to establish such an organization and that IDA should
be consulted on the appointment of the chief executive officer and senior
technical and financial staff who will be required.  These discussions
were continued during the appraisal of the Main Piroject.
Urgency of the Project
1.14      BCL's timetable for mining development (paragraph 1.12) is con-
tingent upon successful raising of finance and upon there being no signifi-
cant slippage in the timetable for the construction of the Main Project.
In order to provide the necessary power, water and transport facilities to
bring the mine into operation by February 1973, a very tight construction
program for the Main Project will have to be achieved.
i.l5      The most critical item will be the Shashe Dam.  It is essential
that the dam should be completed sufficiently for impounding to begin by
October 1971 in order to conserve the run-off of the 1971/72 wet season.
It was important therefore to make an early start on the engineering and
preliminary works, since to delay these works until the conclusion of ar-
rangements for financing construction would delay commissioning of the
M4ain Project and commencement of mining by six months.
1.16      Given the timetable shown in paragraph 1.14 above the justification
for making a credit at this time is clear provided it can be shown that the
infrastructure investment to support the mining venture is likely to be
economically justified. The next chapter deals with this matter.

2. MI'ING AUID INFRASTRUCTURE DEPELOPMENT
2.01      This chapter describes the proposed mining development and the
Main Project. It also gives a brief description of existing infrastructure
facilities in Botswana and justification of the Main Project. The Engineer-
ing Design and Preliminary Works Project which is the reason for the pro-
posed IDA credit is discussed in the next chapter.
Mining Development
2.02      The Mining Project which is to be carried out by BCL comprises
the sinking of shafts and the installation of mining and workshop facilities
at Selebi and Pikwe with the concentrator and smelter located at Pikwe.
Refining will be outside Botswana. A total investment in Botswana of about
$72 million (US$100 million) is envisaged, of wjhich about US$9.0 million
equivalent will have been spent on exploration.
2.03      The planned mining rate is 1.5 million short tons per annum at
Pikwe and 660,000 short tons per annum at Selebi. The concentrator will
be designed to treat this ore and produce 1,400 short tons of bulk copper/
nickel per day. The smelting and sulphur reduction processes will be
utilized to produce copper/nickel matte and sulphur. Annual sales are
expected to be equivalent to 13,700 long tons of nickel and 15,800 long
tons of copper contained in the matte together with 125,000 short tons of
sulphur.
2.04      A township will be constructed some three miles to the south of
the Pikwe plant site at an estimated cost of US$14.0 million equivalent.
This includes buildings and houses to be provided by BCL at an estimated
cost of US$5.0 million equivalent.
2.05      Estimated power requirements for mining and township wili,he-
32 MW in 1973 increasing to 41 MW in 1980 and estimated average water re-
quirements will amount to about 4 million gallons per day in 1973 in-
creasing to about 6 million gallons per day in 1980.
2.Q6      BOL's detailed report on the mining project shows that the pro-
posed Selebi-Pikwe copper/nickel mining development should be a viable pro-
position and should produce a net return of 17.4% on the investment.
Ecisting Facilities
2.07      The existing road and rail facilities in Botswana consist of the
main railway line which runs from Mafeking in South Africa via Gaborone
and Francistown in Botswana to Bulawayo in Rhodesia and the main road which
follows approximately the route of the railway. This is an earth road of
substandard construction which is in need of upgrading. The site of the
mining project is some 37 miles east of Seruli (see map) and a branch rail-
way and road will be required to connect it with the existing transport
network.



- 5 -
2.08      Piped water facilities are available at Gaborone and Francistown.
mlsewhere water is obtained from wells and boreholes. AU of these facil-
ities are remote from the site of the mining development, the requirements
of which are in any case in excess of existing facilities.
2.09      There are presently two public electricity supply authorities
in Botswana. One is the Government-owned electricity authority, which has
a coal-fired power station at Gaborone comprising four generating units
(total installed capacity 4.3 MW) using coal imported from neighboring
countries. This plant supplies electricity to the townships of Gaborone
and Lobatse. The other public supply authority is the Francistown muni-
cipal electricity authority, which has a small diesel power station (total
installed capacity 0.4 MW) in Francistown to supply only the township.
2.10      Besides these two sources of electricity supply, small diesel
generating plants have been established by the railways at the Palapye
and Shashe railway watering points and the Mahalapye railway refueling
center. These are mainly for pumping purposes but supplies are also given
to local railway staff housing.
2.11      Both utilities described in paragraph 2.09 above are small and,
in the case of Gaborone, remote from the mining project.  The mining power
demand is large and a new power station with associated transmission facil-
ities will be necessary to meet this demand.
The Main Project
2.12      The Main Project as presently envisaged would provide power, water,
transport, township and medical facilities to support the mining venture.
These would include:
(a) Power: a 60 MW conventional thermal power station using
locally mined coal and a transmission system connecting
Pikwe with Shashe and Francistown;
(b) Water Supply: a dam on the Shashe River and a distribution
system to serve the mining complex, power station, Pikwe
township and Francistown;
(c) Transportation: an access road from Seruli to Pikwe together
with upgrading the Seruli-Francistown section of the north/south
road and a branch railway from Seruli to Pikwe, a distance of
about 37 miles; and
(d) A township at Pikwe, a hospital and associated medical facil-
ities.



- 6 -
The total estimated cost would be US$51 million. This incli3des interest
during construction on the porer and water infrastructure.-
2.13      The power facilities are estimated to cost US$18.0 million, about
35% of the total cost of the Main Project. The water facilities will cost
about US$13.0 million (25%), road and rail facilities about US$3.0 million
(6%), township US$14.0 million (28%) and medical facilities US$3.0 million
(6%).
2.14      Construction of the Main Project is scheduled to commence by
July 1970 and completion is scheduled for February 1973.
.Justification of the Main Project
2.15      Annex 2 shows the Botswana Government's estimated expenditure
and revenue projections for the period 1970/71 through 1980/81. At present
the country is dependent upon an annual grant from the United Kingdom to
balance its budget. In 1968/69 this grant was about 50% of recurrent ex-
penditure.  Annex 2, prepared by the Government, demonstrates the importance
of the mining revenues in future years in eliminating this dependence upon
foreign aid.
2.16      The proposed infrastructure has been appraised by a Bank mission
which visited Botswana in November/December 1969. A preliminary economic
evaluation has been carried out in the light of existing information. In
terms of employment, it is estimated that, directly or indirectly, the scheme
will result in the creation of up to 1,000 new jobs. This is in addition
to the 1,700 workers who will be required for the copper/nickel mining venture
and would represent an increase of about 8% of the total labor force at present
employed in the private sector of the economy outside agriculture.
2.17      More generally, the infrastructure and the associated mining
industry which it is to service will provide the foundation for further
development in the industrial and other sectors, as well as diversify
the economy and improv-e  its export capability.  This should lead to
accelerated economic growth and the economic benefit to the country would
be indicated by the resulting increase in GNP. It is not possible to put
a figure to this with the information at present available but an estimate
of the return on the total investment in infrastructure plus mining venture
can be made on the basis of the mining company's projections of the revenues
from the sale of copper/nickel matte and sulphur, which are said to be based
on conservative assumptions about selling prices. Some uncertainty must
attach to these projections, since they extend to 1992-3, but taking them
as they stand they show a return on the combined public and private invest-
ment of about 13%. This is without credit for any multiplier effect or
for the social opportunity costs of inputs (e.g. of local unskilled labor)
being less than their money costs; but it is sufficient to show that the
17 Interest during construction on other elements of the infrastructure has
not been included as it is assumed that these will be the subject of soft
loans from other agencies with whom preliminary discussions have been held.



- 7 -
combined investment should be justified. A rough estimate of the return to
the Government on the infrastructure alone has also been made, treating as
revenues the projected yield of taxes, dividend and royalties payable by
the mining company plus the estimated revenues from the infrastructure
facilities,l/ less the increase in government ordinary expenditure at-
tributable to the infrastructure. This shows a return of about 18% on the
Main Project, which is satisfactory.
2.18      However there is a problem with the provision of the power facil-
ities.  The consultants' feasibility report of December 1968 supported by
their supplementary report of June 1969 shows a series of alternatives for
the provision of power, water and transport infrastructure. These alter-
natives are based on the following methods for the provision of power:
(a) Imported power from South Africa.
(b) Local generation using imported coal from Rhodesia.
(i) With power station sited at Shashe.
(ii) With power station sited at Pikwe.
(iii) With power station sited at Pikwe, but
integrated with waste heat steam from the
smelter plant.
(c) Local generation with locally mined coal and with the alter-
natives listed under b(i) to (iii) above.
2.19      The feasibility report shows that importing power from South
Africa would be the most economical method of supplying power for the mining
project, municipalities.and other consumers.,Annex 3 shows in detail an eco-
nomic comparison of schemes based on the two alternatives - imported power
and local generation using locally mined coal. The estimated capital invest-
ment to 1980 with imported power from South Africa is shown to be R15.74
million (US$22.0 million) compared with R25.2 million (US$35.3 million) for
local generation but the scheme based on local generation shows savings in
running costs.
2.20      In the case of local generation the consultants' supplementary
report shows that the cost of imported coal from Rhodesia would be some
30% less than locally mined coal and its use would reduce the cost of
power by about 10%.
1/ The Francistown hospital has not been included in this calculation
as no information is available at present on its operating costs
and revenues.



- 8 -
2.21      Notwithstanding these conclusions, the Government has opted
for local generation using locally mined coal because it lacks confidence
in the security of supply with imported power and wishes to encourage a
local coal mining industry. In this connection the Government and the
consultants have had discussions with the Anglo-American Corporation,
and the latter has stated that it would be prepared to develop the
Morupule coal field on the basis of the reduced demand for coal subject
to agreement on the price. The comparison between imported power and
local generation (Annex 3) shows that the return on the additional in-
vestment in the infrastructure based on local generation is 4.8%. This
can only be regarded as marginal but in opting for local generation using
locally mined coal the Government has weighed the financial factors in
favor of imported power against the political and other considerations.
Moreover, the estimate of a 4.8% return on the extra capital for local
generation compared with imported power is based on the estimated money
costs of the inputs for each alternative. The return to the economy will
be different to the extent that the social opportunity costs of inputs
(e.g. of imports and local unskilled labor) differ from their money costs
and that there are any net secondary benefits which can be credited to
the local scheme, including any multiplier effects attributable to the
extra local expenditure which it involves. It is not possible to cal-
culate the effect of these factors with any precision with the information
available, but they could raise the return to the economy on the extra
investment required for local generation appreciably above h.8%.
2.22      The cost of power is an important factor in assessing the
viability of the mining venture. Imported power from South Africa would
probably be available at an average price of US1.25 cents per kWh. The
price of locally generated power using locally mined coal is somewhat
more difficult to determine since it will depend in part on the total
demand, which has varied as BCL has modified its plans. At an earlier
stage when BCL was proposing to refine in Botswana, the overall cost of
power to the mining company of about USIA4 cents per kWh approximated to
the figure on which BCL had based its own estimates. Because of BCL's
subsequent decision to refine outside Botswana, and the resultant drop
in demand for electricity, the estimated cost of power sold to BCL will
noTw be about US1.6 cents per kWh. This is based on Scheme 3, analyzed
in the consultants' supplementary report and which provides for the waste
heat steam from the mining company's smelter to be used in the utility
power station and to be provided at no cost to the utility. Since this
is less than the revised cost of US1.65 cents upon which BCL had based
its own revised estimates, this should still leave the mining venture
attractive to the developer. For this reason as well as the other
factors involved, it is recommended that the Association agree to the
Government's decision to adopt local generation using locally mined
coal. During negotiations BCL's representatives confirmed the intention
of the company to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of
power and water, the price of which would cover all costs and permit a
reasonable return on the investment in power and water facilities.

9.23      The alternative schemes for local generation which are analyzed
in the consultants' supplementary report are described in Annex 1. Scheme
3, which provides for the waste heat steam from the mining company's smelter
to be used in the utility power station, although shown to be the most
economical solution, has undesirable features. Schemes 1 and 2 differ only
to the extent of the location of the power station and the design of the
transmission system. All of these alternatives have been investigated
during the appraisal of the Main Project.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed IDA Project comprises the following works and
services related to the Main Project.
(a) The services of engineering consultants to:
(i) Carry out field surveys as necessary for the transportation,
power and water distribution and townsite.
(ii) Design the infrastructure facilities described in paragraph
2.12 and prepare a final engineer's estimate of construction
costs showing separately foreign and local costs, and de-
tailed time schedules of construction, specifications,
drawings and contract documents for the construction of
these facilities.
(iii) Arrange contracts for, and supervise construction of the
agreed preliminary works, services and advance housing.
(iv) Advise and assist the Government in negotiations with
other parties involved in the development, and assist
the Government as necessary in the preparation of such
legislation as may be required.
(b) Construction of the preliminary works which are detailed in
Annex 4.
(c) Salaries and expenses of project co-ordinating staff who might
be appointed during the design stage.
(d) Miscellaneous expenses and contingencies to include:
(i) Topographical, soil and other surveys.
(ii) Resettlement costs estimated at US$30,000.
3.02      The Government proposes to appoint Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners,
who are acceptable to the Association, to carry out the work described in
paragraph 3.01 above.
Estimated Cost of the Project

3.04      These estimates are based on discussions with Sir Alexander Gibb
& Partners, atrho carried out the feasibility study. The consultants' estimate
of power station capital costs, upon which part of the design fee is based,
is high. Close liaison will be maintained with the consultants during the
design stage to ensure that power station capital costs are kept to a minimum;
it is expected that this will result in proportionate savings in engineering
design costs.
3.05      The Government has agreed to enter into an agreement with the
consultants appointed for the Project on terms satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation setting forth the schedule of fees and conditions under which the
work will be carried out. Approval of the agreement by the Association
will be made a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit.
3.06      Because of its inability to meet the local costs, the Government
has requested that the IDA credit cover the entire cost of the Project.
The services to be provided by the Government would therefore be limited
to land acquisition as necessary and co-ordination and administration of
the Project.
Procurement
3.07      Invitations to tender for the construction of preliminary works
would be in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits.
Disbursement
3.08      Disbursements for design works and other services performed by
the consultants would be made in accordance with the terms of the agreement
w-th the consultants (see paragraph 3.05).

3.09      Disbursements for preliminary works and miscellaneous items

of foreign and local exchange for equipment, material and services.
3.10      The Project should be substantially completed by the time work
on the Main Project is scheduled to commence which is expected to be not
later than July, 1970.   However it is expected there will be at that time
some outstanding commitments on design and advance housing, which should
be completed by May 1971. The design work which can be directly related to

h. RE.IMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
4.01      The mining company will be required to share the risk in the
event the mining development is deferred indefinitely and/or the Bank
decides not to make a loan for the Main Project. As a condition of
effectiveness therefore the mining company will be required to undertake
to refund to the Association an amount equivalent to 50% of the credit
amount spent for the design and preliminary works if any of the following
events occur:
(a) A decision shall have been made by the Board of Directors of
BCL not to commence mining development.
(b)  By November 30, 1970 or such later date as the Association may
determine, BCL shall not have become a mining company (as
defined in the Concession Agreement) persuant to the pro-
visions of the Concession Agreement.
(c) By December 31, 1972, the Association shall not have received
a certificate issued by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Association showing that the total amount of new expendi-
ture for mining development after the date of the Agreement
has exceeded US$25.0 million equivalent.
4.02      The matter referred to in paragraph 4.01 was discussed and the
terms and conditions of the reimbursement agreement were agreed with BCL's
representatives during negotiations and have since been approved by the
Board of BCL subject to satisfactory completion of a tax agreement with
the Botswana Government.

5. COIICLUSIONIS
5.01      The timetable for mining and infrastructure development is tight
and the Project is essential to avoid slippage in the construction schedule
for the Main Project (paragraph 1.15).
5.02      The Project is suitable for a credit of US$2.5 million repayable
over 50 years with a ten-year grace period, and if Bank financing of the
Main Project is applied to the power and water supply facilities that part
of the credit related to engineering design of the power and water supply
facilities estimated at about US$1.0 million would be refinanced.
5.03      It has been agreed during negotiations that as conditions of
effectiveness:
(a) The Government of Botswana will enter into an agreement with
the consultants on terms satisfactory to the Association,
setting forth the conditions under which the work will be
carried out (paragraph 3.05).
(b) B3L will complete the reimbursement agreement which requires it
to refund to the Association an amount equivalent to 50% of the
credit spent for the design and preliminary works if any one
of the events detailed in paragraph 4.01 occurs.

ENGINEERIN AND PRELIMINARY WORKS CREDIT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
Description of
Alternative Schemes and Consultants' Conclusions
Included in Supplementary Report
The object of the supplementary study was to review and revise
the conclusions and recommendations set out in the Feasibility
Report dated December 1968 in the light of the final figures for power
and water demands which had been presented by the mining company.
The consultants were instructed to present alternative schemes
with the power station located at Shashe and Pikwe, and in the latter
case also considering a further alternative with the power utility
utilizing the waste heat steam from the smelter in a turbine to be owned
by the Utility. The costs of local coal versus imported coal were
examined for all alternatives.
Scheme 1 - Power Station at Shashp
Shashi was selected as an alternative site to Pik-we because of
its more central location relative to future anticipated load growth
in northern Botswana.  Since the power station would be located 55 miles
from the mine, the mining company would have to own and operate its
own waste heat turbine to utilize the waste heat steam from the smelter.
In this case the mining load on the utility would be reduced by 13 rNW.
The consultants recommend for all schemes a conventional coal-
burning thermal power station, and in this scheme the power station
would be located near or adjacent to Shashe.  The station would operate
on Morupule coal transported some 60 miles by rail from the mine. This
'would entail the construction of a rail siding (7-1/2 miles long) from
Morxupule to the main line. The power station would be designed for an
initial capacity of h5 1iW comprising three 15 MW units.
Transmission facilities would consist of a double-circuit
110 kv transmission line from Shashi to Pikwe to supply the mining com-
plex and township. The local supply to Shashe and the supply to
Francistown would be given initially at 33 kv.
A railway branch line from Seruli to Pikwe - a distance of
37 miles - would be common to all schemes as would the road system
which would comprise a first-class gravel road from Pikwe to Shashe, to-
gether with an excisting earth road from Seruli to Pikwe.  The
recommendations for the provision of water, which is also common to all
schemes, include the construction of a dam near Shashe siding with water
conveyed to the Pikwe mining complex and township by a 24/27-inch
pipeline.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3 pages
Ihe total capital cost of the scheme (excluding interest
during construction and escalation) would amount to R 25.31 million
(US$35.43 million). The average cost of power per kwh sold is estimated
to be 1.74 cents (US cents 2.4) per kwh in 1972, decreasing with increased
sales to 1.52 cents (US cents 2.13) per kwh in 1980.
Scheme 2 - Power Station at Pikwe
This scheme provides for the power station at Pikwe but with
the mining company owning and operating a waste heat turbine to utilize
the waste heat steam from the smelter. The power station would be the
same as recommended for Scheme 1.
Transmission facilities would consist of a single-circuit 66 kv
transmission line from Pikwe to Shashe, and a 33 kv distribution
extension from Shashe to provide a supply to Francistown.
Road, railway and water facilities would be the same as for
Scheme 1.
The total capital cost of the scheme (excluding interest
during construction and escalation) would amount to R 24.24 million
(US$33.94 million). The average cost of power per kwh sold is estimated
to be 1.63 cents (US cents 2.28) per kwh in 1972, decreasing to 1.46
cents (US cents 2.04) per kwh in 1980.
Scheme 3 - Power Station at Pikwe with W4aste Heat Steam Turbine
Owned by the Utility
This scheme provides for the waste heat steam to be used in
the utility power station. In this case, the power station would be
designed for an initial capacity of 60 MW comprising four 15 MW generating
units with four 12.5 MW boilers.
In all other respects the scheme is identical with Scheme 2.
The total capital cost of this scheme (excluding interest
during construction and escalation) is R 25.21 million (US$35.29 million).
The average cost of power per kwh sold is estimated to be 1.26 cents
(US cents 1.76) per kwh in 1972, decreasing to 1.2 cents (US cents 1.68)
per kwh in 1980.
C mments
The power costs shown for Scheme 3 above are not comparable
with Schemes 1 and 2, since the former averages the cost of all kwh
sold whether generated by coal or waste heat steam, whereas in the case
of Schemes 1 and 2 only the selling cost of units generated by coal is
considered. A comparison of the average total annual power costs of
each of the alternatives shows that Scheme 3 (Pikwe site with integrated
waste heat steam) is still the lowest but the difference between Schemes 2



Annex 1
Page 3 of 3 pages
and 3 is marginal.  Scheme 1 is shown to be more expensive than the other
two in the earlier years; however, with the difference in costs becoming
less marked as the load and fuel consumption increases and with substantial
growth of demand from other developments in northern Botswana, Scheme 1
could eventually become the cheapest.
Scheme 3 has undesirable features. It is higher in capital cost
than Schemes 1 and 2 since additional generating plant has to be installed
to use the smelter waste heat steam. It limits the choice of power stafton
location to Pikw'e, and it involves the use of waste heat steam the quality
and quantity of which is not under the control of the supply authority.
The consultants show that imported coal would cost approximately
30% less than locally mined coal and its use would reduce the cost of power
by about 10%. But in order to encourage local industry and provide employ-
ment opportunities, the Government has decided, and the concession holders,
the Anglo-American Corporation, have agreed that the Morupule coal deposit
should be developed principally 'to supply the fuel for the power station.
Coal will be transported initially by road from the mine to the
main railway line and the railway siding (7½ miles long) from Morupule to
the main line which has been recommended by the consultants would not be
included in the initial stage of development.
The consultants did not provide sufficient data to support their
recommendation for the road investment, and a preliminary report from a
Bank highway mission to Botswfana in September 1969 recommends that road
access should be from Seruli to Pik-we and the Seruli-Francistown section
of the existing north/south road should be upgraded.
