3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The central objective is to mitigate the social and environmental consequences that arise from mine
closures, as part of an overall Government restructuring program for the sector. The project seeks to: (i)
test ways to implement mine closures safely, with due regard to technical, environmental, economic,
financial and social aspects; (ii) ensure that mine workers are afforded opportunities to either transfer to
other jobs in the sector or exit the industry with reasonable compensation and a choice of assistance for
seeking other employment; (iii) transfer social assets to municipal management and support their
rationalization, while helping to ensure that the most vulnerable groups are adequately protected in terms of
access to services; and (iv) through monitoring and feedback, gain experience from the Pilot Project for
subsequent operations.
The objectives were clear and important for the country, the sector and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy. While responsive to development priorities and borrower circumstances, the project was also
complex and risky. The complexity was deternined by the involvement of two ministries (Ministry of Coal
Industry (MCI) and Ministry of Finance (MoF)), a special agency for mine closures (UDKR) and the
Donetsk Oblast Administration (DOA). The riskiness was determined by the contentiousness of mine
closures and the possibility of social and political unrest in the Donbass, Ukraine's once proud coal mining
region. It was for these reasons that the project was designed as a pilot operation, focusing on the closure of
three Donbass mines (all located in Donetsk Oblast), with the overall goal to demonstrate the feasibility of
closing mines in a socially and environmentally acceptable manner. While the Bank deemed the pilot
approach necessary, the Ukrainian Government would have been ready to immediately embark on a larger
restructuring program covering more mines. The Bank supported the larger restructuring program with the
Coal SECAL, following the successful start of the Coal Pilot Project.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The development objective has not been revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of five components:
3   Mitigation of Physical Mine Closure. This component provided for environmental mitigation, civil
works, equipment and operation of the mine's infrastructure during the period of physical closure
works.
*   Social Mitigation. This component provided for severance payments, old age pension benefits,
disability payments, unemployment benefits, reemployment support, micro-credit and public works.
* Social Infrastructure Divestiture and Heating Subsidy. This component provided financial support
for: (i) the transfer of mining settlements' housing and communal infrastructure (kindergartens and
sport, cultural and health facilities) from mine to municipal ownership; and (ii) supply of free coal to
families of ex-miners and pensioners of the closed mines.
*   Institutional Strengthening. This component provided for the financing of incremental operating costs
of UDKR.
*   Technical Services. This component provided for technical assistance, training and studies.
The components were closely related to achieving the objectives and to the capacity of the implementing
agencies. They took into account relevant lessons learned in prior projects in the country and the sector.
The social mitigation component took into account priorities of miners from the pilot mines, but was at the
same time kept adaptable to changing needs and test results.
3.4 Revised Components:
-2 -



The components have not been revised. However, the Loan Agreement was amended three times. The
amendments covered reallocation of funds, an extension of public works in the Donetsk Oblast, and the
financing of audits and installation of a project monitoring system at MoF. Given the requirement for a
flexible approach in a pilot operation of this nature, these amendments were considered minor and did not
require a revision of the basic project components.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The ICR rating for quality at entry is Satisfactory. The project objectives were consistent with the CAS and
government priorities. The project was designed to move ahead fast, on a pilot basis, with implementing
one of the most difficult tasks in one of the most difficult sectors. The later amendments to the Loan
Agreement did not reflect a poor entry design, but were a necessary consequence of operating in the
project's and the sector's environment. The preparation and design of the project involved close cooperation
with stakeholders and the selection of a few key areas for action while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to
changing situations, thus contributing to the achievement of the ultimate project goal, i.e., a demonstration
that the closure of mines in the Donbass is feasible in a socially and environmentally acceptable way.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The underlying central development objective of this pilot project was the demonstration, on a pilot basis of
three selected Donbass mines, that the closure of mines in Ukraine is feasible in a socially and
environmentally acceptable way. This overall objective has been achieved and the outcome rating is
therefore Satisfactory. The three mines have been physically closed and its workers have been laid off, in
line with Ukrainian legislation and the project's provisions. The ex-mine sites do not pose safety or health
risks. Ex-miners who did not find altemative employment have been compensated fairly. The previously
mine-owned social assets have been transferred to municipalities. There has been no social or polital unrest
triggered by mine closures. The different agencies involved in implementing the project cooperated well.
The pilot project did provide the positive experience needed for a larger follow-on project.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Mitigation of Physical Mine Closure. At the three pilot mines, 20 shafts and inclines have been filled and
sealed. More than 380,000 cubic meters of decrepit industrial building space has been demolished and the
rubble has been deposited in an environmentally acceptable way. About 4,500 tons of steel were recovered
and recycled. More than 260,000 square meters of previously industrial land have been reclaimed and are
now available for new altemative use. The output of the component is rated Satisfactory.
Social Mitigation. Severance payments, paid by the Government of Ukraine through UDKR, have been
received by 2,570 entitled persons from the three pilot mines. Disability payments have been made to about
2,800 persons. Two social surveys, carried out at mid-term and towards the end of the project, showed that
unemployed ex-miners and mine pensioners do generally receive unemployment benefits and pensions on
time and in full. The surveys also showed that new employment in the formal economy is hard to find;
however, they showed too that many people have developed their own survival strategies to cope with the
loss of their previous workplace in an acceptable way. The project provided subsidies for the reemployment
of more than 1,000 ex-mine workers, micro-credits for 12 projects that involved 180 new jobs, and
temporary employment for 684 ex-miners who participated in 111 public works projects that have been
socially and environmentally very useful. The projects included repair and maintenance of public housing,
schools, hospitals, roads, street lighting, sewage systems and parks. Based on the result of the social
surveys, the overall output of the component is still rated Satisfactory.
Social Infrastructure Divestiture and Heating Subsidy. As part of the pilot project, 982 houses with
- 3 -



256,300 square meters of living space were transferred. In addition, 7 kindergartens were transferred and 4
town halls. About 5,500 entitled persons received free coal. The output of the component is rated
Satisfactory.
Institutional Strengthening. As part of the project preparation, UDKR was created in early 1996 as a new
state company for mine closures. At the start of the project, the project contributed to the refurbishment of
UDKR's offices in a rented building and to the purchase of office equipment. Creation of the company and
support for its operation were timely and have proven to be crucial for project implementation. The output
of the component is rated Satisfactory.
Technical Services. Limited ad hoc technical assistance was provided to UDKR as needed. Following an
amendment of the loan agreement, consultant services for the supervision of social mitigation projects,
installation of a financial management system and independent financial audits were provided to MoF as
part of the project. The output of the component is rated Satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The net present value of the incremental economic benefit of the project was estimated at $26 million at
appraisal and the project's economic rate of return was estimated at 55%. The recalculated net present
value is $21 million and the economic rate of return is 47%. The recalculation is based on the assumption
that social mitigation costs are higher than estimated at appraisal, while the creation of new employment is
progressing slower (Annex 3).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Because the project is not dealing with a revenue earning entity, no financial return was calculated.
However, the project's positive net impact on the national budget was estimated at $59 million (in present
value terms calculated over a 12-year post-project period with a discount factor of 10%). A reestimation
under the pessimistic assumption that the costs of disability payments and free coal supplies stay at about
twice the level assumed at appraisal, shows that the positive impact on the budget would still be $43
million.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a significant institutional development impact through the creation of UDKR. This agency
initially was created specifically for the project, as a result of close cooperation between the Government
and the Bank's project preparation team. Very soon after its creation, UDKR was mandated by the
Government to close a significant number of mines, in parallel with the three pilot mines. To date, UDKR
has received more than 80 mines for closure, of which more than half have completed all works for
physical closure. In parallel to the physical closure, UDKR has been, and still is, also responsible for the
payment of statutory social benefits to laid-off workers and their families. These benefits include severance
payments, disability payments, free coal and unemployment benefits during the second year of
unemployment. Despite budget shortages, UDKR has been the key to assure a fair minimum flow of social
payments to the affected population and thus became the backbone for the Government's continued
program of mine closures in a socially acceptable way.
Through preparation and supervision work, supported by interviews, social assessments and workshops,
the project contributed greatly to build understanding and consensus for the need of mine closures as an
essential part of coal sector restructuring. Before the project, mine closures were a very sensitive issue that
was not discussed; but today, the topic is discussed in an open and constructive way among the various
stakeholders that include the Ministries of Fuel and Energy, Finance, Economy, Labor, the coal industry,
regional administrations and labor and community representatives. These discussions and the lessons of the
-4 -



project resulted in the identification of strengthened institutional arrangements for a larger follow-on project
in the form of the proposed Coal Sector Social Mitigation Project.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of governnment or implementing agency:
There have been no major events clearly outside the control of government or implementing agencies that
negatively (or positively) affected the project. While social and political unrest in the Donbass area, with
repercussions on the project, has been a possible risk to the project, such event did not occur.
The poor business environment in Ukraine not only hampered the creation of small businesses but also
facilitated fraud in the application of micro-credits and employment subsidies, two social mitigation
measures of the project. While the business environment in general is not outside the control of the
Government, its improvement is a long-term endeavor, far beyond the scope of this project. Local
businessmen and management of the participating bank (Donuglkombank) colluded in a misuse of
micro-credit funds. As soon as discovered, MoF as the supervising agency, stopped the micro-credit
program, reimbursed the Bank, and launched a Government investigation. Some employment subsidies
have been granted to laid-off miners who produced faked certificates of self-employment. As soon as
discovered, UDKR as the implementing agency for employment subsidies, stopped disbursements to
self-employed ex-miners and tightened the rules and controls of the scheme (to such an extend that
thereafter no more employment subsidies were disbursed).
While the occurrence of the incidents is a serious matter and regrettable, the damage control has been
working well and the impact on the overall implementation of the project and achievement of its central
objective has been minimal. Both, the Bank and the implementing agencies, took immediate action. No
further misuse of funds occurred after the incidents. The Bank's performance in supervision and the
implementing agencies' performance have therefore been rated Satisfactory.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Established regulations and procedures have not always facilitated efficient mine closures. There are too
many regulations and legal instruments (including orders and decisions) at various levels of the
Government (President's Office, Cabinet of Ministers, line ministries), often general and ambiguous, in
some cases even contradictory. Some outdated regulations of the Soviet era, including mine safety rules,
have been a hindrance to fast and cost-efficient mine closures.
In public, the Govemment has been largely silent on coal sector reform. Even when faced with false and
damaging media reports, the Government did normally not come forward with coherent public information
on coal sector restructuring and explanations of the rationale. Insufficient public information and
involvement of local stakeholders by the Government raised questions about its selection of the pilot mines
that, although answered in the end, may have resulted in avoidable delays and dissatisfaction. Poor public
information conveyed the sense of incoherent reform policy and may have favored political opposition to
coal sector reform.
A key role in preparation and supervision of mine closures has been allocated to the Government's design
institutes. While the technical knowledge and capacity of these institutes is appreciated, they also exercised
bureaucratic power with a negative impact on time and costs of mine closures. In particular, their outdated
approach to cost estimates (using centrally prescribed standards, sometimes even applied without field
inspections, which then occasionally resulted in plans that did not correctly reflect the existence of
buildings on the mine site) caused avoidable debates and contract amendments with civil works contractors.
-5 -



Although MCI has full control over the design institutes, it chose not to redefine the design institutes' role
or change its working practices.
The expansion of water pumping in neighboring mines has delayed the physical closure of the pilot mines
(the expansion is necessary to deal with an increased influx of water as a result of stopping pumping at the
closing mines). The expansion was the responsibility of the affected mining associations or companies
under order of MCI. Limited state funding was the most often cited reason for delays, but MCI could have
lessened the impact by clearer instructions and priority setting.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Initially, the Bank's contribution to the financing of operating and maintenance costs of transferred social
assets from closed mines was not disbursed because the borrower did not pay its part of the costs.
Dissatisfaction with the status of social assets was found in a social assessment conducted in 1997. Later
during project implementation, payments improved and the situation became better.
MoF could have avoided signing a fiscal agency agreement with Donuglkombank for carrying out the
micro-credit scheme, in particular since the Bank had cautioned about the poor financial standing of
Donuglkombank. However, MoF gave in to political pressures and the apparently genuine dedication of
Donuglkombank to the objectives of the micro-credit scheme.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Although the actual project costs stayed slightly below the appraisal estimate (US$28.0 million actual vs.
US$28.5 million at appraisal), some further savings in the costs of physical mine closure could have been
possible if MCI had put a higher financing priority on the expansion of water pumping in neighboring
mines and if it had intervened more rigorously with mining associations and design institutes, thus
shortening the time for physical closure works and thereby reducing in particular the expenses for operating
the mine's infrastructure (mainly ventilation and water pumping) during the period of closure.
There have been significant shifts in expenses for mitigating the social impact.While the expenses for
statutory social benefits (in particular disability payments) and for free coal were nearly twice as high as
originally estimated, expenses for new employment creation stayed below estimates. The increased
expenses for statutory benefits are largely due to incorrect estimates of payment arrears at the time of
appraisal and the lower expenses for new employment creation are a reflection of the poor business
environment for creation of new small enterprises and limited employment opportunities in the the formal
sector. Nevertheless, unemployment growth was limited due to a relatively large number of miners
benefitting from retirement, transfer to other mines or work in the informal sector.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The Likely rating has been given on the basis that: (a) the project achieved its objective of demonstrating
that mine closures are feasible in a socially and environmentally acceptable manner; and (b) the Coal
SECAL has already demonstrated successfully the larger application of the results of the Coal Pilot
Project. Each closure of a highly uneconomic mine is an achievement that brings the coal sector closer to
sustainability. Full sustainability of the sector is only reached once all uneconomic mines have been closed
or restructured and no more state subsidies are flowing into the sector. The project was a successful first
step to embark on that route.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Facilitated by the positive experience of this project, many more mines have been closed by UDKR and in
- 6 -



that sense the transition to 'regular operation' has been made. However, mine closures are still very risky
and can go off-track politically at any time. Flexibility and adaptability as demonstrated under the pilot
project should therefore be maintained for future mine closure operations.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank lending performance is regarded as Satisfactory, despite significant changes in disbursements
during the implementation of the project. The Bank's preparation of the project included extensive
consultation with stakeholders and, while putting the focus on the jointly identified essential social
mitigation measures, still maintained sufficient flexibility to successfully cope with the nonpredictable and
imperfect environment of the pilot task. The project was among the Bank's best disbursing operations in
Ukraine. It moved ahead fast even in the beginning, largely by concentrating on those activities that were
ready for disbursement, while working on the fulfillment of disbursement conditions that were put in place
for more complex tasks.
7.2 Supervision:
The supervision perfonnance of the Bank is rated Satisfactory. Supervision was greatly facilitated by the
active involvement of the Kiev Resident Mission in following-up with different Government branches and
agencies. Except for the first missions, supervision benefitted from the synergy made possible by combined
missions with the Coal SECAL. Amendments to the loan agreement were promptly made when needed.
7.3 Overall Bank performance.
The overall performance of the Bank is assessed as Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance in preparing the project is regarded as Satisfactory, despite shortcomings in
public information and communication with local stakeholders. During project preparation, the selection of
the pilot mines changed (Removskaya instead of Voskhod mine) and at some point it was uncertain whether
the Government could and would carry through its closure decision regarding the Pravda mine. The fact
that the Government held to its decision despite significant local resistance, speaks very favorably for the
Government's conmiitment to coal sector restructuring and the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
For the most part, Government implementation performance was Satisfactory, despite the shortcomings by
MCI in managing the water pumping capacity expansion in neighboring mines and possible shortcomings
of MoF in selecting Donuglkombank as the fiscal agency for micro-credits.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agencies is rated Satisfactory. UDKR, the main implementing
agency, performed remarkably well under the constraints and political attacks it had to deal with. DOA,
aside from initial shortcomings in contributing to the costs of social assets transfers, cooperated very well
and demonstrated, during the course of the project, very good supervision and financial management of its
two components, public works and social assets transfer. MoF, as supervising agency for micro-credits,
acted promptly and correctly when improprieties in the use of funds became apparent. In addition, MoF
was always very cooperative in implementing all project components and contributed positively to the
success of the project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
-7 -



The overall peifoimance of the Borrower is assessed as Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Gefneral lessons:
*   A pilot operation can be very useful to set in motion a major restructuring program. The Coal Pilot
0roject contributed greatly to the advancement of coal sector restructuring in Ukraine, together with the
(almost) parallel Coal SECAL. The lessons from the pilot project were incorporated in the restructured
SECAL. Although the launching of the Coal SECAL did not wait for results from the Coal Pilot
Project, the mere fact that the pilot closure of mines could be successfully set in motion was sufficient
to trigger an accelerated mine closure program and thus substantially reduce the drain from the national
budget for the operation of uneconomic mines.
*   A flexible approach can keep a difficult project moving. In deviation from the normal best practice,
the Coal Pilot Project had several disbursement conditions for different components, allowing fast
processing and early effectiveness of the loan, thus enabling the national economy to reap the benefits
of fast restructuring. Also, when it became evident during implementation that micro-credits and
employment subsidies were not effective social mitigation measures at this time in Ukraine, the funds
were shifted to public works which, beside the positive temporary employment, had additional social
benefits for the local public and, through the goodwill created, contributed to keeping the pace of mine
closures.
*   Piloting can lead to a new product. Triggered by the difficulties encountered in financing social assets
.ransfe.E and the need to provide incentives for such transfers and improve conditions in communities
with closed mines, the Bank's supervision team, in close cooperation with DOA and MoF, developed
the Municipal Credit Line, which was successfully implemented under the Coal SECAL. The basic
features of the Credit Line are that municipalities which have accepted social assets have access,
subject to agreed rules, to the Credit Line for non-commercial projects of their choice. The credits are
issued by MoF and guaranteed by DOA.
Lessons specifically for mine closure projects:
* The agency for mine closures should be tailored to country circumstances. The creation of UDKR
has been a key to the success of the project. While normally the functions of physical mine closure and
social mitigation are vested in two separate agencies, in this case their combination within in UDKR
has been very successful. Weak institutional capacities, the special historic role of Donbass miners and
the determination of the Government to move ahead fast with the closing of mines, all made the chosen
model for UDKR perfectly acceptable and workable. In fact, UDKR's being in charge of statutory
social benefits for miners greatly contributed to the relatively smooth implementation of mine closures.
°   Lessons for improved mine closure procedures. The project resulted in several lessons for improved
mine closure procedures that are relevant for a follow-on operation (the proposed Coal Sector Social
Mitigation Project) as well as for similar operations in other countries. The major lessons are: (i)
prepare the closure sufficiently in advance (e.g., early stop of mine development, timely preparation of
neighboring mines for increased water inflow); (ii) split the tasks and set the rules (e.g., physical
closure by special agency under special rules, reliable channel for statutory social benefits under
special industry rules if needed, regionally improved labor services by the labor ministry or NGOs
under tested rules); and (iii) concentrate on the essential (e.g., acceptable statutory social benefits, first
phase environmental mitigation limited to reduction of risks to safety and health of people).

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
At appraisal, a comparison was made between economic costs and benefits under the scenarios with and
without the project. As a result, the net present value of the incremental net benefit in the with project case
was estimated at $26 million. The economic rate of return was estimated at 55%. The sensitivity analysis
showed that the single most important factor for the economic justification of the project was the cost of
imported coal. As this cost has not changed and also the total costs of the mine closures stayed very much
at the level of the appraisal estimate (they are even slightly lower), it can be assumed that the net present
value and the economic rate of return are similarly high as estimated at appraisal.
Nevertheless, the net present value and the economic rate of return have been recalculated under the
pessimistic assumption that those major differences to appraisal assumptions which have a negative impact
on the project's return would continue to exist throughout the next 12 years. These differences are: (i)
significantly higher costs of free coal supplies; and (ii) significant less employment in the formal sector (the
informal sector has not been considered), resulting in reduced economic benefit from new non-mining
activity. Specifically, it has been assumed for the purpose of the recalculation that: (i) the costs of free coal
supply would stay 80% higher than estimated at appraisal; and (ii) the benefits from non-mining activities
would stay at half the level assumed at appraisal. Using the same calculation method as at appraisal, the
re-estimated net present value of the project is $21 million and the economic rate of return is 47%.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's Comments
(Unofficial translation)
A. Comments received from Donetsk Oblast Administration
Concerning Section 5.3 which says that since the beginning of the project, the borrower hasn't allocated
its part of expenditures.
In accordance with the Loan Agreement of July 11, 1996, # 4016-UA, the expenditures for social
infrastructure transfer were divided by Category 8 between two parties: the World Bank and the Ministry
of Finance of Ukraine (1700 USD thousands each) during three years, in proportion 75 to 25% till
December 31, 1997; 50 to 50% till December 31, 1998 and 25 to 75% later. According to indicators from
Project Appraisal Document, the above Ministry of Finance's inputs consisted of 283 USD thousands in
1997, 568 USD thousands in 1998 and 849 USD thousands in 1999.
In accordance with Section 3.4 of preliminary Agreement for transferring Grant funds between the Ministry
of Finance of Ukraine and Donetsk Oblast State Administration, financing of expenditures has to be done
with a partial participation of the State budget of Ukraine.
During Coal Pilot Project implementation, Oblast received 422.9 USD thousands equivalent only (or
24.9% of indicated conimitment) from the State budget, including 102 USD thousands in 1997, 320.9
USD thousands in 1998. In 1997-1998, more than 508.4 UAH thousands (236 USD thousands equivalent)
or 19.7 % of total expenditures for transferred social sphere objects maintenance was secured by intemal
Oblast resources (local budgets, enterprises funds etc.). In 1999, State budget funds for covering
expenditures for maintenance of social sphere objects transferred to communal ownership from closing
mnines have not been allocated.
Only after establishing of Grant Agreement #22-04/35 as of December 15, 1999, financing from the State
budget was not presumed, but provided through Oblast's funds. At this part, Oblast fulfilled all the
requirements. In 1999-2000, Oblast paid 11.742 USD millions, including for pre-school enterprises -
0.079 USD mln., houses of culture - 0.037 USD mln., housing - 3.681 USD mln., heating - 7.945 USD
niln. (allocations provided to communal enterprises, where housing & conmnunal objects were transferred).

Program Team is developed at a high professional level and reflects all evaluation issues of cooperation
between the Bank and the Borrower in implementation of the above Project.
