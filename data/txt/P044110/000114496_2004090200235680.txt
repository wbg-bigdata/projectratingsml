(c)
the term “Authorized Allocation” means: (i) an amount equivalent to 
$500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special Account A 
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank

pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the 
equivalent of $3,000,000; and (ii) an amount equivalent to $200,000 to be withdrawn

2.
Payments out of the respective Special Account shall be made exclusively for

3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the respective

subsequent withdrawals to replenish the respective Special Account shall be made as 
follows:
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower, or its 
designated representatives, as provided in Section 2.08 of this Agreement, shall 
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not 
exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request 
or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit in the respective Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower 
shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the respective Special Account, the Borrower 
shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the 
respective Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is 
requested.  On the basis of each such request,

the Borrower,  withdraw from the Loan 
Account and deposit into the respective 
Special Account such 
amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall 
have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the respective Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the

withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in

reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Accounts;
(c)

intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Page  19
Conditions; or

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories for the Project, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment 
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with 
respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories for the Project shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the respective Special Account 
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures.
6. 
(a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of either 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective 
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special 
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in any Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.
(d)
Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal  or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
