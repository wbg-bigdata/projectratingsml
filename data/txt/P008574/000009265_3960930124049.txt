MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE POLISH POST, TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH ENTERPRISE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Polish Post, Telephone and Telegraph Enterprise (PPTT) with the Guarantee
of the Republic of Poland for US$120 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with a 17-year
maturity and would help finance a first telecommunications project.
2.          Background:  For most of the post-war period, Telecommunications
(TC) has been accorded a low priority by the Government of Poland (GOP). A
Bank mission in 1986 (WB Report No. 6736-POL) concluded that, due to many
years of relative neglect, Poland's TC system is now one of the worst in
Europe and constitutes a serious impediment to overall development. In 1987
the GOP came to the conclusion that a significant effort must be made to
rehabilitate the sector. Following this, the Ministry was reorganized, new
personnel were installed at senior levels of the PPTT, regulatory
responsibility was separated from operational activity, and commitment was
made to increase the priority and level of investment in the sector. At the
same time, the 1P indicated that it would be interested in Bank involvement
in the sector.
3.          Following the appointment of a new government and agreement with
the IMF in late 1989 on a macroeconomic framework, a program of concrete,
quickly executable investments was identified for Bank support. These were
chosen with the goal of addressing the most urgent needs, breaking key
bottlenecks and facilitating supply response to overall reforms.
Strengthening the TC network was included in this package. The first Telecom
project is designed as a relatively limited, quickly executable, maximum
impact project within the Bank's strategic framework of rapid effective
assistance. The first project is linked to broader preparations for a more
comprehensive program of rehabilitation, modernization. and expansion of the
TC system which will form the basis for a project currently scheduled for
FY93. The first project would include important first steps in policy and
institutional reform, to be supplemented by more basic reforms in these areas
in the context of a second TC loan.
4.          Bank missions identified two important constraints in the PPTT
which would inhibit effective execution of the project: (a) serious weakness
of the financial departments of the PPTT; and (b) lack of an office or
department in the central PPTT with the power and mandate to coordinate
execution of the project and its main component -- the nationwide digital
overlay network. To address these constraints, the Bank requested that the
PPTT: (a) appoint a chief financial officer with the competence and mandate to
coordinate financial activities in the PPTT; and (b) create a special Project
Implementation Office with the competence and mandate to ensure coordinated,



efficient and effective execution of the project. Both requests have been
implemented.
5.          Rationale for Bank involvement:  The Bank is committed to
supporting Poland's overall restructuring and reform efforts which aim to
increase flexibility, decentralization, market mechanisms and export
orientation. These goals all require improved communications. Thus, support
for TC improvement is an important cornerstone of support for economic reform.
Other sources of support, such as suppliers credits or bilateral finance,
while sometimes available, have limitations: e.g. they usually do not cover
certain types of equipment and they are often unable to provide comparable
support for institutional and policy reforms. In addition, the Bank's
presence and procurement rules can help ensure more economic decisions on
equipment purchases.
6.          Proiect Objectives:  The project would emphasize and support:
(i) strengthening and expansion of the national trunk network and selected
improvements in the international network and in local networks in order to
rapidly decongest the network and improve TC services for business,
(especially export-related business); (ii) increased efficiency in TC
operations; and (iii) improved quality of service.
7.          Prolect Descri2tion:  The project would consist of:
(i) investments in an overlay digital long-distance network connecting 17
major urban nodes plus expansion of international connections and selected
investment in local networks; and (ii) technical assistance and training. The
latter would focus on improving the accounting and HIS systems, traffic
engineering, software development and maintenance, human resource development
and training.
8.          The project cost is estimated to total US$378.7 million, of which
US$210 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$120
million equivalent would meet 571 of the foreign exchange requirements of the
project. A parallel loan of US$90 million by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) will meet the additional 431. Local costs will be met by the PPTT.
9.          Procurement of US$108.5 million (90.41) of the equipment purchased
with the Bank loan and of all EIB-financed equipment will be under ICB.
International shopping will be used for packages with an estimated value below
US$250,000 and not exceeding US$11.5 million in aggregate.
10.         Disbursements would be made against full documentation, except for
contracts not exceeding US$150,000 for which Statement of Expenditures
procedures would be used. To facilitate access to loan proceeds, a Special
Account will be established covering four months of average annual
expenditures, equivalent to DX 6 million. The loan closing date is June 30,
1996. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
The procurement methods and disbursements schedule are in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the Status of Bank Group
operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff

Appraisal Report No. 9272-POL, dated March 1, 1991, and a Map (IBRD 22862-
POLAND) are also attached.
11.         Actions Agreed:  The following agreements were reached at
negotiations:
(a) tariff to be increased to raise the weighted average of the
tariff by (i) inflation since Kay 1, 1990; (ii) 50 of the
expected average price level increase for the quarter In
which the date of effectiveness occurs; and (iii) a real
increase of 30X. This would be a condition of effectiveness.
(b) achievement of an operating ratio including profit tax of not
less than 80X in 1992 and 752 for 1993 and onwards with
quarterly tariff increases in line with inflation adjusted by
cost savings;
(c) separation of non-telecom activities from telecom operations
(TCO) of the PPTT to create an independent telecom division
by the end of 1991 and a separate joint stock company by
June 30, 1992;
(d) an action plan covering:
Mi) 2erformance targets: setting, monitoring, and reviewing
performance targets covering network development,
efficiency, and quality of service. Indicative targets
were agreed for the next three years. Actual
performance will be monitored by the TCO and reported to
the Bank semi-annually. Once a year actual performance
will be compared to targeted performance and discussed
with the Bank. Measures to address any shortfalls will
be agreed and targets for the following three years will
be adjusted to reflect increased information, actual
performance and agreed measures;
(ii) separation of telecom accounts: initial separation of
telecom accounts commenced during project preparation.
This will be expanded by establishing separate
accounting units for the telecom operations (TCO) in
1991; and the accounts of the TCO will be maintained
separately. Separate bank accounts will be maintained
from January 1, 1992. In support of this activity
consulting services will be engaged by July 1, 1991 to
undertake a diagnostic study of accounting and
information systems and make proposals for the phased
development of the system and staff training over the
next six years and to assist in the implementation of
Phase I of the proposed program.



1' .
(iii) technical assistance to the TCO for: (a) traffic
engineering to maximize usage of the existing network;
(b) creation of in-house software development and
maintenance capacity which will be critical to
successful introduction and integration of digital
systems into the network; (c) development of a network
design and digitalization strategy for building on the
digital overlay network and extending modern facilities
into the rest of the main network; and (4) development
of a strategy for recruiting, training, developing and
utilizing human resources;
(iv) technical assistance to the GOP for defining and
developing a regulatory framework for managing the
evolving telecom sector--in which the TCO will be an
independent, self-financing and commercially oriented
company and in which other operators will have a growing
roles;
(v) support for the Special Project Office; and
(vi) a study of tariff levels, structure and institutional
mechanisms for monitoring, analyzing and adjusting
tariffs.
12.         Project Benefits:  The proposed project would help to rapidly
improve the quantity and quality of TC services to key selected sectors of the
economy (primarily business and especially export-oriented business). By
facilitating the improved performance of these sectors, it would benefit
substantially the economy. Economic benefits would come from (i) direct
increase in the financial performance and profitability of PPTT; (ii) improved
access to, and quality of, service for all sectors of business--especially
small and medium private and co-operative firms; (iii) introduction of new
services. The financial rate of return is expected to be high, (i.e. over
27X) with an even higher economic rate of return.
13.         Risks:  The principal risks relate to: (i)  organizational and
political instability at senior levels of the sector; (ii) weak financial
management and consequent deterioration in the PPTT's financial soundness. A
third risk, CoCom restrictions on the export of high technology telecoms
equipment from Western countries to East European countries were significantly
relaxed over the summer of 1990 and are (although delays may still occur)
unlikely to be a serious impediment for the types of equipment involved in the
project.
14.         The first and second risks are related:  instability and political
turmoil in the leadership of the sector would hinder PPTT's ability to execute
the project efficiently and in a timely manner and restrict its ability to
take strong control of its costs and revenues. This danger is exacerbated by
the confusion which reigns among other potential telecom operators, Telecom
users, and the PPTT in the absence of a new Telecom law. Continued attention



by the GOP vill be necessary to ensure strong stable leadership of the sector
and, to the extent possible, to insulate its technical and finar.._ial
operations from daily political influence.
15.         Recommen&tLos. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
