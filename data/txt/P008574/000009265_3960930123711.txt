STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:                The Polish Post, Telephone and Telegraph
Guarantor:               The Republic of Poland
Amount:                  $120 million equivalent
Terms                    Seventeen years maturity including five years of grace
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:      The project would support: (i) strengthening and
expansion of the national trunk network, selected
improvements in and decongestion of the international,
long distance and local networks in order to rapidly
improve TC services for business, (especially export-
related business); (ii) increased efficiency in TC
operations; and (iii) improved quality of service.
Project Description:    The project has been relatively narrowly focused in
order to speed processing and execution and maximize
short term relief of the severely congested
telecommunications system. It would form a part of
the PPTT's investment program for 1991-93 and would
consist of two main elements: (i) construction of a
digital long-distance overlay network together witb
expansion of international capacity and local networks
sufficient to connect subscribers to these new
facilities; and (ii) technical assistance for measures
to improve management, efficiency and financial
performance of the PPTT and the regulatory capacity
and expertise of the Ministry of Telecommunications.
Project Benefits:        The proposed project would help to rapidly improve the
quantity and quality of telecommunications services to
key selected sectors of the economy. High volume



- ii -
subscribers (primarily business--especially export-
oriented business) would be the major direct
beneficiaries from access to modern, digital
communications. By facilitating the improved
performance of these sectors, the project would
benefit substantially all sectors of the economy. In
addition, all subscribers would benefit from
decongestion of the long-distance network.
Project Risks:           The principal risks relate to: (i) organizational and
political instability in the sector. Continued
turmoil in sector leadership could hinder PPTT's
ability to execute the project in an efficient and
timely manner. To reduce this risk the project will
focus on strengthening the project execution
capabilities of the PPTT through selective
reorganization and technical assistance;
(ii) financial strength of the PPTT. In addition to
the normal financial covenants, to ensure sound
performance (internal cash generation and debt
coverage) a number of measures to strengthen financial
management of the PPTT will be included in the project
(e.g., creation of a strong financial department and a
strategic planning department, both reporting to the
Director General, tariff studies leading to tariff
reform and rebalancing, design and initial
implementation of a commercial accounting system and
related MIS); (iii) a third, but rapidly diminishing
risk, concerns COCOM restrictions on export. Recent
high-level decisions by COCOM point to significant
relaxation of restrictions on the export of high
technology telecommunications equipment from Western
countries to Eastern Europe. Thus, these restrictions
are now unlikely to pose a major risk although delays
in procuring export licenses and non-essential re-
specification of some equipment to accommodate COCOM
rules, remain a possibility.

POLAND
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        For most of the post-war period, telecommunications (TC) has been
accorded a low priority by the Government of Poland (GOP). A Bank mission in
1986 (WB Report No. 6736-POL) concluded that, due to many years of relative
neglect, Poland's TC system is now one of the worst in Europe and constitutes
a serious impediment to overall development. In 1987 the GOP came to the
conclusion that a significant effort must be made to rehabilitate the sector.
As a first step, the Ministry was reorganized, new senior personnel were
installed at the Polish Post, Telephone and Telegraph (PPTT), regulatory
responsibility was separated from operational activity, and commitment was
made to increase the level of priority and investment in the sector. At the
same time the GOP indicated that it would be interested in Bank involvement in
the sector. In July, 1989 a Bank mission visited Poland to assess the
prospects for Bank involvement in TC development.
1.02        Following installation of the new Government and satisfactory
understandings with the IMF on a macroeconomic framework, a program consisting
of concrete, quickly executable investments was formulated. These investments
are designed to address the most urgent needs, relieve key bottlenacks and
facilitate a maximum supply response to overall reforms. Strengthening
certain aspects of the TC network was included in this package. The proposed
first telecommunications project is directed at urgent, quickly attainable
goals in keeping with the philosophy of the initial Bank program.
Simultaneously, however, preparations for a more comprehensive program of
rehabilitation, modernization, and expansion will be undertaken. These
preparations will begin with a sector survey and will form the basis for a
second World Bank telecommunications project. The initial project would take
important first steps toward policy and institutional reform and would lay the
groundwork for a broader sector-oriented loan one and a half years hence.
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
2.01        The Polish TC sector consists of four main parts: (i) the TC
network operators and service providers, of which by far the most important is
the telecommunications operations (TCO) of the Polska Poszta, Telegraf i
Telefon (PPTT); (ii) the telecommunications manufacturing industry (TCMI);
(iii) the users of telecommunications services; and (iv) the (Government)
regulatory regime.
A. Network ODerators
Legal Status
2.02        The Communications Law of 1984 (Ustawa o Lacznosci) gives monopoly
over telecommunications, poztal services and the technical component of
broadcasting to the PPTT. (Programming and content of broadcasting are



- 2 -
subject to the Radio and Television Committee.) Ministerial direction of the
PPTT has c..anged several times in recent years. Until 1987 it was part of the
Ministry of Communication which also controlled the telecom manufacturing
industry. In 1987 the manufacturing industry was transferred to the Ministry
of Industry. Short. thereafter the Communications Ministry was folded into
the newly organized Ministry of Transport, Communications and Navigation. On
January 1, 1990 it was separated from the other sectors and is now, once
again, a stand-alone Ministry of Communications.
2.03        The PPTT is a state enterprise directly responsible to the
Ministry of Communications. In principle, the Ministry is responsible for
regulatory activities (e.g., management of the radio spectrum) and for setting
broad national communications policy while the PPTT is responsible for
operating post and telecommunications networks and service. In practice, the
lines of responsibility are not yet fully clarified. This has been due in
part to the absence of a new Communications Law defining these and related
matters. This law became effective on January 16, 1991. Under it: (i) PPTT
will lose its total monopoly over TC; (ii) the Ministry of Communications will
be empowered to grant licenses to other service providers, (excluding
international switched service) subject to certain conditions; (iii)
regulatory responsibility (e.g. interconnection, tariffs, spectrum management,
standardization, etc.) would be vested in the Ministry.
2.04        In addition to the PPTT, a number of specialized networks are
operated by various bodies under various concessions: e.g., the railroads,
power and pipeline networks, police and military. Currently these do not
provide service beyond their own needs. However, the new TC law does provide
a potential framework for these entities to offer service outside their own
circle. In addition, other specialized networks are already being planned
(e.g., for the banks and for large businesses in Gdansk) which could be
licensed to offer service to general or selected markets.
Exi.sting Facilities and Access to Service
2.05        Local.  At the end of 1989 there were 3.1 million direct exchange
lines (DELs) in operation (Annex 1), giving a density of 8.23 per 100
population. This is the lowest penetration in Europe except for Albania.
Furthermore, the distribution is highly uneven with penetration averaging 12.2
in urban areas and only 2.4 in rural areas. There are 6,200 local exchanges
with a capacity of 3.4 million lines of which 346,000 are in rural areas.
This gives a fill ratio of 90.4%, which is above optimum. Although a
relatively high percentage of capacity is automatic (90%), a large proportion
of the automatic exchange capacity is obsolete: 51% of automatic exchanges
are pre-WWII Strowger, 43% are crossbar, and only 7% are electronic- -and these
are obsolete first-generation vintage). Further, much of the capacity is worn
out and unreliable. Transmission is predominantly analogue on conventional
and coaxial cable. A small amount of digital local transmission (2 and 8
Mb/s: 30 and 120 channels) on coaxial cable and locally manufactured optical
fibre has been implemented; 480 channel systems are just beginning to be
introduced.



2.06        There are 2.3 million pot:ential subscribers on the waiting list -
an average of 15 years waiting time at tne average annual hook-up rate during
the 1986-90 period. In fact, the nrumber of potential subscribers is at least
50% larger because many people are diseouraged from signing up on the official
waiting list.
2.07        Long-iistance.  The automatic long-distance network is comprised
of three subnetworks divided into two distinct groups whLich are not fully
integrated: (i) a subnetwork E sed on 1,000 point-to-point trunks with no
direct access to cities not on the system; (ii) automatic trunk networks
providing conventional switched access and (iii) the manual long-distance
network with 304 manual exchanges. The automatic systems, which have a total
of 17,000 trunks connecting 12 transit exchanges cover 20% of the Poland's
territory and 30% of its LD traffic. Most automatic exchanges are Strowger,
with a few Pentaconta crossbar and two E-lOa electronic exchanges.
Transmission is virtually all analogue on coaxial cable (960 and 1,800
channels) and Microwave radio (960, 1,800 and 2,700 channels).
2.08        International.  International traffic is handled by two systems,
both in Warsaw: (i) an E-10 electronic exchange with a total capacity of
1,500 trunks. Direct outgoing connections are made to 23 European countries
and two non-European countries. Incoming direct connections have about twice
as many channels as outgoing and include two more from European countries and
4 from non-European countries; (ii) the second system is a manual crossbar
exchange. Both systems are thoroughly overloaded.
2.09        A new international exchange in Warsaw, built by AT&T with a
capacity of 3,500 trunks is being installed and is scheduled to go into
service in-mid 1991. In addition, a new optical fibre submarine connection to
Denmark and its ex,..ension, via microwave, to Warsaw is nearly completed and
will go into service by early 1991.
2.10        Telex/telearaph/djta.  The telex system is fully automatic with a
total capacity of 50,500 lit..s of which 35,950 are connected. Exchanges are
full in 9 voivodships where approximately 1,800 subscribers are awaiting
connection. International telex is handled by an electronic Siemens exchange
and all countries can be reached. The telegraph network consists of 2,700
teletype machines connected automatically situated in about 1,000 post
offices. In the absence of adequate telephone and telex capacity, telegraph
remains popular, especially in rural areas. However, lack of sufficient
automatic retransmission equipment lowers quality of service. A few thousand
FAX machines are estimated to be currently in service, using the existing
telephone network. Specialized data communications services are rudimentary
with some 1200 data subscribers.
2.11        Mobile communications.  There is an experimental paging system and
traditional mobile radio facilities for police, emergency services, etc.
Active competition for expected cellular licenses is underway, initially in
the 450 Mhz analogue band.



-4-
Usage and Quality of Service
2.12        The Polish TC network is inadequate, unbalanced, obsolete and much
of it is worn out. In the past, inadequate overall investment was
disproportionately allocated to connecting new lines to the detriment of
maintenance and replacement of existing equipment and of proper balance
between subscriber equipment, local ar.d long-distance network, and
infrastructure. This is reflected in the poor traffic handling capability of
the network, intense congestion, and poor quality of service. Call completion
r?tes average 38% for long-distance, and 40% for local but can fall to 10% in
some urban areas at high traffic periods. Incoming automatic international
calls exhibit a completion rate of 20%. No automatic outgoing circuits exist
to the USA, a major correspondent, and booked calls to the USA average more
than three hours to go through. The number of faults per 100 DELs per month
average 8.0 and some 30 percent of faults are cleared within 24 hours.
B. The Telecommunications Manufacturing Industry
2.13        The Polish TCMI is a major, full-line TC manufacturing sector.  In
the past it provided approximately 90% of the TC equipment used in Poland as
well as exporting a substantial amount--primarily to the USSR. The major
manufacturers are listed Table 2.1.

2.14        Apart from the cable and power equipment all the
manufacturers desperately need to modarnize. Now that COCOM relaxation
permits import of digital eauipment, PPTT has targeted 1994 as the last date
for purchase of analog equipment for anything except spare parts and most
other CMEA countries are making similar plans. In this environment the Polish
TCMI's current lines of production are no longer viable.
2.15        All manufacturers are actively seeking foreign partners and some,
e.g. ZWUT, TELETRA, have chosen partners, set up joint ventures or signed
letters of intent to that effect. Full implementation of these plans is still
some way off, however, and their ultimate success in providing sufficient
equipment of the required standard on time and at competitive prices is not
yet assured. Even if they are fully successful, the import content in final
purchases by the PPTT will inevitably rise from the low lOX of equipment
purchases experienced in the past to something like 40X - 50X in the short-
run and 24% to 35% in the long-run. If the PTMI experiences delays or other
difficulties, PPTT's import bill will be higher.

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
Overview
3.01        The Polish reform program calls for decentralization, flexibility,
reliance on market signals and increased exports.  Such a reform depends
fundamentally on rapid processing and trar.smission of information. The
modernization of the information transmission and processing infrastructure is
indispensable for the success of the economic reform program. Central to this
is a modern, efficient telecommunications system. In contrast, the current TC
system is severely underdeveloped and constitutes a serious impediment to
economic development and reform. Losses to the economy from inadequate TC
surpass the amount of investment in the TC in a given year by several
multiples. These losses affect domestic income in general, and specifically
exports, to convertible currency markets in which rapid access to suppliers,
buyers, and world information via electronic means is crucial for success.
Furthermore, in the coming years, the growth of new business activity,
catalyzed by the revolutionary changes in economic and political environment,
foreign investment etc. will stimulate a significant increase in demand for
business related TC services, adding to the existing problem of high and
unsatisfied demand for TC services.
3.02        In 1988/89 the GOP, recognizing the importance of
telecommunications to economic development, decided to give it a higher
strategic priority and place it under a separate ministry. This was
accomplished in January 1990; at the same time a more decentralized
organization was introduced in the PPTT.
The Bank's Strategy
3.03        The Bank's sector strategy has a two pronged approach:  (i)
structural reform of the telecommunications operations (TCO) within the PPTT
to make them more efficient, market-driven, cost conscious and service-
oriented; and (ii) investment in upgrading and expanding the TC network.
3.04        Structural Reform.  The Bank has consistently urged in Poland a TC
policy consisting of:
(i)      At the enterDrise/network level:
(a)   strengthening the management and operations of the TCO of
the PPTT to make them more efficient, familiar with modern
electronic technology, and capable of executing faster
development and modernization of the TC system;
(b)   separation of telecom operations from other PPTT activities;
(c)   increased commercialization of TCO; and



- 7 -
(d)   self-financing of TC investment on
commercial terms.
(ii)      At the Regulatory/Government level:
(a)   implementation of the separation of operations from
regulatory/policy functions;
(b)   gradual and orderly introduction of competition from
alternative suppliers and service providers; and
(c)   definition and implementation of a consistent regulatory
regime.
During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and PPTT on a
program addressing the above issues.
3.05        Investment in Telecommunications Network and Services.  During
1989 PPTT developed a long-term development plan aiming at a telephone
penetration of around 30/100 inhabitants in the year 2000 (see Annex 3). This
requires installation of 11.3 million DELs and some 12 million lines of
capacity. These long-term goals are in line with normal relationships between
demand for TC services and economic development. However, they did not
involve a full analysis of the sources of financing or the institutional
capacity for executing the proposed expansion.
3.06        A 5-year plan for the period 1991-95 was also prepared with more
detail. This 5-year plan aims at an addition of 3.4 million exchange lines of
capacity: of which some 2 million would be used for connection of new DELs
and about 1 million would be for replacement.
3.07        The 5-year plan was prepared under the traditional assumption that
the State would support and, if necessary, finance the implied development and
that the iomestic industry would deliver the required equipment. However, the
situation has changed dramatically in the last year and the underlying
assumptions of the existing 5-year plan for TC--regarding both financial
support from GOP and domestic supply of equipment--are very much in question.
3.08        Both the proposed 10-Year Plan and the 5-Year Plan are ambitious.
The Bank has not conducted a full appraisal of these overall programs. This
will be done in the context of the Sector Survey and the Second
Telecommunication Project. However, in order not to halt or inhibit ongoing
development, the GOP and PPTT, in consultation with Bank staff, have developed
a realistic "Urgent Priority Plan" for the period 1991-93. The main objective
of this Plan is to decongest the key components of the network (international
and long-distance) and to provide urgently needed service to major large
volume and business customers--in the shortest possible time. A keystone of
this emergency plan is the construction of an overlay digital long-distance
network which forms the core and bulk of the Bank project. Simultaneously the
PPTT would attempt to connect some 900,000 new DELs.



-8.
3.09        The Bank's overall sector strategy will be more fully elaborated
and specified in the course of the forthc'%ming planned Sector Survey and
eventually incorporated in the Second Telecom Project. In the meantime, the
first urgent priority project will be supportel   limited, concrete and
achievable goals in the following areas:
(a)   decongestion of the network by building an overlay digital network
for long-distance and international services and to serve large
users and the business community;
(b)   improved utilization of the existing network, and emphasis on
serving the business community;
(c)   initiation of the digitalization process (especially
improved planning for digitalization and development
of software adaptation and maintenance capacity);
(d)   initiation of modern financial, accounting and management
information systems;
(e)   financial self-sufficiency for the TCO;
(f)   improvement in procurement and related procedures; and
(g)   initiation of a human resource development strategy and programs.
B. PPTT Development Plans
3.10        The urgent high priority nature of the priority project and the
time constraints of the PPTT on its preparation have precluded full appraisal
of the entire investment program. However, economic and financial viability
of the Bank project does not depend upon full implementation of the remainder
of the PPTT's entire TC program. The Bank project has been appraised and is
justified on a "stand alone" basis, but full exploitation of the project's
potential benefits will certainly be enhanced if the PPTT's overall TC program
is successfully implemented on time.
3.11        The main features of the PPTT's overall TC investment program for
1991-1993 (in addition to the Bank Project) are given below. However, the
full financial and technical analysis of this program has not yet been
undertaken; thus, both the substance and the magnitude of the investments
outside the Bank project are subject to change.
(a)   provision and installation of 1,731,000 lines of switching
capacity, associated local network and subscriber plant (of which
436,000 would be for replacement). During the 1991-93 project
period it is anticipated that some 900,000 new subscribers will be
connected. For replacement 436,000 lines will be used. Of the
new subscribers about 100,000 would be high traffic volume
business customers. An additional 60,000 high traffic volume



-9-
business subscribers are expected to be connected directly to the
digital overlay network.
(b)   provision of 8 digital tandem exchanges with 14,000 trunks for the
Warsaw multi-exchange local network with associated fiber optic
transmission capabilities.
(c)   other network components, i.e.:
(i)   Installation of an international exchange with 1500 trunks
in Katowice and expansion of the Warsaw International
exchange with 3,500 trunks;
(ii) Installation of automatic toll exchanges: (a) with 9,390
trunk (Katowice) and (b) 4,500 trunk and 150 operator
positions elsewhere in the country;
(iii) Installation of some 1,800 Km Interurban F0 cables;
(iv) Completion of some 900 Km coax cable lines;
(v)   Installation of telex exchanges in Warsaw (12,000 lines)
Gdansk and Katovice (12,000 lines) and inland (26,000
lines);
(vi) Digitalization of the Intelsat station; and
(vii) Installation of a packet switching network with 3,000
circuit terminations.
C. Proiect Description
3.12        The Bank's Project consists of a subset of the overall investment
program comprised primarily of a national digital long-distance network
(described in para 3.13), plus institutional strengthening measures and
technical assistance. The principal components of the Project are:
(a)   the Rhysical investment prozram consisting of construction of an
overlay digital long-distance network, expansion of international
communications capability, and decongestion of the Warsaw and
Katowice multi-exchange local networks, connecting at the same
time the majority of high traffic business subscribers to these
new digital facilities. This will have the combined effect of
relieving the most congested portion of the network -- thus
improving service for all subscribers -- and of providing high
quality "business class" international and nationwide TC services
to the critical business sector in the shortest possible time;
(b)   institutional strengthening of PPTT designed to: (i) improve
PPTT's overall TC efficiency; (ii) increase commercialization of



- 10 -
TC activity and reorganization of PPTT's financial complex; (iii)
design and implement a master plan for human resources management
and development; and
(c)   technical assistance to support the institutional strengthening
objectives and a special project implementation office,
The Investment Program
3.13        The investment program of the Bank Project comprises:
(a)   an overlay digital long-distance network consisting of:
(i)   12 trunk exchanges with some 106,500 ports, and 360
operator positions;
(ii)  10 of the 12 trunk exchanges will have local exchange
capability to connect 71,000 business subscribers and
associated local network. (During the project period,
60,000 new business class subscribers are expected to be
connected);
(iii) 16 microwave routes with 39 radio channels (140 MB/s)
including digital to analog transmultiplexers;
(iv)  1000 km of optical fiber cables and multiplex (140 MB/s);
(v)   network control center (first phase).
(b)   expansion of the international network with:
(i)   EUTELSAT ground station;
(ii) five microwave routes with 11 radio channels.
Institutional Strengthening
3.14        The institutional strengthening program will consist of a time-
bound action plan covering four topics:
(a)   measures to increase efficiency and productivity of PPTT's TC
sector through separation of the TCO by the end of 1991 from other
activities (post, broadcasting), establishment of a separate TCO
joint stock company by the end of 1992, commercialization of TC
operations and strengthened capacity for strategic corporate
planning. Initiation of incentive structures, HIS, and
appropriate organization directed toward greater: (i) customer and
service orientation; (ii) cost and efficiency consciousness; and
(iii) responsiveness to market signals.



- 11 -
(b)   reorganization of the financial functions of the PPTT aiming at
commercialization of TC operations, design and introduction of a
commercial accounting system as a management tool, financial
planning and engineering;
(c)   design and initiation of a human resources management and
development master plan to support the corporate objectives of the
TC organization. The master plan should be the vehicle for
organizational changes aiming to support the huge development,
technological changes and commercial orientation; and
(d)   strengthening of the regulatory expertise of the Ministry of
Telecommunication.
During negotiations agreement was reached with PPTT on a program for: (i)
separating its non-telecom activities from the TCO and creating a separate
division for each by the end of 1991; (ii) transferring by June 30, 1992 its
non-telecom activities to a separate entity; and, (iii) reconstituting itself
as a joint stock company exclusively for TCO.
Technical Assistance
3.15        The technical assistance (TA) component of the proposed project is
aimed at: (a) supporting the execution of the physical investment; and,
(b) the institutional improvements. The main elements would be foreign
consulting services and training in the following areas:
(a)   TA for Special Project Implementation Office (SPO):
(1)   The SPO will be organized under the direct control of the
Director General of the PPTT, staffed with 10 - 12 high
level Polish experts, to coordinate, supervise and interface
with foreign suppliers in the process of the construction of
the digital overlay network. SPO will also incorporate the
PPTT's existing World Bank unit. The SPO would be
responsible for the preparation of bids, selection of
suppliers, technical assistance and training, and
integration (including operation and maintenance
organization) of the new network in the existing one.
(2)   To support the SPO, 5 manmonth consulting will be provided
immediately (by the EIB) for the preparation of the bidding
documents for the overlay network. An additional 60
manmonths of foreign expert support will be provided under
the World Bank loan in order to support PPTT's interaction
with the foreign suppliers.
(b)   TA for institutional strengthening, the main components of which
will be:



- 12 -
(1)   Technical
* - development and introduction of a strategy for
digitalization of the network;
- design and development of a preliminary traffic matrix as a
prerequisite for technical and economical optimization of the
network design and development;
- assistance in other new technology subjects (such as software
center, fiber optic transmission, cellular radio, introduction
of ISDN, etc.);
- development of a strategLc planning unit within the TCO and
technical assistance to this unit.
(2)   FinancialZEconomic
* - design and initiation of a modern, commercial, financial
system;
- design and initiation of MIS for financial accounting and
technical/operational systems;
* - analysis and reform of tariff level, structure and tariff
setting system;
- corporate planning.
(3)   Human Resources Development and Management
K - design and implementation of a HRM&D Master Plan;
* management training/commercial training;
- reform of organizational structure of TC operations.
(4)   Regulatory
* - development of the regulatory unit of the TC ministry:
* - definition of structure, functions and responsibilities;
* - design of systems and routines; and
* - training of expert personnel.
While agreement was reached with PPTT on the scope and content of TA, the
division and financing of different parts is under consideration. The EC has
expressed interest in financing a portion of this assistance. In any event,
the Bank will oversee those items which are indicated by asterisks (*) above.
While for all the subjects financing is secured from the Bank loan, the
understanding with PPTT and GOP is that if financing is available from other
resources (EC, etc.), the Bank funds will not be used for that particular
assistance but would be reallocated to the investment program. In any event,
the World Bank office in PPTT will administer the TA component of the loan and



- 13 -
the Bank will be involved in the monitoring of the TA irrespective of the
source of financing.
The volume of technical assistance is estimated at 298 manmonths of foreign
experts and 484 manmonths of training (including study visits abroad) of local
counterpart experts. The total cost is estimated to be $8.1 million foreign
cost and $4.1 million equivalent local cost (not including contingencies). An
overview of the Technical Assistance is given in Annex 6.
The financial and training aspects will be covered under the accounting and
training programs (paras 4.08 and 5.05). During negotiations, the timing of
the balance of the TA was confirmed and the draft TORs agreed.
Cost Estimates
3.16        Total project costs is estimated at Z1 3,598 billion ($378.7
million) with a foreign exchange component of Zl 1,995 billion ($210 million).
These costs are based on estimated late 1990 prices for equipment services and
civil works. Cost details are given in Annex 7 and summarized below.

Least Cost Solution
3.17        The timing and dimensions of various elements in the system are
based on generally accepted engineering practice for selection of techniques
and equipment, after study of feasible alternatives, subject to the
international restrictions on export of equipment and technologies. Project
planning of the overlay network is based upon least cost solution
methodologies which are satisfactory. The agreed investment for the project
represents the least cost solution for providing the service level
improvements planned with the constraints imposed by the existing
configuration and technology of the telecommunications network.
Contingencies
3.18        Physical contingencies are based on 4X for local and foreign
equipment, 5% for civil works and 8% for local and foreign services. Price



- 14 -
contingencies are based on annual foreign cost increases of 4% per annum in
1991 and 3% per annum thereafter. Local cost increases are based on 55% in
1991, 25% in 1992, and 10% in 1993.
Financing
3.19        The proposed sources of financing the project are as follows:
Table 3.2: PROJECT FINANCING

3.20        The Project cost estimates and financing arrangement confirmed
during negotiations. Total program cost estimates are in Annex 8.
Procurement
3.21        Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.4.  The Bank
loan would finance $120.0 million of equipment, materials and associated
services, $99.07 million (or 82.6%) of which would be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank's procurement
guidelines. Participation of the Polish suppliers in the bidding is expected
to be limited since equipment and supplies to be procured under the loan are
generally not yet manufactured in Poland. Nevertheless, Polish enterprises
competing under ICB will be eligible for a preference of 15% of the delivery
at frontier (DAF) value of the bids, or the amount of custom duties and taxes,
whichever is lower. International shopping based on price quotations from at
least three suppliers, are from at least two eligible source countries, would
be used for packages with an estimated value below US$150,000, and not
exceeding an aggregate of US$11.5 million. Procurement of goods which are of
proprietary nature, which require standardization with existing equipment or
for which early delivery is crucial for expedited project execution, would be
carried out through direct contracting.
3.22        All bid packages for goods estimated to cost US$1 million
equivalent and above and proposals for letters of invitations for consulting
services would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation. It is estimated that Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation would cover about 82% of the total estimated value of contracts.
The balance of contracts would be subject to the Bank's review of the contract



- 15 -
award. Recent relaxation of COCOM regulations, effective July 1, 1990, will
practically eliminate restrictions on most of the equipment to be purchased
with the Bank loan. Nevertheless, the Bank will continue to review bid
documents prior to issuance for possible residual problems.
3.23          Procurement of equipment financed by EIB would be in accordance
with World Bank regulations which are acceptable to the EIB. Locally produced
goods are contracted according to usual PPTT and telecommunications industry
practice through local competitive bidding, direct purchase and negotiated
prices as appropriate--subject to GOP regulations. Contracts for consultant
services and training being financed by the Bank, totalling US$9.43 million,
would be awarded according to Bank guidelines for use of consultants. During
negotiations, the procurement arrangements were confirmed.

Disbursement
3.24         Disbursement from the proceeds of the proposed loan would be made
for:
(a)   100% of foreign expenditures of directly imported goods and
services and 100% of local ex-factory cost of goods manufactured
in Poland; and
(b)   100% of total expenditures for consultants' services.



- 16 -
Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for expenditures in
respect of contracts valued below $150,000 equivalent, which may be submitted
on the basis of certified statements of expenditure (SOEs). In this case,
supporting documentation would be retained by PPTT for at least one year after
receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the period during which the last
disbursement was made and would be made available to auditors and Bank
supervision missions upon request. In order to facilitate project
implementation, a special account in the amount of $8.0 million equivalent
representing about four months of average would be established and maintained
by the Borrower. The estimated disbursement schedule for the project is shown
in Annex 9. The loan closing date is June 30, 1996.
Project ImRlementation
3.25        PPTT will be responsible for overall project implementation.  PPTT
has sufficient experience in the execution of similar works, albeit in analog
technology. Every voivodship investment organization will be charged with
responsibility to execute their part of the investment, interacting with the
foreign supplier and subject to central co-ordination. The voivodship
organizations would also be responsible for the operation of the system after
implementation is completed. A Special Project Office (SPO) reporting to the
Director General will be responsible for coordination and direct supervision
of works in the 12 locations where the digital interurban exchange. will be
installed. The supplier will be responsible for the installation and
commissioning of the exchanges and training of local staff. In the Special
Project Office a separate group of 10-15 experienced personnel will be engaged
as a Special Implementation Group. This group will be aupported by five man-
years of foreign expertise in order to ensure smooth project implementation.
Suppliers will be contracted for maintenance supervision for one year. During
negotiations the creation of the SPO was confirmed.
3.26        The staff of the existing World Bank unit, incorporated in the
SPO, will coordinate the work of preparation of bid documents, bid evaluation
and contract signature. EIB will support the group with five mantmonths of
foreign expertise for the preparation of technical specifications for digital
switching and optical transmission equipment.
3.27        PPTT has decided to rely more on contractors and complex
subproject deliveries in the implementation of this development program than
it has in the past. An example is the SESA (Spain) contract for the
installation of 8 digital tandem exchanges in Warsaw. The aim is to create
and equip special units in the Directorate General but also in the
voidvodships which will supervise the implementation of such contracts and
their final acceptance. This unit will oe supported with an MIS with an
inbuilt finance and time control function. PPTT plans for more aggressive
development and the elimination of state support will necessitate more
efficient and cost conscious methods to ensure investment efficacy. In any
case, the more complex installations and new technology will require special
assistance and supervision by contractors and suppliers. As the digital
overlay network is an important element of the whole system, one year of
supervision of maintenance will be requested from and contracted for with the

supplier. The proposed implementation schedule for the Project is in
Annex 10.
Performance Indicators
3.28        An Action Plan consisting of:  (a) performance indicators for
monitoring the execution of the project were agreed upon during negotiations
together with targets for each indicator both for the Project and the Program
in each year of the project. Agreement will be reached on: (b) PPTT
monitoring of these indicators and semi-annual reporting to the Bank of actue'
vs. targeted performances; (c) discussions, once a year, between the PPTT, and
the Bank of any shortfalls, reasons for them and remedies; (d) agreement
following this discussion will be reached between the Bank and PPTT on
adjustment of performance targets for the following year(s). Examples of key
performance indicators (see Annex 11 for full list) are:
1990             1993
a)    network develoDment indicators

3.29        During negotiations it was agreed that semi-annual reports to the
Bank will be sent regularly in which PPTT will analyze its performance vis-a-
vis the agreed indicators and will annually reach agreement with the Bank on
talgets, monitoring and any necessary corrective measures for the subsequent
year.
3.30        Tariffs:  The level of tariffs has deteriorated substantially in
real terms over the last two years (para 5.07). Further, the structure of
tariffs is not based on any regular economic analysis linked to either costs
or elasticity of demand. Compared to neighboring countries (Annex 17)
connection charges are relatively high but other principle charges are low.
This is especially so for rental charges which are extremely low in relation
both to demand and the cost of maintaining connections. The project includes
in its Technical Assistance component a tariff study of levels, structure, and
tariff-setting mechanisms (paras 5.11 and 7.02).

IV. THE BORROWER/BENEFICIARY
A. Legal Background
4.01        Polska Poczta Telegraf i Telefon - PPTT - the Polish Post,
Telegraph and Telephone, like the other East European PTT's, was until 1987
directed by a Ministry of Communications which also controlled the
telecommunications manufacturing industry and the related services for
construction, transportation, research and development, and training. In
1987, the responsibility for the industry was transferred to the Ministry of
Industry and the MOC was folded into the newly organized Ministry of
Transport, Communications and Navigation (MTCN). However, the absorption of
communications into the larger MTCN has been deemed unsuccessful and on
January 1, 1990, the new Ministry for Post and Telecommunications (MPT) was
formed. Before and after the structural reform in 1987, the Ministry was
responsible for setting national telecommunications policy and regulatory
activities including radio frequency allocation, pricing and technical
standard setting.
4.02        Immediately after its inception in January 1990, the new MPT began
drafting a new communications law. This was finalized and presented to
Parliament in October 1990. It was enacted by Parliament on December 10,
1990. The salient features of the new law can be summarized as follows: (i)
PPTT will be demonopolized with only international service retained as a state
monopoly. The Minister of Post and Telecommunications will have the power to
license other operators in the various market segments according to specified
criteria (long-distance operators must be Polish controlled but local service
will not be so constrained.); (ii) the TCO will be separated from other PPTT
activities and a new Polish Telecom enterprise, wholly owned by the State,
will be formed as the dominant operator; (iii) the Ministry will retain its
responsibility for regulating the sector including setting of tariffs. The
law is generally in line with the Bank's views on the structure of the sector.
The present organization of the MPT is presented in Annex 11.
B. Organization of PPTT
4.03        The PPTT is a state enterprise, directly subject to the MPT, and
is responsible for operating post and telecommunications networks and
services. The PPTT has a General Directorate and is divided into 49
Directorates. Directorates provide both telecommunications and postal
services and are responsible for the investments on their territories. The
number of Directorates was expanded in 1987 to encourage decentralization and
closer relations with the local municipal and state administrative organs.
However, the experience has not been fully successful and the PPTT plans to
re-consolidate Directorates to the original number, ten in tot&i. In this
report the term telecommunication operations (TCO) is used to refer to the
telecom section of the PPTT until the separation of the telecom and postal
systems on January 1, 1992, and to the telecom enterprise thereafter.



- 19
4.04        Beside the Directorates, PPTT has a number of functional units to
carry out specialized tasks. The more important are:
-     Nine radio communication and teletransmission divisions operate
and maintain the radio and TV transmission network, radio links,
marine radio and intercity teletransmission. The center in Warsaw
offers intercity and international services and ovursees the TV
and radio transmission network.
-     Eleven technical plants provide equipment overhauls and
maintenance, research services, production, supply and maintenance
and expansion of data processing equipment. The Research and
Development Center in Warsaw prepares development programs
including market studies and demand forecast;
-     The satellite communication center at Psary provides international
services and TV transmission;
-     Optotelecommunications Techniques Center in Lublin is responsible
for research and implementation of fiber optic technology,
including small-scale production.
The organization chart of PPTT and the General Directorate are in Annex 13.
4.05        The structural reform in 1987 gave PPTT greater autonomy by
defining PPTT as a self-financing corporate entity. Organizational changes
were instituted within the PPTT aimed at stream'.ining the administration,
strengthen economic links and increase overall efficiency. Despite the
changes PPTT remains relatively inefficient and further institutional
improvements are needed and will be introduced within the TCO structure during
the project period, especially after the separation from the postal system on
January 1, 1992 (para 3.14).
Human Resources Management and Develooment
4.06        With the rapid ongoing and expected changes in the TC sector, PPTT
will have to undergo substantial transformation to respond to the two basic
challenging requirements:
(i)   (a) sustain and improve the operation of the existing network;
(b) expand the network with modern digital technology in order to
better respond to demand for services; and
(ii) implement substantial organizational, operational and management
changes in order to improve the financial viability and
operational efficiency.
These substantial changes must be undertaken in, and are complicated by an
environment undergoing important political, economic and regulatory change.



- 20 -
4.07        Critical to the PPTT's success is a major shift in the way it
manages and develops its human resource base. This, in turn, requires:
(1) development and introduction of a human resources management and
development strategy, and (2) comprehensive training in order to re-orient the
culture and mentality of managers and workers from a government department to
a commercial enterprise. The proposed project will support both.
4.08        During negotiations assurances were obtained to develop by the end
of 1991 and implement during the projeet period, a master plan for human
resources management and development to better motivate and utilize staff.
With the help of foreign expertise PPTT will develop a master plan with the
following major areas:
o    organizational structure (including timetable and process for
reform)
o    manpower and competence planning
o    utilization of skills, knowledge and motivation (incentive
structure, career planning, etc.)
o    training program for technical and administrative staff, utilizing
in-house and external training facilities.
4.09        The Human Resources strategy must support the overall (corporate)
objectives and strategy of PPTT. However, the corporate strategy for PPTT is
not yet clearly defined. Therefore, the formulation of the corporate
objectives, strategies and plans must be a joint exercise with the formulation
of the Human Resources strategy. Both of these processes require knowledge
not available or not ye' utilized in the PPTT. Therefore, an intensive, fast
and comprehensive mat.:gement training program is needed, which is the second
component of the agreeI activity in the project period. The details of the
activities agreed duriag negotiations, are described in Annex 14.
4.10        Mannower anljStaffing.  Since border, between postal and
telecommunications acti6-.ties are not yet well-defined, it is difficult to
give an exact total of i': staff. The new law and its subsequent regulations,
to he applied shortly, wi'l define the division of postal and
telecommunications servic's as well as define the relationship between
nationwide services, reg;otal authority and other value-added services (mobile
telecommunications, data; etc.). Using the 1990 figures (which also include
manual operated exchanges) there appears to be a staff/DEL ratio of around 20
per 1000.  This is high compared with other countries but lower than Eastern
European countries and does not accord with Bank observations.  Probably
statistics are distorted by a combination of Telecommunication, Posts, and
other activities.
4.11        The formal education in Poland, both at university level and
secondary school level, compares favorably with many other Bank
telecommuniication borrowers. Higher management and senior technical staff are
well educated, experienced and dedicated. However, the application of



- 21 -
knowledge in a commercial environment is not well developed. Middle
management is well qualified in conventional technology but lacks experience
in modern technology and in the commercial/economic approach to result-
oriented operations. Manual and technical workers are well qualified in
traditional technology but unfamiliar with new digital, electronic and optical
technologies and lack incentive and motivation for result-oriented work.
4.12        Education/Training.  Two main sources of education and/or training
are available to the PPTT: (a) State-run universities, colleges and secondary
schools, and (b) specialized PPTT schools traditionally run but needed to be
raised to another level of specialization and quality. There are 41 secondary
schools in Poland providing telecommunication training. Students start at the
age of 15 years and the courses last for 5-6 years. There are 25 schools for
switching with about 3500 students, 13 schools for transmission with about
2,000 students, and 1 for data with about 50 students. Presently only a few
hundred students of this group are regularly employed by PPTT. There are 7
universities with somewhat different specialties of which 2 have the main
output related to TC. In total, the universities have an output of a few
hundred graduates per year within the telecommunication field. The major part
is employed by other sectors and about 100 are employed by PPTT.
4.13        Renewed discussions are taking place between the Ministry of
Communications and the Ministry of Education in defining a more general
engineering education in the State-owned system. At the same time the PPTT
training system will be geared to strictly job-oriented training with
specialization required for the new technology.
4.14        Language training is presently a serious bottleneck.  The "young'
generation is well-motivated and will soon catch up with the demand. The more
experienced supervisory and management group will, however, be the main
problem, especially as the concepts in, for example, economic efficiency,
commerce and marketing need a new terminology. Extensive language training is
needed in this group. PPTT is planning to take measures to meet this demand.
Project Related Training
4.15        The coordination of all project-related training under
implementation will be needed. The Human Resource Management function,
besides its regular work, has to involve itself in the following advanced
training needs related to:
o     Specialized Technical (related to the priority World Bank project)
o     Planning and design of adaptation to the new technology
o     Quality concepts and follow up
A consistent and comprehensive system approach is necessary in any management
training program. Due to the many offers to Poland of management training, it
is recommended to try to find a few high quality suppliers of such training
until PPTT can continue with its own resources. These suppliers should be
identified as part of the human resources development master plan (para 4.06).



- 22 -
Salary and Incentives
4.16        The demand for persons with a combination of knowledge in new
technology, language, commercial/market knowledge will be great. The external
private market as well as ministry headquarters and voivodship will compete
for these people. The ui3ency of adaptation to the fast commercial
development will require remuneration for result-oriented behavior. An urgent
administrative adaptation to the evolution will be needed in order to prevent
the dissipation of trained, qualified staff. The HMR&D master plan has to
include these features. The immediate assistance in HRM&D is given in
Annex 13.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General
5.01        The degree to which financial statements of enterprises in Poland
reflect economic realities are, for reasons inherent in the economic system,
limited and uncertain. In recent years, the growth of inflation, without the
adoption of a current cost accounting system, has exacerbated the problem.
Hence, the financial statements do not necessarily reflect the efficiency or
financial position of enterprises and should be interpreted with caution. As
the telecommunication system in Poland operates in a monopolistic market, the
setting of administrative prices has a major effect on the enterprise's
financial results.
B. Accounting. Billing and Collection
5.02        Accounting regulations in Poland are established by the Ministry
of Finance. The basis of the accounting system is a Uniform Chart of Accounts
which all companies must comply with. This Charc was designed primarily to
provide data for economic planning, tax collection and Government statistics.
The PPTT's accounting department produces monthly revenue and cost statements,
semi-annual profit and loss statements and an annual balance sheet covering
both postal and telecommunications services. The accounting system, however,
is of little assistance in providing information either to the Ministry or
management for monitoring and controlling the operations of the enterprises.
5.03        The Chief Accountant, attached to the Director General's Office,
is responsible for the PPTT's accounting system. The actual accounting work
is decentralized to 90 regional units which operate in accordance with
instructions from the Ministry of Finance and the PPTT's Chief Accountant.
The 90 accounting units maintain a general ledger, payroll, stock control
system, fixed asset register, etc., in a variety of forms, including manual
cards, duplicate recording systems, mechanical accounting machines, PC
applications or mainframe computers. Each accounting unit submits monthly,
semi-annual and annual reports to the Chief Accountants Office where the final
accounts for the PPTT are prepared. Budgets for a limited number of revenue
and expenditure items are prepared by the Economic and Market Research Bureau
attached to the Director General's Office. There are substantial delays in



- 23 -
approving the original budgets and in making the necessary revisions. The
budget system is not integrated with the financial accounting.
5.04        The billing for telephone services is undertaken at 34 billing
centers throughout the country. Nine of the centers covering the major
population areas have computerized billing systems and the other 25 centers
operate manual systems. There are variations in the billing systems in
operation in each center and a wide variety of accounting hardware is used.
In the Warsaw Billing Center, telephone bills are issued bimonthly. Customers
are given credit until the 10th of the month following billing. Payment can
be made at any post office or bank. If accounts are not paid by the end of
the month following the month on which they are due, the line is disconnected.
A fine of 8% of amount outstanding plus a reconnection fee of ZL 150,000
(US$15.0) is charged for re-connection. During 1989 about 800 lines (0.2%)
nationwide were disconnected.  Government and Government agencies paid their
accounts by due date. There are no major collection problems.
5.05        The accounting system provides very limited information on the
overall financial performance of postal and telecom operations. The system is
very cumbersome, labor-intensive, prone to errors and not in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Due to high staff turnover at the
Chief Accountants Office in recent years, considerable difficulties are being
experienced in issuing semi-annual and annual accounts. As a result of
decentr&lization of control of accounting, the various accounting and billing
offices have been developing their own systems which is an unsatisfactory and
costly practice. A modern management system is essential to the future
development of the telecommunications system. The first essential step in
this development is the separation of the telecom accounts and finances from
the postal accounts. During the fourth quarter of 1990, PPTT undertook a
pilot project to separate accounts in four regional offices with the
assistance of consultants from the Center for Studies and Development. During
negotiations agreement was confirmed with PPTT that as from January 1, 1991:
(i) separate accounting units were established for the telecom operations
(TCO); and (ii) the accounts, with the exception of bank accounts, of the TCO
will be maintained separately. Separate bank accounts will be established for
TCO not later than January 1, 1992. To develop and operate a satisfactory
management accounting system in the TCO will take from six to eight years and
will require substantial consultancy and training assistance. While this
assistance will form part of the Bank project, it is anticipated that it will
be financed by bilateral and multilateral grant funds available to Poland.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that TCO will engage consultants,
not later than July 1, 1991, to undertake a diagnostic study of the accounting
and data processing systems and make proposals within six months for the
phased development of the systems over the next six years. Draft terms of
reference for the study were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
C. Past Financial Performance
5.06        The financial statements for the telecom operations of PPTT for
the three years 1987 through 1989 are shown in Annex 15, and a summary is



- 24 -
shown in Table 5.1. These figures were extracted from PPTT's consolidated
accounts with the assistance of PPTT's accounting staff. This division of
accounts was based on limited source data and so gives rise to further
reservation on the accounts. In order to reduce the distortions of
hyperinflation during this period the accounts were adjusted to May 1990 price
level using the retail price index as a general price-level index and
International Standard' guidelines. All further references to local currency
in this chapter are to constant May 1990 zlotys unless otherwise stated.

5.07        During the three-year period 1987-89, the number of direct
exchange lines (DELs) increased by about 61 per annum. Telephone revenue in
May 1990 price levels, however, fell by about 11 in 1988 and by about 271 in
1989 compared to 1987. The total revenue from all sources also decreased by
about 29X. This substantial fall in revenue was due mainly to failure to
adjust tariff sufficiently and in a timely manner to cover inflation during
this period of hyperinflation (Table 5.2). During the same two-year period
operating costs in May 1990 price levels decreased by about 101. There were
considerable variations in the changes in various cost components with
salaries and wages representing about 481 of operating cost in 1989 compared
to about 36% in 1987 and depreciation representing 211 in 1989 compared to 231
in 1987. Part of these variances may be due to changes in the classification
of costs introduced during the period. In spite of the very significant fall
in revenue, net income before tax and interest only decreased by about 10 in
1989 compared to 1987 due to the decrease in operating costs, an increase in
non-operating income and inflationary gains on TCO's net monetary liabilities.
The telecom operating ratio in 1987 was 75% but deteriorated to 881 in 1989.

5.08        The telecom cash flow for the three years 1987-89 totalled ZL 2.9
billion in May 1990 price level. This represented about 90X of the telecom
investments for the period of about ZL 3.2 billion. The balance of funds
required of about ZL 0.3 billion was provided by the Grverrnment as grants.
During the same period the telecom operation paid about ZL 2.5 billion to the
Government in profit tax which represents about 60% of the telecom profits
before taxes. Telecom debt service was insignificant as its long-term debt
was very low. The rate of return on average net fixed assets fell from about
16% in 1987 to about 6% in 1989. The absolute level of the rate of return is
of little significance due to the revaluation method used and the fact that a
major part of the fixed assets is obsolete. However, the significant drop in
the rate indicates a deterioration in the financial performance.
5.09        On the face of it, the telecom financial performance in generating
90% of the funds required for investment appears satisfactory. However,
taking into account the grossly inadequate level of service provided, the
obsolete state of its fixed assets and the enormous investment required to
upgrade the system, the telecom past financial performance was poor.
D. Forecast Financial Performance
5.10        With the recent high level of inflation and major political
changes underway in Poland, it is difficult to predict inflation with a
reasonable degree of accuracy during the next few years. All the financial
forecasts have, therefore, been prepared in constant May 1990 Zlotys. This
date was taken as a base point as the current tariffs were implemented on
May 1, 1990. The conversion rate used to convert Zlotys to US Dollars was
9,500.
5.11        The projected financial statements for the TCO for the period
1990-1996 are in Annex 15. For the purpose of making the financial



- 26 -
projections it was assumed that average tariffs will be increased on
January 1, 1991 by the increase in inflation since May 1, 1990 plus a real
increase of 32% and that tariffs would be adjusted periodically to compensate
for inflation after allowing for any increase in productivity. On February 1,
1991, an increase in tariffs of 89% was implemented which is in line with the
assumption. To ensure that tariffs are increased to the proper level by the
commencement of project implementation, during negotiations agreement was
reached that as a condition of effectiveness, the weighted average tariff will
be raised, between May 2, 1990, and the date of effectiveness, sufficiently
to: (a) cover inflation from May 1, 1990 to the end of the previous quarter;
(b) 50% of estimated inflation for the quarter in which the date of
effectiveness occurs; and (c) a real increase of not less than 30%. With the
tariff increase of February 1, 1991, this provision will require that tariffs
be raised to cover inflation from January 1, 1991, to the date of
effectiveness. For the purposes of forecasting a further real increase in
average tariffs of 8% was assumed to be implemented on January 1, 1993 when
some improvements in the telecommunications system are expected to be secured
as a result of the proposed investment program. Further details of the
assumptions used in the financial projections are outlined in Annex 16. In
order to assist the TCO in improving its tariff structure, agreement was
confirmed during negotiations that TCO will engage consultants in accordance
with an agreed timetable to undertake a tariff study.
5.12        Telephone revenue is projected to increase by about 150% to
ZL 10,169 billion (US$1,100 million) during the three years 1991-93 (Annex 15
and Table 5.3). This increased revenue results from a combination of the real
tariff increases, increased connection fees for the digital system, increased
numbers of DELs in operation and an increased rate of call completion.
Revenue from telegrams, telex traffic etc. is projected to remain flat during
the project period as demand for these services should stabilize as the
improved telephone system comes into operation. Operating expenses are
projected to increase by about 30% in real terms during the three year period
ending December 31, 1993. Wages and salaries are projected to increase by
about 13% while the number of DEL are projected to increase by about 24%.
This reflects a substantial increase in labor productivity which is expected
to be achieved. Depreciation charges will increase in 1993 by 66% to ZL 1,900
billion compared to 1990 and by 100% by 1994 when the project works are fully
operational. This increase is due to two factors: an average increase in the
percentage depreciation change from 3.6% to 6.6% to better reflect the
projected life of the assets and the increased level of investment. Net
income before interest and taxes is projected to increase by about 550% to
about ZL 5,500 billion during the project period compared to average net
income of recent years. The operating ratio is projected to improve from 90%
in 1990 to a projected 50% in 1993 and remain at about 55X in future years
without any further increase in tariffs in real terms. After payment of
profit tax at the current level, the 55% operating ratio is equivalent to an
operating ratio including profit tax of about 75%. To ensure that TCO has
sufficient internal cash generation to meet its irvestment requirements,
during negotiations agreement was reached that the TCO will maintain an
operating ratio including profit tax of not more tiuan 80% in 1992 and 75% for
1993 and onwards, and that the tariff will be adjusted on the first day of



- 27 -
each quarter by an amount sufficient to keep pace with inflation adjusted for
increases in productivity already achieved If, in any quarter, tariffs are
increased by more than that required by the above measure, the excess may be
offset against future tariff increases.

5.13        Annual internal cash generation is projected to increase from
about ZL 1,000 billion (US$105 million) in 1990 to ZL 4,800 billion (US$504
million) in 1993 and to gradually increase to ZL 6,900 billion (US$725
million) in 1996 (Annex 15). Debt service is insignificant during the project
period but increases to about 14X of internal cash generation in 1996. Debt
service coverage is 15 times in 1993 and gradually decreases to about 7 times
in 1996. Annual telecom investment is projected to increase from about ZL
1,000 billion (US$105 million) during the last four years to about ZL 6,300
billion (US$660 million) in 1993.
5.14        Net fixed assets invested in telecommunications is projected to
double to about ZL 20,600 billion during the project period 1991-93 (Annex
15). Equity is projected to increase by about 50X to about ZL 16,000 billion
during the same period. As a significant part of future investment will be
financed by loans, the debt equity ratio will rapidly increase from about 1:99
in 1990 to 24:76 in 1993 and about 35:65 in 1996. TCO can easily support this
level as the projected debt service coverage never falls below 6.6 times.
E. Financing Plan
5.15        The proposed Bank loan of US$ 120 million plus the EIB Loan of
US$90.0 million will finance the futll foreign exchange cost of the project of
US$210 million. The local currency cost of US$ 168.7 million equivalent will
be provided from TCO's internal cash generation. As the local currency cost



- 28 -
less price contingencies (Zl 850 billion) represents about 8% of TCO's net
internal cash generation, no problems in securing these funds are anticipated.
Effectiveness of the EIB loan will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
loan.
5.16       A summary of the projected sources and application of funds for
telecoms during the project implementation period 1991-93 is shown below.

5.17       After the payment of debt service the TCO's net internal cash
generation of ZL 10,120 billion (US$1,065 million) is projected to finance
about 70% of telecom investment requirements. The proposed Bank loan of
US$120 dollar equivalent will finance an additional 7% of requirements. The
European Investment Bank (EIB), bilateral funds from the Government of Spain



- 29 -
and other foreign loans and suppliers' credits are expected to provide a
further US$150 million equivalent (ZL 1,423 billion) or 10% of requirements.
This leaves a balance of ZL 1,766 billion (US$186 million) or 12% of
requirements. These funds are expected to be provided by a consortium of
local banks. PPTT has already had discussions on this financing with the
Government and some banks and a loan amount substantially in excess of this
amount has been agreed in principle. In addition, the ongoing discussions on
bilateral and suppliers' credits involve amounts substantially in excess of
the foreign loans of US$150 million equivalent required under the above
financing plan. So, if the country credit situation does not deteriorate no
problems are anticipated in securing the outside financial requirements.
F. Reporting and Audit
5.18        The form and process for the quarterly progress and financial
reports was confirmed at negotiations.
5.19        PPTT telecom and postal services has a Control Bureau attached to
the Director General's office with 70 authorized positions, 50 of which are
currently filled. About 35 of this staff are assigned to 9 district offices.
In addition, each of the accounting units have Central Bureaus which employ a
total of about 550 staff. The major part of the central bureau's work covers
the postal service and appears to be part of PPTT's internal control rather
than internal audit. Annual external audits are performed by auditors from
the Ministry of Finance. The auditors are selected by PPTT from a list
provided by the Ministry. These auditors hold audit qualification issued by
the Ministry of Finance and are full time employees of other companies who are
released to undertake the audit assignment. The terms of reference for
auditors require them "to verify all entries in the balance sheet based on
evidence and documentation to ensure that the entry is in accordance with
Polish law". The auditor is also required to verify that the amounts due to
the Government's budget are correct. The principal objective of this audit is
to ensure that all taxes due to the Government are paid. It, therefore, does
not have the depth and scope of a generally accepted audit designed to secure
an objective evaluation of the results of the enterprise. The Government
should require such audits, especially for enterprises the size of PPTT -
particularly regarding integrity of accounts, and for evaluating enterprise
performance under proposed restructuring programs. In addition, the auditors
as individuals do not have the independence, unity of command, and public
liability implied in a audit context. However, the audit procedures meet the
generally accepted auditing standard of Poland and provide a satisfactory
compliance audit system. Given the current state of the PPTT accounts and the
necessary urgent task required to upgrade the system, the mission feels it
would not be an optimum use of funds to immediately require that a complete
annual audit be undertaken by international firms. Assistance to strengthen
Poland's financial systems, including the audit function, is presently planned
for 1991 to implement the reorganization and training of the audit profession.
Audit firms with the necessary independence, qualifications and support
facilities should be available in 1995. It is therefore recommended that for
a period of about three years the Bank should require that the Bank project



- 30 .
accounts, SOEs and special account be audited annually by auditors meeting
internationally accepted audit standards, and that the audit of TCO's annual
accounts be undertaken by the current auditors under arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank. The accounting consultants will ensure that the project accounts
are satisfactory (para 5.05). During negotiations agreement on auditing of
the TCO's accounts for the three years 1991-93 in accordance with the above
proposal was reached. It was further agreed that the annual audit for the
1994 accounts onwards will be undertaken annually by independent auditors and
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and that the audit reports
be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the fiscal
year.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Rate of Return
6.01        Financial:  The financial internal rate of return (FRR) for the
Project is 62.3%. However, this very high figure is distorted by the
disproportionate amount of international revenue resulting from high
international tariffs presently in force, compared to relatively small
investment in international facilities. Major reform of international accords
covering international accounting rates is likely in the near future; thus,
the eventual size of international revenue is uncertain. Therefore, we have
calculated the rate of return on the ristional digital overlay network (which
forms the bulk of the Bank project) by itself. This rate of return is 27X,
which is consistent with rates of return for similar investments in other
countries in the region. This figure is based on the conservative assumptions
of: (a) no additional network growth other than that associated with the high-
volume "business class" subscribers directly connected to the overlay network;
plus, (b) the additional traffic from existing subscribers who formerly could
not get through but whose traffic the overlay network will be able to handle;
plus (c) steady traffic growth after the initial jump of 5% p.a. (The exact
assumptions r3garding traffic "jump", fill rates, costs tariffs etc. are given
in Annex 18). Since, in fact, the PPTT will succeed in implementing some
portion of its overall expansion plan, and since the overlay network is
generously dimensioned so that it can handle more traffic, actual returns will
probably be higher than the figures given here.
6.02        The following sensitivity tests on the ERR were carried out:
Case                                 FRR
Base                                 27%
Delay of one year                    21%
Investment costs higher by 20%       22%
Maintenance costs higher by 50%      24%
LD tariffs fall by 5%/yr to
75% of esvimated               22%



- 31 -
6.03        Economic Rate of Return (ERR):  The financial rate of return based
on conservative assumptions does not fully reflect the net economic benefit
from the new works. The value of telephone service is well in excess of both
the cost of providing it and the price charged for it. One indicator of this
is the implied market price for a telephone connection contained in the price
differential for housing and business premises which have telephone
connections and those which do not. Revaluing connections at this implied
price would yield an estimate of consumer's surplus associated with
connections which would raise the ERR by several percentage points over the
FRR. However, the indirect value of a connection implied in price of premises
applies primarily to residential and small business. For large business
users, however, the problem is more one of obtaining sufficient connections
and of poor quality of service rather than crude difficulty in obtaining a
connection. The Project focuses primarily on these customers and its returns
are related more to increased traffic, reliability, call-completion rates,
speed etc. The relevant indicators for this are the traffic tariffs which
potential business subscribers have indicated they would be willing to pay to
cellular phone companies. Since most cellular telephone in Poland will be
used, initially, as a simple substitute for fixed telephone (rather than for
its specialized mobile capacity) these indicated prices are relevant
yardsticks and, if used to revalue the increased traffic on the digital
overlay network would increase the ERR by at least 5 percentage points.
6.04        Benefits:  The above estimates and calculations include only the
direct benefits to users of the new facilities and which, in principle, could
be financially realized by the PPTT. In addition to these direct benefits,
there are significant indirect benefits from improved telecommunications.
These benefits, though difficult to quantify, are certainly very large.
Indeed, improved TC facilities and services, especially for business can
almost be considered a pre-requisite for success of Poland's transition to a
decentralized, market-driven economy. Development of market-based agriculture
and rural industry and exports to the world market. in particular, absolutely
require the capacity to rapidly transmit informatio.. on markets, supplies,
prices. In earlier times this could be accomplished by post or telegraph.
Today, however, markets are increasingly integrated by electronic means. To
compete successfully in them requires access to and participation in modern
electronic TC and the information transfer it makes possible.
6.05        Specifically, the WB project will:
* permit businesses to substitute TC for physical transportation in
many instances;
* obtain more timely information on markets, supplies, credit, labor
supplies etc.;
* increase the efficiency of transportation, stock management, cash
management etc.; and
* increase the integration of economic activities with West European
and world markets.



- 32 -
6.06        Risks:  The principal risk is of continued instability in the
leadership of the sector. This could delay implementation, increase costs and
reduce service quality, induce the construction of less efficient bypass
networks to fill the vacuum. It would also contribute to and exacerbate the
second risk: weak financial management and consequent financial deterioration
of the PPTT which would inhibit execution of the project and, especially, of
attendant development of local networks.
6.07        Another, but rapidly declining, risk concerns COCOM restrictions
on import of modern digital equipment. Nominally restrictions were eased in
the summer of 1990 by enough so that, in principle, they should no longer be a
major barrier. However, delays, irritations and inconvenience could still
surface in the actual implementation of the policy decisions taken in the
summer. However, these are unlikely to seriously affect the project.
B. Environmental and Health Aspects
6.08        The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or health
impacts. Indeed, to the extent the TC services do substitute for
transportation and hence reduce fuel use, the project will have a positive
environmental and health effect.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01        During negotiations agreement has been reached regarding:
(a)   achievement of an operating ratio including profit tax of not less
than 80% in 1992 and 75% for 1993 and onwards with quarterly
tariff increases in line with inflation adjusted by cost savings;
(b)   separation of non-telecom activities from telecom operations (TCO)
of the PPTT to create an independent telecom division by the end
of 1991 and a separate joint stock company by June 30, 1992;
(c)   an action plan covering:
(i) performance targets: setting, monitoring, and reviewing
performance targets covering network development,
efficiency, and quality of service. Indicative targets
were agreed for the next three years. Actual
performance will be monitored by the TCO and reported to
the Bank semi-annually. Once a year actual performance
will be compared to targeted performance and discussed
with the Bank. Measures to address any shortfalls will
be agreed and targets for the following three years will
be adjusted to reflect increased information, actual
performance and agreed measures;



- 33 -
(ii)  separation of telecom accounts:  initial separation of
telecom accounts commenced during project preparation.
This will be expanded by establishing separate
accounting units for the tslecom operations (TCO) in
1991; and the accounts of the TCO will be maintained
separately. Separate bank accounts will be maintained
from January 1, 1992. In support of this activity
consulting services will be engaged by July 1, 1991 to
undertake a diagnostic study of accounting and
information systems and make proposals for the phased
development of the system and staff training over the
next six years and to assist in the implementation of
Phase I of the proposed program.
(iii) technical assistance to the TCO for: (a) traffic
engineering to maximize usage of the existing network;
(b) creation of in-house software development and
maintenance capacity which will be critical to
successful introduction and integration of digital
systems into the network; (c) development of a network
design and digitalization strategy for building on the
digital overlay network and extending modern facilities
into the rest of the main network; and (d) development
of a strategy for recruiting, training, developing and
utilizing human resources;
(iv) technical assistance to the GOP for defining and
developing a regulatory framework for managing the
evolving telecom sector--in which the TCO will be an
independent, self-financing and commercially oriented
company and in which other operators will have a growing
roles;
(v) support for the Special Project Office; and
(vi) a study of tariff levels, structure and institutional
mechanisms for monitoring, analyzing and adjusting
tariffs.
7.02.       During negotiations agreement was also reached on the following
conditions of effectiveness:
(a)   tariff to be increased to raise the weighted average of the tariff
by (i) inflation since May 1, 1990; (ii) 50X of the expected
average price level increase for the quarter in which the date of
effectiveness occurs; and (iii) a real increase of 30X. This
would be a condition of effectiveness.
(b)   effectiveness of the EIB loan (para 5.15).



- 34 -
7.03        Subject to the above agreements, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$120 million equivalent for a period of seventeen years,
including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.

FIRST TELECOM LOAN - PPTT
HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT (HRM&D)
IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE NEEDED
1. INTRODUCTION
The immediate assistance needed in the HRM&D area in PPTT relates
to two activities: (i) preparation, elaboration and implementation of a HRM&D
Master Plan (MP), and; (ii) organization and implementation of immediate high
level management training. A short description of these activities are as
follows.
2. THE HRM&D MASTER PLAN
In order to arrive to an operable Master Plan, a small Project
Group (PG) consisting of representatives (head) of the training department,
personnel department and organization and methods development in the
Directorate General of PPTT is formed. As the Project leader, a foreign
expert will be engaged. The objective of the PG is to define the
requirements, substance and the correlation of the MP to the Corporate Plan
and Strategy of the PPTT which will be eventually converted into a commercial
telecommunication enterprise. Because at present, no Corporate Plan exists,
the task of the group will be to interact with the management of PPTT and the
recipients of the Management Training (see para 3 below) in order to arrive at
a framework of the Master Plan. The PG with the assistance of the Project
Coordinator, will write the TOR, identify and quantify the foreign assistance
required, select the Polish contrapart for the work, and supervise and advise
on policy and conceptual matters. The members of the PG group will themselves
be the first recipient of the management training. The MP should draw upon
the World Bank/ITU framework for HRM&D strategy for developing countries in
the field of telecommunications.
Once the task is defined, the TOR prepared (and cleared with the
Bank) the Consultants and local counterparts selected, the actual work will
begin. The role of the PG will then be of the overviewer, adviser, and
controller. Furthermore, any interaction on conceptual level will be enacted
through this group, as the MP will have to touch upon many HRM&D activities,
functions and strategies which in turn have to be harmonized with the
conceptual solutions of the Corporate Plan and strategy.
The interrelationship between the MP and the Corporate Plan is
obviously important as the Corporate Plan will have a substantial say about
the human element, which is one of the most important and critical component
in determining the life or death of the future Corporation. Therefore, many
solutions from the MP will appear in the Corporate Plan and vise versa.



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2
The foreign expert assisting (leading) the group must be an
experienced professional in HUM&D matters with proven achievements in his home
Administration or Company. He must also be experienced in the matters of
organizational development, as the HRM&D function should be the vehicle for
organizational changes in PPTT. His role will be to coach the group, assist
in all activities TOR, selections of the consultants, contrapart, etc.)
overviewing the work of the consultants and their contraparts, organization of
study tours, training, assuming that the deliverables of the consultants are
the highest possible quality and caring for the implementation of their
recommendations after the PPTT management and the Bank accepted them.
This engagement will consist of several short trips to Warsaw and
interaction with the Project group via electronic means. Estimated total
engagement time is two man-months with 5-6 visits in a one year period.
3. IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT TRAINING
The PPTT management (on the highest level) was never exposed to modern,
commercial managerial methods in a telecommunication company. As the
transformation of the PPTT to a commercial organization is imminent, it is
necessary to expose the top management of PPTT to modern management training.
To organize, systematize, plan and implement such training, another working
group is set up in the Directorate General of the PPTT. The group will, like
the Project group under para 2 above, have the support of a foreign expert to
coach them and inject experience and professional knowledge and judgment. The
objective of the working group will be to plan, overview, and implement the
management training project and care for the formation of a group of trainers
inside the PPTT in order to disseminate the acquired knowledge in the field of
modern management methods and systems as applied to a telecom entity thereby
changing the culture of the organization toward a cost conscious service
oriented, commercial organization. A secondary objective of the working group
will be to systematize, prioritize and harmonize the many offers received from
abroad for training including management training.
One other important function of the group should be to debrif the
recipient of the management training in order to orient the training toward
the goals and objective of the HRM&D Master Plan concepts and Corporate
Strategy and Plan. As the early recipient of the Management Training will be
the highest echelon of the PPTT, their interaction with both the Project Group
for HRM&D and the working group for Management Training is important.
The task of the foreign expert assisting (heading) this working
group will be similar to the task described in para 2 above. The estimated
amount of assistance is of two man-months with 4-5 visits in one year period.

Main Assumptions used in the Financial Proiections
1.         With the recent high level of inflation and major political
changes underway in Poland, it is difficult to predict inflation within a
reasonable degree of accuracy during the next few years. All the financial
projections have, therefore, been prepared in constant May i990 Zlotys. An
exchange rate of ZL 9,500 to the US dollar was used for conversion of the
project's foreign exchange costs and Bank's loan to Zlotys.
2.         A real tariff increase of 32X was assumed to be implemented on
January 1, 1991 with a further real tariff increase of 8X on January 1, 1993
when substantial improvements in the telecom system is expected as a result of
the major investments during 1991-92.
3.         The average cost of DEL installed was US$1,640 equivalent.
4.          The connection fee for the new digital overlay system was US$1,000
equivalent per line.
5.         A major increase in the long distance pulses was projected to be
achieved in 1993 as a result of expected improvements in the network from the
current investment program.
6.          Interest rates on foreign and local loans were assumed at 5X per
annum in real terms.
7.         Depreciation rates was increased from 3.6 to 6.6X per annum to
better reflect the estimated life of fixed assests.
8.         Further assumptions are shown in the chart below.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR CALCULATION OF PROJECT
RATE OF RETURN
Service iumns
Improved service leads to higher demand. This is true for most walks of
life, also for telecommunications. It is perhaps more correct to say that there
is a suppressed demand which becomes visible when service improves. The
phenomenon is well known. When converting from manual to automatic
traffic one may expect that the traffic increases 2-4 times. Unfortunately,
there is no corresponding rule of thumb for service improvements in an
automatic network. Assumptions have to be made. We must consider two
types oi service jump. First, the subscribers actually make more calls when
it becomes easier to get through the network. This service jump generates
additional revenues. The second tvpe of service jump has to do with
changes in subscriber behaviour. The demand on the network is normally
highest between 9 and 11 a.m. Since an overloaded network cannot cope
with the peak traffic, the subscribers modify their habits so that they spread
the calls more evenly during the day: they adapt to the existing service
level. When the network is extended, the natural pattem of demand will be
re-established. The subscribers will make most of their calls during the
natural peak period and the traffic will increase. However, this traffic
increase does not represent any additional revenue. In the following we
shall call this phenomenon a "non-revenue service jump".
Basic Darameters . international
International char&ed minutes
This is obtained from Poland's intemational accounts with other telecoms
operators. The figure is for outgoing traffic only.
Averaee charce per minute
This is a weighted average of the current tariffs for automatic traffic. It has
been calculated as follows: the traffic to each destination was multiplied by
the tariff to that destination. The result per destination was totalled and
divided by the total traffic. The average is probably on the low side. There
are two reasons for this. First, high tariff traffic (eg. the USA) is not auto-
matic at present and thus not. included. Second, the tariffs to Comecon
countries are extremely low: an average of 2,400 zloty a minute versus
14,000 for traffic to Western Europe. It is probable that this will change in
the medium term.

New international circuits
Obtained from the routing plan for the new international exchange. The
actual maximum capacity of the exchange is 3500 circuits but onlv 2,495
have been allocated at this stage. Note that the 1,500 international circuits
planned for Katowice are included in the investment cost but not as revenue
generators. The reason is that the exchange routing plan is not yet complet-
ed. Anv estimate of revenues would be highly hypothetical.
Consumed bv renlacements
There are 446 outgoing circuits for automatic traffic. The number of manual
circuits is 172. Being manual, they operate at a high rate of utilization, say
0.95. When tho traffic is converted to automatic. the utilization rate will
decrease. Most of the international routes are rather small. A reasonable
utilization rate would be 0.75. Hence, the 172 manual circuits would
correspond to 233 automatic circuits and the current traffic load would
require 446+233, ie. 679 equivalent circuits in the new intemational ex-
change.
Consumed bv non-revenue service iump
We have assumed 25% of the equivalent circuits (see above).

termination roirts or "p.rrs". An exchange has an incomning and an outgo-
ing side. A call through the exchange occupies two ports. An L/D call
involves two transit exchanges and, conseq, -ntly, four ports. Hence,
112,200 ports correspond to 28,050 circuits.
Consumed by replacements
About 20% of the total goes towards replacing analogue circuits in the city-
to-city r.ttwork.

Consumed bv non-revenue service iump
We have assumed 50% on the replaced analogue circuits.
Net additional circuits
Remaining circuits after allowing for replacements and the non-revenue
service jump.
Averaee revenue per circuit
There are no reliable data on the distribution of revenue between local,
zonal and interurban calls. In any case, such data would not be applicable
since the network is overloaded and operates in a non-optimal mode. For
the estimation of revenue in such cases there is a rule of thumb that a trunk
line is fully used for about four hours per 24-hour period. To understand
this. assume that the utilization rate is 0.8 during the morning peak hour,
0.6 during the aftemoon peak and an average of 0.2 during all other hours
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. This gives a total occupation time of 264 min-
utes. Some of the traffic does not produce revenue (busy, no answer). On
the other hand these calls are much shorter than those which lead to a
conversation so four hours is a reasonable figure.
There are three tariff classes for non-local traffic:
Distance          Interval
between exchanges between pulses
<25 km           30 seconds
25-100 km                10 seconds
>100 km                 5 seconds
These rates apply during business hours. Outside business hours the 10 and
5 second intervals are prolonged to 20 and 10 seconds respectively.
Calls covering a distance of less than 25 km are not LID calls. We have
assumed an average pulse interval of 10 seconds.
As of May, 1990 the charge per pulse will be 150 zlotys corresponding to
0.016 US$.
Under these assumptions, the annual revenue per line in a network operating
under normal conditions would amount to USS 5760 assuming 250 normal
traffic days per year.
Subscribers in digital overlay
The number of subscriber lines connected to the new transit exchanges.

Basic Darameters . telex
Connection fee and subscrintion fee
These are the actual fees valid in May,1990 assuming that the distance
between the exchange and the subscriber is 1 km on average (the monthly
subscription fee is 6 US$ plus 2 US$ per km).
Average revenue per subscriber
The total revenue from telex traffic divided by the number of subscribers.
Maintenance
Costs for maintenance and spare parts usually amount to 5-10% of the
investment cost. We have assumed 8% with a reduction to 4% during the
guarantee period.
Fill factors and tariff forecasts
Investments
We have assumed that the share of investments over the three years is 30%,
40% and 30%.
Subscribers
This refers only to the 61.000 subscriber lines which are connected directly
to the digital overlay. They are assumed to be connected at the rates of
20%. 40% and 30% over the three years bringing the ultimate exchange fill
factor to 90%.
Lona-distance network
We have assumed that the revenue-generating service jump amounts to
100% of the replaced circuits in the city-to-city network and that 10% of
the net additional circuits will be required to handle new automatic traffic
cases. We have assumed that the jump takes place during the first two
years. After the initial jump we have assumed a steady growth of 5% per
year. Note that this figure does NOT assume any additional subscribers. It
is based on experience from Western Europe where this is a typical growth
rate, partly explained by the growing amount of facsimile and data traffic
carried on the public telephone network.



ANNEX 18

International network
Currently, the traffic is very depressed and many important destinations like
the USA are served by semi-automatic traffic. We have assumed a reve-
nue-generating service jump of 100% to destinations which are now served
manuallv and 25% to destinations with automatic service. After the initial
jump we have assumed a steady growth of 10% per year.
L/D tariffs
We have assumed that the tariffs remain unchanged in constant zlotys.
International tariffs
Here we have assumed a decrease by 10% annually until the tariffs are at
50% of their current level. There are two reasons. First, Poland's tariffs are
very high. This is due to a forner policy of using the international traffic as
a source of foreign exchange. This was done by discouraging outgoing
traffic in favour of incoming which results in a net surplus with other
telecoms operators. We assume that this policy will be reversed graduallv.
Second. intemational services are generally overpriced by all telecoms
operators. The threat of private by-pass operators will force a reduction in
the tariffs.
Telex network
We have assumed an initial backlog of 2,000 subscribers to be connected at
commissioning and then a growth by 4% per year falling to 2% as from the
eleventh year.
8.4   The viability of the Programme as a whole
Please refer to Page 1. The IRR is 63%.
8.5   The viability of the digital overlay network
Please refer to Annex 2 which shows the basic alternative. The investment
costs include the costs shown under the heading "Domestic Services" in
chapter 2 plus the costs for technical assistance and training.
The IRR is 27% which is satisfactory.

The sensitivity has been tested as follows:
CASE                                 IRR
Base                                 27%
Cormmissioning delaved by one vear   21%
Investrnent 20% higher than
estimated                            22%
Long-distance charges falling by
5% annually down to 75% of current
charges                              22%
Maintenance costs 50% higher
than estimated                       24%
Under these assumptions the overlay network retains its viability. In fact.
the viability is underestimated because we have evaluated the investment
solely on its own merits. We have not assumed any additional traffic apart
from that generated by (1) the service jump, (2) the subscribers connected
to the overlay, and (3) a steady growth of 5% per year. Under these as-
sumptions, the network will only be utilized to 57% at the end of the
calculation period.
The reality will of course be very differenL PPTT will commission new
local exchanges, not least in Warsaw, and the overlay network will fill up
quite rapidly. This means that a substantial part of the investment in the
overlay network is to accommodate additional subscribers. In this perspec-
tive the IRR figures arrived at in our analysis must be considered very
satisfactory.
We have also looked at the matter of connection and subscription fees. As
noted earlier in this report, the business subscribers connected directly to the
overlay network will enjoy superior service. It is not unreasonable that they
should pay premium fees. We have investigates three alternatives for the
connection fee: 250, 500 and 1000 US$ and three alternatives for the
monthly subscription fee: 1, 10 and 20 USS. The table below shows the
impact on the IRR for each combination of alternatives.

1000        33%          37%          42%
Considering that the programrnme of technical assistance includes a tariff
study, it would be premature to make any recomrendation to PPTT at this
stage.
8.6   The viability of the telex expansion
Please refer to' Annex 3. The IRR is only 3%. Telex is an essential business
service which will not be superseded by facsimile until most business
customers have access to the modern network. In our opinion, a low IRR
could be tolerated for this mather small investrnent. At the sarne time we
recommend that the telex charges be included in the tariff study to be
perfonned under the technical assistance component.
