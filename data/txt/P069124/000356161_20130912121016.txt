F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The original development objectives of the Project were:

    1. To reinforce, in rainfed areas, institutional capacity for Project formulation and
       implementation, in partnership with the communes and local organizations.

    2. In seven priority action zones, to improve the incomes of the local populations and
       reduce their vulnerability to drought; and to improve access to public and social services.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

In December 2009, the Board approved on a no-objection basis the following amended PDO:

        The objective of the Project is to promote the development of rainfed-based agricultural
        farming in the Priority Rainfed Areas in the Project Area and improve access by local
        populations to basic infrastructure and socio-economic services, through an integrated
        and participatory rural development approach.

 Comments: The revised target of hectares improved was achieved. However, only some schemes actually
 showed an extension of the irrigated area or higher productivity.
 Indicator # 2           Additional pastoral areas where the land has been improved and pasture growing
 Value                                                                        20,000 ha              9,390 ha (47%)

 Comments: The shortfall was largely due to community inability to provide protective fencing during the
 establishment period.
 Indicator # 3           Additional improved water points used for agricultural/livestock purposes
 Value                                                                             80                  98 (122%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: The target was exceeded.
 Indicator # 4           Pilot farmers adopting new technologies
 Value                                                                            350                    30 (9%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: An apparently unsatisfactory result. However, the numbers reflect performance in only one area.
 Data for other Project areas is not available.
 Indicator # 5           Additional villages (douar) with access to potable water
 Value                                                                             25                   20 (80%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: Shortfall resulting from delays in preparation and procurement.
 Indicator # 6           Additional visits to health centers
 Value                                                                          + 20%                + 30% (150%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: Purchase of ambulances and upgrading of health centers were completed almost as planned, despite
 procurement problems. Whether these two outputs led to the result of 30% additional visits to health centers may
 be questioned, as may the reliability of the 30%.
 Indicator # 7           Additional children attending school
 Value                                                                          + 20%                + 22% (120%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: The Project delivered one new college, 42 school upgrades, and two school buses, in excess of
 targets. Certainly part of the reported increase in school attendance can be attributed to these outputs,
 particularly for girls.
 Indicator # 8           Number of villages (douar) that can be accessed by car all year round
 Value                                                                             + 30%              + 29% (96%)
 Date achieved                                                               12/30/2009                12/31/2011
 Comments: Physical outputs included four bridges and 131 km of rural roads. Undoubtedly these outputs
 contributed to the ‘desenclavement’ of the douars in question.

(b) Intermediate Outcome Indicators (as revised)
Component 1: Strengthening of intervention capacity

Intermediate Outcome 1A: Institutional mechanisms established and MAMF capacity strengthened for the preparation
and execution of participatory integrated development projects in the Priority Rainfed Areas in the Project Area
      Indicators            Baseline Value           Original           Formally Revised            Actual Value

 Indicator # 9          Number of CPDH and CLDH in operation
 Value                                                                         7 CPDH             7 CPDH (100%)

 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: The CPDH and the CLDH were set up in the context of INDH in 2005-7, and were adopted for the
 Project in October 2008. In view of the independent process by which they were set up, they cannot be
 considered outputs of the Project.
 Indicator # 10          Number of PICs prepared and executed
 Value                                                                            7                  12 (170%)
 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: The PICs were generally of good quality, and served as a source of proposal for the ILDH and PCD.
 Caveats are identified.
 Indicator # 11          Amount of FDR funding for non-agricultural activities (as a percentage of the total PIC
                         amount)
 Value                                                                           30%                31% (102%)
 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: The indicator suggests that the FDR performed as planned. However, the mobilization and use of
 FDR resources caused long delays and cost huge administrative effort.
 Indicator # 12          Additional funding in PIC zones (as a % of the total PIC amount)
 Value                                                                           20%                 Unknown
 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: Clearly a poorly-designed indicator.
 Indicator # 13          Number of agreements with local partners
 Value                                                                            30                 45 (150%)
 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: These agreements not only provided a useful mechanism for Project implementation but also helped
 build civil society capacity (albeit with varying results).
 Indicator # 14          A reliable monitoring and evaluation system is in place
 Value                                                                           Yes                     No
 Date achieved                                                              12/30/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: An elaborate M&E system was designed but never implemented.

  Comments: This is a successful achievement of the Project, although the associations are of variable capability
  and sustainability. In all cases, follow-up support is needed.
  Indicator # 16         Number of trained beneficiaries (communal councils, associations)
  Value                                                                          100                   550 (550%)

  Comments: The training program was well designed, of good quality and appreciated. The decentralization
  created extra costs and led to overlap in preparation of modules and variable quality of training delivered.

 Comments: Agreements were concluded and satisfactorily implemented in all but one province. The future of
 such local agreements remains to be defined as Morocco restructures its approach to research financing.
 Indicator # 18        Number of field demonstrations
 Value                                                                        50                   115 (230%)

 Comments: After considerable delay, a study for establishment of an early warning system was eventually
 carried out. Its impact on risk management practice remains to be seen.

 Comments: A program of 155 km was agreed in the PIC, and overall this target was achieved. It is not clear
 why a target of 200 km was set at the time of the 2009 restructuring.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Rainfed Agriculture Development Project (‘the Project’) was conceived at the end of the
1990s, a decade during which Morocco – a lower middle-income country – had experienced low
GDP growth of 1.9% per annum compared to population growth of 1.8% per annum. The
agriculture sector had actually experienced ‘negative growth’ of -0.3% between 1991 and 1999,
mainly due to a succession of droughts. This lack of growth had been a key reason for the
alarming increase in rural poverty rates during the 1990s. Economic stagnation was accompanied
by the emergence of striking income inequality and of a large and growing gap between town and
country in access to basic infrastructure and services. Government identified four main drivers of
rural poverty: (i) a technology gap characterized by low productivity; (ii) climate fluctuations and
vulnerability to drought; (iii) the environmental fragility of certain ecosystems; and (iv) low
levels of investment in agricultural development and rural infrastructure.

In response to these problems and in line with the Bank’s recently published rural development
strategy Reaching the Rural Poor, the Government adopted in 1999 its 2020 Rural Development
Strategy. The 2020 Strategy aimed at broad-based rural development, including agricultural
growth, off-farm employment, and investment in rural infrastructure and services. The approach
was based on principles of: (i) decentralization; (ii) multi-sectoral integration; and (iii)
stakeholder participation. A series of projects was prepared within the 2020 Strategy to apply its
approach to the poorer, largely non-commercial farming areas, including the Irrigation-Based
Community Development Project (Bank-financed, see ICR # 1096) and the Rainfed Agricultural
Development Project. The former project was intended to test application of the 2020 Strategy in
poor mountainous areas, the latter in poor areas where rainfed farming predominated. The
Government also set up a dedicated source of finance, the Rural Development Fund (Fonds de
Developpement Rural, FDR), managed by the Governors (local representatives of the Ministry of
Interior), and with a mandate to finance multi-sectoral integrated rural development.

The Bank worked closely with the Government on preparation of its 2020 Strategy. In view of
the Bank’s global and country expertise, the Government invited the Bank to share in financing
the first two projects within the 2020 Strategy. This was consistent with the 2001 CAS which
prioritized inclusion and reducing the vulnerability of the rural poor through integrated rural
development. The Project was included in the CAS program agreed with the Government.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The approved Project Development Objective and indicators were:

1.3 Revised PDO and key indicators, and reasons for revision

Following the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Board approved in December 2009, on a no-
objection basis, the following amended PDO:

         The objective of the Project is to promote the development of rainfed-based agricultural
         farming in the Priority Rainfed Areas in the Project Area and improve access by local
         populations to basic infrastructure and socio-economic services, through an integrated
         and participatory rural development approach.

The reasons for the amendment were to implement recommendations at MTR to make the PDO
and indicators more realistic, consistent with Project activities, and quantifiable. The revised
PDO indicators were:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target group comprised the approximately 15,400 poor rural households of selected
communes in the seven provinces where the Project was to be implemented: some 91,200 people
living in 230 villages (douar). Within these communities, all of which practiced predominantly
rainfed farming, specific priority target groups were identified as: (i) douar in Tata, Taroudant,
and Boulemane provinces where social cohesion was strong, (ii) women’s groups in Tata and
Khouribga where male emigration was pervasive; and (iii) farmers’ associations in Khemisset and
Sidi Kacem where agricultural potential was significant. Further priority target groups were to be
identified during implementation. Targeting within each community to ensure that the maximum
benefits went to the poorer segments was to be done through the process of formulation of the
communal investment programs (Plan d’Investissement Communal, PIC).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

According to the PAD, the Project was to consist of two complementary components:

Strengthening of implementation capacity for rainfed agricultural development

This component was designed to help implement the principles and objectives of the 2020 Rural
Development Strategy in rainfed areas and to develop a structured response to drought. The
Project aimed at developing a programmatic approach for rainfed areas development in order to
integrate activities within a coherent framework, to create synergies and to promote good
practices. It was to achieve this by:
 Strengthening the implementation capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture (then called
    MADR) at the central level for developing and managing the rainfed agriculture development
    program, and for ensuring adequate monitoring and evaluation of this program (composed of
    numerous operations with similar approaches). In addition, the proposed Project was to


                                                        2
    provide technical assistance to help MADR prepare and implement a restructuring plan for its
    field offices.
   Strengthening the local implementation capacity of MADR provincial and local
    representations as well as of local government and community institutions. The Project was
    to provide technical assistance and support training activities to help prepare local
    participatory PICs, including economic and social investments.
   Developing new instruments and institutional capacity to improve support services for rainfed
    agriculture, notably:
    - drought management, including drought-related policy making at the national level, the
         development of an early warning system for drought in the seven largely rainfed areas of
         the Project, and the piloting of a weather-based index insurance scheme.
    - agricultural research, including development of demand-driven research funding
         mechanisms, strengthening of the decentralized national research network, the
         preparation of technico-economic reference manuals for each Project area, and the
         preparation of studies to improve collective rangeland management.

Rural development activities in rainfed priority areas

The component was to finance activities aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural
development, improving access to basic infrastructures and services, and developing income-
generating activities, both off-farm and on-farm. Activities were to be implemented over a period
of up to five years in each of seven rainfed Project areas, which were among the poorest areas of
the country and which lacked rural infrastructure and access to basic social services.1 Three sub-
components were:
 Agricultural and pastoral development, aimed at increasing the productivity of agricultural
    systems, improving natural resource management and mitigating the effects of drought,
    notably through soil and water conservation, and land development works.
 Rural infrastructure development, including small and medium-scale irrigation systems,
    pastoral water points, rural roads, and other non-agricultural infrastructure; and the provision
    of technical assistance to rural communes (Commune rural) for the formulation and
    implementation of the PICs.
 Support to local initiatives to strengthen the capacity of local organizations in identifying
    their own development needs and plans, and to support education and skills training activities,
    including financing equipment for on-the-job training and promoting micro credit
    organizations, farmer associations, and income generating activities.

Total estimated cost was USD 41.1 million over six years (January 2004 to December 2009),
financed by the Bank (USD 26.8 million) and by Government and beneficiaries.

1.6 Revisions

The Loan Agreement was amended three times. In April 2005, a new disbursement category was
created and funds reallocated to finance sub-project grants in partnership with NGOs and/or
research and development institutions. These partnerships had been envisaged in the Project
under Support to local initiatives (see 1.5 above) but without a specific disbursement category. A
second amendment of the Loan Agreement in October 2008 brought the Project decision-making
mechanisms at local and provincial level into line with a new nation-wide governance structure
established under the National Human Development Initiative (Initiative Nationale de

  Activities to be implemented were identified in six areas, in the provinces of Boulemane, Khemisset, Khouribga,
Sidi-Kacem, Taroudant and Tata. Activities in a seventh area, in the Province of Errachidia, were to be identified
during the first two years of project implementation and included thereafter.

Developpement Humain, INDH). The third amendment (December 2009) revised the PDO and
indicators (see 1.3 above), reallocated loan proceeds, cancelled a small portion of the Loan, and
extended the closing date from December 31st, 2009 to December 31st, 2011. According to the
documents approving these three amendments, the original Project components and activities
remained unchanged. However, in practice a shift took place in the institutional development
component, with reduced emphasis on the broad goals of developing a scalable programmatic
approach for rainfed areas development and supporting MADR restructuring. The scope of
activities related to drought management strategy was similarly scaled back.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

The background analysis supporting the Project was very thorough, based on an assessment of
the shortcomings in previous approaches. Following Reaching the Rural Poor, the Bank and the
Government had worked together on an exhaustive Bank report on rural development in Morocco
which had considerably influenced Government thinking and contributed to Government’s 2020
Rural Development Strategy. There was strong Moroccan participation in a series of regional
workshops organized by the Bank to follow up on Reaching the Rural Poor. Also, the Bank
financed a pilot participatory rural development project, the Oued Lahkdar Watershed
Management Project, and organized a national conference on integrated rural development at
Beni Mellal in 2002. Preparation studies for the Project began in 1999 with major input from the
FAO-Bank Cooperative Program, and continued for over two years. The resulting Project design
incorporated lessons from both global and Moroccan experience, principally that: (i) integration
across sectors is essential; (ii) participation creates ownership and relevance; (iii) funding has to
be made directly available for community-driven programs; and (iv) development programs must
be decentralized as far as possible.

Assessment of the Project design

Although the presentation of the Project’s purpose is not entirely consistent throughout the PAD,
it is fairly clear that the Project was designed to build capability to implement a nationwide
program based on the design of the Project, and to test the proposed interventions in the seven
Project areas as a basis for scaling up to a national-level integrated rural development program
thereafter. At the time of appraisal, this was considered a realistic objective, given the length and
depth of preparation and Government’s then strong commitment both to the Project approach and
to the deconcentration2 that was proposed.

For the same reasons, the components were appropriate to reach this ambitious objective. They
were designed to test and develop implementation capacity at the central and local levels for
managing a broad program. The sub-component aimed at improving capability for drought
management was an appropriate element in a program aimed at improving productivity and risk
management in rainfed areas, especially given the frequency of droughts in the 1990s.

The organizational arrangements for implementing the Project were exceptionally complicated.
They included a dense structure of bodies for (i) coordination; (ii) programming and follow up;
and (iii) implementation and management at national, provincial, and communal level. If these
arrangements had ever been fully operational, up to ten different bodies would have been working
at national level, four in each province, and three at each local level. In addition to this dense

Government was not complete at the time of appraisal: deconcentration, and the FDR. There was
nominal commitment in Government to deconcentration, but this commitment was very uneven
across ministries. At appraisal it was assumed that deconcentration would take place early in the
implementation period, but this assumption proved overoptimistic, and this became a major factor
in delaying Project implementation.

Regarding the FDR, there was only partial agreement within Government that the FDR should be
made permanent, and its operational modalities remained unclear. In addition, Project design
depended on the operational capabilities of the Ministry of Agriculture’s provincial and local
level representations. At the local level, the Ministry’s local extension centres were notoriously
weak, but it was expected that they would be strengthened under the Project and as part of the
proposed restructuring of field offices (see 1.5 above).

Borrower commitment

Borrower commitment was strong in the Ministry of Agriculture (then MADR), which at the time
had responsibility also for rural development and which had been the promoter of the approaches
enshrined in the 2020 Rural Development Strategy. During 1996-9, MADR had also been
implementing small pilot projects in 25 sites, testing participatory approaches to rainfed area
development. At the broader level, other ministries were giving at least nominal support to a
cross-sectoral integrated approach, and the Ministry of Finance had agreed to the continuation of
the FDR. Overall, however, it has to be said that the commitment of MADR at the appraisal
stage was rather stronger than that of other ministries, essential partners though those ministries
were.

The participatory process

Despite the primacy of the participatory approach in the Project concept, there is no clear
description in the PAD of the participatory process envisaged. What information there is
suggests a participatory process organized around villages (douar), local associations and
cooperatives, aggregated and arbitrated by a commune-level ad hoc local committee. Teams of
‘community workers’ (animateurs) at commune level were envisaged, and participatory
monitoring was to take place during implementation. What was missing was a simple
methodology for participatory diagnostic and planning that could have been applied rapidly at the
start of the Project (or even during preparation) to get implementation quickly underway.

Assessment of risks

Three major risks were identified at appraisal, and the overall risk was rated as ‘substantial’:
 Climatic risk, which was to be mitigated by the integrated drought management system to be
   developed under the Project.
 Policy risk from the then prevailing incentive price structure for cereals and from possible
   future adjustments to that structure.
 Institutional risks that: (i) MADR would not be able to restructure and build capacity for the
   type of decentralized and integrated role envisaged under the Project, to be mitigated by
   restructuring and capacity building foreseen under the Project; and (ii) that MADR would not
   be able to lead other agencies in the integrated rural development approach, and that the
   cooperation of other ministries would be less than expected – to be mitigated by the several
   joint committees and teams envisaged in the dense organizational structure of the Project.

Although these risks were certainly the main ones at the time of appraisal, in practice it was the
institutional risk that turned out to be the most important by far. The mitigation measures
                                                 5
proposed for this were the correct ones, but they were only partly put in place. In addition, the
lack of deconcentration turned out to be a significant factor in slowing implementation. Despite
the focus at appraisal on managing climate risk, this concern was side-lined during
implementation

2.2 Implementation

Factors influencing implementation arose at two levels: (i) changes in the policy and institutional
environment beyond the control of the Government implementation team; and (ii) factors of
Project management at least partly within the control of the Government implementation team.

Changes in the policy and institutional environment

Changes in the policy and institutional environment were numerous. All of them had an impact
on the relevance of the Project, and many also affected Project implementation directly:

2005        Government declares a focus on ‘upgrading’ (mise a               Continuation of a shift of emphasis away

2007        Responsibility for rural development transferred from the        Commitment to integrated rural
            Ministry of Agriculture to a new Département de                  development and the Project within the
            l’Amenagement du Territoire (along with part of the FDR).        Ministry of Agriculture dwindled further.
2008        Restructuring of Ministry of Agriculture, including: (i)         Strategic all-change in the Ministry of
            creation of regional directorates and movement of staff          Agriculture essentially marginalized the

            strategy, the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), with the                    organizational changes further weakened
            establishment of a new agency to finance specifically            the Ministry’s centres – the front-line
            agricultural investments (Agence pour le Developpement           units.

            developpement, PCD).                                             approach and planning instrument (PIC)

                                                                             by a lighter but multi-sectoral and

                                                                             the Interior (PCD).

Essentially, the result of all these manifold changes in the policy and institutional environment
was a shift away from agriculture-led integrated rural development as a mainstream policy in
Morocco, which diminished the relevance of the Project as a pioneer of new approaches to
participatory development.

On the positive side, certain elements of the Project inspired and were mainstreamed in INDH
and the PCD process: the Commune as the unit of planning; the bottom-up participatory
approach; the diagnostic-problem-solution paradigm for planning; the delegation to commune-
level and provincial-level governance organs; and the dedication of a specific budget for each
commune.

Other elements of the Project approach were not adopted in the new programs - including the
FDR - and the Ministry of Agriculture lead in developing cooperation between agencies at
provincial level and in coordinating programs for rural development. As a result, over time the
Project ceased to be a pioneer for a new national approach and ended up as a small scale rainfed
rural development project with the limited objective of delivering a set of useful investments to
target communities.

Factors at Project level

The principal implementation problems were the delays and the higher costs than anticipated.
The causes of these problems included:

The capacity and performance of the Project units at central and provincial level. Although there
was initially strong commitment to the Project in most units, this commitment diminished as the
focus of decision-takers moved away from the integrated rural development concept. Staff
availability for implementation varied, with most units understaffed and frequent changes of
personnel, particularly in the central unit. Although an adequate Procedures Manual was
prepared early in the Project, it was never updated.

The variable contribution of other ministries. Project design called for all relevant ministries at
the provincial level to work together in a team to support the participatory programming process
and subsequently to help implement the investments decided. In general, this worked fairly well
at the provincial level but with particular constraints stemming from the rigidity of certain
sectoral programs (particular the national rural roads program) and the need to refer certain
technical reviews and decisions to the central ministry in Rabat (for example, for more
complicated engineering projects such as bridges, or works on classified roads). This led to long
delays for certain components, particularly roads and potable water supply, and to cost overruns
where higher technical specifications were required.

The process of preparing the PICs. The decision to entrust ‘support’ to the diagnostic and
planning process to consultant firms resulted in generally sound work, but had a number of
unintended negative side-effects: high cost; excessive detail and length of the process; a loss of
confidence by the population as the actual investments took so long to come; and poor access of
the population to the wealth of information and assessment gathered.

Delays in the FDR. Throughout the Project, the allocations of FDR financing were made
available only late in the year, delaying the signature of the relevant contracts, and frequently
requiring burdensome administrative processes to get the allocations rolled over to the subsequent
year.

Complex sources of finance for a number of sub-projects. Several sub-projects (roads, bridges,
one school) were too large to be financed by the Project alone, and communes devised co-
                                                 7
financing packages which, whilst they achieved the intended object, created considerable
administrative burdens, with up to nineteen separate contracts awarded for a single sub-project.

Management of procurement. Despite elaboration of the Procedures Manual and efforts to
provide training, procurement was slow. Particularly at local level, numerous procurements
proved abortive, generally through lack of sufficient responsive bids. In some cases three
attempts were made before a contract was finally awarded. Part of the problem lay in the
difficulties of coordinating many small procurements at the provincial level. More intensive and
targeted training at central and local level might have eased this constraint.

In addition, specific factors affected the implementation of certain sub-components:

Partnerships for local initiatives. Arrangements for selecting partners and sub-projects for
financing under the ‘local initiatives’ sub-component were not spelled out at appraisal. As these
were essentially public financing of quasi-private goods (they benefited associations of producers
or cooperatives rather than the community as a whole), there were risks attached. Transparent
procedures for selecting the partners and sub-projects were never set out. Follow-up and hand-
holding during development and operation phases of these sub-projects was unsatisfactory.

Other partnerships. The Project developed a good working partnership with INDH. The
provincial level partnerships with INRA for agricultural research were technically responsive, and
also forged new links between research and agricultural services at the local level.

Responsibility for the drought management component. The institutional structure for drought
management assessed at appraisal (the Observatoire de la séchéresse) never became functional,
and it took a long time to find a home for the proposed activities within the Ministry of
Agriculture. Eventually, a study was carried out, but only late in the Project. However, this study
was never linked to the needs of the Project areas nor did it drive any specific drought
management activity.

Findings of the Mid-Term Review and subsequent restructuring

The December 2006 Mid-Term Review (MTR) rated implementation performance and progress
towards the development objectives as moderately unsatisfactory. Progress on institutional
strengthening and on irrigation and agricultural development investments was at least moderately
satisfactory, but the slow progress on the non-agricultural investments, due to the administrative
difficulty of working across departments and to the non-availability of the FDR, was rated
unsatisfactory. The MTR also recommended bringing the governance bodies of the Project into
line with the INDH. Following the MTR, there was discussion of how the Project might be
aligned not only with INDH but also with Government’s new agricultural strategy (Plan Maroc
Vert) – for example, as a ‘pilot project’ for the second pillar of that strategy, which was
concerned with largely non-commercial farming. However, no agreement was reached, and
eventually Government and Bank decided that it would be best simply to meet the commitments
made to communities under the approved PICs, and to revise the PDO and define precise
outcome indicators accordingly. A formal restructuring along these lines was effective in
December 2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

M&E design. Project design provided for monitoring of physical and financial aspects of Project
activities to be carried out at the local level, involving communities in the process, and for M&E
of outputs and impacts to be conducted by the central Project unit. At appraisal, the definition of
output indicators was conventional and complete. Some outcome and impact indicators were
                                                 8
appropriate (e.g. number of villages accessible all year round) but others were either limited in
their significance (e.g. number of committees established) or only vaguely attributable and hard
to measure (incomes have increased and inter-annual variations are reduced). No indicators were
proposed that would have given an idea of progress or results on the strengthening of
implementation capacity component. After the MTR, the Project was effectively scaled down,
and more precise indicators were established to measure results of a less ambitious Project.

M&E implementation. An M&E system was designed by consultants but was not implemented.
The proposed baseline surveys were never conducted. In practice, monitoring was mainly based
on administrative reporting including information on physical and/or financial execution of the
activities, with some none too reliable indications on outputs or outcomes. No data on impacts
were collected. De facto evaluation was ‘qualitative’, mainly done during supervision missions
and was based on the information included in the PICs, on administrative reports, on field
interviews and on discussions with the central Project Unit.

M&E utilization. There is no evidence that M&E served as a management tool, supporting
decision-taking and thereby improving efficiency, as had been proposed in the PAD. The
proposed participatory M&E, a key element in the participatory approach, could have sustained
knowledge and engagement of the community throughout the Project period, but this was never
implemented.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment

The Project was classed as Category B, with two OPs triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP
4.01) and Pest Management (OP 4.09). An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared, and
disclosed in March 2002. The EA identified potential positive and negative impacts as well as a
broadly defined set of mitigation measures through the preparation of an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP), including a training program and a generic environmental monitoring
checklist.

Throughout implementation, the safeguard management performances and the compliances with
the OP were rated satisfactory, with the exception of the last ISR, in which the safeguard
management performance and the compliance with OP 4.01 were downgraded to moderately
satisfactory, justified by the lack of regular follow-up from the Central Project Unit.

Notwithstanding this overall satisfactory evaluation, there were several shortcomings. Due to
changes in the composition of the Central Project Unit, the electronic version of the EA went lost.
What can seem a very minor problem proved to have large implications in the knowledge of the
environmental framework among the Project stakeholders. Due to this, and because of the
institutional arrangement of the Project, a lack of systematic approach in dealing with
environmental issues was noted. The environmental monitoring checklist which was supposed to
be developed by typology of investment was never produced, and the Project was carried out with
virtually no environmental M&E. Nonetheless, the measures designed in the EMP were
addressed in the implementation of specific investments (e.g. inclusion of environmental
requirements in contracts).

A number of environmental issues were picked up during supervision. Issues related to rural
roads and related infrastructure were generally satisfactorily dealt with except in the case of one
bridge. Issues related to by-products of olive oil production were dealt with only partially, and a
recommended study was never carried out. A study on the use of chemicals to remove shrubs
confirmed the environmental suitability of the operation, although doubts remained over the
                                                 9
extent of due diligence checks. Issues on drinking water quality in schools and on the
environmental impact of bush soil clearing were raised but appear to have led to no action on the
part of the Project.

As information on environmental impacts was limited, the Project conducted a study in 2011 to
assess the baseline scenario and the environmental impacts of the Project, and to produce a guide
on how to factor environmental issues into the Project. The study concluded that the Project had
limited negative environmental impacts, mainly reversible or temporary, and anyway
compensated by the positive socio-economic benefits for the population. The ICR evaluation
generally agrees with this assessment. The study recommended mitigation measures for the
limited (observed or potential) negative environmental impacts noted. However, as the Project
has closed it is unlikely that there will be action on these relatively minor measures. Similarly, it
is hard to see what will be the use of the environmental guide, although this is of good quality.

Procurement

Based on a procurement assessment and on a satisfactory procurement plan for the first two years
of the Project, the overall procurement risk was rated low at appraisal. During implementation,
the procurement plan was periodically updated, often with delays due to the large number of
decentralized procurements. The main findings of supervision of procurement were: (i) delays in
procurement due to late notification of the budget, particularly the FDR; (ii) inexperience in
handling procurement at the provincial level; and (iii) lack of competition amongst suppliers of
goods and services at the local level. Supervision missions emphasized the need to improve
performance at the local level through training, and some training was provided by the Bank.
Post-reviews of a sample of contracts conducted during supervision revealed considerable delays
in the procurement process and frequent difficulties at the local level of obtaining sufficient
responsive bids. This led to a rating of moderately unsatisfactory during the last two supervision
missions. Overall, the judgment of the Bank’s fiduciary team is that, despite the very significant
delays, overall procurement performance was moderately satisfactory.

Financial management

At appraisal, the proposed financial management arrangements were judged satisfactory, with a
‘medium’ level of risk due to the decentralization of implementation to seven provincial Project
units. During implementation, risks were managed through detailing of procedures in the
Procedures Manual, capacity building, and initial close supervision. Adequate controls and
checks were in place to ensure the integrity of transactions. The main problems arising were: (i)
very slow opening of budget credits, particularly for the FDR which was often not available until
the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year; (ii) slow pace of actual spending, due to delays in
the procurement process; (iii) sometimes erratic application of the Procedures Manual; and (iv)
delayed and sometimes unsatisfactory audit reports. These problems were in part resolved
through very active follow up by the staff of the Central Project Unit but performance in the
provinces continued to lag, with ratings slipping to moderately unsatisfactory by 2009, and with a
downgrade to unsatisfactory at the final supervision in December 2011. Overall, the judgment of
the Bank’s fiduciary team is that performance of financial management, financial reporting and
auditing was moderately unsatisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Operation of Project-financed public goods is the responsibility of the Communes as sub-project
sponsors or of the line ministries. In most cases, the new socio-economic infrastructure assets
have already been taken over by the relevant ministry (Health, Education) or are under
community management (water points). At least some assets (school buses in Taroudant) have
                                                 10
not yet been put to use due to administrative problems. As always in Morocco, the highest risk
on public goods relates to rural roads. Here active dialogue is going on to get the Departement de
l’Equipement to ‘adopt’ those roads not already under its management, or to organize with
Communes for maintenance or with a group of Communes in the case of inter-Commune links,
but at project closing there was no guarantee that this would actually happen.

In the case of private or quasi-private goods, notably for income generating activities, operation
and maintenance is assured for those sub-projects operating profitably. In the case of the several
failed or at-risk sub-projects, arrangements are being made to recuperate the assets and to confide
them to groups that can make a more efficient enterprise out of them. However, at least one at
risk sub-project (an oil mill to be run by a woman’s association in Tata) has no clear prospects of
ever operating.

Regarding the bigger question of ‘the future of integrated rural development’ and of the Project
model, the rapid changes in the policy and institutional environment leave open the question of
whether follow up will be attempted. An evaluation of Morocco’s whole experience with
integrated rural development is underway but the signs are that the success of the INDH, the PCD
initiative, and the new strategic approaches of the Ministry of Agriculture (now MAPM) leave
little room for relaunch of a large scale integrated rural development program. However, the
inclusion of a sizable allocation for the FDR in the 2012 budget, together with the return to the
Ministry of Agriculture in 2012 of the mandate for rural development and current plans to
establish a new Rural Development Department in the Ministry, may provoke further reflection
on this. Essentially, the ‘next phase’ questions here concern how pro-poor agricultural
development will fit within the new context provided by the PMV, the INDH, and the PCD, and
what will be the role of the Ministry of Agriculture in rural development vis-à-vis other agencies,
programs and instruments.
                                       3
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

At appraisal, the Project was the spearhead of a high priority national agenda for integrated rural
development, the flagship of the Government’s 2020 Rural Development Strategy, and was thus
highly relevant. Today, strategic thinking and practice in Morocco have moved on. The agenda
of the Ministry of Agriculture is now growth and poverty reduction through market-oriented
agriculture rather than integrated rural development. The main themes of integrated rural
development – decentralization, integration, participation - are still highly relevant, but with the
advent of other mainstreamed approaches – INDH, PCD – it is clear that the objective is being
attained by alternative means.

What remains highly relevant in the Project is the focus on agricultural growth as the leading
element in development of poor rural communities. INDH and the PCD initiative offer support to
socio-economic infrastructure, but agricultural growth will remain the leading vector of rural
development and poverty reduction. Recent initiatives under the PMV are designed to meet the
need for investment and support to agricultural growth, but it remains to be seen whether the
instruments put in place (ADA, etc.) can reach the poor and isolated communities which have
been the focus of the integrated rural development thrust.

 The relatively low disbursement rate reflects the fact that the Moroccan government pre-finances all investments and
has not drawn on the Bank loan for the entirety of those investments.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO, as revised after the MTR, is quite modest, essentially the objective for a small, area-
based agriculture and rural development project adopting an integrated and participatory
approach. The revised PDO indicators are also restricted to specific local results of Project
investments. There are three components to the PDO: (i) development of rainfed-based
agriculture; (ii) improved access to basic infrastructure and socio-economic services; and (iii)
adoption of an integrated and participatory rural development approach. The table below shows
target and actual values and the percentage achievement of the target.

Of the three ‘outcomes’ making up the PDO, for the first - development of rainfed-based
agriculture - Indicators 1-4 suggest mixed results. On the irrigation, the revised target of
hectares improved was met, but only some schemes actually showed an extension of the irrigated
area or higher productivity. On the pastoral, out of a program of 20,500 ha, only 9,400 ha of
pasture improvement was achieved. The shortfall was largely due to land tenure questions and to
community inability to provide protective fencing during the establishment period. It is
surprising that these problems were not identified up front and resolved. By contrast, 98
agricultural/livestock water points were improved, compared to targets of 80, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the Project in delivering improvements that fit within local socio-cultural and
economic conditions. On the agriculture, it appears that the low number of only 30 pilot farmers
adopting new technologies reflects performance in only one Project area, and that data for other
Project areas is not currently available. The adoption rate was apparently limited by the delays in
the availability of research results, most of which became available only right at the end of the
Project. Overall, it is apparent that, despite the formulation of the PDO – development of rainfed
farming – it was the development or improvement of an assured source of agricultural water that
proved the most sought-after investment. The delays in the development of new technology and
the relatively low achievements on specifically ‘rainfed’ investments like pasture improvement,
land clearing, de-stoning etc. (indicators 21-22) suggest that the Project contributed less than
expected to the demonstration of pathways to improved productivity in purely rainfed farming.

For the second PDO ‘outcome’ - improve access by local populations to basic infrastructure and
socio-economic services - Indicators 5-8 suggest generally satisfactory results. On access to
potable water, against a target of 25 douar (and PIC previsions of 34 douar), 20 douar were
provided with water by the end of the Project. Delays in preparation of the studies with ONEP
and procurement and contractual problems contributed to the delays and resulted in the shortfall.
Regarding access to health services, the PIC provided for eight ambulances in five provinces, and
despite considerable procurement difficulties (e.g. three frustrated tenders at Khemisset), all eight
were purchased and are in good use. Nine health centers were to be upgraded in two provinces,
and the works were successfully completed in eight of them. However, whether these two

                                                     12
outputs led to the result of 30% additional visits to health centers may be questioned, as may the
reliability of the 30% number itself. For improved access to education, 30 schools were to be
constructed or improved, and two school buses purchased. In the event, 42 school sub-projects
were delivered, one college constructed, and the two school buses were acquired but have not yet
been used. Certainly part of the 22% increase in school attendance can be attributed to these
outputs, particularly for girls, for whom separate sanitary facilities were provided in many
schools. Regarding all-weather access to isolated rural communities, physical outputs included
four bridges and 131 km of rural roads (target 110 km). Undoubtedly these outputs contributed to
the ‘desenclavement’ of the douar in question.

For the third element of the PDO - an integrated and participatory rural development approach -
there is no outcome indicator to measure results. However, Intermediate Outcome Indicators # 9
(number of governance bodies operating at commune and province level), # 10 (number of PICs
prepared and executed), # 11 (amount of FDR funding), # 13 (number of agreements with local
partners), # 15 (number of new local associations), and # 16 (number of trained beneficiaries) all
measure aspects of the participatory process and all show the targets set at MTR met or exceeded
(see Annex 2).

However, as most aspects of the participatory approach merit a qualitative rather than a merely
quantitative evaluation, an in-depth assessment of the quality of the participatory process and the
Project’s institutional development impacts was carried out during the ICR mission (see Annex 5
for highlights). On the participatory process, the assessment concluded that:
 The Project developed and demonstrated an exhaustive participatory planning process,
    although the consensus is that this could have been considerably shortened and executed at a
    fraction of the cost. Heavy reliance on consultants materially contributed to quality, but also
    to delays, to a ‘distancing’ of the bulk of the population from the process once the diagnostic
    phase was over, and to over-complexity of data and their subsequent inaccessibility to the
    vast majority of the population.
 The Project helped a dynamic of participatory planning to emerge in the target communities,
    and this has facilitated the launch of the INDH and the PCD processes.
 The quality of decision-taking certainly improved, and ownership of the resulting investments
    by the population was strong, except in one or two cases where extraneous ‘political’ factors
    interfered.

On the institutional development impacts of the Project, the assessment concluded that:
 The Project had an impact on the development of the mainstream participatory planning
    model in Morocco. Government and Bank staff involved in the Project contributed
    significantly to the design of the INDH, drawing on the Project’s design and early
    implementation experience.
 The Project strengthened the strategic capacity of local decision-makers and public services.
    Decision takers definitely gained strategic capacity in participatory diagnosis and in
    managing public contracts, as well as experience in putting together cofinancing for large
    infrastructure, and skill in matching available projects or funding sources to the priority needs
    of the Communes. This capacity served them well in INDH and in PCD. The Project also
    contributed considerably to the capacity of public services at the provincial level – and to a
    lesser extent the local level - to work together with communities on investment programming
    and implementation (the EPP). Potentially lasting relations between these services and the
    Communes were forged. In addition, the Project certainly strengthened the capacity of the
    technical staff of the Communes.
 The level of knowledge of the public fell short of what was expected. A disappointing aspect
    of the Project is that after the diagnostic phase, the involvement of most of the population fell
    away rapidly. Little or none of the vast wealth of knowledge and ideas collected during the

                                                 13
    participatory process remained in the community. All of it was in reports in French. The
    proposed participatory M&E could have sustained knowledge and engagement, but this was
    never implemented.
   Overall, participation of local people in planning their own futures was greatly strengthened.
    Despite the falling off in involvement of the population as a whole after the diagnostic and
    decision-taking phases, two factors suggest that the participatory process has ‘taken hold’ in
    the Communes involved in the Project. One, of course, is the fact that most of the
    Communes are participating actively in the broader national processes of INDH and PCD.
    The other is the considerable number of associations and cooperatives set up under the
    Project which continue to be active.

This analysis, taken together, supports an assessment that the Project broadly achieved its revised
outcomes and met the PDO but with shortcomings. It has to be said that the results targeted after
MTR are relatively limited in relation to the size of the Project and to the effort that went into its
preparation and implementation. In particular, the assumption at appraisal that the Project would
result in an institutional structure and operational program for participatory rural development in
rainfed areas that could be scaled up nationwide has been disappointed. The results eventually
produced are those of an effortful but small-scale and localized rural development project. Set
against this assessment is the prospect that the Project can still be an important learning
experience (but only if the lessons are analyzed and learned).

3.3 Efficiency

At appraisal, an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was calculated for each Project area,
based on expected increases in agricultural production. The average EIRR for the whole Project
was calculated as 15%, with one third of the benefits coming from the olive oil sector, and 70%
from the higher potential provinces of Khemisset, Sidi Kacem, and Khouribga. However, no data
to show production impacts of the Project at completion have been collected. The economic
analysis done for this ICR (Annex 3) therefore concentrates on other objectively verifiable factors
showing cost effectiveness. The major conclusions of the analysis were:
 The average cost per hectare under the Project for rehabilitation and improvement of small
    scale irrigation is slightly below the cut off point for economically viable projects generally
    applied by the Ministry of Agriculture (DH 19,000 against a cut-off value of DH 20,000). In
    this sense, the small-scale irrigation component was efficiently executed. However, the
    impacts of better water control provided by the Project varied considerably, and were in some
    cases limited. Out of five schemes examined in detail: (i) two showed an extension of the
    irrigated area; (ii) three gave evidence of more intensive production and hence higher
    productivity; and (iii) three schemes showed a measure of diversification into higher yielding
    or higher value crops.
 Investments in rural roads were also judged ‘efficient’, with all projects proving less costly
    than the ceiling generally adopted by Government for eligibility (DH 5,000/inhabitant), with
    the exception of the roads at Tata, which were over-designed in relation to the population
    served.
 Regarding agricultural investments, there was no basis for economic evaluation of soil
    conservation projects financed. However, one of the two projects reviewed in the economic
    analysis was well designed and built on experience of similar projects in recent years, whilst
    the other did not meet these conditions, and was already in fact partly degraded at the time of
    the ICR mission visit. There was a wide variation in the sample of five agricultural
    processing projects examined: (i) one project was appropriately designed and was working
    well; (ii) two projects were incomplete (and in one case with poor prospects of successful
    operation); and (iii) two projects had already ceased activity.
 There was a similar range of results in the public service investments reviewed. Three tests
    were applied: (i) did the investment facilitate access to the services? (ii) did the investment
                                                 14
     reduce the costs of providing services or of accessing them? and (iii) did the investment make
     the services more efficient? Although only qualitative information was available to the
     mission, there were clearly some excellent and efficient investments such as the college at
     Ouneine, whilst other investments were lower yielding. It should, however, be noted that the
     projects were selected by the communities, and although considerations of efficiency were
     key, community choices resulted from a ranking determined by local priorities.

In addition to the above review of efficiency, the Project certainly produced institutional
development results (see above) as well as intangibles and externalities hard to quantify, such as
social capital, preservation of cultural heritage and traditional lifestyle, reported slowing (or
apparently even reversing) rural-to-urban migration, and the development of tourism.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Despite implementation delays and some cost over-runs, the Project broadly achieved its revised
PDO – as measured by the revised PDO indicators – although with shortcomings. In addition,
the Project produced important lessons and models for the participatory process, and created
institutional capacity.

Efficiency is harder to measure, as the M&E system did not provide an information base for a
thoroughgoing economic analysis of sub-projects. What assessment was possible suggests
shortcomings ranging from moderate (for example, for irrigation, roads, health, and education) to
more significant shortcomings, for example on agricultural processing investments, where the
failure rate appears to be high. The overall efficiency of the Project as a vehicle for delivering the
investment program was relatively low, as implementation was slow and costly in relation to the
assets and impacts delivered.

It is perhaps on relevance that the assessment is the most problematic. On the one hand, much of
the original relevance of the Project as a flagship for a new national program in integrated rural
development has been swept away by wholesale changes in the policy and institutional
environment. On the other hand, the Project foreshadowed much broader national programs and
their participatory methodology, and at completion can still be a rich source of further lessons and
methodologies. In particular, the Project potentially provides a learning platform for how support
to agricultural growth with a pro-poor focus can be integrated into or paired with the kind of
community-driven development support being provided under INDH or the PCD. However, this
key question was not specifically addressed under the Project as it derives from the new strategic
and institutional context (PMV, INDH, PCD). If the post-evaluation study process now
underway within the Ministry of Agriculture can draw answers to this question from the Project
experience, it will provide an ex post boost to the relevance of the Project. Pending the results of
this study, a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is conservatively proposed. This rating is also
influenced by the fact that the PDO was revised so late in the implementation period, so that in
principle the outcomes have to be assessed against both the original and the revised objectives,
with considerable weight given to the earlier formulation because that governed the Project for
the bulk of its implementation period.4

 ICRR Guidelines Appendix B Rating the outcome of projects with formally revised objectives require evaluation
against the original objectives as well as the revised objectives, with the weight given to results against the original
PDO determined by the proportion of disbursements up to the date of formal revision – in this case about two thirds.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The specificity of women’s role and their marginalization (vulnerability due to lower
education level, limited land ownership, limited decision making power within the household)
were well evaluated in the PAD and appropriate design measures were put in place to help
women’s voice to be heard during the diagnostic and decision-taking processes. This included
hiring both men and women community workers and designing sessions by gender. However,
during implementation, actual practice appears to have varied considerably by area. In some
areas diagnostic sessions were held separately for women, but at the time of the ICR mission it
was hard to find a woman who attested to having taken part in any of these sessions. At the
decision-making stage, the process was generally opaque, and it is impossible to tell whether
gender-specific investments had a higher or lower chance of being selected. Nonetheless, it
should be noted that some investments specifically targeting women were retained in all sites.

The PAD foresaw a number of investments specifically tailored to women’s interests and needs,
including local small-scale revenue and employment-generating activities (handicrafts, livestock)
and improvement of basic services (maternal health, child nutrition, women education). The ICR
evaluation concluded that women received direct benefit from investments financed under
Support to local initiatives (for example, establishment of women cooperatives and associations
and the establishment of a number of revenue earning projects) and marginally under Agricultural
and pastoral development (for example, distribution of animals at household level). Women
received indirect benefit from investments under Rural infrastructure development (specifically
rural roads and other infrastructure). While these investments were meant for the whole
population, they provided some distinctive benefits for women groups: (i) water points reduced
the time women and girls spent fetching water, freeing them up for other activities; (ii) school
construction and rehabilitation certainly benefited girls, although there are no firm data on
numbers. In particular, provision of clean toilets separated between boys and girls (e.g. in Tata)
helped to keep girls in school after puberty, and construction of new schools (e.g. in Taroudant)
allowed many more girls to attend. (iii) improved accessibility through the construction of roads
and the purchase of minibuses and ambulances provided a specific benefit for women’s access to
education and health services. For example, while no numbers are available, the beneficiaries
met during the ICR mission confirmed that increased accessibility played a very important role in
reducing the risks in childbirth. (iv) women particularly benefitted from microcredit activities
(e.g. in Sidi Kacem, 60% of beneficiaries were women borrowing for small-scale revenue and
employment-generating activities). By contrast, women did not specifically benefit from
investments in agriculture, as these investments usually targeted agri-food chains employing
mostly men.

Despite this generally positive assessment, there are questions over sustainability of some
investments, due to: (i) the weakness of some of the women’s associations and of the capacity-
building mechanisms that should support them; and (ii) the poor design and feasibility of some of
the revenue-earning projects.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

Risks to the sustainability of Project investments in rainfed agriculture and in basic infrastructure
and socio-economic services are discussed above (2.5): they are assessed as Moderate. Risks to
the learning about the integrated and participatory rural development approach are at present
Significant, given that the major national programs that could have benefited – PMV, INDH,

                                                 16
PCD – have paid little attention to the Project. This risk can, however, be managed by
appropriate action in the coming months and years, beginning with the ongoing
post-evaluation study process now underway within the Ministry of Agriculture (see 3.4 above).

There are also risks to the institutional capacity created. At the community level, the risk is Low,
as this capacity is now harnessed to successor participatory planning and implementation
processes (INDH, PCD). There is, however, a Significant risk for the associations and
cooperatives, many of which need further institutional support if they are to be sustainable. Risk
over the sustainability of capacity within public services at central, provincial and local level is
also Significant: already at the completion of implementation, teams imbued during the Project
with the integrated and participatory rural development approach have been disbanded. Overall,
the risk has to be assessed as Significant.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank devoted considerable effort to a sustained dialogue with Morocco on integrated
participatory rural development and on the 2020 Rural Development Strategy, and furnished a
comparable level of effort to the design and appraisal of the Project, which was to spearhead
implementation of the Strategy. Appraisal took into account global and country lessons and
Project experiences. The technical, economic, social and fiduciary assessments were sound, as
was the appreciation of most risks. The institutional assessment at appraisal was based on the
Government’s own existing and proposed organizational arrangements for integrated rural
development, as well as on Government’s intention to reorganize field services in support of the
Ministry of Agriculture’s lead role in integrated and participatory rural development. Support to
this restructuring was therefore appropriately built into the Project. There were, however, two
significant shortcomings in appraisal. First, the expectations of early deconcentration proved
over-optimistic, and this resulted in considerable implementation delays. A second weak point at
appraisal was the absence of a simplified methodology for participatory diagnostic and planning
(such as Rapid Rural Appraisal) that could have produced the PICs more quickly and led more
efficiently to the delivery of investments.5 Overall, in the light of these shortcomings, Bank
performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Supervision inputs. The Bank provided an appropriate supervision budget and fielded regular,
well-staffed multi-disciplinary supervision missions with a good degree of continuity. During
implementation, just two team leaders were responsible, one of whom had participated in
appraisal, and both team leaders took part together in a number of missions. Regular site visits to
all Project areas were made. A fiduciary team working out of the Country Office ensured support
and capacity building on procurement and financial management, even if the central Project Unit
remarked the insufficient training and sometimes some delay in handling the non objection for
procurement. One gap was the lack of an environmental specialist in the team except for the
penultimate mission.




5
    INDH subsequently demonstrated that this kind of rapid diagnosis could produce satisfactory results.
                                                           17
Supervision quality. Supervision was conducted as a joint activity with Moroccan partners and
had a problem-solving approach. Bank missions actively supported efforts to get organizational
structures set up, capacity building underway, and initial contracts awarded. The Bank followed
implementation closely, constantly raising issues and proposing solutions to implementation
issues. The aide memoires are concise, pragmatic and thorough across all technical and
organizational aspects, and there was transparent and consistent feedback at central, provincial,
and local levels.

Areas of greater and lesser impact. Overall, the Bank had a strong impact on getting
implementation going and in ensuring that components were executed as designed. Areas of
lesser impact were: (i) M&E, where the team could have done more to ensure that a baseline was
assessed, the system designed was operational, and that reliable information was produced and
put to use in decision making. At the local level, the Bank could have done more to ensure that
the proposed participatory M&E was implemented, as this could have sustained knowledge and
engagement of the communities after the initial diagnostic phase; (ii) environment, where more
consistent supervision could have picked up the limited familiarity of involved stakeholders with
the EA requirements, and suggested easy-to-implement mitigation measures; and (iii)
disbursement, where closer follow up on the disbursement request and on the respect of the
procedures could have resulted in higher disbursement rates and lower rate of rejection of
disbursement requests. Overall, supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Management failure in strategic dialogue. The most disappointing aspect of supervision was at
the strategic and policy level. For long, the Bank continued to press Government for clarity on
how the 2020 Rural Development Strategy was to be implemented, beyond the time when
Government's strategic thinking had already moved elsewhere. By 2005 it should have been clear
that the Ministry of Agriculture had moved on from its erstwhile focus on integrated rural
development towards a new emphasis on commercial agriculture, and that the initiative on
participatory planning and community driven development had passed to the INDH. This was the
moment for the Bank to engage in a fresh dialogue with Government on a joined up pro-poor
integrated and participatory rural development strategy and on agriculture’s role within that
strategy. The Project might then have been restructured within the new strategic context.

Given that such a dialogue would have concerned several ministries and involved Government
policy as a whole, it was up to the Bank’s Country and Sector Department management to turn
what was a problem at the level of the Project into an opportunity at the level of the nation. In
fact, an excellent paper (annexed to the May 2006 aide memoire6) was prepared by Bank staff on
how to adapt the Project to the new context of the INDH. However, the recommendations in the
paper were not taken up. The subsequent arrival of the PMV created a further set of adaptation
challenges, which again were not taken up, and in any case the issues required a high level
dialogue, not just a technical analysis. This critique is sharpened by the fact that the Bank soon
became actively engaged in separate dialogues and financial support to the PMV and to the INDH.
This aspect of the Bank’s contribution during implementation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall, Bank performance at appraisal and during supervision was Moderately Satisfactory. The
quality and level of effort were high. However, the growing separation of the Project from the
strategic context in which it was operating and which was its raison d’etre progressively reduced
the relevance of the operation and showed up a lapse in the Bank’s supposedly broad-based
policy dialogue with Government.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Although Government commitment to the Project was initially strong (see 2.1 above), this
commitment began to dissipate early in the Project’s life. Delays in effectiveness resulted from
slow Government procedures. By the time implementation got underway in 2005, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Project’s sponsor, was already moving on different lines, whilst a parallel
initiative of participatory programming, INDH, was getting off to a rapid start. To the credit of
Government, some working-level adaptation to the new reality of this major ‘royal’ program was
made, and this was beneficial to both INDH and the Project.7 However, more generally,
Government commitment to the Project steadily diminished, so that by the time of the ICR
mission, engagement was barely discernible at any senior level, either in Rabat or in the
provinces. Other than the adaptations noted, Government made no real attempt to review or
restructure the Project in the light of the new policy and strategic context. The on-going post-
evaluation may provide an opportunity to learn lessons for future application, but this comes too
late for the Project itself. At the same time, Government was remiss in failing to ensure the
efficient working of the FDR. For these reasons, Government performance is rated
Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At the outset, Project units were set up in Rabat and in each of the Project provinces. On the
whole, these units functioned effectively, although aide memoires frequently note that there were
too few staff, or that staff turnover was excessive. At central level there were certainly too many
changes of staff – including the departure of all three most senior staff in 2005. At provincial
level, performance varied, depending on the commitment of the staff and on the level of support
from the governor, but generally there was sufficient capacity and dedication. Cooperation
amongst agencies worked reasonably well, although again this varied by province. The
Département de l’Equipement tended to be more centralized and its provincial offices had little
flexibility to work outside agreed plans. Procedures were not regularly updated. Staff struggled
with cumbersome procurement, financial management and reporting procedures, resulting in slow
implementation and reporting. The biggest challenge was the FDR, to which staff in the central
Project unit devoted inordinate amounts of time. Considering the extent of constraints and lack of
support from decision takers, overall implementing agency performance was characterized by
commitment and energy, and is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Rating: Moderately
Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Moderately Satisfactory performance of the Project units does not counter-balanced
the Moderately Unsatisfactory contribution at Government level, thus the average rating is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

  In the six communes where both programs operate, the decision was taken to adopt the CLDH as the decision-taking
body. The respective investment programs were aligned, or in some cases cofinancing arrangements were worked out.
In some cases (especially Taroudant), the commitment of the governor and provincial level public services to the
participatory process ensured that both programs were essentially implemented in a complementary way.

6. Lessons Learned

Too long a process of planning reduces efficiency. The participatory planning process needs to
be adapted to its purpose: in the case of ‘basic needs’, short cuts can produce a list of priority
investments very quickly. Many stakeholders asserted that such a list could and should have been
produced during the preparation process, which could have got the Project off to a quicker start.
Longer processes of planning can be used to develop a vision of long term development, but even
here the process should be intelligently deployed: a quick diagnostic to develop a ‘vision’ can
then be built on during more detailed participatory study processes later on.

A rolling program refreshed annually like INDH may generate more participation and ownership
than a ‘once for all’ program like the Project. The general opinion of the population consulted
during the ICR mission was that the INDH ‘small but regular’ approach was more appropriate,
perhaps because it made the participatory programming process into a permanent ‘rolling’ one,
allowing the participatory habit to grow, mistakes to be corrected etc. In the ‘once for all’
approach of the Project, many people seeing an investment delivered in 2011 could not make the
connection with the diagnostic in which they had participated in 2005.8

A participatory planning process is only really empowering if it builds accessible knowledge and
transparent decision-making. Making information accessible to all is a key element in the
participatory process The vast bulk of the rich information collected under the Project is hidden
in reports in a language not even notables in the Commune can understand, quite inaccessible to
the population and leading to a ‘distancing’ of people from the communal plan and from the
participatory process in general. All information should be available locally, and key information
should be available in readily understandable formats. The process remained opaque by which
decisions were taken on the sub-projects to be financed by the Project. The criteria for choosing
amongst competing claims should be set from the outset, but then the decisions themselves
should be entrusted to a transparent and open local governance mechanism.

Dependence on consultants makes the participatory process longer and more expensive. It also
reduces the capacity building impact within public services, and undermines the confidence of the
population in the process and the consequent decisions. The use of consultants might be best
limited to areas requiring specialist expertise such as: supervision of the diagnostic phase;
formation of a strategic vision; or in-depth technical studies.

The economic analysis shows a way to streamline sub-project programming and evaluation.
Some types of investment proved generally economically sounder than others. Strengthening of
capacity and provision of public infrastructure were generally economically sound investments,
whereas investments in private goods, such as processing of agricultural produce, proved riskier.
If there were clearer upfront definition of the eligible projects and their efficiency parameters, this
would make programming more efficient and ease the task of post-evaluation.

Integrated rural development does not necessarily require integrated implementation. The Project
showed the value of a single participatory planning process to identify a community’s range of
needs, and this lesson has been mainstreamed (in INDH and PCD). However, it may be better in
the Moroccan situation to leave implementation to the agencies concerned in direct concert with
the communes rather than try to deliver them as an integrated package, which led during the
Project to considerable implementation challenges. The experience of the Project (and its sister
irrigation-based project) suggests that, at least for basic services (education, health, water

    One Commune chose to allocate the lion’s share to irrigation, as ‘we know this is our one chance’.
                                                            20
supply..), the value added of the integrated approach compared to the sectoral approach is
questionable, especially considering the difficulties related to coordination between different
ministries. There may, however, be merit in integrated implementation of complementary
activities having an impact or synergies with agricultural production such as: irrigation, flood
protection, pastoral development, rural roads, marketing, agro-industry.

When the strategic and policy context involves several sectors and is evolving, there needs to be
continuous review of the implications for operations. The chances of the Project having its
intended impacts were reduced when the strategic context in which it was conceived changed. At
the same time, the question of how to fit pro-poor agricultural investment within a participatory
planning framework such as INDH or the PCD process remains open. With some intelligent
adaptation, the Project might have contributed to identifying and testing options. Government
and Bank should maintain continuous dialogue and strive to re-engineer operations to test new
approaches within new strategic contexts.

The Bank should certainly engage fully in the on-going post-evaluation of the integrated rural
development experience (see 2.5 above). Key questions are: (i) how pro-poor agricultural
development will fit within the new context provided by the PMV, the INDH, and the Plan
communal de developpement; and (ii) what – if anything is the future of the FDR?


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

The implementing agency submitted specific observations on the draft ICR which have been
reflected in revisions to the text. Overall, the implementing agency considered the project
satisfactory, because of the extent of assets created and their impact on productivity and improved
livelihoods. Whilst there is no dispute regarding these achievements, the Bank’s more
conservative rating of moderately unsatisfactory also takes account of the mixed results as
measured by the indicators, of the relatively low efficiency of the Project, and of concerns
regarding the relevance of the Project’s objectives to Morocco’s current strategies for integrated
rural development and agricultural growth. The implementing agency also considered that
changes in the Bank team were partly responsible for implementation delays. However, with just
two team leaders from the Bank side (with the second leader having also participated in both
appraisal and supervision prior to taking over), and with a single sector manager for most of the
implementation period, this contention is not borne out by the facts.

    Comments: The revised target of hectares improved was achieved. However, only some schemes actually
    showed an extension of the irrigated area or higher productivity.

    Indicator # 2         Additional pastoral areas where the land has been improved and pasture growing
    Value                                                                     20,000 ha           9,390 ha (47%)

    Comments: The shortfall was largely due to community inability to provide protective fencing during the
    establishment period. [RA: 15]

    Indicator # 3       Additional improved water points used for agricultural/livestock purposes
    Value                                                                       80                98 (122%)

    Comments: An apparently unsatisfactory result. However, the numbers reflect performance in only one area.
    Data for other Project areas is not available.

    Indicator # 5          Additional villages (douar) with access to potable water
    Value                                                                          25                20 (80%)

    Comments: Against a target of 25 douar (and PIC previsions of 34 douar), 20 douar were provided with water
    by the end of the Project. Delays in preparation of the studies with ONEP and procurement and contractual
    problems contributed to the delays and resulted in the shortfall.

    Indicator # 6            Additional visits to health centers
    Value                                                                          + 20%               + 30% (150%)

    Comments: The PIC provided for 8 ambulances in 5 provinces, and despite considerable procurement difficulties
    (e.g. three frustrated tenders at Khemisset), all 8 were purchased and are in good use. Nine health centers were to
    be upgraded in two provinces, and the works were successfully completed in eight of them (see Indicator # 26
    below). Whether these two outputs led to the result of 30% additional visits to health centers may be questioned,
    as may the reliability of the 30%.

    Indicator # 7          Additional children attending school
    Value                                                                         + 20%                  + 22% (120%)
    Date achieved                                                               12/31/2009                 12/31/2011
    Comments: In the PIC, 30 schools were to be constructed or improved, and two school buses purchased. The
    Project delivered one new college, 42 school upgrades, and two school buses, in excess of targets. Certainly part
    of the reported increase in school attendance can be attributed to these outputs, particularly for girls.

 Comments: Physical outputs included four bridges [RA: 23] which were executed and 131 km of rural roads
 (target 110 km, see Indicator # 24 below). Undoubtedly these outputs contributed to the ‘desenclavement’ of the
 douars in question. [RA: 28]

 Date achieved                                                             12/31/2009              12/31/2011
 Comments: The CPDH and the CLDH were set up in the context of INDH in 2005-7, and were formally adopted
 as the decentralized governance bodies for the Project in an amendment of October 2008. They replaced the DRI
 specific structures foreseen in the PAD, and exercised the same functions adequately. However, in view of the
 independent process by which they were set up, they cannot really be considered outputs of the Project.

 Indicator # 10         Number of PICs prepared and executed
 Value                                                                              7                    12 (170%)
 Date achieved                                                                 12/31/2009               12/31/2011
 Comments: The PICs were generally of good quality, and the UGP prepared excellent summaries. They can be
 counted as one of the significant achievements of the Project, serving as the basis for a prioritized investment
 program, and creating capacity at communal level for the processes of participatory diagnostic and programming,
 and for dialoguing with third parties on development needs and financing. They have also served as a source of
 proposals for both the INDH programs (ILDH) and for the recent development of Plans Communaux de
 Developpement (PCD). Three caveats: (i) as the PICs were prepared with consultants, the permanent capacity
 building effect on MAPM and other staff was limited; (ii) the process of preparation was extremely heavy,
 expensive and time consuming; and (iii) community ownership and use of the vast amount of material produced
 by the consultants is very limited (usually only the 1-2 page investment plan is known by the community) – not
 least because the entire exercise is written up in French. Also, it is not clear why the target is 7 PICs, when 12
 had already been prepared at the time of the 2009 restructuring.

 Indicator # 11      Amount of FDR funding for non-agricultural activities (as a percentage of the total PIC
                     amount)
 Value                                                                    30%                   31% (102%)

 Comments: The indicator suggests that the FDR performed as planned. However, the mobilization and use of
 FDR resources caused long delays and cost huge administrative effort.

 Indicator # 12      Additional funding in PIC zones (as a % of the total PIC amount)
 Value                                                                      20%                     Unknown

 Comments: These agreements not only provided a useful mechanism for Project implementation but also helped
 build civil society capacity (albeit with varying results). According to the RA [RA 19-20], 45 agreements were
 concluded, as follows: livestock 20; agriculture 3; PMH and AEP 7; women’s centers 6; micro-credit 3; tourism
 2; oil pressing 2; and honey production 2.
 These agreements included important Project inputs [RA: 16], including:
           Distribution of 456,000 tree seedlings in all seven provinces (target 525,000)
           Provision of six oil presses to coops and associations (target nine presses)
           Supply of 1,178 sires, largely within a framework agreement with ANOC (target 925 sires)
           Supply of hives and bee colonies

  Comments: This is a successful achievement of the Project, although the associations are of variable capability
  and sustainability. The strongest are local branches of national associations, the weakest are the associations
  created specifically for a Project enterprise. For these associations, sustainability is doubtful. In all cases, follow-
  up support is needed.

 Comments: Across all seven provinces, 13 training contracts were put in place for: coops, associations, young
 entrepreneurs, local actors, UGP etc. The training program was well designed, and it was generally of good
 quality and much appreciated. The decentralization of training to each Project area created extra costs and led to
 overlap in preparation of modules and variable quality of training delivered.

 Comments: Six agreements were signed with INRA to prepare and conduct a program of applied research and
 demonstration. These agreements were successful completed in two phases. Agreements were concluded and
 satisfactorily implemented in all but one province: only in Errashidiah was no agreement concluded or work
 carried out. [RA: 9-10] UGP staff considers that these local agreements initiated a practice of local partnership
 between research and MAPM. The future of such local agreements remains to be defined as Morocco restructures
 its approach to research financing.

 Comments: Demonstrations were successfully conducted and a series of workshops for evaluation and
 dissemination were carried out. [RA: 10-11] Questions arise concerning: (i) dissemination under the Project (see
 the low number of farmers adopting at Indicator # 4); and (ii) arrangements for future dissemination, given the
 restructuring of MAPM’s approach to extension currently underway.

 Comments: A study for establishment of an early warning system was to be set up. The initially-proposed
 partners – ONS, DPV – declined to implement the activity, and it was eventually assigned to the DAF. After two
 unsuccessful tenders, the study was finally absorbed into a broader risk management and agricultural insurance
 study which was carried out in 2010. [RA: 7-8] Its impact on risk management practice remains to be seen. In
 addition, meteorological equipment was acquired for five provinces. [RA: 8]

 Comments: While the target was largely exceeded, a limited number of pilot farmers adopted the improved
 technologies (see Indicator # 4 above), and there is no guarantee that other farmers will pick them up, considering
 also the unclear arrangements for future dissemination, given the restructuring of MAPM’s approach to extension

 Comments: A program of 155 km was agreed in the PIC, and overall this target was achieved. It is not clear why
 a target of 200 km was set at the time of the 2009 restructuring, as the PICs were already approved at that date. In
 addition, 71 stilling basins and 22 diversion structures were built, and 14 springs were improved. [RA: 13]

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

This annex is dedicated to economic reanalysis of the Project following the ICR mission carried
out in April 2012. First, it provides the results, methodology, and limitations of the analysis
integrated in the initial PAD. Second, it displays an efficiency analysis of the main activities of
the Project, classified according to the economic nature of goods and services provided. Third, it
identifies factors producing ''externalities'' of integrated rural development projects, and at last it
draws lessons and makes some recommendations to improve the efficiency of rural development
actions.

The above table contains conclusions of this assessment of actions efficiency in separate areas of
actions (public goods, private goods, public services, and externalities). The table also presents
the main underlying factors of the assessment and levers for efficiency improvement.

The main lesson learned from the study is that there are efficiencies to be yielded in rural
development by: (i) refocusing interventions on publics goods, adopting users accountability
approaches in maintenance; (ii) adopting competitive procedures for the selection of production
support actions; and (iii) defining a territory-based public tender offer, identifying priorities
eligible for funding in terms of components and agriculture/local development integration model.

Initial economic analysis

The economic analysis carried out during the preparation and appraisal missions included a
comparison between costs and anticipated benefits of the Project. The study only took into
consideration benefits related to agricultural production increase (crops and livestock) in the six
priority action zones. This increase model was established on the basis of assumptions pertaining
to: (i) increase in yields; (ii) slight increase in acreage due to the reduction of fallow land; (iii)

                                                   28
shift from low-value crops, mostly cereals, to higher value crops such as livestock fodder and
fruit and vegetables; and (iv) increase in meat production in pastoral areas. The costs estimated
during preparation have been reviewed and ' adjusted'' to keep only costs related to these benefits.

The report outlines the results of the analysis and estimates the Net Present Value (NPV) and the
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for each priority action zone and for the entire Project over 20
years. The resulting ERR for each priority action zone varies from 6 to 28 percent. It amounts to
15 percent for the entire Project, which corresponds to a NPV of 64 Million DH10.

The underlying assumptions for the above analysis do not completely correspond to the effective
implementation of the Project, regarding both the costs and the benefits. On the costs side, there
is an underestimation of costs for the agricultural component as well as an inclusion of costs for
another component related to drought management that was eventually abandoned. On the
benefits side, the breakdown by zones and sectors does not correspond to the achievements of the
Project, including the overestimation of the contribution of the olive oil sector (33% of benefits)
and those of irrigated priority action zones (70% of Project benefits should come from the
provinces of Khemisset, Sidi Kacem, and Khouribga).

Efficiency of the main components

The Project monitoring system does not provide data measuring the benefits as they were
anticipated in the PAD in terms of agricultural production and income. The following analysis
distinguishes interventions relating to local public goods, agricultural production, and public
services.

Interventions relating to local public goods

Investments for the rehabilitation of local public goods are justified by the profitability of
activities they support or by expenditure savings they allow. The non-exclusive nature of the
benefits provided by such goods is an unfavorable factor when it comes to the management of
rehabilitation investments by direct users and provides additional justification for public
investment.

The analysis is based on unit costs ratios compared with current standards and field observations
collected during the mission.

Rehabilitation of small and medium irrigation systems (PMH)

The cost of the agricultural sub-component of the Project (B1), as revised, amounted to 187
million DH, half of which were dedicated to the rehabilitation of PMH systems (95 million).

The table below presents data from reports consulted 11 during the mission. It provides
information on physical outputs and costs of PMH system rehabilitation in each province. It
calculates an average unit cost in DH/ha, comparable to the threshold for eligibility in similar
projects selected by the Department of Agriculture and amounting to 20,000 DH/ ha (Northern
PMH).

To this end, the actions of the Project in PMH mark an efficiency in terms of acceptable cost,
with an average of 19,000 DH/ha.

However, the limit of such an indicator is that the unit cost ratio can not reflect the disparities
found during the mission in relation to the enhancement of the value of PMH investments
implemented by the Project. The mission noted significant disparities, depending on areas, in the
three factors of irrigated production growth after rehabilitation namely: (i) expansion of the area;
(ii) intensification of production; and (iii) diversification of cropping patterns. The table below
provides a qualitative assessment of the presence of these factors within the visited areas.

Rehabilitation and development of rural roads

The cost of the Project infrastructure sub-component (B2), as revised, amounted to 85 million DH,
of which nearly half was dedicated to the development of rural roads (about 40 million including
the bridge of Tissaf).

The eligibility threshold of opening up projects adopted by the DRCR and the Bank in the PNRR
completion report (December 2011) for roads supporting traffic of less than 30-50 vehicles / day
amounts to 5 000 DHS per beneficiary. Applying this standard to the Project, it appears that costs
of actions implemented in Tata are unjustified in light of this criterion, since the total number of
beneficiaries is expected to reach 2 000. Costs in other provinces remained within reasonable
limits and therefore gave good cost-efficiency values.

Subsidies for agricultural production

The following comments are based partly on the consulted literature 15 and partly on the
observations of the mission. They do not concern the totality of the actions in the sub-component,
and focus on soil conservation activities carried out on private plots, including in particular the
distribution of olive plants and the construction of oil extraction units.

Soil conservation

The economic justification of subsidies for soil conservation is to improve behavior relating to
land use patterns without taking into account depreciation effects caused by erosion and potential
loss of production associated to it.

Conservation and improvement actions identified and scheduled in the PIC have finally been
partially implemented (59% of the initial target of 17 826 ha of agricultural land), according to
the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

   The cost includes the part financed by the rural commune from NIHD Funds or in vertue of the loan from the “Fonds
d'Equipement Communal? (FEC).

                                                                   thanks to irrigation supply.

                                                                   erosion control. Many basins are damaged
                                                                   by plowing.

If the results of conservation investments in terms of erosion reduction are “moderately
satisfactory? or “'satisfactory?', where the erosion risk is low (less than 20% slope), then the
economic justification of the extra cost of anti-erosion structures is doubtful. However, these
difficulties have been widely documented in the literature on assessments of previous projects in
the same zones, since the fifties with fruit SCR, the sixties with the DERRO Project, the seventies
with the integrated development projects, the eighties with watershed management projects, the
nineties with Natural Resource Management (NRM). In fact, one of the perimeters visited by the
mission was the subject of several developments before the Project, with inconclusive results.

Distribution of production processing units

The distribution of production means and/or processing inputs is justified, a priori, by the
elimination of constraints hindering operators’ capacities in intervention zones to create and
retain a significant part of the added value, which infrastructure investments can generate.

To make this justification fully operational, production means distributed in the action zones of
the Project must be timely used and adapted to the purpose of the creation / retention of the added
value. The table, hereafter, summarizes observations of the mission during visits to olive oil units
financed by the Project in three provinces and observations collected in implementation agencies.

Without being exhaustive, this table shows that certain minimum efficiency requirements have
not been met. On this subject, as stated above, experience gained in previous projects has not
been considered in the formulation of success preconditions for such investments.

Public service support

Public services support actions are justified by the increased number of beneficiaries and by the
reduced cost of service per beneficiary. This is generally achieved by interventions that aim either
to lower the cost of access (transport and proximity) and the cost of use (equipment of
agglomerations) or to increase the performance of services (appropriate research). From an
economic perspective, however, the desired effect goes beyond the access and must take into
account the quality of public services in question (health, education, research).


                                                      32
The efficiency of the Project implementation depends as such on other sectors’ contributions and
on the quality of local coordination.

Observations and accounts collected by the mission are consistent with what was mentioned
above, insofar as according to the quality of cooperation and coordination, it was possible to
implement efficient actions (Ouneine college), actions with no effect (wall surrounding under-
equipped or under-supervised health centers), or actions with delayed effect (research).

Main external effects

The adoption of an integrated territory-based approach by the Project involved an
additional cost, compared to sectoral approaches. This additional cost was supposed to be
compensated by the positive externalities in the form of an inter-sectoral synergy and an
accumulation of “knowledge and skills''' favorable to local development in less favored
rural areas.

Experience has shown the relevance of this approach to the two considered points. Regarding the
inter-sectoral synergy, the project implementation revealed the diversity of indirectly productive
agriculture functions in each representative type of situation of development zones.

The accumulation of knowledge and skills is an intangible, difficult to assess process. According
to assessments presented in other sections of this report, the Team for participatory planning and
the communal councils were and are still able to deploy this capital for rural development
purposes.

Lessons and Recommendations

The first lesson is that the efficiency of the Project depends on the nature of goods and services
provided by the interventions.
 The main costs of the project consisted in capacity building and rehabilitation of existing
    infrastructures (PMH, rural roads, and water points). These actions, generally economically
    useful and efficient, concern “local public goods?. The management of these “local public
    goods?, involving direct beneficiaries more or less organized, could be improved in terms of
    sustainability.
 Actions pertaining to the distribution of direct or indirect subsidies to private operators (land
    improvements, distribution of various means of production, etc.), were marked by very
    disparate economic performance.
 For actions relating to public services support in the priority action zones
    (research/development or equipment of schools or health centers), efficiency remains
    uncertain because it is conditional upon resources mobilization outside the scope of the
    Project.

                                                     33
The second lesson concerns the potentially significant influence of externalities on the economic
justification of agricultural development actions, particularly in the poorest zones in terms of
resources.

If the concept of rural development remains relevant, then its implementation requires the
definition of a policy that sets out areas concerned, eligible components according to area, and
agricultural development models consistent with the diversity of agriculture functions, according
to area. As long as the ''priorities'' of local communities correspond to components and reference
models formulated in advance, it would become possible to move to a more efficient
programming, in terms of timing, integration, and local actors’ accountability.

This approach, rather a program than a project, would give more “responsibilities? to local
communities and more guarantees to the “State? in terms of efficiency of expenditures incurred
under rural development.

Annex 5: Evaluation of the participatory process and related institutional
development

The Project and the participatory process

The Project was the first attempt in Morocco to apply participatory planning at the level of the
rural commune and to prepare a communal investment plan in a consultative way at the level of
the commune. At the time of appraisal, this was seen as an innovative approach to improve local
governance by ‘responding to the real needs of beneficiaries, thereby ensuring the
appropriateness and sustainability of investments’. At the time of the ICR, an evaluation of the
effectiveness of this approach was made by assessing three aspects: (1) the effectiveness of the
participatory planning procedures; (2) the creation of lasting capacity; and (3) improvement in the
quality of decisions.

The effectiveness of the participatory planning procedures

A review of the documentation on the participatory planning procedures reveals a very exhaustive
process of collecting information and consulting the population. However, almost none of this
information is accessible to the local population. The use of consultants certainly aided the
quality of the data, but also impaired the process of building ‘ownership’ of the process and of the
resulting decisions – beneficiaries describe the participatory programs as the results of ‘studies’
rather than of a participatory dynamic. The exhaustive nature of the process took a very long
time to complete (2-3 years) and cost a lot (DH 2.5 million, compared to DH 250,000 per PCD).
Nonetheless, in some cases the length of the process allowed a continuity of dialogue within the
community on priorities.

Overall, the conclusion is that the participatory process would have been much faster and cheaper
without compromising the quality. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the resulting
PIC were essentially just lists of quite standard investments that could almost have been put
together without such a lengthy process. Essentially, the participatory process identified a series
of ‘technical’ problems’ and the PICs comprised a series of technical responses to those problems
(e.g. an olive mill to bring processing nearer to the point of production). Proof of this is that the
range of projects selected was very limited, and varied little between PICs.

The creation of lasting capacity

Nonetheless, there was certainly a strong participatory dynamic, with many participants involved
(in one commune, the planning meeting at commune level lasted four days!). In this process, the
involvement of ‘outsiders’ – an inter-ministerial technical team in each province (the équipe de
programmation participative, EPP), consultants – improved the quality considerably, particularly
in involving the more marginal members of communities. Overall, the involvement of external
actors brought some benefits, but reduced efficiency and sapped the confidence of the community
in the process.

Many also thought the planning process too long – they would have preferred a ‘quick diagnostic’,
and then more in-depth diagnoses once the priorities were clear, or in-depth technical studies at
the time of implementation.




                                                 37
And improvement in the quality of decisions

The quality of the decision-making process can be judged by two criteria: the technical soundness
of the choices made, and the ‘ownership’ of those choices.

Generally, the projects selected were technically sound and well-adapted to needs and the
environment. In terms of ‘ownership’, in almost all cases there was agreement amongst
beneficiaries consulted that the PICs corresponded to their real identified needs. In two cases,
however – Khouribga and Khemisset – unrelated local ‘political’ issues led to conflicts over the
selection of investments and hence to lower than expected levels of investment.

Institutional development impacts

Three points were examined: (i) strengthening of the strategic capacity of decision takers; (ii) the
level of knowledge of the public; and (iii) strengthening participation of local people.

The strategic capacity of decision takers

Decision takers definitely gained strategic capacity in participatory diagnosis, in managing public
contracts, experience in putting together cofinancing for large infrastructure, and skill in matching
available projects or funding sources to the priority needs of the communes. [This served them
well in INDH and in PCD]

The Project also contributed considerably to the capacity of public services at the provincial level
(both provincial staff and provincial level-departments of central ministries) to work together
with communities on investment programming and implementation (the EPP). Lasting relations
between these services and the communes were forged.

In addition, the Project certainly strengthened the capacity of the technical staff of the commune.

The level of knowledge of the public

A disappointing aspect of the Project is that after the diagnostic phase, the involvement of most of
the population fell away rapidly. One aspect of this is that little or none of the vast wealth of
knowledge and ideas collected during the participatory process remained in the community. All
of it was in fat reports in French. The proposed participatory M&E could have sustained
knowledge and engagement, but this was never implemented.

Strengthening participation of local people

Despite the falling off in involvement of the population as a whole after the diagnostic and
decision-taking phases, two factors suggest that the participatory process has ‘taken hold’ in the
communes involved in the Project. One, of course, is the fact that the communes are participating
actively in the broader national processes of INDH and PCD. The other is the considerable
number of associations and cooperatives set up under the Project which continue to be active.

Links to subsequent participatory development programs

The Project has the advantage to have been the first, pioneering Project to graft the participatory
planning process onto the structure of the rural commune – and the disadvantage that before the
Project had developed the approach, it was rapidly overtaken – even engulfed - by nationwide
programs that adopted a similar methodology: INDH and PCD.

                                                 38
Convergence with INDH

There are two linked and very distinct differences between the Project and INDH: (i) the Project
had a much bigger budget per commune, giving the possibility that if the vision and investments
could be correctly identified, there could be a quantum leap in the commune’s development
prospects; and (ii) linked to that, the Project was essentially a ‘once-for-all’ approach, whereas
INDH had a smaller but annual budget which is expected to continue over at least three five year
phases. The general opinion of the population consulted during the ICR mission was that the
INDH ‘small but regular’ approach was the more appropriate, perhaps because it made the
participatory programming process into a permanent ‘rolling’ one, allowing the participatory
habit to grow, mistakes to be corrected etc.

To the credit of the Project, adaptation to the new reality of this major ‘royal’ program was both
rapid and beneficial to both. In the six communes where both programs operate, the decision was
taken to adopt the CLDH as the decision-taking body. The respective investment programs were
aligned, or in some cases cofinancing arrangements were worked out. In some cases (especially
Taroudant), the commitment of the governor and provincial level public services to the
participatory process ensured that both programs were essentially implemented in a
complementary way.

It is clear that the participatory planning process of the Project contributed to the efficiency of
development of the ILDH and to its quality.

Continuity with the new process of commune-level strategic planning

In a 2009 revision of the Charte communale, all communes were required to go through a
participatory planning process and to come up with a Plan communal de developpement (PCD).

This decision can be seen as an effect – or at least a vindication – of the Project’s choice of the
commune as the level for planning and of the participatory approach adopted. Certainly, the
Project experience in participatory planning has made the same exercise relatively easy for the
communes in preparing their PCD. Again, the capacity and habit of public agencies at provincial
and local level in working with communes on these approaches resulted in part from their
experience under the Project.

Thus, the Project prefigured both INDH and PCD approaches, although the extent to which it
actually influenced them is hard to determine precisely.

Lessons

Too long a process of planning reduces efficiency. The process needs to be adapted to its
purpose: in the case of ‘basic needs’, short cuts can produce a list of priority investments very
quickly. Longer processes of planning can be used to develop a vision of long term development,
but even here the process should be intelligently deployed: a quick diagnostic to develop a
‘vision’, that can be built on during more detailed participatory study processes later on.

Dependence on consultants makes the process longer and more expensive, reduces the capacity
building impact within public services, and undermines the confidence of the population in the
process and the consequent decisions.

Recommendations are: (i) limit the use of consultants to areas requiring specialist expertise such
as : supervision of the diagnostic phase; formation of a strategic vision; or in-depth technical
studies; (ii) define the criteria for choosing amongst competing claims, but then entrust the
                                                  39
decisions themselves entirely to the local governance mechanism; and (iii) ensure at all costs that
everything is ‘given back’ to the community through meetings, the development of accessible
documentation etc.

Annex 6: Summary of Borrower's ICR and Borrower’s comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower’s ICR provides a record of Project implementation and outputs which has
helped with the writing of the Bank’s ICR. The implementing agency also submitted
specific observations on the draft ICR which have been reflected in revisions to the text.
Overall, the implementing agency considered the project satisfactory, because of the
extent of assets created and their impact on productivity and improved livelihoods. The
implementing agency also considered that changes in the Bank team were partly
responsible for implementation delays.
