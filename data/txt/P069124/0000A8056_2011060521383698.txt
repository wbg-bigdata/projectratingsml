                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR includes the outcome of two supervision missions done respectively in November 5-12, 2010 and March 1-4, 2011. Implementation of the agriculture component is
                         satisfactory with 91% of the total budget of this component (184,2 Millions DH) already committed and 75 % paid. It is likely that the component PDOs will be achieved.

                         Unfortunately, implementation of the component financed by the Rural Development Fund (RDF) is still very much behind schedule despite the restructuring of the project and the
                         commitment taken prior to the restructuring. As of February 2011, only 48% of the total budget for this component (106,85 Millions DH) has been committed and 18 % has been paid.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         About 40 million DH remain to be committed as of February 2011. It is unlikely that the FDR funds will be disbursed before the project closing date (December 31, 2011). A decision
                         will therefore be made during the next supervision mission (June 2011) on whether to cancel or not some of those funds.
