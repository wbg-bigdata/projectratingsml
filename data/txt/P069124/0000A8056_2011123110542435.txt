                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project summary.
                         Appraisal started in May 2002. The project went to the WB Board in June 2003 and became effective in July 2004. It was restructured a first time in March 2005 to create a new
                         disbursement category for grants for sub projects. The second restructuring was done in June 2008 to adopt the same decision making mechanisms as INDH (Initiative Nationale de
                         Developpement Humain) in order to build synergies with INDH and simplify the multiple governance mechanisms created at the communal and provincial levels. A third restructuring
                         was done in January 2010 to cancel a portion of the loan, take into account the reform of the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries (MAPM in French, the name changed in
                         2010), extend the closing date until December 31st 2011 and revise PDOs and associated outcomes and corresponding monitoring indicators. The revised PDOs and indicators are
                         more realistic and consistent with the Moroccan administrative context and project activities, and quantifiable.

                         Background.
                         The project was designed to implement the 2020 Rural Development Strategy which was adopted in 1999. The Strategy provided a framework for interventions in rural space based
                         on four principles: (a) participation and transfer of responsibility to rural civil society, (b) decentralization and deconcentration; (c) adaptation of activities to the agro-ecological and
                         socio-economic specificities of each zone ("territorialisation" in French); and (d) coordination and integration of interventions by sectoral ministries.

                         The main activity of the project is to finance Communal Investment Plans (CIPs) prepared with the participation of beneficiaries in seven different rainfed-based agro ecosystems.
                         Each CIP includes two types of activities: agriculture-based income generating activities (including livestock and rehabilitation of small irrigation systems) and socio-economic
                         infrastructures (improvement of schools, health centers, rural roads etc.). The budget of the MAPM finances agricultural activities while the Fonds de Developpement Rural (FDR), a
                         fund under the authority of the Prime Minister but managed by the Governors, finances socio-economic infrastructures.

                         The project was implemented by seven province-level implementing agencies from the MAPM for agricultural activities, and by the provincial services of seven Governorates, with
                         support from a national project coordinating unit (PCU). The absence of effective delegation of power (deconcentration) from the central level to the provincial level, which was
                         necessary to efficiently implement this province-based project, resulted in project implementation being very slow and cumbersome: all decisions made at provincial level (decisions
                         regarding work programs of the provincial services, procurement decisions, approval of terms of reference for consultant or contractors, reporting of work done etc..) had to be
                         revised and approved by central units in Rabat for each line Ministry concerned. This generated long delays in contracting and contract execution.

                         It took three years to prepare the CIPs with the beneficiaries and to get them approved. Implementation of the Agricultural component of the CIP went well once activities were clearly
                         identified. Implementation of the socio economic activities identified in the CIPs faced additional delays since most of these activities were works that needed feasibility studies to be
                         conducted prior to contracting the firms to implement the activity, given the situation described above.

                         Because of efforts made by all parties, implementation has been catching up during the last year of the project and most of the revised PDOs are met with financing from the loan and
                         from the Government budget.

                         Financial Management.
                         Total project cost was 405,4 MDH including 272,2 MDH (25 M Euro) from the loan, 107,1 MDH from Government budget and 26,1 MDH from beneficiaries. Total project cost was
                         reduced to 390 MDH after cancellation of a portion of the loan (1.4 M Euro). The Ministry of Finance allocated a total of 363 MDH to the project. As of December 12, 2011, 305 MDH
                         (84 %) are committed and 250 MDH (82 % of the committed funds) are disbursed. The team expects an additional 40 MDH to be disbursed before December 31st 2011.

                         Disbursement from the loan remains very slow (42 % as of December 12, 2011), meaning that the Government has been re-financing project activities from its own budget. The
                         reasons for the delays in getting reimbursement from the loan include lengthy administrative procedures to gather the necessary documentation from all the provincial services

                         to help collecting these documents.

                         As of December 12, 2011, the Ministry of Finance is processing an amount of 53 MD to be disbursed from the loan and is expected to receive an additional 47 MDH to be disbursed

                         In 2005-06, the World Bank and FAO financed an evaluation of the implementation of the Rural Development Strategy through various projects, including two World Bank financed
                         integrated rural development projects (Etat des Lieux de la Mise en Oeuvre de la Stratégie de Développement Rural). In addition, for the completion of the project, the MAPM
                         contracted a firm to draw the lessons learned from implementation of all the different integrated rural development projects implemented in Morocco. The results are expected to be
                         presented in March/April 2012 on the occasion of the forthcoming project implementation completion mission.
