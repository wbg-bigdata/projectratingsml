PBIVATE SETR  DEVELOPMENT ADJUSTMENT LQAN
Loan Sumlmarv
goQlf:                 Jamaica
Amount:                US$75 million equivalent.
Terms:                 Payable in 17 years, including a grace period of 5 years at the
standard variable interest rate.
Loan DescCdon:         The proposed Loan would support the Government's program
to achieve rapid and sustained growth through private sector
development. Macroeconomic policies would primarily focus
on strengthening fiscal adjustment. Trade reform would
reduce tariff protection in stages in accordance with the
recently agreed Caribbean Community Common Extemal
Tariff, increasing international competitiveness and efficiency
of enterprises. The privatization program, which cuts across
many sectors, will open new activities for the private sector,
shift the Government's role from commercial and industrial
activities to the social sectors and reduce the fiscal burden of
Inefficient public enterprises. Complementary legal, regulatory
and administrative reforms will improve the business
environment to accelerate output and export response. The
loan would finance general imports, subject to certain
restrictions.
Disbursement Estimate:   The Loan will be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche
of US$40.0 million would be disbursed upon loan
effectiveness. The second tranche of US$35.0 million would
be released upon compliance with tranche release conditions,
expected within about twelve months from loan effectiveness.
Disbursement of the entire proposed Loan would be completed
within eighteen months of loan effectiveness.
Benefits and Risks:    The macroeconomic program, supported by trade reform and
privatization, will reduce the public sector's claims on the
economy's resources and help build investor confidence. Over



the medium term, trade reform, deregulation and privatization
will reduce barriers to entry, stimulate domestic competition
and efficient private investment, and improve resource
allocation. The program's social impact will also be positive
through employment creation in non-traditional labor-intensive
export sectors, less costly provision of goods and services,
and wider distribution of ownership. The major risks are the
Government's limitea margin of flexibility In macroeconomic
management given tne economy's vulnerability to external
shocks and the large debt overhang, timely implementatior' of
the fiscal reforms, continuation of public support to the
program, and sustaining the momentum of the privatization
effort as it involves more complex cases.
Financinag Plan:
IBRD                   $75.0 million.
Other 
Total                  $75.0 million.
Retroactive Financing:    Retroactive financing in an amount not exceeding US$15
million equivalent will be allowed on the basis of eligible
expenditures incurred after February 15, 1993.

INTERNATIQNAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIN AND2  DgLOPMEgT
tEPORQT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR
A PRIMATE SECTOR DEVMELOPMENT ADJUSTMENT LOAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Private
Sector Development Adjustment Loan (PSDAL) for the equivalent of US$75.0 million. It
will support the Government's (GOJ) adjustment program to restore macroeconomic
stability, reduce its debt overhang, achieve more rapid and sustained growth and improve
social welfare within the framework of an outward-oriented, private sector-led strategy.
The loan would have a term of 17 years including five years of grace, with interest at the
standard variable rate. GOJ's adjustment program is also being supported by an ongoing
IDB investment sector loan. GOJ has successfully completed an IMF Stand-by agreement
and the IMF Board approved a three-year EFF on December 11, 1992, for the total amount
of SDR 109.125 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY AND THE BANKS STRATEGY
-ackgEouS
2.        Jamaica is a rmiiddle income country with a per capita GNP of US$1,380
(1991). It is one of the larger Caribbean islands, with a total area of 11,000 square
kilometers (of which 45% is under agriculture). Its population has been growing at about
1.4% per year and now totals 2.4 million, with 55% of the population living in urban
areas. It is well-endowed with natural resources, has a relatively well-educated and skilled
labor force, and enjoys proximity to North American markets. However, significant levels
of emigration have taken place over the last two decades. During 1980-86 skilled worker
migration was equal to about 50% of the graduates from educational and training
institutions. The principal economic activities are bauxitelalumina mining and processing,
tourism, small-scale manufacturing and agriculture, together accounting for 55% of GDP,
50% of all employment and 75% of foreign exchange eamings. Mainly due to
bauxite/alumina sector needs, the Jamaican economy is highly energy intensive and fully
dependent on imported oil for its commercial energy generation and consumption.
Past Policies and Econ2Mic Performanc
3.        Jamaica exhibited significant volatility in its macroeconomic performance over
the past two decades, as a result of external shocks and inconsistencies in domestic
policies. The overall fiscal accounts were continuously disrupted, generating unsustainable
domestic and extemal imbalances. On the extemal side, the economy was adversely
affected by sharp changes in its terms of trade, rapid increases in the US dollar value of its
outstanding extemal debt because of the depreciation of the US dollar vis-&-vis other
OECD currencies, and declines in net foreign financing. On the domestic side, successive
governments acted to expand effective demand as a means of maintaining economic



2
growth In spite of adverse external shocks. These expansionary policies then had to be
followed by stabilization programs that sharply cut output growth. Delayed policy
response implied that significant distortions including high tariffs, iraterest rate subsidies,
discretionary duty exemptions, price and exchange vontrols and public monopolies were
not addressed. The end result was low efficiency of resource use and Investment, as
reflected by weak economic performance in spite of rather high Investment rates of over
20% of GDP. Moreover, the public sector expanded, crowding out the private sector and
increasing the external debt, which doubled between 1980 and 1985, reaching
US$4 billiorn. Poor performance led in 1986 to the cancellation of an IMF standby
arrangement, the suspension of Bank lending, and a halt to debt-rescheduling discussions.

was reviewed in OED's program performance audit report on the country. It concluded
that the Bank's three SALs to the country should have established a better balance
between domestic adjustment and foreign borrowing. Slower disbursement of those
adjustment loans, in line with the pace of reforms and the country's absorptive capacity,
might have been more appropriate. The SALs were actually disbursed before most of the
necessary reforms had been implemented. In effect, the high levels of support allowed
Jamaica to delay economic adjustment. Subsequently, the resulting increase in debt
service reduced the flexibility to deal with macroeconomic policy issues including
management of the balance of payments, fiscal deficits and the exchange rate.
5.        In 1986, GOJ began seriously to address the pressing economic issues.
Aided by a decline in oil prices and a recovery in mineral exports, the economy began to
expand with GDP growth of over 4% per annum during 1987-89. GDP growth would
have been higher had it not been for the devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert in 1988.
The external current account deficit was significar.tly reduced to an average of 7% of GDP
during 1987-89 from 1 1 % in 1980-86, while the overall public sector deficit was also
sharply reduced in 1986-87 to 5.5% of GDP. It widened again in 1988 to 13.5% of GDP
because of post-hurricane and election related increases in expenditures, financed mainly
from external sources. Government expenditures continued at high levels even though this
financing was transitory. As external flows began to toper off, the country's foreign
exchange reserves were gradually depleted.
6.        The Manley Government, elected in 1989, began to accelerate the pace of
reforms and reduce the size Lf the public sector and to rapidly remove distcrtions in the
incentive system. Interest subsidies were eliminated and the financial sector regulatory
framework and instruments for monetary policy were strengthened. Most prices and
marketing and distribution channels were deregulated, general food subsidies were
removed, most quantitative restrictions and trade monopolies were eliminated, and tariffs
were reduced to the Caribbean Community's (CARICOM) Common External Tariff (CET)
maximum of 45%. In September 1990, GOJ adopted a market-determined exchange rate
regime based on interbank transactions. Because GOJ did not tighten fiscal and monetary
policies sufficiently, the exchange rate began to depreciate rapidly and inflation increased.
In September 1991, GOJ eliminated all exchange controls and the rate rose sharply. By
April 1992, the rate had reached J$28 per US dollar, from J$5.5 per US dollar in late
1989, but thereafter it quickly recovered to the range of J$22-23 per US dollar, where it
has remained.
Remaining Reform Aaenda
7.        Macroeconomic Program. In May 1992 GOJ issued a Medium-Term Policy
Framework Paper (MTFP) for 1992/93-1994/95, prepared with Bank assistance, specifying
its economic and social development objectives for both the short and medium term. In
parallel, the Bank issued a review of Jamaica's Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP).
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed at the Board on March 25, 1993 in
conjunction with Reform of Secondary Education Project (Report No. P-5974-JM), provides
an updated description of the development agenda of GOJ. Achieving price stability is the
main short-term goal of macroeconomic policy. GOJ recognizes that, because domestic
prices are closely linked to the exchange rate, the key is to continue to stabilize the



4
exchange rate at competitive levels. This requires maintaining viable domestic balances
fully supported by strong fiscal measures. Any actions that increase expenditures will
need to be carefully matched with other measures to improve fiscal balance.
8.         Over the next three years at least, the achievement of the full reform agenda
as described in the NMTFP and the CAS, will require sustained improvements in the public
finances. This is crucial to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve the investment
climate, and speed up the supply response to the many sectoral reforms being undertaken.
GOJ will also need to generate a fiscal surplus (Table 2) so as to reduce the debt
overhang, arrest any remaining inflationary pressures and avoid the crowding out of the
private sector. Targets for fiscal surplus have been agreed under the IMF's Extended Fund
Faclity (EEF) agreement. On the revenue side, the country already has a large tax burden.
The main need is to rationalize the tax structure and make it less distortionary to improve
efficiency. The introduction of the General Consumption Tax in 1991 is a major step in
this direction, but there is need to further broaden the tax base, improve tax col!ections
and eliminate distortions through tariff and customs reforms. On the expenditure side,
GOJ needs to eliminate any remaining transfers and subsidies, introduce automatic, full-
cost recovery in all public utilities and provision of se-vices, including agriculture and
infrastructure, and focus its (targeted) subsidies on the very poor. It needs to continue
and accelerate its program of divesting assets and stock in commercial, financial,
agricultural and industrial enterprises. Nominal wage increases were not agreed upon until
near the end of FY92/93, and the payment of the increases, which were larger than
provisioned under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, was deferred until FY93/94.
Consequently, the budget for FY93194 will be tight, but the GOJ's Budget Speech in June,
is expected to announce the measures necessary to achieve this targeted overall surplus
for the fiscal year. In addition to the needed improvement in the public finances, the
achievement of the reform agenda will require other measures discussed below.

9.         Private Sector Development and Supply Response. Consistent with these
macroeconomic objectives, the GOJ's medium-term strategy is to reduce substantially the



5
size and scope of the public sector, and to stimulate efficient investment and growth In the
private sector. Thus, the remaining reform agenda focuses on further improvements In
efficiency, through trade policy reform, deregulation, privatization and the reform of the
legal-regulatory framework for business, creating an appropriate environment for foreign
and domestic investment. Import tariffs in Jamaica and other CARICOM countries
remained too high, lagging behind the rest of Latin America. This required strong actions
to reduce protection, which CARICOM agreed to in October 1992, following the lead of
Jamaica, among others. Government regulations and complex procedures continue to
constrain business activity. Reforms in this area will address the elimination of barriers to
competition, and streamlining of administrative procedures and institutions. The pub!ic
sector is still too large and the petroleum and sugar sectors where the public sector plays a
prominent role are still regulated. Inefficiencies in publicly-owned utilities (power and
water) contribute to hidden and explicit costs in the private sector. An extensive
privatization program covering utilities and a large number of commercially oriented entities
and services, together with the deregulation of sugar and petroleum sectors, constitute the
key components of the reform agenda.
10.       Poverty Alleviation and Human Resource Development. Longer-term
development prospects depend on progress in both these areas, after long years of
deteriorating social service delivery and increased poverty. The policy framework which
underpins the HRDP is now broadly appropriate to Jamaica's conditions and potential. The
challenges are to increase resources and improve the institutional capacity to implement
social programs. GOJ is committed to annually increasing the social sector share of non-
debt current budget, as well as increasing capital allocations for education, health and
nutrition in the PSIP from 13% in 1992/93 to 18% in 1994/95. GOJ will provide the
domestic finance required to utilize external funding, and streamline procedures for the
disbursement of both. The other main thrust is towards the rationalization of social
service provisions and increased cost recovery. Within the social sectors, GOJ is targeting
resources with the highest social rate of return. Recurrent expenditures for primary health
care are to be increased to 25% of the total; primary education already takes 38% of the
education budget. GOJ is considering the divestment of some hospital support services;
more community involvement in education; and improved administration of user fees.
Better program design and increased efficiency in the delivery of education, health and
nutrition services can make a substantial contribution to poverty allviation. However,
much depends ultimately on sustainable, broad-based growth to provide more employment
and increase resources for social programs.
11.       Extemal Financing Requirements. Jamaica's gross financing needs will remain
substantial. After allowing for increased real net direct foreign investment and for
continued IMF support, gross extemal disbursement needs are estimated at about
US$375 million per year for the next four years, which are covered by existing and
anticipated commitments. Even after the debt rescheduling agreed with the Paris Club in
January 1993, the burden of external debt service remains high. Increasing the share of
grants and concessional loans would substantially reduce Jamaica's debt overhang (and so
its debt-service ratios) by the latter 1990s (Tables 1 and 3).

12.          Bank Assistance Strategy. The Bank Group's current assistance strategy
concentrates on support of the objectives and policies expressed in the MTPF and the
associated PSIP, and in the CAS. The CAS has identified the following as the key
objectives for GOJ: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) improvement of private sector
confidence and expansion of private investment; (iii) development of the economic and
social infrastructure, tackling basic poverty issues and promoting environmentally sound
development policies. Support of the adjustment program emphasizes completion of
important aspects of the reform agenda (reduction of the size of the public sector through
privatization, deregulation and trade policy reform). The Bark Group assistance strategy
would help address the adjustment agenda through the proposed Loan, an additional
SECAL and a credit line, focusing on resuming macroeconomic stability and the
development of an efficient private sector. It would then concentrate on investment
lending in infrastructure, human resources and poverty alleviation programs, and the
environment. Equally important is our support in mobilizing other extemal assistance and
assuring its more effective use.
13.         Bank Exposure. Outstanding Bank debt peaked at US$735 million in 1987
and was reduced to US$633 million in 1992. Debt service payments to the Bank were
about 16% of MLT public debt (including IMF) and 5% of the value of exports goods and
non-factor services. The Bank has played a special role in recent years in providing policy
advice and mobilizing external resources. It would continue to provide a share of
Jamaica's large extemal financing needs that is appropriate to this role and responsive to
GOJ's improved performance.

PART II - PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRIVATIZATION:
POLICY. LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
A. Private Sector Structure and Performance
14.          Structure. The industrial survey of 1990 estimated that about 90% of
existing firms are privately owned. In the manufacturing sector, more than half of the
private firms, mostly small and medium size, are concentrated in the food, beverages,
clothing, leather and wood furniture sectors. The production base evolved under the
former incentive regime remains heavily concentrated in import substitution activities and
generally unprepared for international competition. Partly because of the small size of the
domestic market and of existing barriers to entry, private sector activity is highly
concentrated and vertically integrated. While about 90% of private firms are small or
medium size, employing less than 100 workers, the large firms (10%) play a dominant role
in production and distribution. In cement, flour and condensed milk, there are single
producers for each product, effectively operating as private monopolies.
15.          Export Performance. Between 1985-1991, the growth in the US$ value
of exports exceeded 13% per annum, even after recording a slight drop in 1991. Despite
a doubling of the value of merchandise exports during this period (from US$568.6 million
to US$1146.2 million), very little diversification away from traditional exports such as
bauxite, sugar and bananas took place. While non-traditional exports increased, traditional
exports expanded even faster, leaving the structure of exports virtually unchanged. The
share of traditional exports (bauxite/alumina, sugar, bananas), increased from 67% in
1985 to 78% in 1990 but declined to 70% in 1991, following the movements in the
bauxite price.
16.          Some product diversification among non-traditional exports, however, has
begun as new sectors such as data-processing, agro-industries, and wood furniture started
exporting, in addition to an expansion of clothing exports. Non-traditional exports have
developed largely in export processing zones (FTZ), benefitting from tariff concessions and
market access provided under programs such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).
Linked to these special arrangements, the US market attracts the largest share in
Jamaica's non-traditional exports (varying between 50%-65%). CARICOM trade-
consisting mostly of non-traditional exports- has been steadily declining since 1983 (5.4%
of exports in 1991), as non-traditional exports have been redirected to the US and, to a
lesser extent, to other non-CARICOM markets. Despite these developments, both market
and product diversification have remained marginal, indicating the need for intensifying
reforms to strengthen the export orientation of the economy.

B. Trade and Financial Sector Policies
Trade PYli: Proaress to Date
17.            Background. Until 1987, the trade regime was characterized by high non-
tariff barriers and import taxes (import tariffs and stamp duties), reference prices and a
complex regime of exemptions. Tariff rates (0%-70%) were largely based on the
CARICOM's CET, adopted in the early 1 960s. Tariff and non-tariff measures were
introduced to provide high protection within CARICOM as well as to generate additional
fiscal revenues for GOJ. Import licenses and taxes on competing Imports reflected
CARICOM's and Jamaica's protectionist policies; for non-competing imports, these were
utilized either to raise revenue or to manage scarce foreign exchange resources. Combined
with stamp duties, nominal protection rates exceeded 200% for many products, with
effective protection ranging from negative rates to 220%.
18.            In 1987, GOJ embarked on a trade reform  program  to phase-out most of the
existing distortions and improve the economy's competitiveness, supported by Bank
adjustment loans (TFSAL I, AGSAL and TFSAL II). The broad policy objectives adopted in
the 1987 trade liberalization program have been met.
19.            Non-Tadff Barriers. All protective import licenses and reference prices were
eliminated, except a few retained for security and health considerations. Most public



9
trading monopolies (trade boards) in the agriculture sector were deregulated.1 More
importantly, the extensive import monopolies of the Jamaica Commodity Trading Company
(JCTC) were eliminated in 1991. JCTC's monopoly had extended over 34 product groups
accounting for 8% of imports, including fish, milk (solids), com, rice, lumber, fertilizer,
pharmaceuticals and motor vehicles, many of which were heavily subsidized. JCTC's role
has been reduced to a procurement agency for commodities imported under bilateral trade
agreements when foreign governments specifically request JCTC to perform these
functions. Since then, for most of these products private sector importers and
procurement companies have taken over the trade from JCTC as intended. Motor vehicles
are now imported directly by individuals or dealers after the payment of applicable taxes
and duties, which entitles them to an import certificate.
20.       Import Monopoly for Petroleum Products. One of the two last remaining
public trading monopolies (along with sugar) is the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica's
(PCJ) subsidiary Petrojam, which has a de facto monopoly over imports of crude oil and
petroleum products. The monopoly is maintained through import duty and excise tax
exemptions for PCJ and its subsidiary Petrojam, while prohibitive import taxes are imposed
on other importers. Only Bauxite and alumina companies besides PCJ can import
petroleum products duty/tax free, through tenders. While domestic distribution and retail
margins in the petroleum sector have already been deregulated, ex-refinery prices are still
set by Petrojam.
21.       Export Licenses. Most export licenses have been eliminated. The remaining
17 items include sugar exported by the Sugar Industry Authority (SIA) to preferential
mnarkets (see paras. 42-43); pimento, exported by the Pimento Board, and fats and edible
oils subject to CARICOM trade arrangements. Petroleum products and motor vehicle
exports also require a license. This also includes health and security related items, such as
ammunition, or commonly banned articles such as crocodile eggs. These are administered
by the Trade Board and verified by the Customs.
22.       Stamp Duties. All stamp duties have been removed, with the exception of
those on agricultural products for protective purposes. Agricultural stamp duties are
presently being phased out gradually, over a 3 to 7 year period, as agreed under the
Bank's Agricultural Sector Loan (AGSAL). The remaining agricultural stamp duties apply to
25 products including some fresh vegetables, apples, fresh chicken and turkey wings and
legs, some meats, fruit juices and jams (meals).
23.       Tariff Reform and the Present CET Structure. The reduction of tariffs in
Jamaica has been constrained by CARICOM's earlier highly protectionist emphasis and
domestic concems for losing fiscal revenue. Following long CARICOM negotiations to
reform and simplify tariffs, a revised CET was adopted in February 1991, bringing tariff
rates from a 0%-70% range to 5%-45%. Jamaica was among the first to adopt the 1991
CET while some of the smaller Caribbean countries have only implemented it recently. The
1991 CET tariff structure (5%-45%) has a few exceptions at 50% and 70% and 368
tariff positions at 0%. The average tariff rate is 20.3% and there are 6 tariff levels
I    A few trading boards, such as the Coffee Board, continue to exist to manage exports.



10
including zero (see Table 8). In 1991, zero-rated imports constituted about 45% of all
duty paying imports and 23% of all imports 2, As a result, 79% of tariff revenues was
collected from 28% of merchandise imports (Table 5). This structure has maintained the
high and uneven effective protection ingrained in the trade system. Effective protection is
estimated to range between negative rates and 200% for low value-added (20%)
products. A built-in distinction between competing and non-competing imports, which is
designed to protect not only Jamaica's local industries but import-competing industries in
the whole region, increased the variation in effective protection even within similar product
groups (Table 6). A product is classified as a competing import when production capacity
exists within CARICOM for 75% of total CARICOM demand. These products attract
substantially higher tariffs than similar non-competing imports.
24.          Exemptions. In 1987 (under TFSAL I), duty-exemptions directed to import
substituting industries were abolished. The remaining exemptions are limited to imports of
firms exporting 100% of their output (including tourism) and charitable organizations.
Imports of firms exporting 100% of their output located in FTZs, benefitting from special
regimes such as CBI, constitute 12% of total imports. Imports under tariff concessions for
the importation of raw materials, intermediate goods and capital goods of other (partial)
exporters make up an additional 17% of merchandise imports.

Trade Facilitation: Progress to Date
25.          Duty-Drawback Scheme. Despite past efforts to establish an effective duty-
drawback system to ensure cost-competitiveness of exports, Jamaica does not yet have
an efficiently operating scheme in place. The former "7.5% export rebate system", an
export subsidy, was eliminated in 1990, under the IMF standby program. The duty
drawback system which replaced the export rebate has proven to be cumbersome and
inefficient, and has so far been used only by a small number of exporters. The absence of
Zero rated products (365 tariff positions) include basic food and educational products, pharmaceuticals
as well as plastic raw materials, all agricultural inputs, some petroleum products and some basic metals.



11
a comprehensive regime offering a full range of schemes, including duty suspension,
bonded warehouse and duty drawback options, leaves an important gap in GOJ's export-
facilitation policies.
26.       Anti-Dumping Measures. In 1990, GOJ began a review of the existing anti-
dumping legislation. It was modified in 1991 to address its major weaknesses and
inconsistencies with the GATT. A full review of the Anti Dumping Act has recently been
completed, under a technical assistance program supported by the IDB and the Bank, to
make it fully consistent with GATT articles and procedures and minimize the possibility of
its being used as a protection device. GOJ has accepted these recommendations and final
revisions of the Act have been completed. The revised Act is expected to become
effective during FY 1993-94. Given that dumping has not been a significant issue for
Jamaican producers and that GOJ has resource constraints, GOJ has agreed to keep the
Anti-Dumping Commission fairly small.
27.       Customs Administration. The inefficiency and widespread discretionary
practices of the customs administration have become a major bottleneck and a source of
chronic private sector complaints. The Customs Department has suffered from
organizational weaknesses and its staff has lacked discipline and management skills. High
tariff levels, tariff concession schemes prone to discretion and a dispersed tariff structure
have created strong incentives for corruption. In turn, the Customs Department's inability
to enforce the official rates continues to adversely affect GOJ's revenues. Massive under-
invoicing of imports still prevails. GOJ initiated a customs administration reform program
in 1989 (supported by TFSAL II) to address these problems. However, the reforms had
initially been introduced very slowly and the program has lacked focus on trade facilitation.
Moreover, high import tariffs have continued to favor discretionary behavior in customs
administration. Recently, GOJ intensified its efforts and accelerated the reorganization of
the customs administration, assigning new management, downsizing personnel, re-training
staff and introducing new control systems to improve revenue collection. Red and green
lines have been introduced at all entry points to speed up clearance of particularly informal
commercial importers (ICls), but the system needs further fine-tuning. While positive
results have been achieved and some benefits from recent improvements have begun
reaching targeted groups of traders, a considerable challenge awaits GOJ to successfully
complete the modemization of its customs administration.
Financial Sector Reforms: Progress to Date
28.       The Bank supported substantial financial sector reforms under two Trade and
Financial Sector Adjustment Loans (TFSAL I in FY87 and TFSAL II FY91) which focused
on interest rate policy, strengthening the tools for monetary policy and establishing a
satisfactory legal-regulatory framework. The reforms, which have eliminated existing
distortions in the financial sector, are summarized below. As most of these reforms have
either only been introduced recently or are still in the implementation stage, their full
impact can not be fully observed as yet. Further fine-tuning of financial sector policies
would be assessed and addressed in a follow-up investment operation.
29.       Interest Rates. Supported by AGSAL and TFSAL II, all remaining interest rate
controls have been removed, moving to market determined interest rates. Interest rate



12
subsidies have been eliminated, except those for small farmers (through the Agricultural
Credit Bank (ACB)) and for low income housing (through the National Housing Trust
(NHT)); under the new policy, subsidies for small farmers have also been reduced
significantly. Currently, funds channelled through ACS are at variable interest rates and
bear an interest rate equal to the treasury bill rate, which is below the final market lending
rate charged by commercial banks on all other loans to industrial and commercial
enterprises and large farmers by about four percentage points-the average spread of
commercial banks and other financial intermediaries. The auction mechanism for treasury
bills and certificates of deposit (CDs) was improved to reflect market forces.
30.       Reserve Requirements. Reserve positions of financial institutions are
determined by two policy instruments, i.e., the cash-reserve requirement and the liquid
asset ratio (inclusive of the cash reserves). While cash reserves are non-interest bearing,
liquid assets consist of CDs and government paper which bear auction-determined interest
rates. Under TFSAL II, GOJ began moving towards equalizing the cash-reserve
requirements for commercial banks and merchant banks at 17% by December 1993.
However, under the IMF's EFF, as part of the stabilization measures, the reserve
requirement for commercial banks was temporarily raised to 25%, and the equalization
date was postponed to 1995. The cash-reserve requirement for merchant banks is being
raised according to the original schedule and is currently at 10% for merchant banks.
31.       Financial Sector Legal-Regulatory Framework. TFSAL II supported a
comprehensive program to strengthen the legal-regulatory framework through the
introduction of prudential regulations and adequate supervision. The main constraints to
effective bank supervision included the lack in the former legislation of clear capital
requirements, limits on exposure to related parties, rules on loan classification and
authority for the Inspector of Banks (at the BOJ) to issue cease and desist orders and
other necessary actions to enforce sound financial sector practices. A revised draft
Banking Act (covering commercial Banks), a new draft Financial Institutions Act (covering
"near banks'--, the term used for trust companies and merchant banks, etc.) and a revised
Bank of Jamaica Act were recently approved by Parliament. The new Banking and
Financial Institutions Acts now include explicit capital adequacy requirements for
commercial and near banks; however, these may not be fully sufficient to cover
depositors' risks. This issue is being pursued with GOJ and will be addressed under a
follow-up investment operation.
32.       Banidng Supervision. The project appraisal and supervision capabilities of the
commercial and merchant banks are reasonably good, but can be further strengthened.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the supervision of financial sector institutions
and delegates this responsibility to the Governor of the BOJ who holds the post of
Inspector of Banks. The inspection unit has qualified staff and uses reporting and
examination procedures developed by U.S. regulators. In line with the revised Bank of
Jamaica Act to strengthen the supervision capacity of the inspection unit, TFSAL II
supported an on-going technical assistance program.
33.       Current Structure of the Sector. Jamaica has a relatively large number of
financial institutions in relation to the size of its economy, with total assets equaling 87%
of GDP at end- 1991. There are 11 commercial banks (34% of total financial assets,



13
including the Bank of Jamaica's assets), 13 merchant banks, 7 trust comnanies and 8
finance houses. In addition, there are more than 200 credit unions, people's cooperative
banks, building societies and life insurance companies. Most financial institutions are
privately owned. GOJ has divested its share in financial sector institutions and is now left
with the National Development Bank (NDB, industry), the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB),
and in the housing sector, the National Housing Trust (NHT) and the Jamaica Mortgage
Bank, which constitute only 7% of the assets of all financial institutions. While no single
institution enjoys a dominant market share, many of these institutions form part of
financial and industrial conglomerates so that the degree of competition may not be as
large as these figures suggest. Among the financial institutions, commercial banks are by
far the largest but merchant banks and finance houses are the more innovative and fastest
growing. Commercial banks are dominant in short-term commercial financing, with
merchant banks providing funds for longer-term investment capital. Total loans
outstanding to the private sector at end-1991 were equivalent to 33% of GDP (US$700
million). Currently, the corporate securities market consists of primary and secondary
markets in equities, conducted in the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). While legally
possible, a bond market has never developed. The government securities market consists
of primary markets in bonds, T-bills and CDs. A small amount of over-the-counter
secondary trading in govemment bonds takes place but the principal 'secondary market'
deals with the redemption of securities by GOJ. GOJ and JSE are discussing the
establishment of a secondary market in govemment paper (see paras. 70-71).
C. DeregtdatiRn
Proaress to Date
34.        Since the mid-1 980s, GOJ has been deregulating the economy to create an
environment conducive to private sector development and increased foreign and domestic
competition. It has removed most price controls (except for petroleum ex-refinery prices,
kerosene, sugar, electricity, and water, whose prices are regulated) and generalized price
subsidies, dismantled public marketing boards in agriculture and other trading monopolies
(JCTC), and eliminated interest rate and exchange controls and legal barriers to foreign
investment. The remaining issues include the deregulation of the sugar, petroleum-
commercial and industrial-sectors and the establishment of an appropriate regulatory
framework for utilities (power, water--to be privatized-and telecommunication-already
privatized).
Petroleum Sector
35.       Jamaica has a relatively high energy consumption due to the power
requirements of the bauxite and alumina industries, which absorb about 30% of the
country's overall energy consumption needs. Imported petroleum meets most of
Jamaica's commercial energy needs (82%). In 1990, the country's energy imports (mainly
feedstock from Venezuela and Mexico) amounted to about US$390 million, of which some
US$270 (equivalent to one quarter of the year's foreign exchange eamings from exports)
was for non-bauxite energy needs.



14
36.       Structure and Competition. The petroleum sector in Jamaica is divided at
present between private marketing companies (affiliates of multinational oil companies)
and the government-owned Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). PCJ, a parastatal
holding under the Ministry of Public Utilities, Transport and Energy (MPUTE), operates the
Petrojam refinery subsidiary, PCJ Engineering, and Petcom (a one outlet marketing
subsidiary). PCJ is the main supplier of petroleum products, either imported or via its
Petroiam refining subsidiary. Petrojam operates the only refinery which was built in 1963.
The company was established in 1982 when the refinery was acquired from Esso by GOJ.
PCJ/Petrojam has a de faoIl import monopoly of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
The monopoly position of the PCJ derives from certain privileges and tax exemptions that
PCJ and Petrojam have been granted. Under the present regime, Petrojam enjoys
exemptions from import taxes and duties, while all other importers are subject to
prohibitive import taxes and duties. Customs tariffs on petroleum products are part of the
CET, ranging between 0%-30% (in 1992), and GOd imposes additional import stamp
duties raising protection even higher. Petrojam's ex-refinery prices on all products are
regulated using pricing formulae based on USGC (Gulf Coast) prices adjusted on a weekly
basis.
37.       GOJ has already deregulated distribution and retail margins, allowing
distribution companies to set their own wholesale and retail prices. The private marketing
companies own a number of storage and distribution facilities and domestic retail sales of
petroleum products. A certain degree of competition exists beyond the refining rack;
refined and imported petroleum products are sold through about 250 stations, 60% of
which are owned by Shell, Esso and Texaco, and leased to independent dealers; the
remainder are independently owned and operated. The three marketing companies have
some receiving and storage facilities for their end-product imports to cover for occasional
Petrojam supply shortage. Petrojam's subsidiary, Petcom, has one retail outlet which also
distributes LPG. GOJ is planning to privatize Petrojam and its subsidiaries including
Petcom, and without deregulation measures to promote competition, this could lead to an
undesirable oligopolistic market structure. Ensuring increased competition among suppliers
to avoid this possibility would, therefore, be an important aspect of the deregulation and
privatization process.
Sugar Scso=
38.       The sugar industry forms the most important sub-sector in agriculture in terms
of foreign exchange generation (54% of value of all 1990 agricultural exports; 7.4% of
total merchandise exports), employment (16.7% of agricultural labor force in 1990), and
as a source of income. Exports of raw sugar are realized under favorable government-to-
govemment pricing arrangements, which are critical for the performance of the sector
since production costs are well above the efficient producer costs or foreseeable world
market prices. Currently, Jamaica benefits from export quotas to Europe, under the Lome
Convention, and to the US at prices significantly higher than the world market average. At
its peak in 1965, the sugar industry consisted of 18 privately-held factories, producing
506,000 tons.
39.       Ownership Structure and Performance. In the 1970s, with increasing
intemational competition and growing government involvement, a gradual exodus of



15
foreign investors and factory operators occurred. By 1977, GOJ had gained effective
control of 65% of the country's sugar processing capacity. Of the 8 factories it had
acquired by then, 4 have since closed. Currently, there are nine remaining factories, of
which four are government-owned and five are privately-held and/or operated.9 Five
privately operated facilities account for about 38% of production. The government-owned
factories are operating well below capacity and incurring significant losses. In FY91, the
combined accumulated deficits of the four publicly-owned sugar mills/estates have
exceeded J$500 million (about 1 % of GDP). Compared to 40%-65% for the public
entities, most of the privately managed entities operate at 90% or more of capacity, which
explains their apparent solvency and survival, despite obtaining a lower average sugar yield
per ton cane than the public entities.
40.       Total sugar production has declined steadily since the early 1 970s. In
1989/90, it fell to 44% of its 1965 peak output. The sector is characterized by high unit
production costs, low productivity, an operational structure based on outdated equipment
and processes and irrigation problems. The factors contributing to this have included: (i)
reduced quality and supply of cane from government-owned estates; (ii) massive
overheads at the publicly-owned factories and plantations; (iii) lack of reinvestment
resulting from persistent foreign exchange shortages and growing fiscal constraints of
GOJ, leading to the neglect of maintenance of irrigation networks; (iv) restrictive price and
market structures under the current regulatory control of the Sugar Industry Authority
(SIA); and (v) growing world competition and technological changes, while automation has
been insufficient, particularly in the harvesting segment of the process. The Bank made
two loans in the past to assist GOJ with restructuring of the industry with limited results.
41.       Regulatory Framework. The world sugar market has a special structure. It
consists of excess sugar production over what is absorbed by preferential markets (about
20% of total world production), sold at the world price which is currently 60% below
preferential market prices. As a result, most countries fully regulate exports, imports and
the domestic price of sugar. Countries with access to preferential export markets have all
adopted centralized marketing structures, and Jamaica is no exception. Another aspect of
sugar industry is that sugar, even after it is processed and refined, is jointly owned by
farmers and millers. GOJ, through SIA, is the sole exporter and importer of sugar. SIA
imports refined sugar from the open market, an input to beverage and food industries and
a close substitute for raw sugar in consumption. The actual export and domestic trade is
handled through private companies under contract (e.g., through the Jamaica Cane
Products Sales Ltd., JCPS, a private cooperative). SIA also establishes domestic
wholesale sugar prices and fixes the cane price for growers.
42.       In addition to having the exclusive right to import, export and market sugar,
SIA is in charge of setting the wholesale price of sugar, allocating the foreign exchange
obtained from sugar exports. It also conducts research for the sector through the Sugar
Industry Research Institute (SIRI) and sets quality standards for the industry. Over the last
decade the SIA has gradually broadened its portfolio and commercial activities, acquiring
real estate and rolling stock, shares in entities, and functioning as the industry's banker
3    Duckenfield is on a 49-year lease to the private sector since 1988 and is classified as private.



16
(for farmers and factories) as well as its accounting officer. SIA participates in the
servicing of the debts of government-owned sugar estates, allocating part of the proceeds
from imported refined sugar sales for this purpose.
Reoulatlon of UtlittisL Power. Tdecommunications and Water
43.       In the power sector, as part of its energy sector privatization and deregulation
strategy, GOJ is in the process of developing a regulatory framework to be implemented
prior to the privatization of the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo) in 1994. The
design and implementation of the regulatory framework, facilitation of private sector
investment in new power generation and the privatization of JPSCo are being supported
under a separate Bank project approved by the Board in July 1992, and will not be
specifically dealt with under the proposed PSDAL.
44.       Jamaica's telecommunications company (local and intemational) has already
been privatized. The private company (TOJ) operates under a license which grants a long-
term monopoly to the private owner, determining to a great extent the regulatory
framework under which the company invests and operates. The regulatory body is
currently under MPUTE whose responsibilities are limited by the scope of the license.
WYhile this regulatory framework has provided a safe and attractive investment
environment to the private owner, evident in the rapid expansion and improvement of
service and infrastructure, the long-term efficiency consequences of a monopolistic market
structure under a poorly set-up regulatory framework are questionable. The remaining
policy agenda in the telecommunications sector, would, therefore, focus on the
improvement of its regulatory framework to achieve medium to long term efficiency gains.
GOJ is currently considering establishing an independent Utiiities Regulatory Commission
in charge of all three utilities, power, water and telecommunications. The Bank is
supporting the conceptualization and the design of the utilities regulatory commission
under the Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project (Ln. 3502).
D. Privatlzation and Pubric Sector Reforn
The Pubric Enterprise Sector
45.       The Size, Scope and Financial Performance. Since the existing legislation
does not provide a clear legal definition of "public entities", de facto definition of public
enterprises remains wide, including even entities with only 1 % public sector participation.
The puiblic sector today includes statutory bodies, public authorities, regulatory agencies
and commercially oriented entities, with varying levels of govemment ownership and
control. Public enterprises (PEs) are either established as corporations under the
Companies Act, or as statutory bodies covered by individual enabling Acts. Public
enterprises incorporated under the Companies Act tend to have greater autonomy than
those established by enactment.



17
46.        In 1982, at its peak, the public sector comprised 530 public entities, 200 of
which were public enterprises. PEs spanned many sectors, including utilities, banking,
transportation, bauxite-alumina, sugar, manufacturing, agro-industry and trade, and
accounted for 21 % of GDP and 1 1 % of investment. In 1985, the estimated total assets
of the public enterprise sector (including housing finance and banking) stood at 116% of
GDP and its (gross) revenues exceeded 70% of GDP. Despite a decade of privatization
and deregulation in telecommunications, banking, urban transport, manufactures and
agriculture, the PE sector still remains large. Currently, there are 320 public entities,
including non-commercial statutory bodies and agencies which perform governmental
administrative functions. Among these, commercially oriented PEs add up to 125.4 In
1991, the total assets of the public enterprise sector (including housing finance and
banking) are estimated to have declined to about 72% of GDP, with revenues at 38% of
GDP. Currently, the PEs in the manufacturing activities employ about 10% of the work
force in the manufacturing sector.
47.        Although satisfactory financial data is not available for all entities, a recent
Bank analysis indicated that overall PE performance is poor, with most entities showing
negative or negligible profitability. In FY90/91, the total accumulated deficit of the 66
largest entities, excluding the banking and housing sectors, was estimated to be at least
J*291 million (1.4% of GDP and about 3.9% of current expenditures) and most non-
financial entities operated at a loss. Among major loss makers were sugar, Air Jamaica,
JPS (power), NWC (water) and JRC (railways).
48.        Transfers: Financial Flows between PEs and the Central Govenmuent. The
Bank has also carried out a study of direct and indirect financial flows between the PEs
and the Central Government in recent years, based on a sample of 14 major entities.
Direct transfers include operating and capital expenditures such as subsidies, grants,
equity participation, and loans while indirect transfers reflect foregone revenue for the
state or for the PEs (for example, tax exemptions or unpaid utility bills). The analysis
indicates that, between 1990 and 1992, net total transfers to the selected PEs were
reduced significantly both in nominal (by 25%) and in real terms (by 67%). There was
also a marked shift in the composition of transfers from direct to indirect. This shows that
while GOJ has intensified its efforts to make the PE sector financially self-sufficient, PEs'
dependence on government resources continue in terms of foregone tax and other
government revenues. Direct transfers have virtually disappeared by 1992 as indirect
transfers increased steadily, leaving total transfers at 0.7% of GDP (J$425.3) in 1992.
49.        Monitoring and Accountablity of PEs. The poor performance of public
enterprises in the 1980s stemmed from the large size and scope of the sector, inadequate
policies for increasing the independence of public entities and the failure to adjust prices in
a timely manner, as well as weak management within public enterprises. In 1981, GOJ
began monitoring the performance of a selected group of public enterprises, based on
criteria set under the IMF and Bank programs (SAL I-l1l and PESAL). The GOJ's objectives
4     The PE sector comprises 124 wholly- and partially-owned commercial, industrial, and trading enties; 33
financial entities (including the Bank of Jamaica); 73 technical, administrative and regulatory bodies
financed through the budget as the central govemment and 48 publicly-funded service functions
lAnnex Vill. Table 1). The remaining 39 entities are either inactive, have ceased operations, merged or
are in liquidation.



18
included increasing the tariffs for public services, petroleum products, water, electricity,
and basic foods. However, these were implemented with long delays, reducing the
effectiveness of measures taken,
50.       The current institutional structure is not adequate for monitoring PEs. Outside
the 18 PEs monitored by the IMF since 1981 through a management information system
(MIS) at the Ministry of Finance, basic information on performance indicators and direct
transfers to PEs is largely unavailable. A technical assistance program has recently been
designed by the Bank to strengthen GOJ's ability to monitor all remaining PEs through an
expanded MIS, establishing an early warning system and an adequate database. This
technical assistance program, when implemented, will also permit for the first time, the
calculation of total transfers to PEs including direct and indirect subsidies and capital
infusions, based on the methodology developed in a recent Bank study. Moreover, GOJ
has recently approved a new Finance Administration and Audit Act (FAA) to clarify the
legal obligations, accountability and reporting requirements for all PEs and introduce
mechanisms for better managing their activities. FAA also helps clarify the scope for
govemment control in entities where it is a minority shareholder.
rlyAtzation: Progress to Date 1981-1991
51.       Approach. The privatization program was initiated in 1981, to reduce GOJ's
role in the economy and improve fiscal balances. During 1981-90, GOJ opted for an ad-
hoc, decentralized, case by case approach to privatization. A Divestment Committee was
formed, housed by the National Investment Bank of Jamaica (NIBJ). The implementation
of the privatization program was carried out by the Divestment Committee (for smaller and
less complex privatizations), sector ministries and statutory agencies such as National
Hotels and Properties (NHP), Agro 21" and the Factories Corporation. No official list of
enterprises slated for privatization was issued. Divestiture candidates were selected
among commercial entities considered to have a reasonably good chance of attracting
private sector buyers. The lack of a formal framework, however, led to a low level of
cooperation between the different Institutions involved in complex transactions.
52.        Implementation. Initially (1981-86), the privatization program advanced
slowly because of lack of experience and the absence of a clear policy statement on its
objectives and guidelines. As a result, minimal transfer of assets occurred, and
privatization was primarily achieved through management contracts, leasing or contracting
out services. Major privatizations in the initial phase included the transfer of operating
control of several hotels to the private sector, the leasing of 59 of the total 69 rural
agricultural marketing boards, the transfer of operation of Jamaica Omnibus Services Ltd.
to a number of private sector bus operators, and the divestiture to private farmers of
growing projects and boxing plants of the Banana Company Ltd..
53.       After 1987, divestiture accelerated significantly, covering a broader range of
sectors including finance, manufacturing, utilities, tourism and agriculture. Among some
important entities privatized in this period were 14 of the 17 hotels (carried out by National
Hotels and Properties), the Caribbean Cement Company, Telecommunications of Jamaica
Ltd. and shares in the National Commercial Bank. By July 1991, the total number of
entities privatized, excluding land leases, deregulation of markets and privatization by local
govemments had reached 50, generating cumulative divestment proceeds of J$1.8 billion



19
(equivalent to about 4% of GDP). In the second phase, all basic modes of privatization,
i.e., sale of assets, liquidation, outright divestment and contracting out, have been
employed. In the process, GOJ established a record in privatization and accumulated
valuable experience in a wide array of sectors.
Acceleration of the Privatizatlon Program: Recent Developments
54.       The new Government, soon after taking office in 1989, announced its plans
to undertake an accelerated privatization program. GOJ's renewed interest in accelerating
privatization and expanding it to new sectors stemmed from both an urgent need to
improve GOJ's fiscal performance, and to increase productive efficiency and the private
sector's role in the economy as part of its development strategy. GOJ adopted the
principle that it would withdraw over the medium-term from all commercially-oriented
activities, and seek private sector participation in utilities and other infrastructure, through
divestiture and new investments sponsored by the private sector. GOJ also intends not to
create new public entities in commercial activities. Government participation would
continue beyond the next few years in transportation (roads, ports, airports), where a
privatization initiative is also beginning, and bauxite/alumina where GOJ maintains joint-
ventures with foreign multinationals. Since the thrust of the program is privatization, GOJ
does not envisage any major public enterprise restructuring. It is, however, trying to
improve the monitoring and auditing of the remaining PEs and statutory bodies to
rationalize budgetary outlays and transfers in the medium term.
55.       In June 1991, the Prime Minister issued a Policy Paoer (No:34) on
privatization setting out the GOJ's privatization objectives, methods, a new institutional
framework and an initial list of enterprises, activities, or assets, (67 entities) as candidates
for privatization. The objectives of the privatization policy were stated as: (i) increasing
efficiency of enterprises through change in ownership; (ii) eliminating the fiscal drain
caused by poorly performing PEs; {iii) optimizing the use of GOJ's limited management
resources; (iv) creating opportunities to access foreign capital, technologies and markets;
and (v) widening the base of ownership and direct equity participation in the economy.
The initial list of 67 privatization candidates is not considered final or fixed; the list is
subject to periodic Cabinet reviews for adding new entities, or sometimes putting on hold
others. The public was also invited to identify government-owned assets of interest to the
private sector for divestiture, to be added to the list after Cabinet approval.
56.       The new divestiture program and NIBJ, the institution responsible for
coordination and implementation of the program, were placed under the responsibility of
the Office of the Prime Minister, with the Prime Minister himself having responsibility for
this program. A more centralized approach than previously utilized was adopted, to ensure
a more systematic strategic planning for divestiture, better institutional coordination
around NIBJ, and improved transparency in the objectives, process and procedure for
privatization. The division of responsibilities betwean the Cabinet and NIBJ was designed
to ensure flexibility and transparency in the decision-making process.
57.       Since the adoption of the centralized approach a year ago, however, the
process has been modified to ensure a more explicit "consensus-building' and participation
among institutions involved. More decentralized supporting mechanisms (e.g. Special
Divestment Committees) were brought into this framework to provide the right package of



20
expertise to tackle the more troublesome or sensitive divestments. Such committees
have been established in the cases of Air Jamaica, JPS, Petroism and the sugar sub-
sector.
58.         With some of the technical work for complex or sensitive privatizations
involving political, human and sector considerations currently being cearried out by special
committees, NIBJ has concentrated on the privatization of small and medium entities while
playing a coordinating role for the rest. In addition, the Urban Development Corporation
(UDC) maintains a parallel privatization portfolio of remaining 4 hotels and land, sharing
NIBJ's previously unique responsibility for implementing the privatization program. Under
the modified institutional set-up, the objectives and principles set out by GOJ to ensure
transparency and efficiency apply to both UDC and NIBJ (pars. 98).
59.         Regulatory Issues Related to Privatization. In past privatizations, sufficient
attention was not given to the policy and regulatory environment within which enterprises
were to operate. Particularly, the implications of the regulatory framework for long-term
efficiency and competition we. e not carefully assessed. There are cases where monopoly
privileges were transferred to the private owner in favor of more immediate benefits such
as higher proceeds from privatization; or where price controls were preserved to protect
the consumer, limiting the future profitability of the enterprise.5 Under the new
privatization policy, GOJ has adopted the principle that all appropriate regulatory issues
will be dealt with prior to or simultaneously with privatization. In the tradeable,
coinmercially oriented sectors, regulatory provisions entail the deregulation/liberalization of
imports, prices and marketing and the removal of other barriers to competition. In the non-
tradeable utilities sectors, which generally require large investments (such as electric
power and water supply), GOJ has agreed that the establishment of transparent and
independent regulatory bodies would be essential to ensure private investors' confidence
and long-run economic and financial efficiency (see paras. 43-44).
60.         Legal Framework for Privatization. During a decade of privatization, legal
barriers to privatization have never become an issue in Jamaica. There are no major legal
impediments to privatization, nor any provisions in the Constitution precluding or bearing
on the power of GOJ to sell assets nor are there any provisions in any general statute.
Ministerial-Policy Papers issued by the Prime Minister have been sufficient for defining the
scope of the program and establishing institutional (NIBJ's) mandate, legitimacy and
responsibilities. However, for entities incorporated under a special law or enabling Acts,
this would require amendments and other legislative action to change aspects of each
special incorporation statute, on a case by case basis.
5     Some of the examples where reogulatory issues could have been treated more satisfactonly are: P) in the
privatization of TOJ (telecom), the foreign buyer was granted a license ensuring a 25 year monopoly and
17.5%-20% rate of return on net investments in lieu of a transparent regulatory system providing
sufficient security for the investor. While this has led to a rapid expansion of services and investments,
its impact on long-run costs and the efficiency of investment will not be optimal; Pii) In the case of CCC
(cement), domestic price controls and the regulation of margins and distribution were kept In place until
June 1991. This may have affected profitability/prospects of the company, in turn reducing the value of
shares sold during privatization; and (iii) in the privatization of Omnibus Company (Kingston Urban
Transport), strict controls on imports of buses (JCTC) and restrictions on types of vehicles permittd (by
the Transport Authority} continued after privatization and fares remained regulated. In the absence of
sufficient competition, this led to a decline in the quality of service.

61.       Labor Redundancy and Ownership Participation Schemes. In past
privatizations, labor redundancy has not been a major problem and no special schemes or
safety-net programs have been necessary. While the labor unions are strong, they are
generally supportive of the privatization program, partly because past privatizations did not
have adverse effects on labor. In fact, studies show that employees of privatized entities
became better off than before. Existing labor laws and regulations are flexible and do not
impede privatization (see Annex X). However, some labor redundancy is expected to
occur, at modest levels, with the up-coming privatizations such as the railways and the
sugar factories. Labor unions have been strongly supporting the Introduction of safety-net
schemes to protect the labor which would become redundant under forthcoming
privatizations. Their view is that change in ownership is a cause for redundancy
payments, although it is not required by law. GOJ is now considering introducing safety-
net packages, consistent with existing budgetary constraints, and assessing the need on a
case by case basis. GOJ has also prepared legislation to introduce Employee Stock
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to broaden the ownership base. ESOPs could be an option for
future privatizations or be used for raising capital for already private companies. ESOP
legislation is to be tabled at Parliament during 1993.
E. Business Legal-Regtlatorv Environment and CoMoetton
Progress to Date
62.       In the mid-1 980s, GOJ began improving the business environment through
deregulation, removal of legal restrictions on foreign investments and trade and customs
reforms. . With the recent lifting of foreign exchange controls, legal resttictions on direct
foreign investment and the repatriation of profits were also eased. Despite these
measures, however, there still remain major bottlenecks for foreign and domestic
investments as the business environment remains highly bureaucratic, regulated and
inhospitable to modern business practices. The legal-regulatory environment and
administrative processes impose barriers to entry, exit and domestic competition. The lack
of a level playing field and transparent rules for business activity have reinforced anti-
competitive practices. Consequently, foreign as well as domestic investment is still slow
in coming and domestic productive capacity is not yet geared up for international
competition. During the past year, GOJ intensified its efforts to improve the business
environment through strengthening the business legal framework and key institutions,
encouraging competitive behavior and eliminating excessive red-tape In the day-to-day
dealings of businesses with the State.
Completition Policy
63.       Given the size of the domestic market, the thrust of the GOJ's competition
policy is on opening domestic markets to international competition through trade
liberalization. However, this may not be sufficient in non-tradeables activities, where
barriers to entry exist, and in tradeable activities, where effective monopolies or oligopolies
prevail even with 20%-30% nominal protection. In such cases, complementary legal and
regulatory measures would be needed to further encourage competiton. GOJ has



22
prepared a new Fair Competition Act (FCA) to signal the public its determination
to maintain a dynamic and competitive market place, discouraging collusive behavior. It is
meant as a complement, not a substitute, for open trade policy. Among the key issues
that the FCA addresses is price-fixing (collusion). FCA adequately combines competition
and consumer protection under one legislation. The Bank has provided GOJ technical
assistance for preparation of FCA.
64.       Distribution and JCTC. Anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, have
been common in Jamaica, particularly in trading and distribution activities and in non-
tradeable sectors where an oligopolistic market structure has become prominent.
When JCTC was incorporated 18 years ago, it was given sole importer status for a
number of commodities which expanded over 34 key product groups over the years. As a
result, JCTC has had a strong influence on domestic distribution. Although JCTC's
import monopolies have been dismantled, JCTC, as agreed, continues to procure certain
products when requested by bilateral govemments. Currently, products imported and
procured by JCTC under bilateral credit lines include basic food items such as rice, wheat
and fish. Since its establishment, JCTC has continued to use exclusively the same small
group of domestic distributors which used to import these products prior to JCTC's
formation. Allocation among the small number of distributors is still based on their Import
shares prior to JCTC's inception. This system has severely limited competition in the
domestic distribution of key staple goods by disallowing free entry to new, well-qualified
medium size distribution companies. Recently, GOJ has taken the initiative to review the
process of selection of distributors by CJTC and has fornulated new procedures to allow
for competition in distribution.
C'omponies Act
65.       The Jamaican Companies Act was enacted in 1965. It is an important part of
the legal environment for business as it governs the starting-up, operation and winding-up
of companies. It is based on the Companies Act 1948 (UK), but incorporates a number of
innovations and specific Jamaican developments. Since 1965, in Jamaica and elsewhere,
the business environment has become increasingly complex and the demands placed on
company law more varied and frequent. This has resulted in major legislative reforms
particularly in countries which had legislation based on the 1948 UK Act. GOJ has
initiated a similar review and reform process to modernize its Companies Act, consistent
with the evolving business environment. A Committee appointed by the Minister of
Industry and Commerce and chaired by the Solicitor-General completed its report
recommending revisions in the Act. The Bank had extensive discussions with the
Committee on proposed reforms and has provided assistance to the Committee for the
preparation of the new legislation.
66.       The objectives of GOJ for the new legislation are to facilitate the entry and
exit of companies and reduce the cost of day-to-day business activities while ensuring a
playing field that would reduce risks for investors. The existing legislation imposes several
undue constraints on normal business activity. It does not provide for the incorporation of
an individual with limited liability, does not grant sufficient discretionary powers to
company directors, and imposes several unnecessary compliance costs on businesses.
Through the Companies Act reform, GOJ aims at reducing these entry and operational
costs, which are particularly significant for small businesses.



23
67.        Reorganization and Uquidation of Companies. Uquidation is a long and costly
process taking up to five years, leading to a depletion of the value of the company's
assets, and hurting both creditors and debtors. More importantly, currently there is no
possibility or formal legal-institutional structure for restructuring comparnes even if this is
the economically most efficient solution to the company's financial problems. Under the
revised Companies Act, GOJ is also planning to introduce provisions to facilitate orderly
reorganization and/or exit by providing simple, expeditious and fair procedures for releasing
and distributing the assets of insolvent and defunct companies and the option of
restructuring. These changes should, over time, also help reduce the very high collateral
(typically mortgages on personal property) required by secured creditors, which is a
common concern for small businesses in Jamaica.
68.       Registration of Land and other Personal Property. GOJ is considering
modernizing the register of the personal property system in the medium-term. A new
register of personal property securities is proposed to replace both the register of company
charges and the bills of sale registers kept in Spanishtown, simplifying search procedures,
increasing certainty in commercial transactions and facilitating the eventual
computerization of the registration and searching systems.
EnviaonMontl Regulaton
69.       GOJ is becoming inceeasingly aware that environmental protection is
important to sustainable development. Its draft National Environmental Action Plan
focuses on land use, urban degradation, and water pollution. It includes better coastal
zone management, increased technical assistance for numerous watershed projects, and
the removal of irrigation subsidies. The Natural Resources Conservation Authority (NRCA),
a new umbrella agency established in 1991, is responsible for the formulation of
regulations covering air, water quality and hazardous and toxic chemicals and has the
authority to request environmental audits for new investment of rehabilitation projects,
issue permits, fine polluters or other environmental offenders. A Bank report on the major
environmental issues, discussing the present and potential mandates and capacity of
NRCA, has been circulated to the Board (Report No. 11239 "Economic Issues for
Environmental Management"). While currently no environmental regulations
exist that are enforceable for industrial discharges in Jamaica, NRCA has been working on
introducing such regulations, and gearing up for imposing, in the near future, effective
regulation of the industrial sector, including the newly privatized entities. A technical
assistance program to strengthen the institutional organization of NRCA is being supported
under the IDB's Trade Finance and Investment Sector Loan. The TA program focusses on
enhancing the environmental assessment capability of NRCA, improving mechanisms for
monitoring and mitigating environmental risks, and preparation of environmental
regulations. The Bank will support the introduction of such industrial regulations and
further assistance to NRCA, under a follow-up investment operation.
CaRital Markets: Leal and Reaulatory Framework
70.         Capital market development can play an important role in facilitating private
sector development in Jamaica even though conventional loans and retained eamings have
been, and will remain for sometime, the principal source of capital formation for
enterprises. The volatile interest rates and high inflation rates that prevailed over the last
two years hampered Jamaica's capital market development, despite the activity generated
by several privatizations through public share offerings. In recent months, however,



24
GOJ's macroeconomic stabilization program and the liberalization of the foreign exchange
regime have made a positive impact on the capital market. To support this expansion,
GOJ has an interest in rapidly establishing the legal regulatory framework for equity
markets, particularly since acceleration of the privatization program could place a strain on
the existing capital market infrastructure. The approval of the new Securities Act would
constitute an important step towards establishing a sound legal-regulatory framework. It
is designed to regulate stock brokers, stock markets, shareholders rights, trading rules and
other aspects of capital market operations. Under this Act, an independent Securities
Commission with jurisdiction over all securities market matters will be established.
71.       Structure of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). JSE is a limited membership
corporation established under the Companies Act. There are presently nine corporate
members of JSE, recently increased from six when two new members were admitted and
one dormant member was reactivated. Entry and exit are strictly controlled by JSE
members to protect financial stability on the basis of a desirable volume of transactions or
an acceptable return on equity per member. Large financial/commercial groups are
increasingly taking substantial or controlling share holdings in JSE members. As of March
1992, forty-five companies listed securities on JSE with a total market capitalization of
about US$760 million. In 1992, there were 38 ordinary shares. 12 preference shares and
3 corporate bonds listed. At present JSE and its Council constitute the regulatory
structure for capital market supervision. The Council of JSE includes representatives of
BOJ and MOF, and non-exchange representatives. BOJ has exercised informal regulatory
control over JSE but has lacked a clear mandate and capacity to adequately fulfill this role.
Recent attempts of JSE to improve its self-regulatory capacity have been hampered by the
lack of a legal structure to support its actions and a related lack of supervisory
responsibility and power in GOJ to ensure that JSE conducts itself responsibly as a self-
regulatory organization. In the absence of a formal regulatory framework, JSE relies on a
Rule Book covering membership, trading and listing rules, and has supervisory staff to
police adherence to the rules.
72.       TaxatIon of Financial Instuments. A taxation scheme which is neutral across
investment instruments will be important for capital markets. The most obvious taxation
deterrent to equity market development is the double taxation of dividends. Other
anomalies in the tax regime also exist, leading to differing taxation incentives between
instruments, such as a lower tax paid by life insurance companies on investment income
than that paid on their trading income or than paid on investment income by companies or
individuals. These distortions warrant a full GOJ review of taxation of financial
instruments.
Administrative Red-tae
73.       Business related, day-to-day dealings with the State in Jamaica is
characterized by heavy administrative red-tape. In particular, two areas with a very
significant impact on business performance have been investment aDorovals process and
lxport transctionis. Major simplifications are needed in the administrative process to
make Jamaica an attractive environment for potential investors and exporters. This



25
requires a complete shift in the way GOJ defines its future role and mandate in facilitating
investment and exports.
74.      Investment Approvals. Investors not seeking incentives do not generally need
to obtain approval from any agency in Jamaica. However, as a practical matter, all
investors with projects in FTZs, in 100-percent exporting activities or in tourism apply for
possible incentives, and the existing approvals process constitutes a bureaucratic
bottleneck practically for all potential investors. GOJ also intends to streamline the
existing approval process which is long (3-6 months), complex and discretionary. GOJ's
previous attempts to shorten the process by creating a "single window* in JAMPRO-the
export-investment promotion agency-were not effective since the number of clearances
required by different government agencies remained the same. GOJ also intends to
rationalize and gradually phase out these incentives in the medium term, maintaining only
those incentives that have proven effective in FTZ across countries.
75.       Administrative Barriers to Exports. There are more than 20 administrative
steps required for each export shipment, involving the Customs and other agencies-such
as JAMPRO (the export and investment promotion agency) and Bureau of Standards-for
statistical data collection, verification of value for claims for duty drawback/suspension,
export licensing, providing "certificates of origin" under bilateral agreements and
eliminating the narcotic contamination of cargo. Although most of these steps constitute
intemational standard procedures, they are sequenced in an inefficient and bureaucratic
way. Additional steps specific to Jamaica originate from concerns to impose strict
controls on drug-trafficking and to compensate for weaknesses in tax administration as
export transactions are used as a channel to enforce tax compliance. These time-intensive
procedures have often been quoted as a strong disincentive to export, particularly for small
exporters and newcomers.
PART IIl - THE ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Rationale of the Proposed Loan
76.       The proposed Private Sector Development Adjustment Loan is designed to
address the remaining gaps in the adjustment agenda supporting a comprehensive set of
reforms to create an environment conducive to private sector development. Key reform
areas in the remaining adjustment agenda are: (i) trade policy and customs reform; fii)
deregulation of key domestic productive activities; (iii) continued privatization of public
enterprises; and (iv) reform of the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for
business. These reforms are complementary and consistent with each other and will be
carried out in the context of an agreed medium-term macroeconomic framework
compatible with the EFF program (see paras. 7-8). The maintenance of the medium-term
macroeconomic framework based on targets specified in Table 2 will be monitored under
the proposed loan. The major remaining issues in the four areas identified above and the
proposed actions and policies that the loan would support are described below. The policy



26
matrix which details the loan conditionality is provided in Annex I. The GOJ's Letter of
Development Policy is attached as Annex IV.
B. Trade Reform
77.        Tariff Reform. GOJ recognizes that to strengthen its international
competitiveness, rapid tariff reform beyond what was already introduced in 1991 is
essential, particularly in light of region-wide moves in Latin America towards lower tariffs.
78.        Jamaica assumed a leadership role at the CARICOM  Heads of State meeting
held in July 1992 and the follow-up technical discussions among member countries. As a
result of these discussions on October 29, 1992, CARICOM reached an agreement on a
three-stage tariff reform to gradually reduce the tariff band to 5%-20% at the latest by
1998 (slow-track). However, the reform program provides for a "fast-track" option,
allowing individual countries to implement the 5%-20% by 1997. Jamaica chose the fast-
track option, adopting an implementation timetable as shown in Table 7.

79.        The new CARICOM agreement is a success in many respects, even though it
spans over four years. CARICOM negotiations were finalized very rapidly-only in four
months, which compares favorably with the previous round of negotiations, which took
about four years to complete. Decisions taken are transparent and regionally binding,
giving credibility to the reform in the eyes of the private sector. By providing clear signals
to the private sector, GOJ ensures an efficient allocation of new investments, as potential
investors will base these decisions on the future, final tariff rates (i.e., 5%-20%) rather
than on interim rates. For the Caribbean region, the program gives a clear direction and
incentives for moving towards extra-regional export orientation. The gradual approach to
tariff reform was opted by most CARICOM members to provide sufficient time for the
restructuring of existing domestic industries to prepare them for increased intemational
competition, or for allowing capital to move out of those that would not survive under
such competition.
80.        GOJ has publicly announced the implementation schedule for all three phases
of tariff reform and implemented the first stage, moving to a 5%-30% tariff range in April
1993, with four tariff lines at 5%, 20%, 25% and 30%. The only exceptions are: (i)



27
tariffs for agricultural inputs and the basic necessities
basket, at 0% (about 300 items); and (ii) tariffs for
agricultural products (e.g.. fresh tropical fruits, citrus,   Table 8 JAMAICA TARIFF STRUCTURE

conclusions to the Bank.
Source: The Jamaia Gazette Supplement, 2/01.
82.         Table 8 above provides information on
the new 1993 tariff structure, and Table 9 below
provides a comparison of 1991, 1993 and 1997 tariff structures. The 1993 CET has
about 53% of all tariff positions concentrated at 5%, significantly lowering the average
tariff and increasing tariff uniformity. The average tariff was reduced from 20.3% in
1991-92 to 13.6% in 1993 and to will be further reduced to 13% by 1997. Average
tariff rates applied to capital goods and intermediate goods were reduced from 12% to 7%
and 9%, respectively, to levels comparable to those adopted by other countries in the
Latin America region with recent tariff reforms.
83.         The fiscal impact of the tariff reform has been jointly estimated by the Bank
and GOJ on the basis of the new CET structure. This analysis indicates that under very
conservative (pessimistic) assumptions, initially (the first year) the impact of tariff
reductions would be negative - approximately a 30% fall in tariff revenue. This is
primarily because more than 50% of tariff positions now attract only a 5% tariff.
However, since tariff revenues constitute less than 10% of total tax revenue, this would
imply only a 2% fall in total tax revenue, which can easily be compensated for through

other sources. To partially close this gap, GOJ has already adjusted the domestic excise
taxes on motor vehicles, tobacco and alcohol, which is expected to have an important
offsetting effect. Moreover, GOJ began eliminating remaining concessions to widen the
base. If imports grow (exogenously) 4% per annum, the potential loss of tariff revenue
would be totally eliminated. After the first year, the impact is estimated to be revenue
neutral or positive. The revenue impact of improved customs administration, which often
generates significant additional revenues, was not included in these estimations.
84.         Elimination of AgrIultural Stamp Dudes. GOJ will accelerate, by 1 to 5
years, the elimination of protective agricultural stamp duties, currently being phased out
over a 3-7 year period. During negotiations the Bank and GOJ agreed on the list of
agricultural products for which stamp duties will be eliminated by May 1993, by March
1994 and by March 1995. All the agricultural stamp duties on the list in Annex Xl, that
GOJ agreed to eliminate in 1993, have already been eliminated. This accounts for 30% of
the import value of products covered. Elimination of agricultural stamp duties for products
on the 1994 list will be a condition of second tranche release. The fiscal impact of this
measure is estimated to be minimal.
85.         Customs Reform. GOJ's objective is to achieve measurable and substantial
improvements in the quality and speed of customs clearance to facilitate imports and
exports as well as revenue collection. This will be pursued through a two-pronged
approach, i.e., by minimizing customs involvement in export transactions (see para. 119),
and by establishing an effective, modemized and speedy system for clearance of imports.
The new systems to be introduced, combined with lower tariff rates to be Implemented in
1993, will help diminish incentives for corruption, underinvoicing and related inefficiencies,
improving revenue collection. In line with this approach, GOJ has agreed with the Bank on
the specific time-bound targets for speeding up customs clearance for importers and
exporters. Accordingly, the maximum time for cargo clearance will be: (i) for regular



29
importers with no past records of violation of customs regulations, 24 hours; (ii) for first
time or occasional importers, 48 hours; (iii) for importers with a "negative record" with the
Customs Department, 72 hours; (iv) for exporters of perishable goods, with no violation
record, 8 hours; and (v) for other exporters, 24 hours. Exporters continue to be
responsible for 24 hours prior to notification of the Customs Department on shipments.
These targets will be monitored through systematic sampling of customs records and
information obtained from exporters and importers. The above targets will be met on a
sustainable basis prior to the release of the second tranche.
86.       In the context of the Customs Reform Action Plan provided in An2.&YL GOJ
has already taken several important steps, including the following key actions:
i.  initiate the implementation of an effective audit system;
H. initiate the preparation of new policy and operational manuals for
custom's staff reflecting new procedures, objectives and performance
targets consistent with the Customs Administration's Corporate Plan;
iii. implement an information-based, random cargo examination system based
on 15% sampling, to replace the current 100% physical examination;
iv. complete and adopt the simplified, customs export entry documentation
and procedures; and
v. present to the Bank, GOJ's detailed plans for computerization of the
Customs systems, and begin implementing the computerization program.
87.       GOJ will implement the following key measures in the context of the action
plan, prior to the release of the second tranche:
i. complete the setting up of the internal audit system;
ii. complete and distribute to the Custom Administration's staff a new
comprehensive policy and operational manual;
iii. expand the use of fast-track cargo clearance systems for already
identified groups of exporters and importers;
iv. implement duty-suspension and duty-drawback schemes and the
accompanying "tax payer audit system", taking necessary legal,
institutional and technical steps;
v. complete the first phase of computerization of Customs; and
vi. switch to a single numbering and identification system of traders.

C. l:swlutaniQo
88.       The proposed loan will support deregulation programs in a number of
important sectors or activities. The two major deregulation programs that GOJ has begun
undertaking are for the petroleum and sugar sectors. These programs are particularly
important since public enterprises in both sectors have been included in the GOJ's
privatization program. To avoid shortcomings of some past privatizations, GOJ's new
strategy provides that in future privatizations, regulatory Issues will be dealt with up-front
in a manner consistent with stated policies and the establishment of a competitive
business environment. Both cases entail complex and sensitive issues. but offer
considerable potential efficiency gains to the economy.
89.       DergWulation of the Petroleum Sector and Dismantling of the Import
Monopoly. The deregulation of the petroleum sector and liberalization of petroleum
imports and the privatization of Petrojam are closely linked. GOJ designed its
deregulation/privatization program based on the recommendations of a recent study.
90.       Dismantling the Petroleuma Imort Monopoly. GOJ has dismantled the de
fact monopoly-maintained through prohibitive import taxes and duties. GOJ's objective
was to adopt a tariff structure which would: (i) eliminate Petrojam's monopoly; (ii) provide
sufficient revenue for GOJ to compensate for revenue losses expected from reduced direct
revenue via Petrojam; (iii) keep the final cost of petroleum products to the consumer at the
present level or reduce it; and (iv) be consistent with the overall CET (1993) structure.
The study concluded that a 5 to 10 percentage point differential between the tariffs on
crude oil and finished products would meet all objectives indicated above. The new CET,
adopted in April 1993, sets the tariff for crude oil at 5%. GOJ set the tariff for most
petroleum products at 1 5%,7 eliminated all stamp duties on petroleum products, removed
tax exemptions and other legal privileges of Petrojam, and made Petrojam subject to the
same tariff structure as all other importers. As a result, imports of petroleum products and
prices to distributors have been fully liberalized. GOJ, will undertake as needed, other
minor fine tuning in excise taxes on petroleum products to ensure revenue neutrality.
91.       Deregulation of the Sugar Sector. GOJ has undertaken intensive discussions
on the deregulation of the sugar sector with the sugar industry, labor unions and sugar
cane producers to build consensus. The deregulation is envisaged in the context of the
privatization of the remaining four publicly-owned sugar factories. GOJ's objective is to
increase the sector's low productivity and efficiency over the medium-term.
92.       Recently, GOJ has adopted a sugar sector deregulation program, and began
implementing it. GOJ has provided the Bank a letter detailing its sugar sector deregulation
program. In this letter, GOJ has committed itself to complete the implementation of this
program before second tranche release. The key elements of the GOJ's Sugar Sector
Deregulation Program are:
Lubricants, which attract 25% tariff under the new CEr, are not produced by Petrojam but by other
domestic industries, thus are irrelevant for Petrojam's import monopoly. A few products consumed by
the poor are at 0% tariff.



31
i.  Liberalization of the domestic marketing and imports of refined sugar
subject to an import tax.
ii. Restructuring the SIA such that it will become a regulatory agency
without any commercial functions or responsibilities.
iii. private provision of domestic marketing of sugar: The industry wilt be
free to organize the marketing of raw sugar under a private, centralized
marketing cooperative of producers and farmers (Jamaica Cane Products
Sales Ltd., JCPS), with the representation of labor unions in its board.
This option is preferred by the industry (farmers and producers) for
transparency, efficiency and economies of scale reasons. Practices of
JCPS, like all private companies, will come under the Fair Competition
Act.
iv. Management of export quotas: JCPS will also act as GOJ's sole
marketing agent for exporting raw sugar to preferential markets. Export
quotas to preferential markets will be allocated pro-rata among the sugar
mills/estates based on the current production. To protect the integrity of
the preferential export agreements, GOJ will maintain an import license on
raw sugar to prevent conduit trade.
v. Management of research: the industry will finance and manage SIRI, the
industry's research institute; and
vi. Liberalization of the foreign exchange allocation in the sector.
93.       GOJ has already adopted the export quota allocation system and defined the
specific regulatory functions that the new SIA will perform.
D. Prlvatizatlon Program
94.       The objective of GOJ is to implement the announced privatization program
rapidly and in a transparent way. Since the Bank and GOJ began working on the
privatization strategy in October 1991, on the whole, GOJ has progressed satisfactorily in
realizing privatization implementation targets. The 67 entities, assets and activities slated
for privatization represented more than 50% of the total assets of the PE sector
(Annx V!ll). Included on this list were 40 of the 50 largest entitles, all major loss makers
(Air Jamaica, sugar factories and railways), utilities (power and water), commercial
enterprises (Petrojam), and also smaller entities and public services. GOJ is aiming at
completing the privatization of these entities within two years with the exception of the
power and water companies to be completed within three years (by 1996). The principal
method of privatization for commercially oriented entities in productive sectors would be
divestment, i.e. change of ownership. For govemment services, historic landmarks, land
and utilities, GOJ will also consider other methods of privatization including long-term (25-
49 years) leases, lease with an opt$.;1 to buy, contracting out services and other types of concessions.



32
95.        Since the valuation of some entities is still being carried out, and ultimately
their value will be determined under the market test, an accurate estimate of the budgetary
impact of the privatization program cannot be made at this time. However, based on
rough calculations, taking into account investment proceeds as well as indirect gains from
the elimination of budgetary transfers and recurrent losses, the privatization program could
possibly yield revenues in the order of J$4 billion (gross) over the next 3-4 years
(cumulatively, about 10% of GDP).
96.        Generic Principles for Privatization. GOJ, with Bank assistance, clarified its
privatization policy and strategy and adopted the following principles, which are reflected
in its Letter of Development Policy: i) all appropriate regulatory Issues will be dealt with
prior to or simultaneously with privatization; (ii) no direct financing or loan guarantees will
be provided to purchasers; (iii) no new investments, other than maintenance, will be
undertaken by GOJ prior to privatization, except in the utilities sectors (power, water); (iv)
sale of public enterprises or entities to other public sector institutions will not be
considered as privatization; (v) all transactions will be conducted in an open and
transparent manner, consistent with normal standards of commercial discretion, and will
be open to local and foreign investors; (vi) no unsolicited offers will be processed,
recognized or assessed by GOJ or NIBJ, prior to the official advertisement of an entity;
NIBJ will respond to such unsolicited offers with a proforma letter informing the Interested
parties of the expected date of advertisement of the asset or entity; (vii) direct sale or
negotiation cannot occur without publicly solicited bids, except in cases where pre-emptive
right exists and where it is more economical to do so in light of small value of the assets
involved; (viii) at the completion of the sale, all aspects of the transaction will be in the
public domain; and (ix) in the case that minority share is retained in any enterprise by GOJ,
such interest will not have special or extraordinary voting considerations.
97.        Insttutonal Framework for Privatization. GOJ has put in place, since 1991,
a new institutional organization to centralize and better coordinate the privatization
process. The proposed loan supports the new institutional framework which Is based on
four principles:
(i) the Cabinet and the Prime Min:ster are the ultimate decision-making
authorities responsible for the program and should approve all
privatization transactions;
(i;) recommendations of acceptable offers will be sent by the NIBJ Board of
Directors to the Office of the Prime Minister for review and then
submitted to the Cabinet through the Subcommittee called the
Privatization Committee. The Subcommittee is composed of the Prime
Minister (chairman) and key Economic Ministers. Functions of the
Subcommittee include review of proposals, submissions to the Cabinet
seeking final approval of privatization transactions, and selection of
enterprises for divestiture;
(iii) an advisory Committee containing persons from the private sector acts as
a sounding board for the Prime Minister; and



33
(iv) NIBJ is to play a leading role as the implementing agency for privatization
(except for privatization of hotels and lands undertaken by UDC) and will
carry out the majority of transactions. NIBJ will implement these
transactions through various task forces or Enterprise Teams consisting of
NIBJ staff, representatives from sector ministries, and external
consultants. NIBJ maintains a small group of permanent staff and relies
mainly on the use of consultants to prepare and Implement privatization.
98.       Process and Procedures. The procedures for privatization adopted by NIBJ
reflect the extensive experience of Jamaica in carrying out privatizations. They constitute
a complete and comprehensive list of actions to be followed for transparency and
efficiency. The key steps are:
(i) NIBJ requests that relevant ministries and agencies identify entities in
their portfolio which are to be privatized. The list is submitted through
the Privatization Subcommittee to Cabinet for approval;
ii) After Cabinet approval, NIBJ is assisted by private local vnd international
consultants in implementation. Specifically, enterprise teams are formed
to undertake the necessary technical work for privatization;
(iii) Enterprise teams' responsibilities consist of data collection, valuation,
preparation of prospectus or tender documents, as well as solicitation and
negotiation. The proposed transactions or offers are submitted to Cabinet
through NIBJ Board of Directors and the Privatization Cabinet
Subcommittee. At this stage, sector ministries may participate in
negotiations; and
(iv) NIBJ implements Cabinet decisions and oversees the completion of legal
work and the hand-over of the entities. The same procedures are
applicable to UDC.
99.       Strte  and Timing for Implementaedon. With Bank assistance, GOJ
classified its entities into two major categories selected on the basis of size, impact on the
budget, complexity of issues involved in their privatization and expected long-term
efficiency gains: (i) priority entities; and (ii) medium and small size entities. The
conditionality is designed around the concept of "bringing to the point of saleo the entities
or assets concemed. Bringing to the point of sale of an entity or asset includes the
completion of audit and valuation of assets and the entity; preparation of an optimal
strategy; preparation of tender document or draft prospectus (for public offering);
elaboration of a marketing plan; and issuing the prospectus or the tender document. Once
the prospectus or the tender document is issued and advertised (eg. in newspapers), the
entity is brought to the point of sale.
100.      Prdvatization of Prioty Enties. Eight major entities were identified as
priority candidates for immediate privatization. These include four entities in the sugar
sector, Petrojam, Air Jamaica, National Commercial Bank (NCB), and Jamaica Railway



34
100.      Privatlzatlon of Prority Entities. Eight major entities were identified as
priority candidates for immediate privatization. These include four entities in the sugar
sector, Petrojam, Air Jamaica, National Commercial Bank (NCB), and Jamaica Railway
Corporation (JRC).8 Under the proposed loan, two sugar mills/estates Monymusk and
Frome, Air Jamaica and NCB have been brought to the point of sale. NCB is already fully
privatized, through a transfer of its remaining 39% shares to the private sector via a public
share offer, bringing in about J$600 million in proceeds. GOJ has received some
expressions of interest for Air Jamaica and negotiations are underway. In the sugar
sector, GOJ is considering long-term (49 years) leasing of lands in the estates and
inclusion of an ESOP component in the divestment of the factories. The GOJ's
deregulaUion program for the sugar sector was reflected in the tender documents.
101.      GOJ will bring to the point of sale, Petrojam and the two remaining sugar
entities before second tranche release. A privatization strategy for Petrojam is being
prepared based on a comprehensive study. Due to its poor financial situation, GOJ has
recently closed JRC down, declaring its employees redundant. Only a few employees
were retained to maintain the assets. Simultaneously, GOJ is carrying out a transport
sector study (financed through Loan 2389), of which rail transport is an integral part.
Recommendations of the study will be finalized by September 1993, and GOJ will draw up
a strategy for the restructuring and/or privatization of certain assets of JRC during the
second half of 1993. JRC will remain closed while GOJ finalizes this strategy. Before
second tranche, GOJ will begin the implementation of the restructuring/privatization
program for JRC.
102.      In the water sector, GOJ is considering the privatization of aspects of the
National Water Commission (NWC) and will begin developing, with Bank assistance, a
water sector strategy, as indicated in the Letter of Development Policy. The specifics of
the privatization tstrategy for the water sector will be prepared under the proposed Water
Sector Project. At this initial stage, GOJ has already begun contracting out water billing,
meter-reading and other services to the private sector. Some preliminary discussions
between the Bank and GOJ have begun on how to approach the regulatory framework and
privatization strategy.
103.      Privatization of Medium and Small Size Entities. The remaining entities,
assets and services on the privatization list comprise medium and small size commercially-
oriented public companies and some support services which together are a serious drain
on the budget. These will be brought to the point of sale under the proposed loan.
Implementation of the program is well underway. GOJ has brought to the point of sale 20
medium and small entities, assets or activities. In setting the implementation timetable,
priority has been given to those operating in competitive markets. In addition, four
Govemment-owned assets/lands were privatized through long-term leases, and three were
advertised for long-term lease. Progress in the implementation of the program until the
entities or assets are actually privatized, will be closely monitored by the Bank through
quarterly progress reports, as has been agreed with GOJ.
8    The privatization of NWC, except for contracting out of some of its services, will not fall under the
1993-94 program supported by the proposed loan, but will be included in the 1994-96 program.



35
105.      Liquidation of PEs. Complementary to divestment, GOJ will accelerate the
liquidation of entities which are insolvent, in receivership or have ceased operations. GOJ
in a letter to the Bank has specified the criteria for selecting PEs for liquidation among the
group of entities already brought to the point of sale, based on the market response (i.e., If
no acceptable offers are received within 9 months) and profitability. As a condition of the
release of the second tranche, GOJ will prepare a list of entities to be liquidated based on
these criteria and appoint liquidators to carry this out.
106.      Privatization Pipeline. To maintain the momentum of the privatization
program, GOJ will also prepare a 1994-96 privatization program, comprising the majority
of remaining publicly owned assets in the commercial, productive activities (excluding
bauxite) and public services including power, NWC and ports. Presentation to the Bank of
the GOJ's list of public entities in the 1994-96 "privatization pipeline" is a second tranche
condition.
107.      Environmental Action for Privatization. The Bank reviewed the list of PEs
slated for privatization, to identify: (a) potential preexisting Droblems stemming from past
neglect of environmental concerns by PEs; and (b) environmental problems that may arise
only if the privatized entity were used for a purpose other than its present (eq., die factory
to be converted to day-care center). A special environmental mission gathered relevant
information on all PEs and visited some entities to be privatized. Based on the above, the
Bank agreed with GOJ on the type of environmental actions necessary prior to
privatization. For entities in which GOJ mainta.ns controlling shares (not less than 50%),
GOJ will be responsible for bearing the cost of providing environmental audits as well as
for cleaning up preexisting problems prior to or during privatization. The other entities In
which GOJ has a minority share are considered the responsibility of the private sector.
108.      The entities where GOJ maintains a controlling share were classified into two
categories: (i) PEs which are likely candidates for environmental action, which therefore
require environmental audits prior to and disclosure of information during privatization; (ii)
PEs in benign environmental activities, which therefore do not require any further action.
As part of its privatization procedures, GOJ has agreed to provide these audits for entities
in category bin, to be disclosed as part of tender documents prior to the privatization of
each entity. GOJ has also agreed to take necessary action to clean up any contamination
found at closed facilities prior their privatization. Terms of reference (not specific to any
enterprise) were prepared and provided to GOJ. The list of entities that require
environmental action, based on the original 67 entities, is provided in Annex I.9 and
adequate information on the relevant sectors and the competition envirorment is available
for each PE on the list. Environmental regulation of the privatized entities will be
undertaken by NRCA (see para. 69).
9     JPSCo. and NWC were excluded from the list since they will not be privatized under the proposed loan.
An environmental audit is under preparation for JPSCo.

E. Improvin the Business Environment: Leal, Reaulator. Insitudional Reforms
109.     Investment Approvals and Export Transactions. During 1991-92, GOJ as well
as the private sector organizations took initiatives to find solutions to bureaucratic
problems hampering business activity. The proposed loan focuses on two critical areas,
i.e., investment approvals and export transactions. Recently, with Bank assistance,
proposed solutions to reduce administrative steps for investments and exports have been
consolidated in two sets of principles and immediate actions consistent with the agreed
principles. The principles reflect the clear shift in the GOJ's policy from control to support
and facilitation. GOJ's regulatory role will mainly be in monitoring and administering
environmental and health standards. They will also ensure that: (i) GOJ will not introduce
similar administrative controls in the future which could violate these principles; and (ii) the
private sector will operate in a level-playing field, without demanding privileges or
exceptions on a case to case basis. The principles and detailed Action Plans to be
supported under the proposed loan are included in Annex V. These received wide
acceptance by the private sector as well as government agencies involved in investment
and export processes. The action plans specify the measures that have been implemented
as a condition of Board presentation and those to be taken prior to the release of the
second tranche.
110.      For investment arwrovals the key objectives of the action plan include:
i) reduction of the approval time to an average of 1-2 weeks; (ii) streamlining and
reduction of the number of clearances and steps including the establishment of a short
negative list of unacceptable activities (eg., weapons industry, hazardous waste); (iii)
elimination of the discretionary technical evaluation system currently applied to new
investment proposals in activities where 100% of output is exported and in tourism
projects, which are entitled to incentive schemes; GOJ will replace this system with a
standard tax/duty exemption package to all 100% export-oriented investment projects
(including those located in free trade zones); and (iv) OJ's commitment to phase out
investment incentives schemes in the medium term.
111.      For export grocedures key objectives of the action plan (some of which are
also reflected in the customs reform program for consistency) are to: (i) adopt and put in
place a documentation-based verification of exports with random physical checks on a
small percentage of shipments; (ii) minimize customs involvement in export transactions;
and (iii) identify and eliminate all other control functions of JAMPRO with the exception of
those imposed by other countries for drug control purposes, in order to clarify its main
mandate as an export promotion agency supporting the private sector.
112.      Companies Act. GOJ is in the process of modemizing the 1965 Act. As
measures for reducing cost of business and increasing transparency, the revised
Companies Act will include: (i) simplification of the incorporation process permitting single
shareholder companies; (ii) simplification and relaxation of the rules relating to capital
maintenance, by introducing a solvency test for dividend distribution, share buy-backs,
etc; (iii) clarification of the role and responsibilities of directors and introduction of



37
objective standards of behavior and type of information that can be used by company
directors; (iv) introduction of provisions to permit the operation of holding companies, but
appropriately regulating holding company activities such as provision of information by one
holding company to another; (v) prohibitions to corporations from acting as directors of
companies, to ensure that identifiable natural persons will be accountable for performance
of their duties; (vi) relaxation of the auditing requirement for companies which do not offer
securities to the public; and (vii) clarification of the registration of corporate securities,
replacing the provisions for registration of companies with a new personal property
securities regime. Securities over feal property would continue to be govemed by the land
registration system.
113.      Reorganization. Insolvency and Uquidation Procedures. GOJ will also
introduce provisions, under the revised Companies Act, to facilitate and rationalize the
orderly reorganization and/or exit of companies in financial difficulty, with a formal
mechanism through which creditors can jointly impose restructuring when this is the
economically efficient option. The revised Companies Act will provide for financial,
physical, or other reorganization of companies threatened with insolvency, and introduce
and define the responsibilities of "administrative receivers", similar to the process provided
for by the Insolvency Act 1986 of U.K. GOJ has just completed a report on the
Companies Act reform which was reviewed by the Bank. The new revised Act will be
submitted to Parliament for approval, before the release of the second tranche. These
provisions have been included in the reform proposals.
114.      Competition Act. To create a level-playing field and foster competitive
behavior, GOJ has recently introduced the new Fair Competition Act (FCA). Key features
of the FCA include making price collusion and market division illegal. The FCA defines
dominant market power and brings sanctions for abuse of such power. It also addresses
basic consumer protection issues. The FCA provides for the creation of a Fair Trading
Commission (FTC) to enforce its provisions. Before second tranche release, the
regulations for the FCA will be put into effect and FTC will be established.
115.      Improving Competition In Distribution. Consistent with its deregulation
policies, GOJ has opened up entry in the domestic distribution of goods procured or
imported by JCTC under bilateral credit lines. It has adopted transparent procedures in
selecting distributors on a competitive bidding basis to encourage smaller-size distributors
to enter, fostering competition among distributors. Under this system, the eligibility of
distributors, both present and prospective, is determined based on the following:
i. to be a bona-fide, incorporated organization which complies fully with
regulations: they have to be a registered taxpayer and have an up-to-date
tax compliance certificate; and
ii. to be able to demonstrate creditworthiness: they have to pay cash
(manager's check) for all transactions prior to taking delivery of the
goods.
116.      Capital Market Reform. GOJ is undertaking a reform program to improve the
legal-regulatory framework for capital markets. GOJ introduced the new Securities Act in
March 1993. With the introduction of new regulations, existing restrictions to entry and



38
exit for the Stock Exchange will be removed. This will mark a policy shift from directly
controlling entry to use of clearly specified prudential regulations for the protection of
investors and financial stability in the market.
117.      Prior to second tranche release, GOJ will promulgate the regulations for the
new Securities Act, and establish a Securities Commission as provided by the Act. Under
the new regulatory framework, JSE will replace its present practices with entry conditions
based solely on uniformly applied professional qualification and financial standards.
Moreover, as a condition of second tranche release, GOJ will complete a review of
taxation of financial instruments including double taxation of dividends which presently
discourages equity investment and the raising of capital through public equity offers, to
establish a taxation scheme which is neutral between instruments. Based on the review,
GOJ will determine the changes in the tax regime, to be implemented in the following
fiscal year.
PART IV - OTHER FEATURES OF THE LQON
Lganiatory
118.      The loan process began in July 1991. Two identification missions and one
pre-appraisal mission were carried out (July and October 1991; December 1991).
Appraisal took place in April 1992. Loan preparation was supported by a Japanese Trust
Fund in the amount of USS450,000 equivalent. The preparation stage involved a close,
continuous GOJ-Bank dialogue particularly on the trade policy, privatization strategy and
sugar and petroleum sector deregulation. The Bank has provided technical assistance In
the preparation of competition, companies and securities legislation. Loan negotiations
took place during May 5-7, 1993 in Washington, D.C. The Jamaican delegation for
negotiations was led by Dr. Omar Davies, Minister without Portfolio, Office of the Prime
Minister.
Loan Amount. Tranching and Borrower
119.      The proposed US$75 million loan is to be disbursed in two tranches, US$40

implementing agency will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF); NIBJ will play a coordinating
role for the privatization component.

Incentives for financial instruments, to be introduced in the following fiscal
year.
123.      The receipt of an audit report on the disbursements of the first tranche
prepared by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank will also be a condition of second
tranche release.
B=urem-nt and Disburnt
124.      Disbursements will be linked to satisfactory adherence to the policy objectives
defined in the Letter of Development Policy and satisfactory compliance with the specific
conditons for tranche release (see Policy Matrix in Annex I and second tranche conditions
listed in Annex Il). Disbursements will be made against statements of expenditures



41
(SOEs), except for contracts valued at US$3 million equivalent or more, for which
disbursements would be made against full documentation received from the BOJ. The
minimum value for each SOE submitted would be US$250,000 equivalent. Suitable
documentation of expenditures under SOEs, based on customs declarations, will be
retained by BOJ and made available for the required audit and for inspection by the Bank.
Expenditures for goods procured under individual contracts costing less than US$5,000
equivalent would not be eligible for financing under the loan.
125.     Loan proceeds will be disbursed to finance the CIF cost of general imports,
except those listed in a standard negative list (eg. luxury, military, environmentally
hazardous goods). Moreover, because of the modality of procurement of petroleum
products under the San Jose accords, such products would not be eligible for financing
under the loan, until these practices change with the liberalization of petroleum product
imports supported under the loan. Retroactive financing will be allowed for up to 20% of
the loan amount (i.e. US$15 million equivalent) for payments made not more than four
.aoonths prior to the date of loan signature. All purchases of US$3 million equivalent or
more would be made through a simplified ICB procedure, in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Procurement valued below the ICB threshold should follow the standard
procedures in the case of public sector purchases and establi, hed commercial practice in
the case of private sector purchases.
126.     A Bank review of public and private sector procurement practices conducted a
year ago found their practices generally acceptable. Since then, there has not been any
change in the public procurement law and regulations. With the recent elimination of
Jamaica Comi. ,odity Trading Corporation's import monopolies under TFSAL II, the domain
of public procurement has been reduced, opening new areas-34 major product groups-for
private sector entry and competition. More generally, GOJ's policies for opening up the
trade regime and increasing competition through deregulation, removing barriers to entry
and promoting market mechanisms in recent years have been a strong incentive for the
private sector to actively seek for efficiency and cost effectiveness in acquiring goods and
services, both domestically and from abroad.
127.     Private sector companies generally follow a limited bidding procedure, or less
commonly, a publicly advertised tender in the press-often for locally acquired goods. The
limited bidding procedure consists of conveying invitations directly tu several suppliers in
pre-approved lists. Government agencies/companies also generally utilize the limited
bidding procedure, except for the GOJ's Supply Division (Ministry of Finance), which as a
rule must tender publicly with advertisements in the local press for all purchases over
J$15,000. Another important exception has been the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica,
which normally procures petroleum products and crude oil in the context of the San Jose
accord, or through directly negotiated contracts. Regarding supply commodities,
procurement can be made on the basis of quotations obtained from more than one
supplier.
Records and Aucdtdng
128.     BOJ would maintain separate records and accounts of all transactions under
the loan. An audit report by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank would be
submitted to the Bank within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year and



42
disbursement of each tranche. Receipt of a satisfactory audit report of the first tranche
will be a condition of second tranche release. Audit reports will give an opinion with
respect to the disbursement requests submitted to the Bank on the basis of SOEs. A
satisfactory audit report on TFSAL II has been received. GOJ is in compliance with audit
reports on past adjustment operations.
Monitoring
129.     The proposed operation will require monitoring of the implementation of its
various components, particularly of the macroeconomic framework, trade reform and
privatization programs. The Bank will carry out its monitoring of the loan components
through regular supervision and frequent exchanges of views with GOJ. It is envisaged
that the Bank's overall assessment of the macroeconomic performance will incorporate the
IMF's review of performance under the EFF program based on agreed targets. Given the
complexity of the privatization program involving more than 60 public entities, the Bank
developed a specific reporting/monitoring format which was adopted by the GOJ's
privatization implementation agency, NIBJ. This "Privatization Quarterly Progress Report"
would enable the Bank to follow the progress in the privatization program. Conceming
the reforms for improving the business environment, private sector feedback will also be
sought on a systematic basis.
Cooperation with other Multlateral InstitutJons
130.     The Bank has worked very closely with the IMF throughout the adjustment
prooess and in monitoring macroeconomic developments. There is also close coordination
with the IDB which supported the adjustment program with sector investment loans, and
with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in operations in Jamaica.
Benefits and Risks
131.     GOJ has taken important measures in a wide range of economic policy areas
and is committed to a stepped-up implementation of its economic reform program over the
next two years. Successful implementation of the GOJ's program will allow the Jamaican
economy to enhance price stability and achieve rapid and sustainable growth. A sustained
improvement of fiscal balances in the context of a sound macroeconomic program,
supported by tariff reform and privatization, will reduce the public sector's claims on the
country's resources and help build investor confidence. In the medium term, trade reform,
deregulation and privatization will stimulate domestic competition, efficiency and a strong
output and export response. These reforms should also have a positive social impact
through employment creation in non-traditional labor-intensive export sectors, and foster
less costly provision of goods and services formerly provided by the public sector and a
wider distribution of ownership. Tariff reform--via lower relative prices of imported food
items-will generate a positive impact on the poorest segments in the near term as well.
Complementary legal, regulatory and administrative reforms to modernize and improve the
business environment would accelerate the supply response by making Jamaica a more
attractive investment location.
132.     A major risk lies in GOJ's limited margin of flexibility in successfully
implementing the structural adjustment program, given the economy's vulnerability to



43
external shocks and the large debt overhang. The ability to proceed with the reforms at
the envisaged pace will depend on the timely implementation of the fiscal measures
needed to achieve a surplus in the overall fiscal accounts, and on the continuation of the
public's support of the program. An important factor to ensure continued support would
be the safety-net programs GOJ is undertaking to reduce the short-term social costs of
adjustment. Although the privatization program has had a good reception so far, the next
stages will be more complex, and socially and politically sensitive, including the sugar and
petroleum sectors and involving labor redundancies. Should the adjustment program slow
down, the problems associated with low efficiency, fiscal deficits and crowding out of the
private sector would Aeemerge. However, in the recent elections, the current
Administration recved a strong mandate from the public for the next five years to
continue its econ34mic reform program. GOJ's determination to achieve fiscal targets to
maintain stabili4 and its commitment to accelerate the reform program should reduce the
risks.    /
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
<33.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
/ Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Dear Mr. Prestons
The Governent of Jamaica requests a World Bank loan to support its
policy adjustment programm in order to achieve rapid and sustained growth
through private ector development.
The objectives of the programme are to successfully consolidate
Jamaica's decade-long structural adjustment effort to achieve macroeconomic
stability and to restore the economy's capacity to generate positive growth rates
on a sustained basis. It also aims to create a business-friendly environment,
free of bariers to entry and excessive restrictions, ln which an efflcient,
internationally and domestically cometitive private sector can become the engine
of growth. Md$.tionally, the Government's role in the economy will shift towards
a stronger focus on social sectors and infrastructure, by reducing its direct
involvemnt in and ownership of comercially-oriented sectors. To achieve these
objectives, the Government's reform program. focuses on macroeconomic policies,
trade reform, deregulation, a far-teaching privatization programme and a
comprehensive set of legal, regulatory and administrative reforms of the business
environment.



58
XacreSconomic Framework
The medium-term policy framework of the Government of Jamaica alms at
improving growth performance, reducing the rate of inflation in line with its
major trading partners, achieving a viable external position, and continuing to
enhance the environment for the rapid expansion of private sector activities.
This framework is consistent with the Extended Fund Facility from the
International Monetary Fund, in effect from December 1992 to December 199S.
In accordance with its Medium-Term Framework Paper of May 1992, the
Government of Jamaica is pursulng policies to reduce regulation and state
intervention, while correcting financial imbalances.  In 1991, most remaining
restrictions affecting the foreign exchange system were removed, and a general
consumption (value added) tax was introduced to improve the tax system.  All
general subsidies were eliminated, and the pricing poliLy of the public sector
was adjusted in line with market forces. The overall operations of the public
sector were nearly balanced in ?Y1991/92, and achieved a modest surplus in
rY1992/93. While inflation soared to over six per cent per month in early 1992,
it fell quickly by the middle of the year and has averaged under one per cent
per month since January 1993  (10-15 per cent per year).   After a rapid
depreciation and brief recovery of the exchange rate following ;he liberalization
in September 1991, the value of the Jamaican dollar vis-a-via the US dollar has
been stable since June 1992. These measures resulted in slower growth in real
GDP, 0.8 per cent in FY1991/92 and about two per cent in FY1992/93. However,
the medium-term economic programme projects the growth rate to be above three
per cent in the mid-1990s and above five per cent in the later 1990s.  The
Government will follow policies to reduce the twelve month increase in consumer
prices to 6.5 per cent by the end of 1Y1993/94 and to maintain it in lLne with
the inflation rate of Jamaica's main trading partners in FY1994/95 and FY1995/96.
The nominal exchange rate with the US dollar will be allowed to move in response
to market forces in so far as it maintains the current level of competitiveness
of the real exchange rate.
Increasing the growth rate of real GODP will require increased domestic
saving and investment, and improved economic efficiency. We expect these to
result from the structural reforms and deregulation programme pursued by the
Governmnat and described in this letter. Public sector savings (including grants
and Bank of Jamaica losses) are projected to increase from 7.8 per cent of GDP
in FY1991/92 to 9.5 per cent of GDP in 1Y1992/93 and to approximately twelve per
cent of GDP by 3Y1995/96. Private sector savings is expected to grow more slowly
at first, because of the initial slow growth in GDP, but should accelerato as
the private sector gains confidence in the economic policies and as the GDP
growth rates increase.
The Government intends to maintain a strong fiscal performance to
accommodate private sector expansion, partly through revonue efficiency measures
including broadening the base of the general consumption tax; other the tax
reforms, measures to increase cost recoveryl and improved customs administration.
The primary emphasis, however, is on improvements in publlc expenditure policies.
Public sector investment will decline modestly in relation to GDP in 1Y1993/94 -



59
is projected to rise significantly during the programme period. Pablic sector
investment will concentrate increasingly on social and economic infrastructure
that can best be harried out. by Government, and many of the investments
undertaken in the past by the public sector will be left to private sector
initiative. Further, in order to contaln public COOtor recourse to domestic
financing, projects involving foreign financing will be given priority. to this
end, recently the warrant and contract systems were re-ezamined and the
availability of domestic counterpart fundlng for externally funded projects was
accorded high priority.
The overall public sector balance (including the Bank of Jamaica
losses but excluding from revenue the proceeds of divestment) has shifted from
a deficit of 0.4 per cent of ODP in TY1991/92 to a surplus of 0.1 per cent of
GDP in JY1992/93. This surplus is slated to rise to 2.5 per cent of GDP in
1993/94 and to three per cent in 1Y1994/95. The overall balance of the public
entities is targeted to improve substantially, which will more than offset a
temporary widening of the deficit of the rest of the public sector in 1Y1992/93
and FY1993/94.  The non-financial public sector will be able to reduce its
domestic indebtedness to permit expansion in bank credit to the private sector,
and for the Bank of Jamaica to increase its net intetnational reserves while
reducing its medium- and long-term liabilities. The Government will continue
to monitor revenue and expenditure flows closely and stands ready to adjust the
expenditure level and fiscal rovenues to achieve the public sector performance
targets.
The Government's accelerated privatization programme is an important
part of the Government's fiscal adjustment programme. Privatization proceed
(potentially JS4 billion over three to four years) will not be counted as part
of current revenues, and will be used to reduce public debt in order to contain
the overall deficit of the remaining public sector within manageable limits.
In allocating the proceeds of privatization between the reduction of domestic
or international debt, the Government will consider both the desirability of
reducing the highest cost liabilities and the necessity of maintaining a
competitive exchange rate.
There are no restrictipns on current external payments in Jamaica and
virtually none on capital transactions. The interbank foreign exchange market
is free of direct government intervention. Maintenance of this liberalized
foreign exchange system and a market-determined exchange rate are cornerstones
of the Governments medium-term policy framework. Economic pollcies will *am
at promoting stability in the exchange market, while achieving the Government s
objectives for growth, price stability and stability of external balances. The
Government's medium-term programme seeks to achieve substantial Lmprovements in
the balance of payments through a stepped-up emphasis on export expansion and
improved debt management and, thus, will ensure that the current account deficit
ig reduced from 7.2 per cent of GDP in 9Y1991/92 (excluding grants) to about four
per cent in FY1992/93, to two per cent of GDP in 1Y1993/94 and to 1.5 per cent
aDP in 9Y1994/95.
Under the Administrative Reform Programme, the Government reduced the
size of the civll service payroll by twenty per cent (more than 7,000 persons)
fronm June a t  invember 1992.  on a full-year basis, this action will reduce the



60
covernmentes wage bill by about eight per cent.   The Governmnt will uoe the
occasion of the reduction in employment to increase efficiency in the civil
service through a better matching of skills and job requirements.
The Government is committed to promoting budgetary transparency and
the financial independence of the Bank of JamaLca. The Government has begun to
discharge its obligatLon to provide cash transfers to help cover the Bark of
Jamaica losses, which increased over the past several years.  In this context,
the Governrent intends to eliminate this quasi-fiscal deficit for FY199S/96 and
beyond.   These transfers will cover all the interest costs of sank of JamaLoa
cortificatos of deposit, starting in FY1993/94, and will cover tho outlays to
reduce the stock of outstanding certificates of deposit. This reduction will
start in FY1993/94 and will be complete by the end of FY1995/96. The Government
has begun to make budget allocations to cover these transfers and also cash
transfers to cover the interest on all government debt held by the Bank of
Jamaica.
The Government is extremely concerned about the social cost of
economiL adjustment, particularly among the poor. To enhance the quality and
durability of the growth process and to protect the vulnerable groups affected
by the dislocation resulting from the implementation of the reform agenda, the
government has taken actions to address the needs of the most economically
disadvantaged groups in the society. The Government's  objective is to gradually
improve and maintain minimum required levels of expenditures in the social
sectors (health, nutrition and education) consistent with its fiscal targets and
the prioritised Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP). The Government is
committed to an annual increase in the share of the non-debt recurrent budget
going to the social sectors. In addition, the Government will commit itself to
raise tho share in the PSIP for education, health, nutritlon programme from
thirteen per cent in FY1992/93 to at least eighteen per cent in 7Y1994/95. These
actions also include the provision of short-term relief through the Food Stamp
Progranme (mainly for children under the age of six years, pregnant women, anq
lactating mothers) and the Nicro-Nnterprise Programso which provides financing
and technical assistance to small businesses wlth the objective of increasing
employment and production.
The oovernment is also committed to continue these social safety net
programmes as a subcategory of total expenditures in social sectors, at 1.1 por
cent of aDP in the medium term. Within the recurrent budget for MLnistry of
&elth, resources for primary care ae to be increased to 25 per cent of the
total. For education, the Government has already met a target of 38 per cent
of its recurrent expenditures going to primary education. The Government is
committed to an annual increase in the total share of recurrent expenditures for
basic education (grades 1-9)  To alleviate the immediate effects of the labor
redundancy expected from the upcoming divestments, particularly of the suga
factories, the Government is considering introducing safety-net packages on a
caseby-case asessoment of needs within the limits of budgetary target.
about ten per cent of public sector investment in 1993-96 will be
spent on projects which contribute to environmental protection, including
agriculture, forestry, watershed management, wratet-water treatment, and the
development of a protected areas syste.   In 1991, the Natural Resouroes



61
Conservatior Act was passed and a Natural Resources Conservation agency was
created. This agency, with the help of the Ministry of Public Service and the
Znvironment and an inter-MLnisterial Committee, will establish a regulatory
framework and research programme in the area of environmental protection in
Jamaica. The Agency has been re-examining a number of new development projects
in the agricultural area with a view to enhancing the environment and mitigating
potential damage.
Financial Sectog
In recent years the Government has reformed its financial sector
policies, addressing all major issues. All interest rate controls have been
removed, movi:;ng to market determined interest rates.   Interest rate subsidieo
have been eliminated, excepting those for low income housing (through the
National Housing Trust, ZHT), which have now become transparent.
The Government had begun a gradual equalization of the cash-reserve
requirements for commercial banks and merchant banks at seventeen per cent by
December 1993. However, as part of the stabilization programme, the Government
recently revised this programe and temporarily raised the reserve requirement
for commercial banks to 25 per cent. Currently this ratio is ten per cent for
merchant banks and is being adjusted according to the original programme's
timetable.  Tho Government, however, remains committed to the equalization
programme and has set a new date in 1995 to complete it.
in addition, the Government has strengthened the legal-regulatory
framework to introduce stricter prudential regulations and improved supervision.
Amendments to the Banking Act (covering commercial banks), a new Financial
Institutions Act (covering "near banks", for example, trust companies and
merchant banks) and a revised Bank of Jamaica Act were all recently approved by
Parliament. The new Banking and Financial Institutions Acts now include explicit
capital adeouacy requirements for commercial and near banks as well as limits
on exposure to related parties and rules on loan classification. The revised
Bank of Jamaica Act strengthens the authority of the Inspector of Banks to
enforce sound practices.
consistent with its macroeconomic objectives, the Government s medium-
term strategy is based on substantially reducing the size and scope of the public
sector, and stimulating investment and growth through the development of an
efficlent private sector. Thus, the remaining reform agenda focuses on further
improvements  in  efficiency,  through  trade  vnolicy  reform,  deregulation,
privatisation and the reform of the legal-regu-atory framework for business,
creating an appropriate competitive environment for foreign and domestic
investment.
Trade Policy Reform



62
Since 1987, Jamaica has taken major steps to liberalize its external
trade regime. All import licenses have been abolished except for a few ltems
for health and socurLty considerations. Stamp duties have been removed, with
the exception of protective agricultural stamp duties.  rmport tarlffs were
reduced from zero-to-70 per cent to zero-to-45 per cent in February 1991 an part
of the 1991 CRRO03 agrement. Moet public trading monopolies in the agriculture
sector have been deregulated and the JCTO iLport monopoly extending over 34
product groups has been eliminated. Sxport licenses, except for those retained
for health and security reasons or as part of international arrangemnts - for
example, sugar - were removed and most duty exemptions have been abolLshed.
Remaining exemptions only apply to imports of 100-per-cent-exporting firms
(including tourism) and charitable organizations. The Government also initiated
a Customs Reform Programme in 1990 to improve efficiency of customs
admLnistration and revenue collection and has prepared a revised Anti Dumping
legislation, consistent with OATT articles, which will be submitted to Parliament
for approval during thLs fiscal year.
Continued trade reform is an important component of the Government s
reform programme to complete the remaining steps towards creating an outward-
oriented polLcy envlronment. The Government is convinced that to strengthen its
international competitiveness, rapid tariff reform beyond what had already been
introduced in 1990 was essential, particularly in light of region-wide moves in
Latln America towards lower tariffs.   The Government's main objectives,
therefore, are to substantially reduce tarlff protection, facilitate trade
through a complete overhaul of the customs administration to modernize and
simplify systems and procedures for processing/clearing imports and exports.
This will include the introductlon of an effective duty-drawback system and
further rationalization of remaining exemption schemes.
The Government has already taken major steps to achieve these
objectives. It led the dlicussions wLthln CARICON for a major tariff reduction
at an accelerated pace.  On october 29, 1q92, at a special Heads of Government
meting, CARICOM reached an agreement on a tariff reform programme to reduce
tariffs in stages to a five-to-twenty per cent range by 1997-98. Some features
of the neW CARICOZ agreeen t1 whloh were proposed by the Government of Jamaica,
are the provision of fast-track and slow-track options for implement.ation of the
reforms by member countries, and a yearly progre9s review of the tariff reform.
The Government of Jamaica has chosen the shorter implementation timetable and
moved to a five-to-30 per cent tariff range in April 1993, with four tariff
lines at 5, 20, 25 and 30 per cent.  The only exceptions are tariLfs for
agricultural inputs and the basic necessities basket at zero per cent, and
tariffs for agricultural products (for example, fresh tropical fruits, citrus
and sugar) at 40 per cent, which will remain in effect until the GATT
negotiations are concluded. As agrioultural subsidies for these coumodities in
other countries are phased out, the import tarlff for agricultural product will
be reduced.
The second stage of reform will be Implemented by January 1998 when
Jamaica will have moved to a fiLe-tO-25 Per cent range, with three tariff levels.
By January 1997, at the third stA9e, the tariff range will be reduced to five-
to-twenty per cent. At this stage, all zero-rated items and most 40 per cent
ites,, de,endina on the outcos  of GATT negotiatLons, will have been brought into



63
the main tariff range. The Government still maintains the long term objective
of moving to a uniform fifteen per cent tariff structure.
The three-stage tariff reform programue described above has been
anneunced publicly and discussed in detail with the private sector to ensure
transparency and credibility of medium term objectives. The Government believes
that a better understanding of the reform programme by potential trader. and
investors provides a clear signal on the direction of the incentive framework,
and thus, will lead to a more efficient allocation of new investments. Within
twelve months of the implementation, the Government will complete a review of
the tariff reform, based on indicators for total and investment goods, imports,
supply or investment and export response and discuss the conclusions with the
Bank.
The improved international competitiveness, increased export
orientation and the introduction of the new tariff structure for agricultural
products and inputs will enable that sector to better compete with extra-
regional imports. Accordingly, the Government ha. decided to reduce the existing
protection to the agriculture sector by accelerating the elimination of
protective agricultural stamp dutLes. Stamp duties for agricultural products
were eliminated in May 1993. All remaining agricultural stamp duties, with the
exception of a few sensitive goods, will be eliminated by March 1994. Stamp
duties for the sensitive goods will be eliminated by March 1995.
The Government is also determined to put an end to the chronic
inefficiencies from weaknesses and discretionary practices at the Customs
administration, a major bottleneck for business. Recently, the Government has
taken specific steps in Customs reforms Customs personnel was significantly
downsized; a nmw management was assigned; a new investigation unit was
established to audit all revenue services; and re-training programs were
initiated to improve the skills as well as the morale of the staff.  The
Government also intends to improve revenue collection by addressing the rampant
under-invoicing and fraud issues.   Moreover,  the exlsting Customs reform
programme was revised and strengthened, adopting "trade facilitationa as its main
objective. The revised action plan aim to achiev measurable and substantial
improvements in the quality and speed of customs clearance in order to facilitate
imports, exports and revenue collection. The Government will be pursuing these
objectives by minimizing Customs involvement in export transactions and
establishing an effective, modernised and speedy system for clearance of imports.
The specific targets for the maximum time for cargo clearance ares (i) 24 hours
for regular importers with no past record of breach of cust2m laws and
reg.iatAonal (ii) 48 hours for first time or occasional importers; (UiL) 72
hours for importers with a record of breach of customs laws and regulations;
(iv) eight hours for exporters of perishable goods, with no record of breach of
customs laws and regulations; (v) twelve hours for regular exporters; and (vi)
24 hours for first time and occasional exporters.
Exporters will continue to be responsible for providing 24 hours prior
notification to Customs of their shipments. The Government will monitor these
targets through systematic sampling of customs records and information obtained
from exporters and importers.   The above targets will be fully met on a
sustainable basis within a twelve month period, by March 1994. The Government



64
sustainable basis within a twelve month period, by March 1994.  the Government
has already implemented the first round of measures an specified in the new
Customs Reform Action Plan and will complete the implementation of the remaining
measures by March 1994. Anmong these, a key measure for facilitating exports,
will be the introduction of effective outy-auspension/duty-drawback schemes by
March 1994.
Dgreulation
The oovernment of Jamaica has been deregulating different facets of
the economy since the mid-1980s to create an environment conducive to private
sector development by lucreasing the role of market forces and competition. Most
price controls and generalized price subsidies were eliminated, and will not be
reinstated. Public marketing boards and trading monopolies were dismantled and
exchange controls and legal barriers to foreign Investment were lifted. As part
of its new reform agenda, the Government will tackle complex issues of regulating
the utilitiest power, water and telecommunicationsl and the deregulation of two
remaining regulated commercial sectors, sugar and petroleum, where the Government
is simultaneously preparing the privatization of state-owned entities.  The
Government believes that the clarification of the regulatory framework will play
a very important role In the privatization of publicly-owned entities in the
sugar and petroleum sectors, bringing transparency to the process and increasing
investor  confidence.    The  sequencing of deregulation  and  the  specific
privatization inttiatives being undertaken ln these sectors is discussed further
in this letter. The Government is also proceeding with the formulation of an
agriculture sector strategy that would build on the deregulation and
privatization initiatives described below, partly through reorienting research
and extension activities to support private sector export development, especially
for non-traditional products.  In the touri sm sector, the aim Is to secure
increased private participation in financing the promotional activities for this
already innovative and successful Industry.
In the petroleum sector, the Government has already successfully
deregulated the distribution and retail margins, allowing distriburlon companies
to sot their own wholesale and retail prices. To complete the deregulation
process, the Government has recently adopted and implemented a comprehensive
deregulation programme to end the import monopoly of the state-owned petroleum
refinery, Petrojam, liberalized imports of petroleum products and deregulated
the prices of petroleum products to distributors.
This programme, already implemented in May 1993, compriseds (i) the
adoption of a new import tariff structure such that a ten percentage points
differential is maintained between import tariffs for petroleum products and
crude oil. Consistent with the new CRT structure introduced in April 1993, the
Government adopted a five per cent import tariff for crude oil and a fifteen
per cent import tariff for most petroleum products, the only exceptions being
the lubricants at 25 per cent tariff and a few petrolewm products consumed by
the poor at zero per cent tariff; (iI) elimination of (import) stamp duties on
petroleum productst (iII) the elimination of the tax exemptlons and other leqaL
ad regulatory privileges that Petrojam enjoyed to preserve a sole importew

status of petroleum products; imposing the same import tariff structure on
Petrojam. The Government has already taken the necessary steps to eliminate
Petrojam's import monopoly position and tariff exemptions;  and   (iv) the
liberalization of prices of petroleum products to the distrlbutors.
The Government believes that the new tariff structure will provide
sufficient revenue to compensate for the foregone direct revenue from Petrojam
and is consistent with fiscal requirements. Should a revenue gap arlse, the
Goverrnent will make the necessary adjustments ln domestic excise taxes on
petroleum products to ensure revenue neutrality, but will not lncrease import
tariffs and duties beyond the agreed fifteen per cent.
In efforts to lncrease competition among suppliers and curb
oligopolistic pricing in the sector, the Government will monitor the impact of
its deregulation/liberalization. programme on competition in downstream activities
(the tankage/storage, transportation and distribution at wholesale and retail
stages), and continue to implement measures to facilitate competition among
small independent importers and the existing distributors.  The Government'
strategy for privatizing Petrojam will also take into consideration, and will
be consistent with, the maintenance of a competitive environment.
The deregulation of the sugar sector, along with the divestment of the
remaining four publicly-owned sugar mills/estates, is one of the key components
of the Government's reform agenda. In determining the specific deregulation
strategy, the Government has engaged in intensive discussions and consensus-
building with the cane farmers, the sugar manufacturers and the labor unions,
to resolve the most socially sensitive issues. The Government's objective in
to increase the sector's low productivity and efficiency over the medium term.
This will involve moving to a more market driven structure, through the
divestment of remainlng entities and a change in the present institutional and
regulatory structure. The Government *sprogramme aimsat maximizing the benefits
to the economy as a whole, taking into consideration the consumers, producers,
workers and the Government.
The key elements of the comprehensive Sugar Sector Deregulation
Programme are:  (V) liberalizatLon of the domestic marketing and imports of
refined sugar subject to an import tax; (1L) restructuring the Sugar Industry
Authority (SIA) so that it will become a regulatory agency without any commercial
functions or responsibilities;  (iii) liberalization of domestic marketing of
sugar. However, the industry will be free to organize the marketing of raw sugar
under a private, centralized marketing cooperatLve of producers and farmers, vls
jamaica Cane Products Sales Ltd. (JCPB), with the representation of labour unions
on its board. This option has strong support in the industry for effiieoncy and
economies of scale reasons. Practlces of JCPS, like all private companles, will
ccme under the fair Competition Act. (iv) JCPS will also act as the Government's
sole marketing agent for exporting raw sugar to preferential markets. Xpowrt
quotas to preferential markets will be allocated pro-rata among the sugar
mlills/estates based on the current production. To protect the integrity of the
preferentLal export agreemnts, the Government will maintain an import lLcense
on raw sugar to prevent condult trade. (v) The industry wlll finn¢ce and manaeg
the Sugar Industry Research institute; and (vi) forelgn exchange allocation ln
the sector wll be liberalLzed.



66
The implementatiov% of the above desoribed Programme is underway. A
full description of the functions of the new restructured SIA as a regulatory
body and ito financing have been prepared.  Similarly, modifications ln the
structure of JCPS, to fulfill its now reuponaibilities, have been identified.
The implementation of the deregulation programme will be fully completed by
March 1994, including the necessary changes in legislatlon and institutional
structure.
The establishment of appropriate regulatory frameworks for the power
and water sectors as well as for the privately-owned telecomnunication sector
are among the important initiatlves that the Government has taken. In the power
sector, as part of its energy sect,xr privatisation and deregulation strategy,
the Government is in the proce. of developing a regulatory framework to be
implemented prior to the prlvatization of the Jamaica Public Service Company
(jPs) in 1994.  In addition, steps are now beLng finalized for bringing in
private sector investment in new power generation.  The Government is now
developLng a water sector stratogy. The main elements of this strategy are to
increase the private sector's participation and to privatizate aspects of the
operations of the National Water Comuission (NWC) in order to rehabilitate the
gector and resolve the severe problems it faces. At this initial stage, the
Government has begun contractLng out water bLIling, meter-reading and other
services to the private sector. Along with these strategies, the Government will
be pursuing the option of establishing an independent utilities regulatory
commission in charge of power, water and telecommunications.
The Government of Jamaica takes pride in having brought the
environmental concerns to the fore at a very early stage. The Government's major
polLcy initiatives include the completion of the National 3nvironmental Action
Plan and scheduled activity is three critical areasi land use, the urban
environment, and water pollution. The passage of the comprehensive Natural
Resource Conservation Act in 1991 and the establishment of an umbrella authority
(the National Resource Conservation Authority, NRCA) allow for the development
of national planning, monitorLng and regulatory systems, and also support the
specific prograues maentioned.
Land use plans include the improvement of coastal zone management,
increased tachnical assistance for watershed project, and the removal of
irrigation subsidies in the interests of better resource use. For the urban
envLronment, a comunity onvironmental project Is proposed, together wlth support
for environmental assessmnat And compLiance among smw.1er enterprises. A major
urban problem, water pollution iL being addresed within an investment program..
that includ"s projects along the North Coast, a planned water project in Kingston
and a much larger project, still in the planing stage, for pollution abatement
in the ingston Harbour area. Currently no enforceable enviroaneatal regulations
exist for industrial charges in Jamaicae  However, the NRCA has been working on
Lntroducing such regulations, and Ls gearing up to impose effectlve regulation

of the entire industrial sector, including privatized entities, in the near
future.
PIratization
The Government of Jamaica has a well established record of
privatisation in a wide range of activities. During the first decade of the
privatieation programm  (1981-1991) more than fifty enterprlues were privatized,
including th  Jamaica Teloepone Company (JTC), hotels, National Commercial sank
(NC3) and the Carib ement Company. An accelerated pdivatiaatLon programme,
cutting across amny seators, is one of the cornerstones of the Government  s
macroeconomic adjustment program and private sector devlopment strategy.
Through pruvatisation, the Government aims at increasing economic effLeiencyp
reducing the drain on public sector resources; widening the ownerchip base and
direct equity participationi and enhancing access to foreign markets,
technologies and capital. The Government has adopted the principle that It will
withdraw over the medium term from commercially-oriented activities, and seek
private sector participation in utillties and in other infrastructure, through
divestiture and private sector sponsorship of new investments. The Government
envisages continued involvement in transportation (roads, ports and airports)
where it is now starting a privatization initiative; and in bauxite/alumina where
it maintains joint-ventures with foreign multinationals. Consistent with this
policy, the Government will not create new majority-owned public enterprLses in
commercial activities in the futurs.
The initial list of more than sixty entities that were slated for
privatization represent more than fifty per cent of the total assets of the
public enterprise sector. Among these are forty of the fifty largest entities,
including major loss makers such as Air Jamaica, sugar factorLes and the JZamaica
Railway Corporation (JRC)t and commercial enterprises such as Petrojam, JPS and
the National water Commission (NNC), as well as smaller entities and services.
Since then a few other entities and assets were added to the list of enterprises
to be divested.   The Government is prepared to implement the announced
privatisation programme rapidly ond through transparent procedures. It is aiming
at completing the privatization of all of these entities by the end of 1994.
nowever, the divestment in power and water which have already begun are expected
to span over a three to four year period.
The primary mode of privatisation is divestment - a direct transfer
of ownership to the private sector - particularly in commercial sectors.
However, the privatization mthod and strategy  for each entity  will be
determined, depending on the type of asset and the seotor. Ior example, in the
case of water, the Government will explore a combination of different methods
of privatization, including contracting out services and long term leasing.



68
The GovervAent has also prepared legislation which will soon be tabled in
Parliament, to introduce Bmploye Stock Ownership Plans (35OPm) to broaden the
ownership bav;. ESOPs are extlacted to be used by private companies as a method
of raising capi 4al. This legislation is the first of its kind In developing
countrieo. The qoverament will encourage the inclusion of an USOP component in
privatization packages0 wherever appropriate.
The new institutional framework, prlvatization objectives and strategy
were spelled out in the Ministry Paper Not 34 issued by Offloe of the Prime
Minister in 1991. In this now phase of Privatiation, the GOverment has decided
to take a more centralized and systematic approach. The National Investment Bank
of Jimaica (N1B3) han becom  the institution responsible for coordination and
implementation of the programme, and was placed under the responsibility of the
Office  of the  Prime Minister, with  the  Prime Minister himself having
responsibility for this programme. The institutiomia responsibilities and the
process have been fine-tuned since 1991, to bring more flexibility and enur
a more explicit 'consensus-buildLasf in the decision making process, while
preserving transparency. more decentralized supporting  chanisms (for example,
special Divestment Coraittees) were introduced into this oentralized framework
to better handle more troubleson  or sensitive divestments.   Such camittees
have been established in the cases of Air Jamaica, 3PS, Petrojam and the sugar
sector. with ome of the technlcal work for complex or sensitive privatixation
now being carried out by special comamittees, 11N has concentrated more on the
privatization of "all and medium entities and plays a coordinating role for the
remaining entities.  In addition, the Urban Developmt Corporation (UDC) has
been given a parallel privatization portfolio of remaining four hotels and public
land, sharing NIBJ' s previously unLque responsibility for implemeting the
privatization programme. The objectives, process and the principe  set out by
the Government, however, apply to both WDC and 513J.
The Government has decided that the prlvatization of each entity will
be carried out in a way consistent with the following principles   (i) all
appropriate regulatory issues will he dealt with prior to, or simultaneusly
with, privatisation;   (ni) no direct financang or loan guarantees will be
provided to purchasers; (iii) no new investments, other than maintenance will
be undertaken by the Government prior to privatLsation, except La the utilities
sectors (power and water); (iv) sale of public enterprise or entLties to other
public sector institutions will nat be aoniderd as privatisatLoRI  (v) all
transactions will be conducted ln an open and transparent awaner consistent with
normal standards of comuercial discretion, and will be open to local and foreign
investors; (vi) no unsolicited offers will be procesod, recognised or asessed
by the GoverMent or N5B1, prior to thO official advertiOs t of ae tityl NB3
will respond to such unsolicited offers with a pro-foam   letter informin  the
interested parties of the expected dto of adver:tlsment of the asset or entity;
(vii) dlrect sale or negotiation camot occur without publicly solicited bide,
except in cases wbhere pre-emptive right exists and where it is maore economical
to do so in light of the small value of the assets involvedp (viii) at the
completion of the sale, all aspects of the transaction wlll be in the public
domain: and (ix) in case a minority share is retained in any enterprise by the
Goverrnmt, such lnte"rt will not be ascribed specLal or extraordinary voting
considerations.



69
The Government is committed to follow these principles strjctly to
ensure transparency, accountability and the maximum long term bnefits to the
country from privatization. !-hese principles ae reflected in a Policy Paper
issued by the Office of the Prime Xinister as a supplement to the miistry Papr
No. 34.
The  ovrnment has prepared specific privatisation timetables for
every entity, indicating the expected implementation date for each key step in
the privatization process, such as completion of valuation, bringing to the point
of sale, negotiations and cmpletiOn of the transaction.  The Goverment is
fully coaLmitted to complete the privatization of all entlties within the set
timetables. Based on the experience of past privatization and as reflected in
the privatization timetables, under normal circumstances the privatisation of
an entity should be completed within twelve months of bringing it to the point
of sale.
For v. more systematic and effective implementation, the Government has
clarified its ov&rall privatization strategy by classifying the entities slated
for privatization as priority entities, and small and medium size entities, based
on size, impact on the budget, complexity of issues involved in their
privatization and expected impact on the long term efficiency gains. Priority
entities are Petrojam, Air Jamaica, MC8, the remaining four publicly-owned sugar
mills/estates and JRC. Among these, NCB, Air Jamaica and the four sugar entities
have already been brought to the "point of sale". The Government understands
that "brought to the point of sale" to mean the campletion of preparatory work
including audit and valuation, privatization strategy, preparation of tender
document (for sale of assets) or draft prospectus (for public offering) and the
Issuing of the prospectus or the tender document and issuing the public
announcement or advertisement for privatization.
National Commercial Bank is already fully privatized, through a
transfer of its remaining 39 per cent shares to the private sector via a public
share offer, and the Government has received some expressions of interest for
Air Jamaica.   In the sugar sector, valuation work for all entities was
accelerated and the privatisatior. of two entities was advanced by one year, and
all four remaining sugar entities, instead of just Monymusk and Frome as agreed
under the programme, were offered for sale simultaneously in May 1993. The now
regulatory framework in the sugar sector was Lncluded in the invitation for bids
for the sugar entities. By March 1994, the Government will also bring Petrojam
to the point of sale.  A privatization strategy for Petrojam is now being
finalized, based on a comprehensive study which also addressed the regulatory
issues and import liberalization. The rallway, JRC, has been closed and all
employees, except for a few who were retained to manage the JRC's assets, have
been made redundant. The Government is carrying out a transport sector study
of which rail transport is an integral part. Recommendations of the study will
be  finalized  by  September  1993.    The  Government  will draw  on  these
recommendations to formulate a strategy for restructuring andlor privatization
of JRC during-tbe second half of 1993. By March 1994, the implemenn of the
agreed programme for JRC will have progressed according to the timetable adopted
by the Government.



70
Significant progress has been made In the privatization oft  a
remaining small and medium size entities, assets and servlces dLated for
privatisation. The GovermenSt has already brought twenty entities to the point
of sale. Out of the twenty entities, elevn have been divested, one contracted
out (hospital services) and eight are under negotiations or have been advertised.
rn addition, four gornment-owed assets/lands were privatlied through long-
term (25-49 years) leases and three advertised for long term lease.  ay March
1994, at least another twenty entities, assets or services will be brought to
the point of sale. The Government will monitor the implementation progress
closely and will prepare a quarterly progre"s report, including lessons from
the privatization processes and reasons for any delays or changes in the
timetable.
The Governmnt will also acceolrate the liquidation of entities which
are insolvent, in receivership or have ceased operations. To facilitate the
future liquidations and to avoid keeping insolvent entities on the privatization
list indefinitely, the Government has adopted criterLa for declding when a public
enterprise becomes a candidate for liquidation.  Using these criteria, the
Goverment will identify entities to be liquidated among those offered for
privatizatlon nine months earlier and which have not attracted any acceptable
offers from the private sector. Following a review, the Government will appoint
liquidators to each etity which has been finally selected.
To maintain the momentum of the privatization programme, the
Government is in the process of preparing a 1994-96 prlvatization programme
includlng new privatization candidates. This list will comprise the majority
of remaining publicly-owned assets in the commercial and productive sectors
(excluding the bauxite industry) as well as public servLces, and the utilities
(power and water). This new list of entities slated for privatization, that is
in "the pipeline", will be finalized and approved by Cabinet by March 1994.
The Government will be responsible for carrying out environmental
audits for public entities which pose a potential environmental problem and in
which the Government has controlling shares (not less than fifty per cent), prior
to theLr privatization. Such entities have already been identified and the
Government has begun taking the required actions.
Buainess Lgal and ReaulatorM finvonment
since mid-1980s, the Government implemented reforms to improve the
business onvironment through deregulation, Lacluding the removal of legal
restrictions on foreign investments and trade. rn its reform programme, the
Government plans to eliminate remaining major bottlenecks for investment, exports
and dometic competition ln order to change the image that some investors have
of Jamaica as a highly bureaucratic, regulated environment. During the past
year, the Governmt intenified lts efforts to improve business environment
through legal, regulatory and administrative reforms covoring competition,
doastic distribution, capital markets, corporate law and bureaucratic red tape.



71
The Government has just introduced a new Fair Competitiot Act, to
provide a leel playing field and foster competitive behavior. The Act makes
price oollusion and market division illegal, defines dominant market position
and brings sanctions against the abuse of such dominant market powr. It also
addresses basic consumer protection issues. The Act creates a lair Trading
Comission (FTC) to enforce the its provisions.  By March 1994, the Governmnt
is committed to put into offect all the regulations accompanyin the Act and to
establish and make the FTC fully operational. The Government will carry out a
review, within twelve months, to assess the performance and practices of FTC.
To further improve competition in domestic distribution of staple
goods generally procured by Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation (JCTC), the
Government has opened up entry in domestic distribution by changing 3CTCos
methods of selecting its distributors. The JCTC now has transparent competitive-
bidding procedures for selecting distributors. For eligibility, distributors
are now required to be bona-fide Incorporated organizations complying with
Government regulations and up-to-date with their tax obiLgations, and to
demonstrate creditworthiness.
The Government is simultaneously improving the legal-regulatory
framework for capital market development. rt has recently enacted the Securities
Act which creates a new Securities Commission. By March l994, the regulations
under the Securities Act, Including those for the operations of stock exchanges,
will have been- promulgated and the Securities Commission will have been
established. New regulatory framework for stock exchanges wilL remove existing
restrictions on entry/exit and will introduce instead non-discretionary entry
criteria based on professional qualification and financial standards, backed up
by rigorous prudential regulation. By March 1994, the Government will also
complete a review of taxation of financial instraments, including double taxation
of dividends which presently discourages equity investment and the raising of
capital through public equity offers, in order to establish a taxation scheme
which is neutral across instruments. Based on the review the Government will
introduce changes in the tax regime in FY1994/95.
The Government has been preparing a draft Companies Act to modernize
the business environment, facilitate entry and exit and reduce the cost of day-
to-day business activities, which will be submltted to Parliament for approval
by March 1994,. The Government's objectives ares (i) to minimize barrLers to
entry for small businesses seeking the benefits of incorporationt   (i1) to
encourage efficient and innovative management of companies by conferring
directors a wide measure of discretion in matters of business judgement, while
protecting shareholders and creditors against abuses of management powerg (Lii)
not to inhibit legitimate commercial activities, or place unnecessary limits on
the ability of participants in enterprises to structure those enterprises in the
most aypropriate wayp and (iv) not to impose unnecessary compliance costs on
businesses operating in Jamaica. In addition, the revised draft Companies Act
will introduce provisions for rationalizing and facilitating the reorganlsation
or the orderly exit (liquidation) of companies In financial difficulty, and will
clarify the responsibilities of uadmlnistrative receivers'.
In connection with the changes to be introduced under the new
Companies Act, the Government is now envisaging the modernization of the register



72
uf personal property system in the medium term. A new register of personal
property securities would replace both the Register of Company Charges and the
Bills of Sale Registers kept in Srsnish Town. This reform will aimplify search
procedures, increasing certainty in comrcial transactions and facilitating the
eventual computerization of the registration and searching systems.
Finally, the Government is determined to drastically improve the day-
to-day dealing of business with the state by eliminating heavy administrative
red tape. During 1991-92 the Government took important initiatives to increase
the Government-private sector collaboration to fled simple solutions to
bureaucratic problem hampering businefs activity. The Government has initially
focused on the investment and export processes which have a very significant
impact on business performanoe. The proposed changes would require a complete
shift in the Government'. role andmandate from control to facilitation. To this
effect, the Government has adopted a number of pxLnctfle2a to define its future
responsibilities, role and mandate in the areas of investments and exports. The
Govement is fully committed to these principles, which are reflected in the
Corporate Plan for the Customs Department and the Corporate Plan for the Ministry
of Industry, Comerce and Tourism, and will not take actions or impose controls
which would violate them.   In addition, to address the immediate specific
problems, it has developed detailed action plans to streamline and simplify
export and investment procedures in line with the principles. The Action Plans
received wide acceptance by private sector as well as government agencies
involved in investment and export processes.
specifically, in the investment area, the Government has reduced the
approval time to an average of one to two weeks, streamlined steps Involved, with
the aLm of reducing the number of clearances. To this and, the Government has
established a short negative list of unacceptable activities, such as, weapons
industry and hazardous waste processing. The Government has also eliminated
the discretionary technical evaluation system used for investment proposals in
activities exporting 100 per cent of their production and tourism projects. The
Government is committed to gradually phasing out investment incentives schemes,
malntaining only those incentives that have proven effective across countries.
In  the  export  area,  the  Government  has:  (i)  adopted  a
documentation-based verification Of exports with random physical checks on a
small percentage of shipments7 and (ii) minimized customs Involvement in export
transactions and eliminated all other control functions of JAMPRO with the
exception of those imposed by other countries for drug control purposes. This
is consistent will JAMPRO becoming solely an export prmotion agency a 2p2rn
the private sector.



73
With the Iupl.amntation of the above policies, Jamaica will have
substantially accelerated the reform agenda and consolidated its structural
adjustment effort, increased its reliance on the private sector and on market
forces as the aegine of economic growth.

Dear Mr. Husain:
Re: PrivAte Sector D__veopAent AdustentLo
Sugear Sectr Dereguaion Pro¢tzRm.e
The Government of Jamaica has adopted a Sugar Sector Deregulation
Programme, to coxplement Its privatization programme which includes
the divsestment of four remaining public-sugar entities.   The
objective of the deregulation programme is to create a regulatory
environment  which  will  encourage  greater  efficiency  and
productivity In the sugar sector.
The key- components of the programme are in trade reform, both
import and export arrangements, domestic marketing and the
institution structure of the market.
Liberalization of Iaports
Imports of refined sugar will be fully liberalized by December 1993
and the following tariff regime applied. Imports wiLl be subject
to a variable import levy composed of the Common External Tarift
for sugar and a variable stamp duty which would make up the
difference between th.. current world price and a long term average
world price of refined sugar.
Imports of raw sugar will remain under lcensing requirements to
maintain the integrity of preferential export arrangements by the
prevention of conduit trade.

Export Markets
The Government of Jamaica will Institute regulations that allow it
to claim entitlement to any sugar production necessary to fulfill
the quota  for preferential  export agreements.   However,  the
management of the quots export process, including the allocation of
foreign currency proceeds will be contracted to a private marketing
co0panJ, zaV, JaPaica Cane Products Sales Limited (JCPS) wich
whould comprise representation from all sectors of the industry.
The JCPS, being a private entity will be responsible for adjusting
Its operations in line with the requirements for the private
marketing cooperative, including representation of labour unions on
its Board and the establishment of a mnechanisa to al2ocate
production for the export quota, Pro rata mong the mills and
estates.
Poreign Exchange Allocation
Jamaica Cane Products Sales will also be required to escablish
accounting procedures to deal with the allocation of foreign
currency from export quota sales. The Government of Jamaica will
amend current regulations to govern this al7ocation as follows.
The Government will be entitled to purchase the portion of foreign
currency which represents the premium between the world market
reference price defined above and the price received from the
preferential warkets, at the prevailing rate of exchange.  The
remainder of the foreign exchange will be allocated between the
miollers and growers according  to a ratio  in line  with  the
relationship between the two interests specified in other
r.egulations.
Domestic Marketing
Domestic marketing of sugar will be liberalized, leaving the
industry members free to organize the marketing functions under a
central body.   The ops.raations of this market and any central
organization will come under the Fair Competition Act which was
enacted earlier this year.
Institutional Framework
The Government will phase out or transfer the commercial functions
of the Sugar Industry Authority (SIR) over the next ten months.



76                          AAN'X V
Page 3 of 4
These functions include:
-    the importation of sugar;
-    the responsibility for the division Oa industry proceeds;
-    the domestic marketing of sugar;
-    the  distribution  of grants/lubsiidies  for  refining,
reaping, irrigation and transport;
-    intermediation in the allocation of credit to sugar cane
growers; and
-    the responsibility of various industry funds.
With regard to the reorganization of the SIA, the Government of
Jamaica will engage the necessary expertise to advise on the
appropriate mechanism for the transfer of functions and the new
structure of SIA, as well as on a detailed schedule for the
process.   The National  Investment Bank of Jamaica Enterprise
Committee on Sugar will coordinate the process of divestment of
commercial activities by the SIA, and the transfer of the
mnagement of preferential market export quotas.   A specific
schedule for the process taking into account the current commercial
agreements of SIA will be agreed by June 2993.
Once the process of transfer has been specified, the Government of
Tamalica will issue instructions for the necessary amendments to the
Sugar Industry Act, which embodies the majority of regulations
governing the industry. Action will also begin apace on amendments
to other legislation which need to be amended along with this Act.
The remaining regulations governing the other industry matters
including:
-    revenue sharing between millers and girowera;
-    technical arrangements regarding the processing of cane,
including the Cane Pr:ces Committee, Jamaica Recoverable
Cane Sugar Formula and cane sampling;
-    registration of cane growers; and
-    activities of the industry's Factory Inspectorate
will remain under the purview of the SIA. The Authority will also
establish a Statistical Unit to monitor and publicize current
trends in the domestic and international sugar markets. The SIA
will be funded through the Government Budget by a fee levied on
industry members, the details of which will be worked out along
with the FY 1994195 aud,rt ar D 1rn,tn

Sequencing
It is important that the major part of these reforms be completed
before the beginning of the 1993/94 sugar crop in December.  The
Govornment is committed to ensuring that the transition to a
deregulated market takes place smoothly and with minimum disruption
to producers and consumers.  Steps will be taken in a sequence
consistent with the sector's financial and production cycle.
A ker element in the programme will be a public relations progrmme
to sensitizo the growers, manufacturers; consumers and end-users to
the substance and effects of the propoae* changes. The Government
is already continuing discussions with ;;he industry to this end.
The outline prograe of deregulation will be completed by March
1994, at which time the Government will undertake with the Bank a
joint review of the deregulated system.
Yours sincerely,
Davies
Zfnister without Portfolio

Action Plan
Simplification of Investment and Export Procedures
kUQBn
INVESMERr
Adopt within the Corporate Plan of the Ministry of Industry the principles May 1993
that GOJ should have a simple investment regime, absent discreionary review
and which moves towards a "level playing field concept." (See Attachment 1
for Statement of Principles to guide GO Involvement in the Investment
Process.)
Investment Approval Proces
Develop and adopt a Negative List which precisely specifies those investment May 1993
activities, processes, etc. which the GOJ wishes to exclude from Jamaica for
legitimate reasons, such as environmental protection and security. The
negative list should not be used for protecting existing opeations from new
competition.
Remove the requirement for screening of those individual project applications May 1993
not covered by the Negative List.
Incorporate security and environmental concemns into normal business  May 1993
regulations, not linked to the investment process.
Pendig the possible modification of the EIEA, any exporter covered by bay 1993
EIEA Approved Industres and Approved Products, who is wiling to commit
to 100% export, will automatically be given 'Approved Export Manufacturer
status under the EIEA.
Undertalme a brief study of the incentives offered, and the importance of these lecemb  1993
incentives to recent invesors in competitor countries and in Jamaica.
Using the results of this study on incentives, develop a uniform and atracve March 1994
tax treatment for the full range of productive activities, moving away from
conditional incentives. Consistent with the removal of scefning, the ElEA
and Freezone Act will be modified accordingly if neded. Incentives will
move from being screening-based to being performance-based.

Duty Concessions on Capital Equipment
Eliminate the duty and GCT concessions of the Modernization of Industry March 1994
Scheme, which are based on individual usage screening.
Give clear guidance to JAMPRO that, ahead of the elimination of this  September 1993
concession, they are to be guided by the proposed revisions in the OCr
Schedule. All purchases of the items covered are to be allowed a concession
of these revised rates of GCT, unless there are specific reasons for them to
be denied this.
Eliminate all other duty and GCT concessions based on case by case  March 1994
discretion or evaluation, including the "Approved Farmer* duty concessions.
Establish instead that any one product will have one single rate of import
duty and of GCr, regardless of usage or user.
Acquisition of Government Land
Institute arrangements acceptable to the Bank, such that prior to disposal, March 1994
government land can be considered for other purposes than agriculture,
particularly industrial purposes, and zoned accordingly.
Institute Regulations and Procedures under the new Financial Administration March 1994
and Audit Act, specifying arrangements for the public adversing of
government land disposals, followed by open and transparent procedures for
competitive bidding.
THE EXPORT fPOCES
Lethimate Interests of GOJ Involvement in the Export Proce.
Adopt principles defining legitimate interests of the GOJ in the export May 1993
transaction and based on these interests, deternine how best to meet these
interests with minimal interference to exporters. Such prnciples are to be
incorporated into the Customs Corporate Plan (See Attachment 2 for
Statement of Principles which define GOJ legitimate interests.)

CUsOMS ExpORT CLEARANCE
Undertake a special project to develop a Customs Export Procedures Manual, May 1993
the draft of which is to be considered by a joint committee, with
representation by JEA and other private representative assocations. Adopt
the new manual, and issue public notices to the trade, detailing the new
procedures that affect their transactions.  This manual will incorporate
procedures consistent with a "single point in time" export clearance (see
below). Assign consultants.
Adopt the new manual officially, and issue public notices to inform the Sptepmber 1993
exporting community.
Customs clearance will take place at a single point of time, just prior to exit. September 1993
Documents will only be presented and the apportunity to inspect the shipment
vill be at that one time. The power of a Customs Officer to delay an export
shipment will be reduced to the absolute minimum. Those powers to delay
that are retained will be monitored, so as to contain possible misuse.
Clearance will involve:  (a) verification that the statistical information May 1993
presented is adequate for Statin's purposes; and (b) confirmation that no item
on the list of controlled exports is being exported.
Exceptions to this clearance procedure will be the foUowing: (a) request by May 1993
the exporter to verify export details for purposes of making claims on
Customs, such as for Duty Drawback or Duty Suspension; and (b), Customs
will inspect export shipments based on intelligence work, and on random
number generation.
Reduce the rate of sample-based inspection of exports from the present 100% May 1993
to no more than 10% of all export shipments in any month. Inspection of
cargo will be based on intelligence work, relating sampling rates to shipment
profiles (e.g., destination, type of product).
Computerizadon of Customs export procedures, based on this Export December 1993
Procedures Manual. The computerization process itself will also be advised
by the joint committee. The computerized system will incorporate the
foUowing:
- Systems audit of regular exporters.
- Automated risk profling of shipments.
-   These will in turn drive the automated selection of shipments for
inspection.
Improve the procedures by which exports will not longer need clearance for July 1993
the lack of statistical information and in which exports may present the
missing information within a reasonable period (say 7-14 days), with this
privilege being automatically withdrawn as a result of failure to comply.



82
Page 5 of 10
Remove all implicit "taces" on the export transaction, including the exisdng May 1993
75 cents "attendance fee".
Intoduce the new single export clearance form, which will incorporate the July 1993
aforementioned procedures.
Apply the above guidelines to transactions involving "export' from the May 1993
Customs territory to a Free Zone. Transactions involving export from the
Customs territory to a Freezone will be greatly simplified, requiring only
submission of commercial invoices. Entries for floppy disk entering or
leaving Zones will be on the basis of Airway Bills alone.
NARCOnCS
Undertake a review the current trade integrity system, and develop workable December 1993
options for improving the current system or for developing a new system.
Develop a system enabling the accreditation of a limited number of private December 1993
companies to provide canine sniffing services to exporters.
Remove the requirement for Customs to sign the Cargo Integrity Form.  May 1993
EXPORT CONTROIS
Export Uceuses
Review the list of seventeen items currently subject to Export Licensing. July 1993
Replace licensing by specific Export Bans thus minimizing diceion in the
process (subject to Cabinet approval of these proposed changes).
Bureau of Standards (JBS) Certification
Remove the furniture cerfification requirement. JBS may continue to provide May 1993
a certification service on a voluntary for fee basis.
Allow the use of private accredited laboratories to provide processed food March 1994
certifications for export.
Commodity Boards
Inveigat adopting a system of voluntary pre-inspection, in which exporters December 1993
would voluntarily receive a seal of approval with accompanying grades.

DUTY DRAWBACK & Dunr SUSPENSION
A new computer-based duty drawback and duty suspension regime will be March 1994
introduced, based on the principles of systems audit; period returns by
traders; and selective inspection based on risk profiling.
WtADE FACIHTATION BOARD
Develop and implement a plan to strengthen the TFB which would do the May 1993
following:
Outline a program to disseminate information about the existence of the TFB May 1993
to exporters.
Develop and adopt a system wherein exporters with specific problems would May 1993
be able to present these problems to the TFB for resolution.
Establish how the TEB would communicate its fimdings and agreed upon May 1993
actions to the public.
Establish the requirement that the Government representatives on the TFB be May 1993
invested with the authority from the highest level of their agencies and that
they be held responsible to canry out agreed upon actions.
(Performance of the various participating ministries and agencies against this
requirement will be monitored regularly by JAMPRO. Copies of JAMPRO's
monitoring reports will be provided to the World Bank.)

Attachment One
Principles Governing GOJ Involvement In the Investment Process
GOJ's overriding interest is to attact new foreign investment and to stimulate local investmt
in export-oriented industries. The following principles will further this goal.
The Investment Approval Process. Discretion should be removed from the investment
approval process. Investors are free to go ahead, as long as they are not involved in precisely
defined, unacceptable activities, and do not apply for special incentives . The major components
of the process should be:
* Clear, openly published, easy-to-verify conditions which replace disonary powr.
Any manufacturing or service industry which is not on the negative list would be an
approved investment.
* A Negative List would be published which would clearly specify these activities not
acceptable to GOJ. Any activity not specified on the Negative List would receive
automatic approval.
* Other public concerns, such as environmental or security issues, would be applied as they
would be to any business activity in Jamaica, and would not be linked to an investment
approval process.
A type of contract between GOJ and the investor will be used to cover the conditions
implicit in special tax or other incentives (e.g., 100% of output must be exworter).
Investment Incentives. A simple investment regime, without discretionary review, is the most
attractive investment regime. Incentives should be phased out without distnction between
foreign and local investors and among sectors. The administration of the regime should be
unified, and not under different laws and agencies.

ANNEX 
Page 8 of 10
Attachment Two
PrLndples Governing GOJ Involvement In the Export Trnsaction
The following are the legitimate interests of GOJ in the export transaction. These interest would
govern GOJ's role involvement in exports, minimizing exporters' costs, uncertainties and delays.
*  Customs Cleanrnce. GOJ has a legitimate interest in clearing (i.e., for a customs
officer to sign off) goods for export in order to (i) verify the exporters registration
number, (ii) check the accuracy of statistical information, (iii) check containers on a
random sample or intelligence basis, and (iv) to verify duty claims (as discussed below).
This should be implemented through a "Single Point in Time" clearance, in which the
documents and goods are only examined at one time pnor to shipping.
° Narcotics ContamIation. GOJ has an interest in minimizing the contamination of
legitimate export cargo by illegal narcotics. Its interest is to ensure that shipping lines
continue to serve Jamaican ports. A secondary interest is to minimize the damage the
drug trade has on Jamaica's image as a place to conduct business. This interest does not
suggest that GOJ needs to assume complete responsibility for controlling narcotics
contamination. In fact, the guiding principle should be passing on this responsibility,
wherever feasible, to the exporters themselves, and to accredited private firms to provide
necessary services such as canine sniffing. Any system that is developed should be
periodically reviewed to ensure its continued effectiveness.
* Duty Suspension/Duty Drawback. GO has an interest in providing effective schemes
to allow exporters to not pay duty on incorporated inputs. 001 has a legitimate interest
in verifying the value and composition of exports involving these type of duty claims.
The system needs to be administered simply and effectively to encourage exporters to
take advantage of these schemes.
* Export Controls. There may be a few products for which controls may be justified for
natural resource or other concerns. In these cases, controls should be in the form of
bans, as opposed to licenses.
* Quality Control. There may be a limited number of items for which GOJ may impose
inspection requirements to ensure that minimum health and safety standards are met. In
these cases, GOJ should allow for private, certified laboratories to provide the required
certification.
e  Trade Statics. GOJ has an interest in capturing accurate trade stistics. This interst
should be promoted with minimal interference to export activity. This can be



86
Page 9 of 10
accomplished widtin the "Single Point of lhme' clearnce. Regular exporters should be
allowed to provide this data at a later time, subject to the provision that if this data is not
provided they lose their privilege to do so in the fuue.
FactoD of Exports. GOJ has an interest in facilitating those ewor supported by
its bilatrl agreements for which exporters require Certificates of Origin. This service
should be provided on a legitimate fee basis, and should be periodically reviewed to
ensure that it is provided efficiently.
0 MonItoring          --mplementato of Trade Practice Reform. GOJ has an interest to ensure
that the simplification of export procedures is implemented in an effectve manner.
Mechanisms need to be in place in which the private sector can communicate on a
regular basis problems they are experiencing due to government involvement in the
export process. The Trade Facilitaion Board has been identified as this mechamm.
The TFB needs to be operated under the principles of (i) penness to the public, (ii)
authority to implement its findings, and (iii) accountability for its actions.

CUSTOMS RfEORM PROGRAMME
ACTION PLAN
OVERALL OBJECTIVE:
The Customs Department and RPD adopt as its main objective, to be specified
In the new Corporate Plan for Customs, TRADE FACILTATION and efficient collection of
taxes and duties arising from trade activities. The Corporate Plan will also specifically
include the general principles and processing time targets for imports and exports. BY May
ia.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND TARGETS FOR TRADE FACIUTATION:
To be adopted by Moy J2M.
1. PRINCIES FOR IMPORTS:
The custom's legitimate interest/involvement in imports are:
1.  collection of tax revenue
2.  enforcement of Custom's laws and regulations to prevent smuggling and fraud
3.  minimizing the level of narcotics trafficking
4.  collection of reliable statistics on imports, being the first check point for
incoming goods
5.  administration of duty-suspension or duty-drawback schemes and other
remaining exemption schemes
ADOPT CUSTOM*'S TARGETS FOQ IMPORT CLEARANCE
Import clearance Is the time between acceptance by customs of an Import
entry and the time at which the entry is finally made available to the broker for
removal of the goods from customs control.



89
ANNEX VIl
Page 2 of 7
A 'breach of customs laws and regulations* is a deliberate act punished under
the customs act 1941 as amended.
Undue delay in the clearance of imported goods is contrary to the overall
objectives of this program.
24, AND 72 HQUR LIMLT FOR CLEARINQ IMPORTED GOODS AT THE
CUSTOMS
-   REGULAR IMPORTERS WHO HAVE NO RECORD OF BREACH OF
CUSTOMS LAWS AND REGULATIONS: 24 hours
-   FIRST TIME OR OCCASIONAL IMPORTER: 48 hours
-   IMPORTERS WITH A RECORD OF BREACHING CUSTOMS LAWS OR
REGULATIONS: 72 hours
These targets to be reached on a sustained basis by March 1994.
II. PRINCIPLES FOR EXPORTS:
To be adopted by May I I9.
The Customs' legitimate interestAnvolvement in exports are for:
1.  Collection of reliable statistics on exports, being the last check point befor-
goods leave the country.
2. Administration of the Duty Drawback and Duty Suspension regimes.
3. Inspection of exports to minimize narcotics trafficking through 'if .telligence
based sampling".
4.  Checking against the unlawful exportation of controlled exports.
ADOPT CUSTOM'S TARGETS FOR EXPORT CLEARANCE: By May 1993
-    Export clearance is the time between acceptance by customs of an
export entry and the time at which the entry is finally made available to
the broker/exporter for removal of the goods from customs control.
-    REGULAR EXPORTERS WITH PERISHABLE GOODS: 8 hours
-   REGULAR EXPORTERS WITH NON-PERISHABLE GOODS: 12 hours
-   SMALL EXPORTERS WITH SPECIAL, SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES: 8 hours

ANNEX Vll
Page 3 of 7
FIRST TIME EXPORTERS/OCCASIONAL EXPORTERS: 24 hours
These targets to be reached on a sustained basis by March 1994.
SPECIFIC ACTIM-
To achieve the important export targets with defined objectives; this Customs
Reform Program Action Plan has been adopted to be Implemented over a 12 month period.
The focus of the Customs Reform would be the Facilitation of Imoorts and cxorts.
Priority areas for reform are Minimization of Custom's involvement In Exogrt Transactions.
Improvement of Mansagment of Customs. Imorovement of Manaaement Systems and
Procedures. Iaroduction of Duty-Susnension/Dutv Drawback schemes. and Modificaion of
Customs Law and Regulations
Introductlon of a fystem of Timing and Datina Imoort & Export Entries
An automated system of timing and dating the submission of entries Is to be
introduced. If the entry is to be retumed to the broker etc It should also be timed and
dated. This process should be applied for each occasion the entry is accepted, rejected
and finally leaves Customs for the removal of goods from Customs control. Wherever
possible Customs should endeavor to cause amendments to be made on the spot. By
December 199.
|?tPQRT FACILITATION
In line with the above defined objectives, and consistent with the 'Acdon Plan for
Simplficaton of Invest-nent and Export Proceduresm the Customs Departnent will adopt
the following procedures:
1.  Adoption of 'single point in time' clearance of exports: Relevant documents
will be checked only once and the Customs will clear an export shipment at the same time,
just prior to exit. By May 1993.
2.  The clearance will Involve (a) verification that the statistical information
presented is adequate for STATIN's purposes; and (b) confirmation that no item on the list
of (remaining few) controlled exports is being exported. By Myi 1993.
3. Procedures will be changed such that collection of statistical information will
not be a reason to refuse clearance: Exporters will be asked to present the missing
information within a reasonable period (7-14 days), with this privilege being automatically
withdrawn for next shipments as a result of failure to comply. By Jjvf 1993.



91
AbNIEX-VIl
Page 4 of 7
4.  In addition, Customs will inspect export shipments based on intelligence for
security reasons and on a random sampling basis. The Sampling rate will be reduced from
100% to no more shan 10%. These sampling rates could be related to shipment profiles
(e.g. destination, type of product). By Mau 199.3
5.  New single export clearance form will be introduced, consistent with the
aforementioned procedures. The new form will rationalize/reduce information requested
(based on STATIN needs). By JtUh. 1993.
6.  Implement computerization of Customs export procedures. By March 1994.
7.  Same guidelines will be applied to transactions involving uexport from the
Customs territory to a Free Zons. By MUy 912.
8.  The requirement for Customs to sign the Cargo Integrity form will be removed.
By March 1993.
9.  Develop and adopt a new computer-based Duty Drawback and Duty
Suspension scheme, which is very high priority. This will allow phase out other Incentive
schemes that have a very high administrative cost on Customs. By Mabrch 1994.
MAMNAEMENT F CUSTOMS
Estabishment of an effective system of management and control for the CUFoMms
Program:
1.  Preparation of a new Corporate Plan defining the roles and functions of Customs, In
a clear, measurable and integrated manner. This Corporate Plan to be presented to the
World Bank for review. May 1993.
2.  Presentation to the World Bank of excerpts from the latest Corporate Plan of the
Ministry of Finance, incorporating RPD and the Revenue Board, showing how their
functions assist in import and export clearance processes. Iy Julv 19y .
3.  The Customs Corporate Plan should specifically address the tasks outlined In this
program with particular reference, also, to objectives and their implementation deadlines
for the petiod before full implementation of the Customs computerization program.
4.  In addition, this Corporate Plan should Include the project/tasks to be undertaken by
Customs to implement the Customs reform program to achieve the objectives/targets
indicated above, as well as other existing tasks that Customs already perform.
Accordingly It must provide the basis to monitor both the progress of the reform and the
performance of the routine customs functions. Thus, it should establish a system of
reporting and collecting information as hosts for performance evaluation. By Marh 1994.



92
ANINEX-M1
Page 5 of 7
5.  A specially designed departmental ma.lagement plan outlining the functions and
objectives of Customs should be published for public and trade consumption, to cover
periods of a maximum of three years. Proposals should be completed by MArch 1994.
6.  Establish an accountability structure, whilst ensuring wherever possible that decision
taking is delegated. By March 1994.
7.  To strengthen the standard of Customs staff at all levels. Prepare and present the
World Bank a training program, covering the period May 1993 - March 1994, involving all
aspects of the operation, including the training of officers at selected overseas centers in
the latest international Customs techniques. Program will specify types ot training and
number of people. This is essential, particulariy in view of the need for rotation to avoid
corruption, and that they give uniform and consistent rulings/decisions to traders. By Mav
1,3.
8.  Establish a management information system (MIS) based on an headquarters PC to
enable senior management to review current information on staffing deployment,
budgeting and the progress of each feature in the management plan. A control system
should be designed and implemented to produce the information required for the MIS. By
MaEgh 1994.
9.  Establish and implement and audit program designed to verify non-random but risk
based selected traders' accounts in relation to the implementation of the effective (non
i 00% routinely examined) duty suspension and duty drawback systems. This programma
should employ the 24 or so trained auditors whose graduation is expected before this
date. By Mrch 1994.
10. An adequate number of officers at Customs House should be selected to receive
special training in duty drawback &/or duty suspensio... These trained officers will provide
the resource necessary to operate the documentary (rather than audit) control of these
trade facilities effectively and to provide an office hours reference point for traders
operating or considering operating duty drawback &Ior duty suspension. By March 1994.
11. All Customs offices attended by traders and the public should be clearly signposted
with specific functions assigned to certain areas, counters etc. By March 19.24.
12. To maintain attendance at public offices and warehouses, etc. throughout the
working day rather than closing at lunch time (staggered lunch time arrangement). Where
Customs occupy offices in premises controlled by other bodies. Customs will be present
whenever these premises are open for business. By MaU 199.

13. Oceratlonal Manuals:
(i)  Exports - an operational instruction manual embracing the latest
legislative/regulatory amendments aimed at encouraging trade facilitation
should be prepared and circulated to all concemed officers for effective
implementation by them of the instructions therein no later than July 1993. In
order to achieve this ambitious objective, a consultancy team is to be
appointed. By May 1993.
The team will prepare a draft instructions manual for consideration by a small
working party comprising Trevor MacMillan of the RPD, Beverley Lopez of the
JEA and one other to be nominated. The working party itself will be formed by
1 June 1993 and will meet weekly at the JEA. It will have power to seek
evidence from all interested parties during its deliberations. The manual is
adopted, and public notices issued. By Semmber 1993.
(ii) Imports - A manual for imports will be drawn up following immediately after
the above using the same methodology throughout. In this case it is
anticipated that the working party will have to be extended to encompass
more interest parties. Nevertheless the objective is speed of implementation
and trade facilitation whilst ensuring commensurate controls for the Revenue.
Working party to be formed by consultants. By September 1993. Completion
and implementation of instruction manual by March1994.
14. The Ministry of Finance program to computerize the entire customs clearance
procedure for imports and exports by electronic rather than paper means is underway. The
computerization of the process should greatly reduce the risk to the Revenue and at the
same time significantly reduce clearance times for imports and exports. It wiil also
improve the collection of date for Stain. Agreement on computerization plan and
implementation timetable. By May 1993.
15. At the end of each calendar quarter a written (quarterly) progress report should be
sent by the Govemment (prepared by the computerization task force) to the World Bank
outlining achievements for the past quarter, the program for the following quarter, any
shortcomings and consequences thereof to the overall objectives as indicated on the plan
dated 4 April 1993 as supplied to the World Bank. Receipt of the complete series of
quarterly reports, due up to IVlarch 1994.
CUSTOMS OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES

1.   Background
1.  Although well-endowed with natural resources, Jamaica is not self-sufficient with
respect to its demand for energy; imported petroleum meets most of its energy needs.
The country has a relatively high energy consumption due to the power requirements of
the bauxite and alumina industries, which absorb about 30% of the overall energy
consumption.
2. In 1990, the country's energy imports (mainly feedstock from Venezuela and
Mexico) amounted to about US$390 million, of which some US$270 was for non-bauxite
energy. The latter drained about one quarter of the year's foreign exchange eamings from
merchandise exports and non-factor services. Energy needs are met by petroleum (82%).
fuelwood (12%), bagasse (5%), and hydroelectric power (1%). The electricity utility uses
predominantly petroleum products (49% of operating expenses) to generate power, and
breaks down its 1989190 net generation as follows: 81 % steam and slow-speed diesel,
79% hydroelectric, 12% diesel, and less than 1 % energy purchases.
3.  The petroleum sector in Jamaica is divided at present between private marketing
companies (affiliates of multinational oil companies) and the government-owned Petroleun
Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). The marketing companies own a number of storage and
distribution facilities and domestic retail sales of petroleum products. PCJ, through its
subsidiary Petrojam Umited, owns and operates the sole refinery and has a de facto
monopoly on the Import of crude oil, while PCJ has a de facto monopoly on the import of
refined petroleum products. This monopoly Is due to prohibitive import tariffs applicable
only to private importers (i.e., marketing companies) while imports of Petrojam are exempt.
4.  Petrojam operates a 36,000 barrels per day refinery located adjacent to Kingston
Harbor. It was established in 1982 when the refinery was acquired from Esso by the
Govemment. Petrojam, while 100% Government owned and operating and service
divisions. It is a simple hydro-skimming unit built in 1963 in Kingston.
5.  As part of its ongoing liberalization and privatization programs, the Government has
decided to further deregulate the sector and has approved Petrojam as an entity to be
privatized. The proposed privatization of Petojam and deregulation of the petroleum sub-

sector are consistent with the eneray sector strateov of the Government which promotes
a greater role for the private sector, effective management of energy sector entities and
deregulation of the sector.
II.      Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica and subsidiaries
6.  The Ministry of Mining and Energy, as part of its overall responsibility for the
country's energy policy, is charged with the regulation of the petroleum market (including
product pricing). PCJ, a parastatal holding, operates the Petrojam refinery subsidiary, PCJ
Engineering, and Petcom (a one outlet marketing subsidiary). PCJ remains the main
supplier of petroleum products, either imported or via its Petrojam refining subsidiary.
7.  A certain degree of competition exists beyond the refining rack, in that refined and
imported petroleum products are sold through about 250 stations, 60% of which are
owned by Shell, Esso and Texaco, and leased to independent dealers; the remainder are
independently owned and operated. The three marketing companies have some receiving
and storage facilities for their end-product imports to cover for occasional Petrojam supply
shortage. Petrojam's subsid!ary Petcom, has one retail outlet, which also distributes LPG.
8.  For the year ended March 31, 1991, PCJ and its subsidiaries, together constituting
the public side of the petroleum sector, reported an aggregate tumover of J$S billion and a
net profit of J$26 million (0.5% margin), most of which appears to have been contributed
by Petrojam, since PCJ lost a net J$4 million on its independent operations. Petrojam's
refining facility has been unable to attain full capacity production, due to (1) mechanical
failures, (2) a persistent foreign exchange shortage, hindering the timely opening of letters
of credit, (3) constraints within the gasoline production unit itself, and (4) a potential
overstatement in the rated capacity. Present effective refining capacity is around 58%.
Despite the above problems, on sales of J$2.3 billion, Petrojam reported a net profit of
J*39 million, dipping below the net J$60 million gain of the previous period. The after-tax
profit brought retained earnings to J$268 million.
Ill.     DerequlationJliberalization in the Petroleum Subsector
9.  Parallel with its privatization program, the Govemment has been deregulating the
economy to create an environment conducive to private sector development and increased
competition. The Govemment has already taken a number of significant steps to
dismantle import monopolies, remove price controls, investment and subsector barriers to
entry. Previous steps included the deregulation of distribution and retail margins, allowing
distribution companies to set their own wholesale and retail prices. However, Petrojam
continues to fix ex-refinery prices.



97
ANNEX VxII
Page 3 of 34
10. The monopoly position of the PCJ derives from legislation 1/ which provides PCJ
and Petroiam certain privileges and tax exemptions. Under the present regime, while
Petrojam enjoys exemptions from import taxes and duties, all other importers are subject
to prohibitive taxes and duties. Petrojam sets ex-refinery prices on all products using
pricing formulae based on USGC prices, which are at present adjusted on a weekly basis.
11. Moreover, despite the deregulation of domestic margins, there may still be other
regulatory and legal barriers to entry and competition downstream, i.e, tankage/storage,
transportation and distribution wholesale and retailing stages. Increased competition
among suppliers is an important aspect of the deregulation process. Another important
issue to be considered in the context of deregulation/privatization is an assessment of
benefits from existing San Jose Accords for crude oil refined products Imported from
Venezuela and Mexico and the potential for the continuation of such benefits after taking
into account alternative supply sources in the international market.
JAMAICAN SUGAR SECTOR
I.   Background
12. The contribution of agriculture to the Jamaican economy has declined since the mid-
1960s, as tourism and mining played increasingly important roles. Within the agriculture
sector, the sugar industry forms the most important sub-sector, in terms of foreign
exchange generation (54% of value of all 1990 agricultural exports; 7.4% of total
merchandise exports), employment (16.7% of agricultural labor force in 1990), and,
generally, as a source of income.
13. In 1965, sugar production among 18 privately-held factories reached an all-time high
of 506,000 tons. However, increased foreign competition created the need for production
consolidation, greater productivity and higher efficiency. Growing govemment
involvement and a gradual exodus of foreign investors and factory operators occurred, and
by 1977, GOJ had gained effective control of 65% of the country's sugar processing
capacity. Of the 8 factories it had acquired by then, 4 have since closed. The Frome,
Monymusk and Long Pond facilities have been operating uninterruptedly, albeit steeply
below capacity, and Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica's Bernard Lodge capability restarted
production following a temporary closure.
14. Since the early 1970s, sugar production steadily declined, due to (1) reduced quality
and supply of cane from govemment-owned estates, (2) massive overheads at the
factories and plantations leading to excessive unit production costs, (3) lack of
reinvestment due in part to persistent foreign exchange shortages, (4) Insufficient
1    ncluding the Petroleum Act of 1979, the Petroleurn Refining Industry (Encouragement Act of 1963
and the Petroleum Refinino and Industry Rwcoonized Refiner, Petrojam Ltd.) Order of 1991, which Is
made under the 1963 Act.

automation particularly in the harvesting segment of the process, (5) neglect of irrigation
networks and, most notably, an irrigation deficiency in the Monymusk area, (6)
constraining regulatory and price-fixing functions of the Sugar Industry Authority (SIA),
which has the exclusive right to market sugar for both local consumption and export, and
(7) growing world competition
15. For 1989/90, total island production of 221,000 tons (44% of the 1965 record
output), was insufficient to satisfy the combined overseas and domestic demand of
264,000 tcens. Beneficial pricing arrangements with EC and US counterparts dictate that
GOJ first satisfy these quotas at per pound prices of two to three times the free world
market rates. To make up for the shortage, GOJ then resorts to purchasing sugar in the
open market to satisfy local demand.
1 6. Some of the remaining strengths of the sugar industry include the secure export
quota to the EC, and the advantageous climate/soil relationship capable of producing cane
without significant interferences from diseases or pests. Amnong the weaknesses are high
unit production costs, low productivity, an operational structure designed on the
assumption of continued plentiful cheap labor, outdated equipment and processes, poor
image, and irrigation problems.
II.  Sector Composition
17. Jamaica's sugar Is produced in nine remaining factories, of which four are
govemment-owned and five are privately-hoeld and/or operated. GOJ, through the
Accountant General (57.1 %) and SIA (42.9%), owns Jamaica Sugar Holdings (JSH). The
laKter owns the two largest sugar processing installations, Frome and Monymusk - both
operated by the same outside contractor. Through an Increasingly inactive holding, the
National Sugar Company, GOJ also owns Long Pond Sugar, which Is leased to and
operated by independent farmers. Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica's Bernard Lodge
Sugar factory was supposed to have been converted to an ethanol production facility
following its acquisition in 1986. This did not happen, and the factory, after temporary
closure, still produces sugar In a very unprofitable manner. The Bank has recommended its
permanent closure over the last two years, in order to divert cane (in limited supply In that
region) to the Monymusk facility nearby, with the objective of production consolidation.
18. Five privately operated facilities (Nephew & Wray's New Yarmouth and Appleton,
Tropicana's Duckenfield, and Hampden and Worthy Park) account for about 38% of the
1989/90 total island production. Compared to 40-65% for the public entities, most of the
privately managed entities operate at 90% or more of capacity, which explains their
apparent solvency and survival, despite obtaining a lower average sugar yield per ton cane
than the public entities.
Ill. Operations and Performance
19. Within total island production (221,000 tons In 1989/90), JSH contrbuted 47%
through Frome and Monymusk, Long Pond added 7% and PCJ's Bernard Lodge another



99
AE  VN L
Page 5 of 34
8%. Output objectives for JSH for the 1990/91 crop (160,000 tons, World Bank appraisal
1987; 1 18,300 tons, JSH's annual target) were not achieved, with Frome and Monymusk
producing a combined 107,000 tons. As financial statements for privately managed
entities were unavailable, only the public entities' figures have been summarized in the
attached schedule.
20. Created in 1984 through the merger of the Frome and Monymusk sugar cane
processing facilities, JSH has experienced an irregular cashflow pattem and steady and
mounting losses. Despite US$13 million in Technical Assistaace since 1985, JSH's
performance has not Improved, and at this moment is not termed a viable, on-going,
concern. Recent projections point to the need of working capital, investment and debt
reducing cash infusions of about US$23 million through 1994 (at the current rate of
exchange equivalent to J$450 million).
21. For the year ended 30 September 1991, JSH lost in excess of J$300 million (or
55%) on J$550 million in revenues, and reported an accumulated deficit of more than
J*400 million. To continue operations, JSH has been borrowing from SIA along a
revolving line-of-credit scheme since 1989. The most recent projections forecast a J$250
to J$300 million loss for the 1991/92 crop year. In an apparent effort to temporarily
alleviate the pressure of the mounting losses, JSH seems to have had to use J$52 million
in social security type withholdings of its employees.
22. Within JSH, it appears that the Frome operations, irrespective of their degree of
inefficiency, do in fact subsidize those at Monymusk, therewith draining the reinvestment
funds needed to maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities at Frome. Proposals before
GOJ, include (1j the acquisition of Frome and Monymusk by private interests following a
govemmental cleaning of the balance sheet, (2) maintaining JSH and funding the entire
JS402 million deficit plus a J$30 to J$50 million in working capital for 1991/92, (3)
closing Monymusk and shifting all attention and funds to Frome. For a multitude of
reasons, option (1) appears the most realistic.
23. PCJ's subsidiary, Petronol/Bemard Lodge, reported a J$18 million loss on J$57
million in revenue in FY91, sending the overall deficit to J$90 million, accumulated since
PCJ took over Bernard Lodge and incorporated Petronol in December of 1986. The
National Sugar Company's Long Pond Sugar Company reported a JS96 million tumover for
FY91, on which it reportedly broke even, stalling the accumulated deficit to J$12 million.
IV. Issues
24. GOJ Is presently the sole exporter and importer of sugar; while it contracted private
companies to physically handle this trade, GOJ manages the process through SIA and
Jamaica Cane Sales Products Ltd. The SIA sets quality standards for the Industry and
conducts research through Sugar Industry Research Institute (SIRI) for the sector. It also
establishes export and domestic sugar prices for both private and public sector enterprises
in the sector and fixes the cane price for growers.
25. Given the GOJ's stated policy of privatization of state controlled assets and the
consistently poor financial performance of the government-owned sugar entities, there Is,



100
Page 6 of 34
however, need for the formulation and implementation of new policies goveming the
sugar sector. These policies are intended to provide the broad framework for the
deregulation and privatization of the industry.
2 S. The future objectives of GC'J sugar policy are to ensure efficiency within the sugar
industry so as to provide reasonable retums to cane growers and sugar producers while at
the same time providing sugar at reasonable prices to consumers.
27. Corsistent with the above and the general liberalization and deregulation of the
economy, GOJ envisages a sugar sector that is financially self-sufficient with levels of
production adequate to meet export quota markets and satisfy domestic requirements.
28. GOJ also recognizes that the present milling capacity is far in excess of sugar
production, and therefore there is the need to optimally rationalize the industry to generally
lower costs and increase efficiency in order to achieve financial viability of the industry as
a whole in the shortest time possible.
29. To achieve the necessary rationalization of the industry, GOJ has decided to
deregulate the sector and to privatize the state owned sugar assets. This move is
expected to provide the framework within which market forces can be brought to bear
upon the industry ;n a manner designed to restore efficiency and thereby insure the long
term viability of the industry.

J&MArA BWAYBQ E&PDBATIIN
I.   Background
30. Railway operations In Jamalca comprise those of the Jamaica Railway Corporation
(JRC), and those of two bauxite mining enterprises (JAMALCAN and JAMALCO). JRC Is a
statutory body, governed by a Board of Directors; it owns and operates some 125 miles of
single track and also provides maintenance services to the bauxite firms, which own tracks
(about 25 miles combined) connected to JRC's network. Several sections of track are in
areas that forced the construction of steep grades and sharp curves, which has
contributed to a high derailment rate and excessive repair costs.
31. Prior to 1986, the entire system had neither signaling nor interlocking mechanisms
Radio and telephone communication facilities, critical to a single track operation, were
rudimentary or non-existent, to the point that public phones had to be used to
communicate with the Train Controller in Kingston. When telephone service was not
available, station masters travelled to and from the next station by bus before clearing the
line. Beside, causing significant delays, this was also an important factor In the accident
and derailment rate.
32. JRC generates revenues primarily through mining freight services (81% projected for
1990t91, and declining), and meeting other bulk transportation needs for the mining
companies. Non-bauxite freight haulage is projected at only 3% In 1990/91, and
passenger service at about 1 1 % of operating revenue.
33. The Corporation has been In financial disarray for at least the last decade, and
appears to be locked in a vicious circle, in that there are no funds to upgrade and properly
maintain the track infrastructure and equipment, or to provide the manpower required to
generate increased revenues with the available assets. This has caused customers
(bauxite companies and commuters) to look for other alternatives. The ALCOA/CAP joint-
venture, for example, started operating its own rail service in January of 1990. Prior to
doing so, JRC used JAMALCO-owned rolling stock to provide the actual hauling service on
JAMALCO's own tracks (22.4 miles). Now under its own operation and management, the
venture has operating costs about 619% of what they were previously and efficiency and
safety improved.
II.  Performance
34. Total revenue grew steadily from J$3 million in 1970 to J$12 million in 1980, and
to J*38 million in 1991, but JRC never recorded a positive after-tax income of
significance. With the J$14 milion loss of FY91, the accumulated deficit grew to J$105
million.
35. Per March of 1991, the long term liabilities of J#187 million were entirely made up
out of advances by and loans from the Govemment. Accounts Receivable remained



103
Page 9 of 34
uncollected at approximately 40% per year; the resulting bad debt Is likely to be written
off.
36. The 1984-87 period seemed to be a turning point, as the Corporation managed to
report improvements in operating income (although it remains unclear as to how JRC was
able to report a profit in 1987). This was attributed to the lay-off of 300 people in 1984,
to the renegotiation of the ALCAN contract in 1985, to the reopening of the ALCOA plant,
and to not having to pay for the acquisition of new locomotives, the latter representing a
GOJ capital infusion of J$40 million. In the late 1980s, however, the reported trend
reversed due to disputes surrounding rate arrangements with the JAMALCO Joint venture,
damages resulting from Hurricane Gilbert, and the massive recurring pension payments
stenmming from the 1984 restructuring.
37. The inability to obtain foreign exchange or to secure adequate financing, for the
purchase of spare parts or the contracting of services are the main reasons why JRC has
not had a comprehensive maintenance program in 23 years. The resulting 'band-aid'
approach has led to an increase in accidents, numbering 48 derailments in 4 months in
1989 (costing more than J$4 million at that time), and subsequently resulting in the
closure of the Montego Bay line.
38. JRC's Corporate Plan (1990-93) attempts to justify JRC's continued operations and
to request additional capital infusions, and outlines JRC Management's strategy for
reviving the railways as a public service, in a country with a decreasing need for a railroad.
The Corporate Plan reflects the cash-strapped JRC's hopes to generate working capital
through the sale of surplus lands and the divestment of selected assets (intemally valued
at over J$28 million), heavily counts on GOJ's willingness to absorb part or all of the
accumulated deficit. It also reflects the RCJ's desire for a more commercially oriented
marketing approach and pricing strategy, so that It will be free to set (freight) rates
according to market conditions, and will no longer be dependent on fare Increases granted
by GOJ (last In 1984). Given the GOJ's tight fiscal constraints, however, the more likely
strategy for the GOJ would be to explore options to privatize and/or liquidate the railway.
111. Issues
-        Staffina problems. a high turnovgr fueled by poor performance, financial pressure,
and a negative image have left JRC with little expertise to properly manage the
technical and financial aspects of railroad operation. Total employment has steadily
decreased from 1,500 in 1971 to 1,150 in 1983, to an expected level of 725 in
1992. In 1986, JRC's Maintenance Department counted 260 staff and one (1)
engineer. With a Corporate Plan calling for expansion of the network and a further
reduction of a pool of employees that has already proven to be physically Incapable
of properly servicing the system, something must give.
-   The unfavorable contracts with the bauxite companies prevent JRC from Imposing
price increases as needed. Every 5 years the arrangements come up for
renegotiation so more beneficial terms must be obtained. This has become complex
given the strained relationships with CAP and ALCAN. which now operate their own



104
,AME^ vi,
Page 10 of 34
services with their own rolling stock, with JRC only proyidinDU Maitnange services
for the tracks.
Reduced safety and reliability lead to lower revenues, and to increased demand for
other modes of transportation. Over the last three decades, JRC has been losing
customers to road transportation; all island-wide freight movement is currently
handled by truck, except for bauxite industry related cargo.
Daterioration of assets is likely to accelerate due to lack of funds.
JRC's anticipation of securing grants and outside (non-GOJ) below market rate
financing at 5% to 7.5% for further expansion is overly optimistic. With operating
expenses consistently between 94% and 144% of gross revenue, JRC has never
had a positive working capital and has been technically bankrupt for many years.
- Given these, the key issue for the Govemment is to rapidly finalize its privatization
strategy for the railway corporation.
AIR JAMAICA
l. Background
39.  Air Jamaica is a public entity wholly owned by GOJ. In its twenty two years of
existence, it has run constant losses for the last ten years. These losses have been
escalating and show no signs of abating in the near future.
40.  Air Jamaica has a fleet of four Airbus A-300, and four Boeing 727-200 aircraft
which are either fully owned or have been bought under a capital lease program from the
manufacturers or from international airlines from whom they were acquired,.eg. In the last
quarter of 1989, negotiations were concluded with Varig Airlines for the acquisition of two
Airbus A-300s. These were put in service during the second quarter of the 1990/91 fiscal
year.
41.  The airline operates routes to New York, Miami, Atlanta, Phildelphia, and Baltimore
In the United States In addition to service to Grand Cayman and Curacao. Service to Los
Angeles has been provided on a contractual basis to Jamaica Vacations Ltd. The Los
Angeles route was extended to San Francisco in July 1989 through the leasing of Li 011
Tristar aircraft from Hawaiian Airlines. However, a change In market conditions i.e.
increase In fuel prices and uneconomic flight schedules, forced the discontinuation of this
service in January of 1990. Service to Tampa was discontinued in February 1990, and
service to Toronto, Canada was replaced by a joint service operated by Air Canada under a
commercial agreement from April 1990.

43.  With the bankruptcy of Eastem Airlines, and the subsequent termination of all
Eastern service to Jamaica, the slack was taken up by American and Continental which
doubled their flights to the country.
44.  In addition to regular and charter services to passengers, Air Jamaica offers cargo
service which has significantly expanded with the acquisition of the two Airbuses from
Varig.
II.   Performance
45.  Air Jamaica has performed quite poorly over the last five years with accumulated
deficits of J$191 million in fiscal year 1989, J$321 million in fiscal year 1990, and J$304
million In fiscal year 1991 (Table 1). Losses have mounted considerably from J$31.7
million In 1985 to an all time high of J*130.6 million in 1990 followed by an equally
dismal performance In 1991 with a loss of J$118 million. With constant negative returns
on assets of (14.2%) in 1990 and (10.4%) In 1991, the asset liability mismanagement
within the organization is quite evident. Further evidence of this mismanagement is
present when one studies the fixed assets to equity capital ratio which at 1.55:1 In 1991
In contrast to 2.53:1 In 1985 does not show a marked improvement in the
disproportionately large amounts of fixed assets financed by debt. This does not reflect
well on the organization since it has been receiving huge grants from GoJ ever since its
inception and cash infusions of J* 286.7 million in 1990 and JO 291.7 million in 1991
have been insufficient to cover Air Jamaica's financing of Its fixed assets through GoJ
grants.
46.  In terms of liquidity, Air Jamaica's current ratios for the last five years show that
the organization cannot retire more than 55% of Its current liabilities through the
liquidation of Its current aessts. Air Jamaica has had constant negative working capitals
over the last five years with an amount of J$(326,438) In 1991 complementing an amount
of J$13131.47B in 1990. Air Jamaica has baan fortunata in that it Ie nwnad hv thin

Government which has always jumped to its rescue whenever the organization has been in
dire straits. GoJ, for some reason, has guaranteed loan amounts in millions of dollars to
cover lease payments for the organization's fixed assets which are primarily aircraft and
ground equipment. Had Air Jamaica been a private organization, its poor overall
performance - which is reflected in its liquidity crunch - would have never met the
stipulations contained In loan agreements and bond indentures regarding the maintenance
of minimum working capital levels.
47. Air Jamaica has considerable long term liabilities such as future minimum rental
payments, which will ensure that the firm remains deeply in the red in the forthcoming
years.

48. Air Jamaica has had significant problems with U.S. Customs arising out of the
transportation of unmanifested cargo which resulted in an unsettled fine of US$ 3.3
million. This is in addition to penalties of US$3 million which was settled upon in 1990
and implemented through security improvements to a value of US$1 million over three
years beginning October 1990.
49. In 1991, Air Jamaica did report an increase of 5% in operating revenues over fiscal
year 1990, L t this was largely due to the depreciation of the Jamaican Dollar in the
international financial markets The Jamaican dollar depreciated from an average of
J$5.51 to US$1 in 1989 to J$7 to US$1 in March of 1990. In March of 1991 the
Jamaican dollar was reportedly averaging J$8.25 to US$1.

Ill.   Assessment of past efforts for the privatization of Air Jamaica
50.  Past efforts ranged from the organization of presentations to selected potential
investors, to GOJ and Air Jamaica receiving or inviting proposals from other airline
companies/investors. All of these efforts failed. Reasons for failure to privatize so far:
Lack of formal privatization process and procedures.
Incoherent, unorganized efforts.
No clear definition of terms of reference given to the different actors
expected to perform the different tasks.
No prospectus was prepared presenting to investors the main
features,present situation and potential of the company.
Valuation of the company was carried out only once (by Avmark) and did not
reflect the true value of Air Jamaica. This valuation did not include liabilies,
and presented Inaccurate value for the routes (which depends upon the
carrier that would be operating and on its ability to reap maximum benefts
from them). Air Jamaica should perform a serious valuation as this Is a
precondition for successful privatization.
Air Jamaica has until 1999 the right of first refusal to operate any new route
granted to Jamaica as well as the right to oppose the operation of a foreign
carrier that could represent a threat to its position. This agreement has not
been reassessed from a legal point of view.
Unavailability of current and future air policy of the Government to expain to
investors the regulatory framework they will be subjected to.

The airline was involved In the negotiations creating risks of conflict of
interest. The company role should only be to support the process, provide
necessary information, leaving negotiation responsibility to government
authorities.
The Govemment did not determine up front the share of Air Jamaica that
would remain public. Keeping 51 percent of the shares In public hands will
discourage potential investors. The maintenance of traffic rights while
necessitating substantial Jamaican ownership and effective control, does not
require the permanence of the Govemment as shareholder.
Aging fleet and weak capital structv're could have discouraged investors.
Lack of clear leadership and multiplicity of agencies involved: NIBJ, Special
Privatization Committee, the management of Air Jamaica, Ministries.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LABOR LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LABOR MARKET INSTITUTIONS
1.       The Bank has recently reviewed the labor market laws and regulations as well
as the institutional structure and existing labor market practices to Identify possible
constraints to private sector activity and to the privatization of public entities. The review
focused on regulations and practices regarding redundant employees in public enterprises,
severance payments, voluntary departure, early retirement, and layoffs and redeployment.
2.        On the whole, labor laws and institutions present no significant impediments to
private sector development or privatization in Jamaica. Both in law and fact, the Jamaican
labor market institutions are conductive to labor mobility and redeployment. Workers can
be dismissed easily, at modest cost, and with virtually no social safety net in place.
Indusial Relton and T     __de Uni
3.        Employers and workers In Jamaica fall into three categories: Those in the
private sector, in statutory bodies, and In the public sector. The labor laws and practices
described below apply equally to workers in the private sector and in statutory bodies, but
do not directly cover public service workers (who are under a separate Ministry, the
Ministry of Public Service).
4.        Irade Unions. The right of workers to freely associate through trade unions Is
guaranteed by the Jamaican constitution. Being a union member is not a condition for
getting employed in a particular job (i.e., no closed shop) nor is the worker compelled upon
~jng employmnent to join the union that represents this particular bargaining unit (i.e., no
union  )Qe}. Although collective bargaining agreements do not have the force of law, the
custom of fi~noaing the agreement is firmly established in practice. A comparative
perspective is offered by the U.S. Departnent of Labor, which reports: 'Labor,
management, and govemment remain firmly committed by law and in fact to collective
bargaining in contract negotiations and contract resolution' (Fgreign Labor Trends, p.5).
5.       The rate of unionization is about 25% of the labor force. Organization rates
are high in the public sector, state enterprises, manufacturing, mining, and export
agriculture. Trade unions are major political forces in Jamaica. The National Workers
Union is closely affiliated with the Peoples National Party and the Bustamante Industrial
Trade Union with the Jamaica Labor Party. Many past Prime Ministers have come from
the trade union movement.
6.       industrial Relations. The industrial relations environment is generagly regarded
as orderly. Collective bargaining agreements typically contain clauses giving the employer
free reign to manage, hire, fire, etc. By international standards, strikes and other work
stoppages are neither particularly long-lived nor particuarly disruptive. (Jamaican law
neither provides the right to strike nor prohibits strikes.) The traditional animosity between



ANNECXX
Page 2 of 6
120
unions and employers in Jamaica is giving way to a more cordial relationship. Some view
the close relationship between the govemment and the unions, combined with both high
levels of union organization and the presence of a tightly-knit business community in the
formal sector, as an institutional vehicle which can be used to link economic policy with
industrial relations policy.1y
7.       Jamaica trade unions play a strong role in other ways. Wages in unionized
jobs are higher than in non-unionized ones. - Fringe benefits are also more generous in the
unionized sector. Unions are strong advocates of job security for their members, often
protecting their members against dismissal for cause (see para. 10).
Laws and Practics Regardin Hing and Firna
8.       In many countries, labor laws establish worker's rights to jobs which make it
virtually impossible to dismiss a worker who complete a short probationary period, perhaps
ninety days. Jamaica has no such system of job rights. Instead, there are laws regarding
notice and severance payments. A worker may be dismissed for cause or for redundancy.
9.       In the event that a worker is dismissed for cause, such as absenteeism or
malfeasance, the law requires that he/she must be given appropriate notice or pay in lieu
of notice. Statutory notice is:
(a)  two weeks for employment under five years;
(b)  four weeks for employment of five to ten years;
ic)  six weeks for employment of ten to fifteen years;
{d)  eight weeks for employment of fifteen to twenty years;
(e)  twelve weeks for employment of twenty year or longer.
10.      Dismissal for cause is not very common. Unions often fight strenuously to
protect their members against such dismissals. It was reported to the mission that strikes
have frequently occurred in reaction to such dismissals, sometimes of a wildcat nature.
The workers believe that dismissal for cause puts their members at risk of arbitrary and
capricious whims of management or at risk of penalty for legitimate trade union related
activity. This, however, is an important discontent among employers who feel they
cannot dismiss workers for gross incompetence or malfeasance.
11.      A much more common reason for dismissal Is labor redundanov. As defined
and governed by the Emaloyment Termination Redundancy Payments Act of 1974. 'labor
redundancy' is the elimination of the position for any of three reasons:
(a)  the fact that his employer has ceased, or intends to cease, to carry
on the business for the purposes of which the employee was
employed by his or has ceased, or intends to cease, to carry on
1/  (Peter Doeringer, 1988, p. 478 Industrial Relations System in Jamaica).

that business In the place where the employee was so employed;
or
(b)  the fact that the requirements of that business for employees to
carry out work of a particular kind, or for employees to carry out
work of a particular kind in the place of where he was so
employed, have ceased or diminish; or
(c)  the fact that he has suffered personal injury which was caused by
an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, or
has developed any disease, prescribed under this Act, being a
disease due to the nature of his employment.
rivatizaton gnd LaLf Rehdn
12.      Privatization may or may not entail redundancies. When privatization cases a
change of ownership, a worker employed by the old owner may experience one of four
things:
(i)    permanent termination of employment without reinstatement;
(a)    temporary termination followed by rehire under substantially different terms
and conditions;
(1i)  renewal of the employment contract with the substitution of the new owner
for the previous owner; and
(iv)    re-engagement under a new contract offering "suitable employment," a
term deliberately left undefined, to be decided by the court.
Workers in categories i) and (ii) are entitled to receive severance payments from the firm,
while those in categories iri) and (iv) are not. Those who are kept on retain their seniority
and pension rights. More generally, liabilities are typically part of the sale of a company.
In essence, then, when a firm Is privatized, or when one private sector firm takes over
another, the new owner may retain as many and whichever of the old workers as he
wants. However, any worker whose employment is discontinued must be paid a
severance payment. Knowing this, the old owner and the new owner must agree on
which of them will make such severance payments as are required.
13.      The law provides that a worker who is declared redundant receive a
redundancy payment which amounts to two weeks of pay for each year of service up to
ten, plus thre weeks of pay for each year of service beyond ten. However, a worker with
under two years of services Is not entitled to any redundancy payment. The law also
requires that the worker receive advance notice of redundancy. The requirements is two
weeks of notice for a worker with fewer than 5 years of seniority with the company, four
weeks with 5-10 years seniority, six weeks with 10-15 years seniority, eight weeks with

15-20 years seniority, and twelve weeks with more than 20 years. If the worker is not so
notified, the company must make payment of the specified number of weeks' wages.
14.      It should be stressed that this redundancy payment is the statutory minimum.
Unionized employers typically provide redundancy benefits which are substantially more
generous. It is common for an unionized company to offer six weeks benefits per year of
service going back to year one, or an extra ten weeks of severance payments after five
years of service. it is also common for the waiting period for redundancy benefits to be
shortened to one year. These benefits, though substantial, are by no means prohibitive. A
company wishing to reduce its work force, unless it is teetering on the brink of
bankruptcy, could make these payments fairly easily. The short term cost of severance
payments may quickly be made up in wage savings.
15.      Practical difficulties of large scale dismissals. It was common assessment in
Jamaica that (Labor unions and GOJ) in the face of large scale dismissals (up to 15-20%),
the unions would generally go along with employment cutbacks. It was also believed
however, that acceptance of redunJancies by unions would increase if remaining workers
are offered the opportunity of ownership through an ESOP. Both employer and union
leaders reported that, worker attitudes toward privatization are surprisingly positive. Since
the public sector wages are lower than in the private sector workers hope that
privatization would result in higher wages. Moreover, many long-service workers prefer to
be made redundant in order to receive severance payments - their unions have, therefore
established seniority-based voluntary redundancy programs. As for the loss of
employment, a recent study by Carl Stone found that employment in recently-privatized
companies was Wghigr than previously. One reason for this is that privatization of some of
the companies In which large-scale redundancies are likely have deliberatel" been deferred.
An employers' representative characterized the unions as saying to employers, "We accept
the change in ownership, but we hope you will take on as many of the old workers as you
can.=
16.      In conclusion, a newly privatized or reorganized company does not face any
serious difficulties, in law or in practice, in dismissing such workers as may not be needed.
Provisions regarding hiring and firing, severance payments, and notice of dismissal do aQt
appear to be serious Impediments to private sector development or privatization in
Jamaica.
Other Labor Regulatons and Pracices
17.      Industrial DisouRa and Grievance Procedures: Under the Labor Relations and
Industrial Disputes Act of 1975. a system for peaceful setdement of workplace disputes
was estbrished. The steps are:
O)    negotiation among the parties to the dispute;
(i)    Conciliation by the Ministry of Labor at request of the parties
where (i) has failed; and



ANN *X
Page 5 of 6
123
{iii)  in the extent the event (ii) has failed, referral of the dispute to the
Industrial Disputes TriPunal, the decision of which is final except
for an appeal based purely on a question of law.
18.      Most disputes are settled in stages (i) and (ii). The smooth functioning of
arbitration and conciliation at the Ministry and tribunal levels has been used by unions in
an opportunistic way on occasion. It is said that a Union will take a case to arbitration or
even to the !ndustrial Disputes Tribunal and lose the case rather than tell a worker that the
union will no represent him/her. This may be one reason that a least 90% of the tribunal's
judgments support the employer.
19.      In both the union and non-union sectors, there is a clear understanding that
workers are not to be summarily dismissed. A dismissal not for cause or redundancy
would be grounds for strike in a unionized setting and a suit for an injunction in a non-
union one. The concept of "employment at will" is foreign to Jamaicans.
20.      MiniMUm Wa_g. Minimum wage laws exist and are generally complied with.
The reason for general compliance is that the minimum wage rates are quite low: J$160
per week (about US$8) for wage employees, J$140 (about US$7) for household workers.
The great majority of workers earn more than the minimum wage. It is, however, binding
for certain agricultural workers and household workers. Because the level of the minimum
wage is low absolutely and relative to the market wage level in Jamaica, it does not pose
an important barrier to private sector development or to privatization.
21.      Retirement. The law contains only modest provisions for retirement and none
for early retirement. Some Jamaican workers are covered by the National Insurance
Scheme. Retirement benefits are payable under the NIS at age 65 for men and age 60 for
women, provided that the person in question is not engaged in and substantial
employment. For a person who is engaged in substantial employment, the age of
retirement benefits is 70 for men and 65 for women. There is no provision for early
retirement benefits under this program.
22.      Private 1ensions are typically provided for in collective bargaining agreements;
they are rare outside the unionized sector. Workers represented by the NWU, for example,
receive a pension equal to two-thirds of the final three years' salary. The pension is
funded by contributions from employers and from workers.
23.      Pension benefits in Jamaica are not vested. This means that a worker whose
employment terminates before retirement receives no pension benefit. The worker is
entitled to take out the amount s/he contributed to the pension fund but not the amount
contributed by the employer. This creates an incentive for the company to offer voluntary
redundancy to long-service employees. There is no provision for early retirement benefits
under either the National Insurance Scheme or private pensions.
24.      Industrial Democracy. Workers participation in management, employee stock
ownership plans (ESOPs), and other aspects of industrial democracy are not particularly
widespread, while gaining greater political importance, in the Jamaican context. Workers



124                               AN4NME  X
have accepted shares in some privatized companies. However; they are said to have
exhibited a strong disinclination to shoulder any of the burdens and responsibilities of
management. Although the trade movement as well as GOJ gives Importance to ESOP's,
it is not unusual that in a newly-reorganized company with ESOPs the workers would
promptly sell their shares back to the company. The more traditional adversarial approach
to labor-management relations is still more common in Jamaican.
