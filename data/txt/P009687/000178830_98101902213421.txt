INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
TWELFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1e        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for the equivalent of US$80 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a twelfth railway project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(156-IN, dated May 8, 1973), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 24, 1973 (R73-113). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance can be criticized on many counts.
Some of the shortcomings have their origins in the open political system,
where the reconciliation of conflicting political views tend to favor les:u
than optimal economic solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of
the task facing the Government. Governing a country divided into more than
20 States with a population of 577 million and over 60 major languages is
an extraordinary responsibility. The country's poverty and poor natural
resource endowment, supplemented by a net transfer of external resources averaging
in recent years well below US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations
on the rate of growth. Any judgment of India's economic performance must
take these underlying circumstances into accuunt. So, also, must account
be taken of two massive uncertainties which overbang India. The first is
the availability of water.  A bad monsoon, which is inevitable from time
to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy and wipes out
the results of years of effort.  The second uncertainty is the availability
of external assistance.  The vast majority of bilateral aid is committed
annually, usually several months after the start of the fiscal year, and
bas too often proved vulnerable to the political exigencies of the donor.
Any delay in IDA replenishment hba an enormous impact on aid flows. Together,
these considerations severely complicate planning and force a high degree of
caution in foreign exchange management.
4.        In this perspective, the performance of the economy has been far
from bad. Since the inception of economic development planning in 1950/51,
national income has grown at nearly 4 percent per annum, which compares very
favorably with the average annual growtb rate of less than one percent during
the preceding 50 years. Pbpulation has also grown faster in the past two
decades than previously, but per capita income has nevertheless risen from
a more or less stagnant level in the first half of this century to achieve
an average growth of roughly one percent a year since independence.



- 2 -
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing
on Wtiers and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs.
The growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education,
health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved
at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial
and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others
have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below
full capacity; in some regions of the country growth and structural change
have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many other parts
of the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly
even decline. Despite these improvements and although the distribution of
income in India is relatively even by comparison with many other countries,
there has been little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses
of the urban and rural population. The Government has become increasingly
conzerned about the plight of the lower income strata, which, conservatively
measured, consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than US$60
per head per year. As indicated in its preliminary proposals for the Fifth
Five-Year Plan (l97h/75-1978/79) GOI is planning to intensify its efforts
to alleviate their poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42
percent of national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49 percent
twenty years previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial
sector has increased only slowly and, partly due to the generally good per-
formance in agriculture, since the late 1960s has remaind approximately
constant at a level of 23 percent. There has, however, been a shift in the
composition of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one-third each compared with an overwbelming pre-
ponderance of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        Undoubtedly, one of India's most impressive achievements since the
mid-1960s has been the doubling of the average growth rate of productivity
in foodgrain production. This has been achieved primarily through the intro-
duction of new, high-yielding seed varieties and through complementary im-
provements in farming practices. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to
consolidate the production growth in the wheat belt and to extend it both
to other areas and to other foodgrain crops, most particularly rice. Other
crops have, in most cases, shown a slow but fairly constant rate of produc-
tivity increase. Irrigation bas played a major part in agricultural growth
and, by reducing dependence on the monsoon, has reduced variability in per-
formance. For instance, the drought-induced decline in foodgrain output in
1972/73 was only some 6 percent, compared with a fall of almost 20 percent
due to the drought in the mid-1960s. At present only about balf the poten-
tially irrigable area bas been developed. Fuller utilization of the existing
irrigation system and the extension of the irrigated area are, therefore,
matters of the highest priority in order to meet India's rising food needs
and to protect the economy against the vagaries of the weather. Land which
cannot be irrigated accounts for about 50 percent of the cultivable area;
output from non-irrigated land will thus remain important and substantial
benefits remain to be realized through technical change and investment.



8.        Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and to
some extent disappointing. Industrial growtb averaged about 7 percent
a year in the 1950s, rose to 9 percent in the first half of the 1960s,
lut has declined to some 5 percent through the early 1970s. The slower
growth of recent years is especially worrying. To a large extent it was
precipitated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the accompanying
general recession. But it has also been the result of many other factors:
the relatively limited opportunities for further import substitution wbich
had from the outset been at the center of the industrialization strategy;
the recurring bottlenecks in the production of a number of key intermediate
goods such as steel and cement; shortages of imported raw materials; and
cumbersome administrative procedures. The improvement in output which
occurred in 1972, combined with recent measures to simplify administrative
controls, should lead to better utilization of India's industrial capacity
and a hi4her rate of reinvestment.
9.        The gruss domestic savings rate has been in the region of 14 percent
for the past decade. While this compares favorably with other countries having
similarly low income levels, it has fallen far short of India's resource needs.
And although external assistance has been substantial in absolute terms, in
relation to national income it has been small, so that the gross investment
rate has reached as high as 17 percent in only a few years. More recently,
as a result of the recession and a decline in foreign assistance, the gross
investment rate has been only about 14-15 percent.
1o.       An outstanding feature of the budgetary situation over the past
decade has been a sharp increase in the tax burden. Overall tax revenues
which represented around 10 percent of national income in 1960/61 rose to
nearly 15 percent in 1971/72. Although several important sectors, notably
agriculture, are still only lightly taxed, the Government has shown itself
capable of swift and difficult decisions in mobilizing extra revetnes.
There was a large additional tax effort in response to the crisis of 1971;
more recently, early in Nov6ber 1973 the Government doubled the excise duty
on gasoline (raising prices to the consumer by 64 percent) and imposed heavy
increases on other petroleum products. Despite a near doubling of tax revenues
in the last decade, however, there has been a deterioration in the savings per-
formance of the public sector, largely due to a sharp fall in the Central
Government's current account savings. A disturbing feature of the budgetary
situation has been the expansion of the States' expenditures far in excess
of the growth of their own revenues. The Central Government bas had to meet
the resulting deficits through budget transfers. This, combined with several
other factors (the military events and refugee relief of 1971 and 1972,
drought relief in 1972 and 1973, and a sbarp drop in net foreign aid in 1972),
has forced a massive rise in total deficit financing. As a result of this
and also of the shortages of food and other commodities, there has been a
sharp increase in the rate of inflation in the past 18 months as has been
the case in so many other countries of the world. In the past year, wbole-
sale prices have risen by some 20 percent, compared with an average 4-5 percent
in the previous three years.  The budget for 1973/74 introduced measures to
help curb inflation and there have been further budget cuts in the past few
months, while the Reserve Bank of India bas also been intervening to control
the expansion of money supply.



- 4 -
11.       Ever since the balance of payments crisis of 1956/57, a sbortage
of foreign exchange bas constituted one of the most criticaa constraints
to the development of the econony. This has manifested itself in various
ways.  The authorities have necessarily acted with extreme caution in their
foreign exchange management and have been left with little flexibility or
margin to accommodate special and emergency needs. The exchange control
and also, in large part, the import and industrial licensing procedures
have thus been the result of the acute foreign exchange situation.  Even
thougb the external sector is small in relation to the national economy,
the continuing shortage of foreign exchange together with these controls
have retarded and distorted investment and the rate of utilization of exist-
ing capacity. This is most clearly seen in the stagnation of non-food imports:
for instance, despite expansion of the economy at almost 4 percent per annum,
even at current prices the present level of non-food imports is approximately
the same as that of the early 1960s, and there has been a continuing shortage
of imported raw materials, spares, and components. While exports have expanded
somewhat since 1960 and have done especially well in the past two years, they
have never achieved a sustained growth sufficient to have an appreciable effect
on the foreign exchange problem. Traditional items such as jute, tea, cashew,
and textiles, which are all beset with supply difficulties at bome and hlighly
competitive or shrinking markets abroad, still constitute the most important
component of exports. And despite a rapid expansion in the 1960s, non-
traditional items such as engineering goods and chemicals still form only
a small share of total exports.
12.       Xxternal assistance has played an important role in assisting
India's development effort, especially from the late 1950s to the end of
the 1960s.  Nevertieless, net aid has always been only a saall component of
domestic product and has been amongst the lowest for all developing countries,
having averaged well below US$1 per head per annum. Moreover, with rising
debt service payments and more recently a decline in gross aid, the contri-
bution of net aid has declined, both as a supplement to domestic investeant
and as a means of financing imports. However, aid remains a vital supplement
to domestic resources and there are now encouraging signs that net aid may
rise somewhat in the future above its currently extremely low level.
13.       As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external public
debt stood at US$845 billion on March 31, 1972. Annrmual debt service paymerts
are currently running at a level of around TJS$725 million (before debt relief),
eq-uivalent to around 26 percent of merchandize and invisible export receipts.
This compares with a level of debt service of about US$200 million iTI the mid-1960s.
In order to mitigate the negative effects on growth of such a high burden of
external debt and to forestall any danger of a foreign exchange crisis5 the India
Consortium from 1968/69 onwards has extended debt relief to India. In 1972/73,
the most recent year in which the JonBortium has taken this action, the amount of
debt relief was about US$150 million. Debt service is projected to grow somewhat
more slowly over the rest of this decade than it did during the 1960s, and the
debt service ratio i_pro ected to decline, to snme 21. percent byml9BO. t,artiwr
in the mid-3%Zs TTeTre has been some softening in the financial terms of officlal
assistance offered by several major creditors, and also an increase in the Dropor-
tion of program to project aid. These changes are welcome in helping India to meet
her more urgent import requirements, but they are still modest in relation to
the country's basic needs.
14.       The Government is at present preparing the detailed sectoral
programs to be implemented in the Fifth Plan. It is also re-examining the
overall internal and external resources position as well as devising the
appropriate policies to achieve the Elan objectives. A first draft of the
complete Plan is expected to be completed shortly, with the final document
being published in March 1974.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
15.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 41 loans and 56 development
credits to India totaIling US$1,178 million and US$2,448 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$600 million bas been
repaid, and US$1,024 million is still undisbursed.  Annex_II contains a
summary statmemnet of Bank loans and IDA credits as of October 31, 1973, and
notes on the execuation of ongoing projects.
16.       Sirnce 1957, IC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of tfbhich US$5.9 million has been repaid, US$7.4 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$22.7 million, US$15.4 million
represents loans- and US$7.3 million equity. A summtry statement of WEO
operations as of October 31, 1973, is also included in Annex II (Page 2).
1L7.      The enphnasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent yeare
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects
the imr.ortance of agriculture and -he investment priorities of the Government.
Agricultural projects wi11 continue to form an important part of the Bank
Group's program of wsistance to India. Projects designed to foster agri-
cultural production through the provision of essential inputs, such as
credit for on-farm irvestment, commnd area developmwnt of existing irriga-
tion projects, or domestic fertilizer production, form an important part of
the program for this fiscal year. Proposals for investment in processing
facilities for special crops and for livestock development which would con-
tribute to diversification of agricultural production, will also be considered
in this fiscal year.  Special empbasis is being given to projects benefiting
small farmers in IDA-supported agrirultural credit schemes, and a project is
presently being developed in support of the Government's drought-prone--areas
program.
18.       The industrial sector and investAents in infrastructure development
have received substantial amounts of Bank Group assistance over time, esser-
tially to cover the large foreign exchange expanditures associated with
investsents in these fields. Apart from IDA credits for a number of fertil-
izer projects, lending to industry in recent years has been principally through
the medium of development finance corporations. In addition, industrial pro-
duction has been helped through a series of industrial imports credits.
Assistance to infrastructure development has been concentrated in the railways,
power and telecommunications. The proposed credit will be the Twelfth Bank/IDA
lending operation for Indian Railways (Ia) - and will mark 25 years of asso-
ciation between  IR  and the  Bank Group.   Credito in   support of the
Government's power transmission and telecommunications program were extended
last year and a rural electrification project is under consideration. India's
cities require major investments, especially in water supply to keep up with
the growth of their population and water supply projects in Madras and Uttar
Pradesh are under consideration.
19.       The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external resources
in support of India's economy bas been a recurrent theme of Bank economic
reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Emphasis on
lending for such critical sectors as agricultural or urban development in-
evitably leads to a relatively slaw transfer of IDA resources. In order to
balance our program, our lending includes more rapidly disbursing projects,
such as telecommunications, railway and industrial imports projects.



- 6 -
20.       The Bank Group has come to contribute significantly towards the
provision of external assistance to India. In the three years 1966/67-
1968/69 the Bank Group accounted for some 17 percent of total new commit-
ments of external assistance; by the three years 1970/71-1972/73 this had
risen to 34 percent. Because of disbursement lags, however, the Bank
Group's share in total disbursements has risen more slowly from 14 percent
in 1966/67-1968/69 to 16 percent in 1970/71-1972/73, but it is expected to
accelerate in the future. As of March 31, 1972, the Bank Group's share
in outstanding external public debt was 19 percent. If current trends
continue as expected, the Bank Group's share in the total amount outstand-
ing will rise to approximately 30 percent, by 1979. Debt service paymen-s
to the Bank Group during the year ended Marcb 31, 1972 were 13 percent of
total debt service payments made by India. By 1979, the Bank Group's share
of total debt service is expected to be around 16 percent.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN INDIA
21.       India's principal transport modes are railways and higbways
carrying virtually all motorized passenger traffic and in the order of
90 percent of motorized freight traffic. Coastal shipping and pipelines
account for the balance of freight traffic; air transport carries about
one percent of passenger traffic. Railways are still the most important
carrier of traffic, although over the last tuo decades there has been
a steady shift from railways to road transport. The railways' share of
freight traffic gradually declined from an estimated 75-90 percent in
the early 1950s to about 50-60 percent of the total at present. This is
due to the inherent economic advantages of taod transport for carrying
certain classes of traffic over short and medium distances. Railways
continue to be the major carrier of passenger and bulk traffic over longer
distances.
22.       During the past 20 years, freight and passenger transport increased
annually by 6 percent and 5 percent respectively. Transport in terms of output
value is expected to grow at an annual average of 6.3 percent during the Fifth
Five-Year Flan period (1974/75-1978/79). Public investments in the sector of
about Rs 55 billion are planned to meet the requirements of projected traffic
growth.  These investments represent about 17 percent of the total Fiftli Plan
outlays, compared 'with a 20 percent sbare originally projected for the Fourth
Plan. Almost Rs 24 billion have been allocated for the railways, representing
about 7 percent of the estimated total Plan outlay. The slight decrease in
the relative share of transport investments reflects the considerable increase
in planned outlays for power generation, housing, education and social programs.
23.       The size of the country and of the transport network, the federal
structure of India and the division of responsibility for transport matters
among Government Ministries at the Center make transport planning and coor-
dination at the same time important and exceedingly complex. Transport
planning is loosely coordinated by the Planning Commission whose functions,
however, relate primarily to setting performance targets within the context
of the whole economy. There are interministerial and Center/State committees
to provide coordination and more recently (1970) the Administrative Reforms
Commission made a number of far reaching proposals for better management of



- 7 -
this sector.  However  it became increasingly apparent during the Fourth
Plan (1969/70-1973/745 that mucb more attention had to be paid to such
basic issues as the role of rail versus road transport, pricing and
licensing policies. Also, although inland waterways, coastal shipping,
pipelines and aviation played a relatively minor role in the sector, the
need to determine how various modes might be integrated was of growing
importance. GOI realized that the planning process for transport needed
to be strengthened and in the course of negotiation of the previous credit
(Eleventh Railway Project, Credit 280-IN), GOI agreed to undertake a trans-
port policy review which was then expected to be completed around July 1973.
This review took longer than expected but was completed in November 1973.
During negotiations agreement was reached on a timetable for further work
on policy coordination and on a Bank Group sector mission in 1974. This
is expected to establishb in cooperation with 00I, a framework for fau%Mw
Bank Group participation in the transport sector.
24.       The Bank Group ha. provided substantial assistance to the transport
sector, tota).llig US$448.6 million in loane and US$488.5 million in IDA
credits. Projects assisted include the construction of ports,and highways,
and air transport and shipping. Two credits are presently being disbursed.
The shipping project is proceeding on schedule while the current railway
credit (Eleventh Railway Project, Credit 280-IM) will be disbursed by the
end of December 1973, three months ahead of schedule, reflecting cost
increases as well as accelerated investments to moset additional traffic
needs early in the Fifth Plan period.
25.       In order to define more specifically IR's direct operational and
investment responsibilities within the transport sector, a 15-year corporate
plan is being prepared by IR in close cooperation with the Plannirg Commission
and relevant ministries. The preparation of this plan was proposed during nego-
tiation of the Eleventh Credit and was intended to complement the work on
policy coordination and to provide the basis for future Bank Group assistance
to Indian Railways.  A group of well qualified staff, together with a part-
time consultant financed by IDA, was assigned in 1972 to undertake this work.
Progress to date has been satisfactory and an initial version of the plan will
be completed by the end of the year.
26.       Although the full results of work on Fifth Plan investments and
the initial version of the corporate plan will not be ready until December
1973, IR has already had to take measures to meet expected demand over the
next few years. The proposed credit has been timed to follow the current
credit in order to maintain continuity. However, unlike more recent credits
for IR, which assisted in covering IR's foreign exchange requirements over two
to three years. this credit has been designed to cover a more limited period
so that further credits can be considered against the background of the frame-
work for Bank Group assistance referred to in paragraphs 23 and 25 above.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The project was appraised in June 1973 and negotiations were
held in Washington from November 5 to 16, 1973. The Borrower was repre-
sented by Mr. M. N. Bery, Chairman of the Indian Railways; Mr. K. S.
Sundara Rajan, Financial Commissioner, Indian Railways; Dr. M. K. Ganguli,
Advisor, Planning Commission; Mr. M. Menezes, Director Planning of the
Indian Railways; and Mr. S. V. Sastry, Joint Director, Finance, Indian
Railways. A report entitled "Appraisal of a Twelfth Railway Project"
(Report No. 2h4a-IN dated December 6, 1973) is being circulated to the
Executive Directors separately.
28.       The project is the Indian Railways' investment program for ,be
period January 1, 1974 to March 31, 1975. The project consists of new
and ongoing works which are required to meet projected increases in demand
for freight and passenger services and to continue with cost reduction
measures, including modernization of equipment. The main elements of the
project are the further replacement of steam by diesel or electric loco-
motives, additions to freight-carrying capacity through wagon replacements
and increases in the wagon fleet, further electrification of mainlines,
track renewal works, and increases in worksbop capacity. A credit and
project summary appears in Annex III.
Project Costs and Financing
29.       Tne estimated project cost is US$654 million equivalent, including
US$97 million of foreign exchange costs.  The proposed credit will finance
82 percent of the foreign exchange costs. The principal items to be financed
are components and materials for the manufacture of locomotives and rolling
stock (US$65.5 million), materials for track renewals and related works
(US$4 million), and materials and components for electrification, signali±ng
and other works (US$10.5 million). The balance of the foreign exchange costs
will be met from GOIls own resources or from bilateral assistance which has
still to be negotiated. The local currency cost will be met in part from
the railways' internally generated funds and in part from Central Government
funds.  IDA credits are channelled through the Government to IR and, insofar
as they relate to additions, they appear in IR's accounts as interGst-
bearing permanent capital known as capital-at-eharge and become part of the
Government's investment. The portion of foreign loans obtained to finance
replacements is reimbursed in local currency to the Government by IR as
expenditures are incurred.
Operating and Financial Performance
30.       The Indian Railways system is the second largest under one manage-
ment in the world, exceeded in size only by the railways of the USSR. The
total system covers approximately 60,000 route-kms. The organization of
the railways is complex. The system consists of nine railway zones, each
under a General Manager reporting directly to the Railway Board. Formal
jurisdiction over the railways is vested in the Ministry of Railways of the
Central Government. The management of railway operations is sound. An



- 9 -
operating ratio (percentage of operating expenses to operating revenues)
of between 82 percent and 85 percent has been maintained over the past
six years, which compares favorably with other major railway systems in
the world. More specifically, the utilization of diesel locomotives has
been raised to 672 kIns per day, which is good and which compares with only
243 km. per day achieved with steam locomotives. Wagon utiliza4ion has
iprond fairl steadily over the past five yeas to reach 959 ton-km per
Vagon-da, the bighest rate so far aehieved by the Indian Railways.
31.         reight traffic has increased by about 2.6 percent per annum in
terms of ton-Ions over the past twe years; while passenger traffc, has
increased by about 5.5 percent per annum in terms of passenger-kms. The slow
rate of growth in freight traffic is a reflection of the modest progress made
by the economy over_the ast three years. Freight tonnage and passenger
traffic are' forecasted by R to increase by about 6 percent and lpercent annually
during the Fifth Plan period.
32.       Over the past five years the railways have been able to finance
about 4i5 percent of total investments out.of internally generated funds and
have aintoained-a return on capital-at-charge ranging from 4.4-pereent to
4.8 percent. GroBs revenue from operations increased by about 8 percent
per annum in 1971/72 and in 1972/73, largely attributable to a higber volume
of freight traffic.  This led to a marked improvement in net revenues.  The
Indian Railways are required to pay out of net revenues a dividend to the
Government on capital-at-charge which represents the Government's net capital
investment in the railways and approximates the value of net fixed assets._The re-
quired dividenid is at present 5.5 pereu9t on capital-at-charge contributed before
March 31, 1964 and 6 percent on capital contributions received thereafter.
Jntil 1971/72 the railways were unable to meet this dividend payment, in part
because the capital-at-charge included investments in unremunerative services.
Tibe Government recognized that the railways should not be required to service
investments undertaken for social and other non-commercial reasons and agreed
in 1971/72 to adjust the amount of capital-at-charge accordingly. The com-
bined effect of this adjustment and the improvement in the net revenue position
enabled the railways to achieve a net surplus over and above the stipulated
dividend payments in the years 1971/72 and 1972/73.
33.       During negotiations, 001 informed the Aseociation that the financial
position of the IR had been adversely affected by the Pay Goimmission award in
October 1973 which will increase IR's mage bill for this fiscal year by about
20 percent. Other costs have also increased and the overall effect is that
the payment of the dividend to the Government will result in a deficit of
Rs 1.3 billion in the year 1973/74, which compares with an originally budgeted
surplus of Rs 250 million.  In the Develoupse't Credit Agreement for this pro-
posed credit, as for the previous credit (280-IN), GOI is required to ensure
that IR earns sufficient net revenue to meet all oprating expenses and the
dividend payable to  OI on capital-at-charge. In view of the substantial in-
crease in costs resulting from the Pay Commission award, it ill not be possible
for IR to meet the requirement of the earnings covenant by an immediate
tariff increase. Consequently, G00 requested a waiver of this covenant
for the three years 1973/74 to 1975/76, at the end of which time IR would once
again be in confformity with the covenant.  GOI further agreed that in 1974/75
IR would meet at least 70 percent of the dividend payable, approximately



- 10 -
85 percent in 1975/76 and the full dividend in 1976/77. The proposed dividend
coverage implies that gross revenues will have to be increased by 5.5 percent
for 1974/75, a further 5.4 percent for 1975/76 and 5.3 percent for 1976/77.
These arrangements are reasonable and accordingly;,the Association proposes to
grant the waiver.
34.       The financial performance of the Indian Railvays should also be
assessed in terms of the role of the railways in the economy. The dividend
payable to -he Government represents between 2 percent and 3 percent of the
Government's total current and capital receipts. The Indian Railways employ
1.7 million people, provide welfare services for its employees and their
dependents numbering some 7 million. The railways also operate major indus-
trial units for the manufacture of locomotives and rolling stock that are
internationally competitive in terms of quality and price; evidence for
this is successful export orders for passenger coaches.
35.       The Railway Convention Committee, which reports to Parliament,
proposed in Dec:ember 1972 an overhaul of the railways accounting system.
The Committee's recommendations were based in part upon the results of
a study carried out in connection with the Tenth Railway Project. The IR
confirmed during negotiations that study groups had already started work
on this and other matters referred to by the Convention Committee. IR expect
that within approximately one year this work will be completed.
Economic Evaluation,
36.       The growth targets for the Fifth Five-Year Plan period will require
substantial achievement in all sectors of the economy, especially in power
generation and industrial production. These sectors generate most of the
demand for bulk transport to be carried by the railwWys. The investment
program of the railways, supported by the proposed credit, is geared to meet
substantial increases in the movements of raw materials such as coal and
other minerals and manufactured products such as steel, cement and fertil-
izers.  The project comprises some 2,000 new and ongoing sub-projects which
pakes an economic; evaluation of individual sub-projects impracticable.
A review of the methodology for appraisal of investment projects indicates
that it has progressively been improving, but further work is required
because of the complexity and size of IR's investment program. The Assois±ation
will continue to review IR's appraisal procedures as part of its review of
IR's corporate planning. A general evaluation of the project has been made
by assessing separately the return on investment in additional capacity and
replacements.  The economic rate of return in both cases is of the same order.
of magnitude and yields an overall rate of return for the project of 13 percent.
The very recent emergence of oil shortages and attendant cost increases wuill
require a re-evaluation of IRt's use of energy.  As railways csn in many cir-
cumstances offer a higher load transporting capability per unit of f5leJl oil
than road transport,  the returns on investment in railways could prove to
be more favorable than those presently estimated.
Disbursement and Procurement
37.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against the cif cost of
imported equipment, components and materials. The credit would be fully dis-
bursed by Marcb 31, 1975. Items financed by the proposed credit would be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the



- 1. -
B'onk Group's guidelines, except for certain items which the railways
should procure from particular sources in tho interest of standardization.
The amount of the credit allocated to procurement of these items has been
limited to US$16 million equivalent.  A further exception to international
bidding would apply to contracts of US$50,000 or less, wbicb are too small
to warrant the administrative complications and cost of global tendering.
The total amount of procurement in this category is difficult to estimate,
but would be a small proportion of the proposed credit.
38.       For contracts over US$1 million equivalent, approval of the
Association would be sought before awards were made except in cases where
the validity period of bids was abort and where the award was to be made
to the lowest evaluated bidder. ERcemptions from the need for prior approval
haVe been granted in respect of steel, non-ferrous metals, wheels, axles,
wheelsets and tires. For contracts between US$50,000 and US$1 million
equivalent, contract documents would be forwarded in the usual way but
additional documentation covering bid analysis and other relevant information
would ba provided only upon request of the Association.
PART V - LEGL INSTRUENTS AND AhJUORIT
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
International Development Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of the Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. There are no
special conditions of effectiveness and the draft agreement conforms to
the pattern of earlier credits for IR projects.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - REC KEEDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

Ln No. 902      Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project  'US 70.0 millionican of -une    ,1D
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
These loans have supported industrialization in India througb
a well-established development finance company. The first three of these
loans are fully committed. The fourth loan has recently been declared
effective and its proceeds are being comitted. There have been delays
in disbursements on the earliest Loan 515-IN as a result of the business
slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
December 31, 1971 for 515-IN bas been extended twice to December 31, 1973.
Loan 683-IN has been fully committed as of December 31, 1972. Disburse-
ments under Loan 789-IN are ahead of sebedule.
Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment;   US$23-0 million credit of June 29, 1966;

Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has
been subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items sebeduled for delivery up to
December 31, 1973,and as a result, the original closing date of December 31,
1972, has been potponed by a year.
Ln No. 61L.    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to aBsist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Corporation
is working efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality.
Seed rroduction is meeting targets. Implementation problems concerning process-
ing plant construction and land-levelling have been solved. Expansion of an
existing processing plant is in progress and tenders for a new plant are under
preparation. Large scale land-levelling demonstration have stimulated demand
for such work and orders for machinery are to be placed i ediately.
Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation;  US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This credit will help to finance the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mabi river and the expansion of the irrigation area below the dam.
The project will also include field channel construction, land-levelling,
drainage and road works, and a program to support agricultural development.
It is now expected that the project will be completed about two years behind
schedule. The major reason for the delay has been the failure of the prime
contractor on the dam itself; the Government wan forced to discharge this
contractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by force account.
More recently, progress with land-levelling haa been slow, and this could
lead to further delay in completing the project; a mission reviewed in
August 1973 remedial action to be taken by the project authorities. The
outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory. As the
delays in implementation so far incurred have arisen at the start of the
project, their effect upon the economic rate of return is not likely to be
significant.

Cr No. 392     Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$38.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
All of the above agricultural credit projects,which total US$287.9
million,are now effective.  Except for the Punjab project whicb consists of
mechanization equipment only, all are similar in structure being desigred to
provide long and medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions
for such on-farm investments as imported tractors, minor irrigation and land-
levelling. Disbursement of these credits started slowly. So far, as the
minor irrigation components were concerned, the main difficulties stemmed
from the institutional requirements which were essential parts of the projects,
specifically the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending tsrms
and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing groundwater
availability. These constraints have now been overcome and disbursements
are accelerating, reflecting higb demand for minor irrigation investments
spurred by the experience of last year's drought. Am a result, by October 31,
1973, US$32.2 mllion out of US$35 million bad been disbursed under the first
project to be approved, the Gujarat project. In all, US$78.2 million has been
disbursed by October 31, 1973 against original disbursement estimates for that
date of approximately US$110 million. The sbortfall is almost entirely the
result of the delay in tractor procurement fo U6owing the substantial change
in both the supply and demand situations affecting tractors since the projects
were originally appraised.  The Executive Directors are expected to consider
at their meeting on Deceiiberm J4, 1:973 a proposal that the credits should be
amended to permit the financing of indigenously manufactured tractors as well
as imported tractors and that some reallocations of the funds earmarked for
tractors should be made to minor irrigation components where these exist to
reflect the shift which has taken place in the relative priority of demand
for tractors and minor irrigation.  The procurement of tractors -i-po-
ceeding under revised and 8implified procurement procedures.

Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation;  US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government has been considering
the procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government
has now indicated that it proposes to proceed with procurement as previously
agreed witn the Association and some disbursements are anticipated during
this fiscal year.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.  Production problers
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months.  Howefver,
production has now picked up and as of October 31, 1973, US$25.2 million had
been disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement is expected by the closing
date  of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II;  US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date:  September 30, 1975
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-IN,
is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid documents suitable for international bidding and the analysis

made for much of the major equipment. Disbursements started in June 1973 and
should be completed by the closing date of September 30, 1975.

development. Land development is presently very haphazard and increasingly
lagging behind water availability in the project mainly because marn ?armers
are unwilling to apply or not eligible for credit under the agricul-tural credit
scheme for land development. Government is aware of the situation and has
requested IDA financing for a Command Area Development Project (CAD), to be
implemented by a Central Authority for all farmers in need of land development.
