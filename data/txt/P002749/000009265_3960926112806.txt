MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK RESEARCH PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Government of Tanzania for SDR 6.0 million (US$8.3 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
(with 40 years maturity) and would support the first phase of a long-term
program to rehabilitate agricultural and livestock research in Tanzania.
Cofinancing of the project by the African Development Fund for US$8.2
million equivalent, the Netherlands for US$2.7 million, United Kingdom for
US$2.9 million, and West Germany for US$1.6 million, is also being
proposed.
2.        Background.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the Tanzanian
economy, accounting for 40-50% of GNP, 75% of exports and over 80% of all
employment. While the economy and the agricultural sector in particular
declined for more than 10 years, largely due to Government policies that
discouraged the farmers from producing, the country's basic agricultural
services, such as research and extension, also suffered considerable
damage. Years of neglect of agricultural research and lack of foreign
exchange led to the deterioration of facilities, the demoralization of
staff and a high rate of attrition of experienced research scientists. The
multiplicity of independent research institutions has led to duplicatioa
and gaps in research. Coordination and a mechanism for setting priorities
are absent, and planning, budgeting and financial control are lacking in
all the research organizations, making it impossible to use resources
allocated to research effectively. The limited research that is going on
is seriously constrained by lack of trained staff, a shortage of laboratory
and field equipment, and scarce operating funds that are largely misapplied
due to the absence of clear priorities. Effective contact between research
and extension staff is rare and even more uncommon between research staff
and farmers. The research system in Tanzania has been unable to meet the
challenge of providing technology to the agricultural sector for producing
more food, raw materials and export commodities.  Since 1980, very few new
varieties have been introduced, and very few new technical packages have
emerged from research services, partly because of the lack of
research/extension dialogue.
3.        This situation is particularly unfortunate since the Government
has embarked on an Economic Recovery Program aimed at remedying the defects
of past policies and reversing the decline in agricultural production. In
addition to continuing real adjustments in the exchange rate, the
Government has introduced several major reforms in the agricultural sector,
designed to give farmers the incentive to increase their production. Had
an effective agricultural research system been in place for the last
several years to generate the normal flow of new and improved technology,
undoubtedly the supply responses of farmers to improved economic incentives
would have been greater. While the recent and anticipated macroeconomic
and sectoral policy reforms can be helpful in stimulating a short-term



-2-
*iupply response from farmers, sustaining productivity growth over the
long-term requires the continuous generation of new technical packages that
only a well organized and managed agricultural research system can provide.
4.        Project Objectives.  Rehabilitation of the research sVstem in
Tanzania is a major undertaking that can only he accomplished in carefully
planned stages which realistically take Into account the country's limited
human and financial resources. The main objective of the proposed project
would be to implement the first stage in this longer term process. During
this first stage, a consolidated and streamlined organizational structure
and management system for research would be put in place, staff would be
trained, the capacity for planning and managing research would be
strengthened, some priority research programs would be rehabilitated and
other programs sustained, while a research master plan is prepared. The
Plan would allow effective resource use for a sustainable research program
to address identified research priorities, and would be the framework for
coordinated foreign assistance for Tanzanian research.
5.        Project Description.  The project would comprise: (i) the
establishment of the new organizational structure for
agricultural/livestock research, including construction of a new
headquarters building; (li) the preparation of the Master Plan; (iII) staff
traiaing to meet immediate needs for management and research methodology;
(iv) vehicles, equipment and materials to sustain ongoing programs; (v)
cotton, root/tuber and farming systems research programs for which
priorities have been established; and (vi) a research fund for priority
crop and livestock research programs identified in the Master Plan. Civil
works, vehicles, equipment, technical assistance, training, and foreign
recurrent costs would be financed. Five donors will cofinance the
project. Because the Special Program for African Agricultural Research
(SPAAR) is participating, close and lasting donor coordination would be
assured. The Federal German Republic and United Kingdom agreed to provide
the SPAAR financial contribution to the project (Schedule A), but other
members are expected to join them. The project would be implemented over
eight years. A project preparation facility of US$0.5 million was used for
project preparation. Tlip Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development
has decided to consolidate the research parastatals into a Research and
Training Department within the Ministry. The Government has given its
approval and the Ministry is developing an implementation plan and
timetable. The total project cost is estimated at US$25.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.5 million (81%). A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
procurement methods, disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group Operations in Tanzania are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (No. IBRD 20656) and the Staff Appraisal Report No.
6926-TA dated May 6, 1988, are also attached.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. This, and the National Extension
Rehabilitation Project that has just been appraised, form part of the IDA
core program to rehabilitate the Tanzanian agriculture. Improvement of
agricultural and livestock research is badly needed to sustain production
increases stimulated by economic reforms. The Bank Group has been
considering ways of assisting Tanzanian research for some time, but the
Government has only recently agreed to consider the institutional
restructuring necessary to revitalize research. In the meantime, the
international donor community has become concerned at lack of impact of its



-3-
considerable, but piecemeal and uncoordinated, support for Tanzanian
research. This and similar experience elsewhere in Africa gave r.se to the
founding of SPAAR, under Bank Group leadership. The SPAAR has selected
Tanzania as the first country for coordinated funding of agriculture/
livestock research on the basis of an agreed plan. The donor community is
looking towards the Bank Group, with its wide international expitrience in
funding research and its standing In Tanzania, to take the lead in
rehabilitating Tanzanian research. The project would be the first step in
such a process and is likely to generate considerable international
support, once institutional restructuring and research planning have been
completed. However, all along, interested donors' participation has been
conditional on successful Bank Group processing and managing of the
project. The project would complement the Extension Rehabilitation Project
in which IDA would play a similarly central role. Research would feed the
extension system, while extension would transfer the benefits of research
to farmers and feed their needs oack to research.
7.        Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was obtained that the
Government will; (i) send the research services consolidation plan for IDA
review within six months of effectiveness, and subsequently implement the
plan according to the atreed timetable; (ii) maintain recurrent budget
allocation for research at least at 1987/88 level in real terms, and invite
all donors to the annual research planning meeting to coordinate assistance
for research; (iii) establish the National Agricultural Research Council by
December  31, 1988 and send the Research Master Plan to IDA for review by
December  31, 1990; (iv) submit an annual work plan satisfactory to IDA by
September 30, each year; (v) organize a joint Government-IDA mid-term
review within 36 months from project effectiveness to which all donors
would be invited; and (vi) introduce a four yearly review of the research
program by an independent panel of eminent local and international research
scientists on terms satisfactory to IDA. Prior to effectiveness, the
Government would need to dissolve the existing research parastatals;
establish the new Research and Training Department; and appoint: the head
of that Department and its Division heads, a task force to consolidate and
restructure the research services,   and working parties to draw up the
Master Plan.
8.        Justification.  The project aims to lay the basis for
transforming the existing sizeable but virtually moribund research services
into an effective organization capable of implementing sustainable programs
based on national priorities. There would be major institution building
benefits. In addition, the strengthening of key research programs and
closer research-extension-farmer linkages should translate into technology
messages to help farmers increase production and improve their incomes and
produce the food, raw ma.erials and export crops needed by the country.
While all research prograws would safeguard the environment, some programs
would enhance it by improving fertility and soil cover. Women farmers
would benefit particularly from Farming Systems Research to find measures
to ease their labor problems.



-4-
9.        Risks. The main risks are organlzational problems in connection
with the proposed institutional consolldation, Inadequate funding,
irrelevant research, and lack of adoption of results by farmers. Strong
technical assistance over several years would minudize organisatlonal
problems. To safeguard adequate funding, assurances would be obtained that
present budget provislons would be maintalned in real terms. Farming
systems research, attention to close research-extension-farmer linkages and
research program reviews by local experts and independent.panels should
help to ensure program relevance, while the recently appraised Natlonal
Extension Rehabilitation Project would Improve the delivery of results to
farmers. Economic dialogue and IDA lending programs focussing on
Incentives, inputs and marketing should foster farmer acceptance of
economically useful messages.
10.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies with the
Articles of Association and recommend that the ixecutive Directors approve
the proposed credit.
