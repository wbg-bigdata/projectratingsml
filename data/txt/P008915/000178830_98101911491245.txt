APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
TURKEY
SUMARY
i.        Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) is one of the oldest and
most experienced DFCs associated with the World Bank Group. Since the last
loan, the eleventh, TSKB has continued to shift the regional pattern of its
operations in favor of the poorer parts of Turkey, particularly Eastern
Anatolia and the less developed provinces in Central Anatolia which received
41% of its total resources in 1975 and 1976. In many instances, TSKB's finan-
cial support is combined with an effort to help identify, promote and prepare
projects, and to widen the ownership of industrial enterprises in the less
developed regions (LDRs) through extension of technical assistance. Other new
functions and responsibilities include: cooperation with the State Planning
Organization in the identification of projects to be jointly financed in the
LDRs, preparation of industrial sub-sector studies of resources and invest-
ment opportunities and participation in studies on Turkey's financial sector.
While the proposed loan aims at a continuation of TSKB's regional development
efforts, it introduces a new dimension: promotion of smaller sized labor-
intensive industries (SM1LI). Resource mobilization, particularly of foreign
funds, continues to be a prime objective.
ii.       TSKB remains the most important institutional source of long-term
funds in the private sector, financing about 10% of total private manufacturing
investment (about 24% in terms of foreign exchange financing). Its attempts
to diversify its resource base and to tap international capital markets (with
IFC's assistance) have been only partially successful. Main constraints were
shortage of long-term finance in the world markets and preemption of available
funds by the Government. TSKB's efforts to raise domestic resources have been
hampered by the regulated interest rate structure, which results in a negative
spread on bonds floated. Yet, in 1975 and 1976 TSKB issued bonds totalling
TL 390 million--a creditable effort.
iii.      At the end of June 1976 TSKB's total assets had reached TL 5.5
billion, with its loan and equity portfolio amounting to TL 4.8 billion.
Commitments increased by about 30% annually in 1972-76. TSKB's portfolio
is diversified and sound. Arrears are well within acceptable limits and pro-
visions for losses adequate. In 1975, net profit represented a return on
average net worth of 17%. Though lower than the level attained in previous
years, TSKB's financial performance is good. TSKB's high quality appraisal/
supervision work and continuing good record of operations warrant the raising
of its debt/equity ratio from the present level of 6:1 to 8.5:1.
iv.       TSKB's business prospects appear good.  The Goverment will continue
to place heavy emphasis on industrial growth to improve export earnings, to
generate employment opportunities, and to develop the LDRs. It can therefore
be reasonably expected that a relatively high level of industrial investment,
both in the public and private sector, will be maintained in the next several



- ii -
years. Based on its pipeline of projects and expected resources, TSKB fore-
casts commitments of about TL 7 billion during 1977-mid 1979. About 22% of
the projected commitments, or TL 1.5 billion, will be in local currency and
will be financed by internally generated funds, bond issues, and share capital
increases. TSKB will on-lend at 14% for both lira and foreign exchange sub-
loans, the present limit authorized by the Government.
v.        To encourage TSKB to continue its developmental and resource mobil-
ization efforts, the Bank received assurances that in the period 1977 and
1978 TSKB will: continue to devote to the LDRs at least the same proportion
of its resources as it did in the period 1975-76, and earmark Bank funds and
other TSKB resources in foreign exchange and domestic currency in the amount
of $60 million equivalent to finance SMLI projects. Regarding resource
mobilization, TSKB has furnished concrete evidence that it has intensified
its efforts to supplement Bank funds with foreign exchange resources from
non-traditional lenders. In addition, assurances were obtained from TSKB that
it will make its best efforts to raise long-term funds of at least $50 million
in the international capital market prior to June 30, 1978. Other features of
the proposed loan include: repayment period of up to 15 years, including a
grace period of up to 4.5 years to allow TSKB to blend long-term with medium-
term market funds; net interest spread of 2.5% p.a.; replenishment of TSKB's
promotional fund by earmarking 1 percentage point of the gross interest
spread of the proposed loan for this purpose; and a small provision to finance
foreign exchange expenditures in connection with its promotional activities.
vi.       Agreement having been reached on the principal issues, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of $74 million to TSKB. A loan of this magnitude
would meet about 25% of TSKB's foreign exchange requirements projected for the
period from January 1977 to June 1979.
vii.      Additionally, an IFC loan of $50 million to TSKB is proposed, of
which $10 million would be for IFC's own account and the balance is intended
to be placed with participants. The interest rate on the loan portion for
IFC's own account ("A" Loan) would be 10-1/4% per annum and the interest rate
for the participants' portion ("B" Loan) would be based on the London Inter-
bank Offered Rate for 6 months deposits plus a margin of about 2%. The "A"
Loan would be repaid in about 9 years and the "B" Loan in about 5 years
including grace periods.



APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
TURKEY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) was established in 1950
with World Bank assistance. TSKB has received seven Bank loans and four IDA
credits, totalling $233 million. Additionally TSKB has received from IFC
three loans totalling $60 million (including $45 million in participations).
IFC holds also 6% of the subscribed capital of TSKB. TSKB is an efficient DFC
in terms of both financial support to industry and overall development impact.
This report updates the findings of the appraisal for the last Bank Loan
(1078-TU),1/ which encouraged TSKB to assume an active role in promoting in-
vestments in the less developed regions (LDRs). TSKB has responded commendably
and has taken the lead in extending technical assistance and financial support.
Although TSKB's efforts - for reasons largely beyond its control - have been
somewhat less successful in raising resources in the capital market domesti-
cally and abroad, it has nevertheless raised substantial amounts of term funds
through domestic bond issues, has organized commercial bank cofinancing on a
large scale, and has raised substantial amounts of foreign exchange with the
collaboration of IFC. In addition, recent contacts with non-traditional
lenders in Europe and in the Middle East provide grounds for a reasonable
expectation that increased amounts of foreign exchange can be mobilized during
the next two years.
1.02      Through the proposed loan, the Bank Group will encourage TSKB:
(i) to continue its impressive technical and financial assis-
tance to industrial projects in the poorer parts of Turkey;
(ii) to expand its developmental role by increasing its focus
on small- to medium-sized labor-intensive investments (SMLI);
and
(iii)  to step up resource mobilization efforts domestically and
abroad.
With these objectives in mind, a Bank loan of $74 million and an IFC loan
of $50 million (including $10 million for IFC's own account) are recom-
mended.

December 20, 1974.

II. THE ENVIRONMENT
Economic Performance 1/
2.01      The Turkish economy has grown at a relatively rapid rate with only
minor interruptions since the early 1960's. Real GNP growth averaged an es-
timated 7.4% per annum during 1973-76, which is close to the Plan's (1973-77)
targeted 7.9%. Industry, power, transport and construction were major contri-
butors to this achievement. Nonetheless, Turkey's economic performance since
1974 has been marked by a deterioration in the balance of payments, infla-
tionary pressures and rising unemployment. The current account deficit rose
from $485 million in 1973 to about $2 billion in 1976. Inflation rates have
been high in the past several years due to increases in wages and import
prices, especially of oil and its products and large fiscal deficits.
Domestic price increases, measured by the wholesale price index, declined
markedly from 30% in 1974 to 10% in 1975 but rose again by about 19% in 1976.
Unemployment edged up from 10% of the labor force in 1973 to 13% in 1975,
reflecting two tendencies: the reduction in net emigration of workers from
136,000 in 1973 to less than 5,000 in 1975 and the faster rate of growth of
the labor force compared with Liiat of employment opportunities. 2/
The Industrial Sector
2.02      The Government's direct involvement in industry continues in areas
where the private sector does not venture because of long gestation periods,
heavy capital requirements, or high risks. At present, the public sector
accounts for about 50% of the value added in manufacturing and mining and
is a major producer in steel, petroleum refining, fertilizers, petrochemicals,
and pulp and paper. The private sector focuses mainly on consumer goods and
durables, and only recently has entered intermediate and investment goods
production. It accounted for about 50% of industrial investment during
1973-76 and about 65% of total industrial employment. Within the private
sector, out of 175,000 industrial establishments (1970), close to 500 employ
200 or more persons, about 1,000 employ 50 to 200 persons, and the balance
(some 99% of total establishments) 50 persons or less. In terms of value
added, the respective shares are 70%, 14% and 16%, while in terms of employ-
ment 42%, 11% and 47%. (For details on the structure and employment distri-
bution of Turkish industry see Annex 1, pages 1 and 2).
2.03      Industrial Policy.  Industrialization has been viewed as instru-
mental for the achievement of high rates of economic growth and structural
changes in Turkey. In the pursuit of these objectives, industrial develop-
ment policy has stressed import substitution, the application of advanced
technology and a shift of emphasis from consumer goods to intermediate and
investment goods industries. The instruments to support this policy have
1/   A detailed review of the Turkish economy can be found in "Country
Economic Memorandum", No. 1272 TU, dated October 21, 1976.
2/   The prospects of the Turkish economy are discussed in para 7.01.

been high protection and generous incentives. The capital-intensity and
inward orientation of the industrialization policies have resulted in the
development of a fairly modern public sector, largely oriented to the domestic
market and with few backward linkages. The private sector, operating mainly
in consumer goods industries (textiles and clothing, leather and leather pro-
ducts, rubber and plastics manufactures, light metal fabricating and engineer-
ing, pharmaceuticals, etc.) has important backward linkages, also to the
public sector. A large number of private sector enterprises cannot exploit
their export potential because they are, for the most part, suboptimal in
scale, inefficient and financially too weak to break into the export markets.
With the prospects for additional net labor emigration severely curtailed, the
country will have to place greater emphasis on export promotion. There are
indications that light, labor-intensive industries have a good market poten-
tial in Western Europe. The Government is considering favorably this needed
change in emphasis in its industrial policy and the Bank would support con-
crete efforts in promising subsectors.
2.04      Industrial Performance.  The performance of the manufacturing sector
has been impressive. During the past ten years or so, manufacturing grew at
an annual average rate of 11% in real terms, while its share in GDP rose from
15% in 1964 to an estimated 21% in 1976. Growing at 13% annually, the share
of manufacturing in total fixed investment increased from 20% in 1964 to an
estimated 31% in 1976. With rising incremental capital-output ratios, indus-
trial employment grew slowly--from 9% of total employment in 1964 to only 13%
in 1976. Exports of manufactures, ranging between $80 and $100 million during
1964-70, increased sharply thereafter and reached an estimated $700 million in
1976. They now represent some 36% of total exports. Rising demand, partic-
ularly from European countries, the devaluation of the lira in 1970, incen-
tives and, generally, a more outward orientation account for this development.
In spite of this remarkable growth performance, the volume of exports is still
relatively low. Manufacturing exports account for only 3% of the total value
of manufacturing production, with leather garments the only major activity
focusing primarily on exports.
2.05      Regional Dispersion of Industry.  Another policy objective of the
Government is to reduce the income disparity among regions and to alleviate
unemployment in the LDRs. The main elements of the Plan (1973-77) strategy
to achieve regional development are to raise agricultural productivity,
diversify agricultural production and improve rural living conditions; to
improve infrastructure; to expand public and promote private investment in
industry; and to raise the standard of administrative and social services,
particularly health and education, to national levels. The Plan also en-
visages continuation of the program to establish estates for small industries
in outlying regions.
2.06      Over the first three years of the Plan, progress in institutional
reforms and in improving the investment climate in the LDRs, inherently a
difficult and protracted process, has been moderate. However, the Govern-
ment's program of industrial estates has made notable progress. It succeeded
in relocating a large number of workshops from crowded industrial quarters in



- 4 -
towns all over the country and has been helpful in promoting a more balanced
regional development. By the end of 1975, 36 estates with over 7,000 work-
sheds had been completed, while another 38 are under construction and others
are planned. With few exceptions, these estates will accommodate small entre-
preneurs and artisans. Their financial requirements are predominantly for
domestic currency, which is provided by the Halk Bank. 1/ TSKB, on the other
hand, encouraged by the Bank, has been instrumental in promoting new manu-
facturing projects in the LDRs and meeting their foreign exchange needs. An
account of TSKB's contribution is presented in paras. 3.01 and 3.02.
2.07      Protection and Incentives.  Various instruments are used for the
protection of domestic industry, including tariffs, 2/ levies and taxes on
imports, quota restrictions and absolute prohibition of some imports. Their
extent and scope, however, have had mixed effects on industrial development.
They have raised substantially the domestic prices of imported and locally
produced goods using imported inputs, have discouraged the growth of indus-
trial exports because of the relatively higher profitability of the home
market, have caused delays in production and underutilization of capacity,
and have led occasionally to a build-up of inventories as a hedge against
import uncertainties. A rationalization of the tariff structure will
eventually be achieved with Turkey's entry into the EEC. Elimination of
quotas on imports is also planned according to an agreed schedule.
2.08      Export and investment incentives in Turkey are described in Annex 1
(pages 4-5). The design of incentives encourages capital-intensive production
and activities, with a high degree of import content. Higher incentives are
offered for investment in LDRs, with some success. The high rate of growth
of manufacturing investment in the past decade--17% per annum in real terms--
supports the view that the incentives package including protective measures
has stimulated considerably private investment in industry. An incentives
bill pending in Parliament reportedly attempts to streamline the incentives
system and to make it benefit a larger circle of export-oriented industries.
The Financial Setting
2.09      The Institutional Framework.  The major sources of long-term insti-
tutional finance of private industry are TSKB, the Industrial Investment and
Credit Bank (SYKB) which finances predominantly domestic currency expenditures
and the Halk Bank. Roughly 44% of total private fixed investment is financed
1/   Halk Bank is a Government owned financial institution, with about 300
branches, total assets of TL 12.7 billion, financing small tradesmen,
artisans and manufacturing workshops. Unlike TSKB, it does not promote
projects or perform the various other functions of a development in-
stitution.
2/   Tariffs are generally lower on equipment (5.4%) and industrial raw
materials (5-100%) than consumption goods (24-150%). Rates for imports
from the EEC are 10-20% lower.



-5-
by intermediaries (10% by TSKB) 1/, 35% out of internally generated funds, 6%
from bond issues and the remaining 15% through direct foreign investment. The
State Investment Bank (DYB) is the only financial institution which provides
long-term finance to state economic enterprises, satisfying about 30% of their
requirements in recent years. Since 1972, commercial banks have increased
medium-term lending to the private sector, in response to new regulations (and
incentives) whereby they were required to earmark 10% (and, since 1976, 20%)
of their portfolio for loans of 2-5 year maturities.
2.10      The capital market is thin.  Share issues by private corporations
to outsiders are very limited. The bond market is dominated by Government
issues, which enjoy a captive market. Government bonds are highly liquid and
yield 11% tax free; corporate bonds yield 18% and are subject to tax. Some
80% of the Government bond issues have been placed with financial and other
public institutions and only 17% directly with savers. The issue of bonds
by private corporations is a relatively recent development. TSKB has played
an important role by guaranteeing and placing such issues. Private bond
issues have been growing and reached TL 1.6 billion in 1976--still a rela-
tively small amount. In contrast, during 1971-76, private savings and time
deposits grew at 22% per annum and reached TL 34 billion at the end of 1976.
In 1976, the Investment Finance Corporation was established by a group of
banks, in which TSKB played a key role, to participate in the equity of
industrial firms located in the LDRs. For the time being, the new company
will be managed by TSKB.
2.11      The role of foreign private investments in industrial development
is limited. The official policy is to accept them when they lead to transfer
of new technology and provision of training, contribute to export earnings,
and entail no monopoly or special privilege. In practice the policy has been
restrictive due to administrative delays. Foreign direct investments rose
from $27 million in 1973 to an estimated $100 million in 1976.
2.12      Since 1975, there have been substantial private short-term capital
inflows through the revival of the convertible lira accounts with Turkish
commercial banks. Under this scheme, the Central Bank converts foreign cur-
rency deposits held by Turkish commercial banks into lira and assumes the
foreign exchange risk. The commercial banks are authorized to pay interest of
up to 2.25% over the Eurodollar market rate on these deposits, and can lend
75% of the proceeds to local borrowers. At the end of 1976, convertible lira
deposits were estimated at $1.7 billion. These deposits are rolled over and
used mainly for investment purposes.
2.13      In April 1975, the Turkish Government established a new banking in-
stitution, the State Industry and Labor Investment Bank (DESIYAB), to mobilize
the savings of migrant workers for investment in the private sector, mainly
in the LDRs. DESIYAB's authorized capital is TL 1 billion, owned 85% by the
Treasury and 15% by state economic enterprises. Eventually 49% of its share
1/   TSKB provides about 24% of the foreign exchange requirements of the
private manufacturing sector.



- 6-
capital, with a guarantee of a 12% dividend, will be made available to the
public, preferably to persons who work or have worked abroad. DESIYAB may
make either equity investments or extend loans for up to 15 years. The
establishment of this new financial intermediary should complement TSKB's
effort in promoting regional development. It is however too early to draw
conclusions.
Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
2.14      Resource allocation in Turkey is affected more by controls over the
volume of credit channelled through,the specialized banking institutions than
by interest rates. In October 1974, the Government raised the legal ceiling
on term loans to industry from 12% to 14% per annum. However, due to the
transaction tax (25%) and other fees in effect, the effective cost of capital
to industrial borrowers is 19%. 1/ Measured by the whole sale price index,
inflation in Turkey subsided from 30% in 1974 to 10% in 1975. In 1976 pre-
liminary indications are that whole-sale prices have increased by 19%. The
Government is determined to reduce inflation in the next several years through
a more effective demand management. It can therefore be reasonably expected
that the cost of capital to TSKB's borrowers of about 19% is sufficiently high
to ensure positive interest rates over the life of such borrowings.
2.15      In May 1976, a new scheme was instituted whereby the Central Bank
assumes the foreign exchange risk on the principal of direct medium- and long-
term borrowings of Turkish firms from foreign commercial banks. For interest
payments the Government does not assume the foreign exchange risk. Under the
scheme the borrower is required to pay a 1% fee on the full amount of the loan
and 1% per annum on the outstanding balance to a special fund administered by
the Central Bank. This measure was subsequently extended to borrowers acting
through financial intermediaries (such as TSKB) in order to put them on an
equal footing with firms borrowing directly from foreign lenders. The new
policy, which raises the effective lending rate to over 20%, does not affect
adversely resource allocation, since the effective cost of foreign exchange
loans and the Government's determination to contain inflationary pressures at
more normal levels, should maintain significantly positive real lending rates.
2.16      Because lending rates are set below domestic capital market borrow-
ing rates (18%), TSKB's efforts to mobilize resources from the domestic market
have been hampered (para 6.04 and Annex 11). To establish a sound factual
and analytical framework for the development of a more responsive financial
system and a more rational interest rate structure, the Government, at the
Bank's encouragement, initiated in 1976 major studies on financial savings
and flow of funds; role and efficiency of the banking system; selective credit
policies; unorganized financial sector; term credit. After the completion of
these studies, late in 1977, the Government is expected to take their findings
into consideration in the formulation of future policies and plans affecting
the financial sector, including the structure of interest rates.

foreign exchange risk.

III. TSKB'S DEVELOPMENT IMPACT
Investment in the Less Developed Regions
3.01      Encouraged by the Bank, TSKB restructured its organization in
January 1974 to support an expansion of its operations to the LDRs (paras.
4.03 and 4.08). It also established two new branch offices in Eastern
Anatolia (Elazig) and Central Anatolia (Samsun), and increased the radius
of activity of the existing branch offices in Adana and Izmir. Promotional
activities normally involve project identification through sector reviews,
with the field offices trying to interest investors in project proposals; or,
alternatively, feeding back tentative project ideas of investors to TSKB's
new Research Department for further study. In 1976 projects identified
and promoted by TSKB accounted for over one-third of total loan and equity
approvals (25% in 1975). TSKB's sector study program for 1975-77 and a
listing of projects identified and approved in the recent past are included
in Annex 6. A large majority of these projects are located in the LDRs.
When projects, thus promoted, reach the financing and implementation stage,
inexperienced investors often turn to TSKB for assistance in the selection
of machinery, technical know-how, and management, and for advice to overcome
implementation problems. In case of equity participations TSKB is represented
on the Board of client companies. Often TSKB staff, serving in this capacity,
consist of experienced engineers who advise investors in technical matters or
even assume interim executive responsibility. The technical and managerial
assistance TSKB extends to a growing number of its promotional projects is
vital for their success.
3.02      Through a concerted effort to assist investments in the poorer parts
of Turkey, TSKB raised its financing of projects in the LDRs from 10% of loans
and equity participations approved in 1973 to an average of 56% in 1975 and
1976. 1/ By way of comparison, over the first three years of the 1973-77 Plan,
the Government allocated only 28% of its investments to the LDRs. TSKB also
succeeded in locating projects and attracting investors away from industrial-
ized centers and into underdeveloped pockets within the more industrialized
Western and Central Regions. In Eastern Anatolia, the least developed part
of Turkey, TSKB's operations in terms of approvals increased from 2% to 20%.
Income Distribution
3.03      In recent years, an increasing number of migrant workers returning
from abroad have pooled their savings and set up industrial ventures. This
has led to a wider distribution of ownership, with individual industrial en-
terprises being owned by several hundreds of shareholders. TSKB has promoted
such projects and provided technical assistance. TSKB-supported companies
in 34 provinces have issued shares for about TL 1.2 billion to more than
5,000 small shareholders.
1/   This percentage is based on SPO's current definition of LDRs; in
terms of the new definition proposed in para 8.02, this percentage
becomes about 41%.



-8-
Economic Impact of Assisted Projects
3.04      In 1975 and the first half of 1976 TSKB computed the economic rate
of return (ERR) for 52 projects (para 4.09). For these projects the weighted
average ERR expected was about 20%, which is above the opportunity cost of
capital. In the majority of cases the financial rate of return (FRR) exceeded
the ERR, indicating that these projects receive special Government incentives
or operate in a protected environment. An important social benefit, which is
however difficult to quantify, is the high share of projects located in the
poorer parts of Turkey (Annex 8, page 1). The total number of projects
approved in 1975 in the LDRs and elsewhere is expected to create employment
for about 11,000 people, equivalent to about 15% of the total increase in
industrial employment in Turkey, at an average investment cost per job of
about $23,000. During January to October 1976, the average cost per job of
approved TSKB-financed projects (64 in number) rose sharply to $43,000. This
was mainly due to the financing of nine capital-intensive, and economically
important projects in chemicals, fertilizers, plastics, machinery, chipboard
and other wood-based products. For these projects the cost per job ranged
from TL 1.17 million ($71,700 equivalent) to TL 3.15 million ($193,000 equiva-
lent). Two-thirds of these nine projects (about 70% in terms of aggregate
fixed assets) are located in LDRs. Exclusive of these nine projects, the
average cost per job in the first ten months of 1976 was $29,000.
3.05      About 10% of TSKB-financed projects in 1975 and 1976 are expected to
export at least 20% of their production. During this period, export-oriented
sub-projects were concentrated in the textile and food processing sectors. To
identify export markets for Turkish manufactures, TSKB has studied the export
potential of a number of industries including cotton textiles, leather prod-
ucts, meat products and iron and steel castings. But due to the long gesta-
tion period of export-oriented promotional projects often requiring special
licensing and marketing arrangements, it will still take some time until the
full impact of TSKB's research is translated into bankable sub-projects.
Technical Assistance
3.06      In addition to technical assistance services extended to client
firms (para 3.01), TSKB assists Government planning agencies and the financial
sector through participation in studies and secondment of staff. Assignments
taken up by TSKB during the past two years include: (i) identification of
projects in LDRs to be jointly financed with SPO; (ii) preparation of studies
on industrial sub-sectors in cooperation with Government authorities; (iii)
participation in the preparation of comprehensive studies on Turkey's finan-
cial sector, undertaken by the Government; and (iv) setting up and managing
the Investment Finance Corporation to provide equity to projects located in
the LDRs (para 2.10). Most recently the Government has asked TSKB to give
technical assistance to the newly established State Industry and Labor Invest-
ment Bank (DESIYAB) through secondment of experienced staff. TSKB has fully
accepted the challenge of assuming responsibilities in these new fields.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS I/
Ownership and Control
4.01      Shareholders.  In 1975, TSKB increased its share capital from TL
193.3 million to TL 425.5 million to be fully paid in before the end of 1977.
Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest commercial bank, remains the principal
shareholder, holding 22% of the total share capital. IFC presently holds
6% of the subscribed capital. A list of TSKB's shareholders is given in
Annex 2.
4.02      Board.  In early December 1976, Mr. Cahit Kocaomer, General Manager
of Turkiye Is Bankasi, was elected Chairman of TSKB's Board to replace Mr.
Selahattin Karahan. Mr. Kocaomer is able and a respected member of the
banking community. A list of Board members is shown in Annex 3.
Organization, Management and Staff
4.03      Organization.  In 1974, TSKB established four regionalized opera-
tions departments, each headed by a Department Manager in charge of two
Project Managers who supervise the financial analysts. The Engineering and
Research Departments have not been regionalized. Engineers and economists
are assigned to appraisal and supervision teams and work together with the
Regional staff. An organization chart is included in Annex 4. Regionaliza-
tion has proven to be successful (para 3.02).   TSKB is considering the
serviceability of establishing additional branch offices in the LDRs.
4.04      In early 1975, a Planning and Budgeting Department was established.
Its main function consists in preparing Annual Lending and Investment Programs
based on demand projections for funds prepared by the Regional Departments.
It also monitors the progress of the lending and investment programs and
reviews the performance of the Regional Departments. The Department is
presently understaffed, but Management plans to strengthen it.
4.05      Branch Managers assisted by a small staff are active in identifying
projects and are responsible for the preliminary screening of loan applica-
tions. Actual appraisal work is done by staff despatched from headquarters.
TSKB has in the past two years experienced difficulties in appointing suitable
Branch Managers to the Regions, and Management is considering ways and means
to resolve the problem.
4.06      Management and Staff.  Mr. Resid Egeli, General Manager, retired
in November 1976. He had been associated with TSKB for twenty-four years and,
under his continuous and able leadership, the institution grew and attained
1/   The analysis in this report focuses on major developments since the
Bank's eleventh loan was approved and updates the findings presented
in the Appraisal Report on TSKB (No 529a-TU) dated December 20, 1974.



- 10 -
its present stature. He was succeeded by Mr. Ozhan Eroguz, Senior Assistant
General Manager. Mr. Eroguz, 47, has been with TSKB for almost two decades;
he is competent and well regarded by the business community and by the staff.
4.07      TSKB has a staff of 142 professionals.  Staff strength has increased
by 7% since the end of 1974. This growth seems small in relation to TSKB's
additional promotional and economic work, but its increasing reliance on
outside consulting services has relieved the pressure for a rapid increase of
its own staff. Turnover has been low; internal promotion and competitive
salary scales have been important factors.
Policies and Procedures
4.08      Policy Statement.  In June 1974, TSKB established quantitative tar-
gets for industrial investments to be promoted in the LDRs in 1975 and 1976.
Simultaneously it limited its lending operations in the more developed areas
to enterprises with particularly attractive investment plans but no access to
resources in domestic and international capital markets. During negotiations
TSKB's management confirmed to the Bank its intention to continue its assis-
tance of the LDRs in 1977 and 1978 with the same vigor as in the recent past
(paras 8.02 and 8.03). In addition, TSKB expanded its operational targets to
include the financing of small- to medium-sized labor-intensive industries
(paras 8.05-8.06 and 8.10). A formal resolution setting forth these policies
was adopted by TSKB's Board on April 8, 1977 (Annex 5).
4.09      Project Promotion and Appraisal.  TSKB's project-related research
(Annex 6) and appraisals have reached high standards. Because of the progress
made in preparing sector studies, the market analysis of projects has been
further upgraded. Economic rate of return (ERR) calculations are prepared
for all Bank-financed projects above the free limit as well as for other major
projects.
4.10      Procurement and Disbursement.  TSKB's role in providing guidance
for the procurement of machinery and equipment has become vital for the suc-
cessful implementation of most projects identified in the LDRs. Frequently,
TSKB's engineers negotiate with foreign suppliers on behalf of their clients.
Disbursement procedures are satisfactory.
4.11      Project Supervision.  Project supervision work is effectively car-
ried out by the Regions. TSKB has been preparing annual consolidated end-
use reports, analyzing the financial condition of its clients. More in-
depth economic analysis to be included in such reports is providing valuable
feedback to TSKB's project appraisal work.

V. OPERATIONS
Summary of Operations
5.01      A summary of operations for 1972-75 and the first six months of 1976
is included in Annex 7. The level of TSKB's commitments has been erratic
reflecting primarily the highly fluctuating availability of resources. Low
commitments in 1972 (TL 676 million) and 1974 (TL 613 million) contrast with a
high commitment level in 1973 (TL 1,079 million) and 1975 (TL 1,362 million).
In the first half of 1976, there was a slight fall in foreign currency commit-
ments while local currency lending rose above the 1975 level; equity invest-
ments doubled in 1975 and retained their high level in 1976. The upsurge of
equity investments reflects TSKB's active role in developing projects in the
LDRs. On the other hand, bond guarantee and underwriting business is declin-
ing, as bond issuing firms become better known and are able to float bonds on
their own strength. Total disbursements lagged behind commitments in 1975 but
began to catch up in the first part of 1976. The geographical, sectoral and
size distribution as well as other information on TSKB's loan approvals are
shown in Annex 8.
Assistance to Less Developed Regions
5.02      In connection with the last Bank loan (1078-TU), TSKB's Board
approved a policy under which in 1975 and 1976 at least 50% of total resources,
including the Bank loan, would be allocated to projects in the LDRs as defined
by SPO. TSKB has lived up to this commitment (para 3.02 and Annex 11), despite
the numerous difficulties it has encountered in its efforts, particularly in
the least developed Eastern part of Anatolia. Most critical have been the
lack of entrepreneurship, equity finance and management expertise. Frequently,
there have been significant time lags, ranging from 5 to 10 months, between
approval and commitment of loans. To speed up the process, TSKB has played
a major role as developmental catalyst, its assistance ranging from identifica-
tion of promising investment sub-sectors and help in preparation of investment
proposals to the provision of seed capital and the establishment of a pilot
company together with a small number of local shareholders. Commitment of a
loan to such a pilot company would then depend on its ability to attract
further shareholders 1/ and to secure competent management.
Small- to Medium-Sized Labor-Intensive Industrial Projects (SMLI)
5.03      As detailed in Annex 9, an analysis of TSKB's operations since 1973
shows that it has financed a broad spectrum of projects of a variety of sizes,
including a number of comparatively small projects (fixed assets around
$500,000), mainly in the LDRs. In the context of Turkish modern industry,
small- to medium-sized labor-intensive industrial projects could be defined
1/   Annex 8, page 2 shows that the "equity gap" is particularly pronounced
in the LDRs.



- 12 -
as those with maximum fixed assets per project of $2.3 million (TL 35 million
equivalent) and maximum investment per job ratios of $17,000. Using this
definition (based on 1975 prices), TSKB's financing (on approval basis) of
the SMLI target group over the period 1973-76 was as follows:
(Jan.-Oct.)
SMLI Operations                               1973    1974    1975        1976
Number of projects                            24      23       35         26
Total foreign exchange and TL financing        6.8     6.6    19.8        13.3
($ million)
Average fixed assets/project ($ million)    0.6        0.7      1.1        1.0
Average cost per job ($ 000)                   7        9      10         11
TSKB's assistance of SMLI projects increased sharply in 1975. In 1976 a
plateau at about $15-20 million seems to have been reached. TSKB attributes
the 1975-76 upsurge of its SMLI financing to the promotional drive in the LDRs
and the fact that, due to the small local markets and savings potential of
the LDRs, the projects promoted had the tendency to be relatively small and
labor-intensive. Often SMLI projects were related to basic food processing
(e.g. flour) or construction (e.g. bricks and tiles) in sub-sectors with a
fairly steady but slow rate of increase of demand. The possibilities for
promoting such projects in the LDRs seem to be somewhat circumscribed, as
evidenced by the leveling off of SMLI financing in 1976. Prospects for SMLI
financing in the more developed provinces are good and TSKB is planning to
focus its promotional efforts in this direction, while continuing its action
program in the LDRs (paras 8.04-8.06).
VI. FINANCIAL SITUATION
Resource Mobilization
6.01      Annex 10 presents TSKB's resource position as of June 30, 1976.  For-
eign exchange borrowings from international financial institutions (including
IFC syndications) as of that date accounted for about 74% of TSKB's domestic
and foreign resources, totalling $241 million equivalent. The remaining 26%
of its resources included: (i) a local currency subordinated loan from the
Turkish Government of TL 368 million ($22.5 million equivalent); (ii) various
Government lira loans from revolving foreign aid counterpart funds totalling
TL 85.5 million ($5.2 million equivalent); (iii) bonds floated in the domestic
market of TL 300 million ($18.3 million equivalent); and (iv) equity of
TL 602.2 million ($36.9 million equivalent).



- 13 -
6.02      Foreign Currency Resources.  During 1975 and 1976, TSKB expected to
raise aid funds of $66 million from KfW and EIB as well as market funds with
IFC's assistance of $125 million. Against these projections, TSKB received
two loans from KfW totalling $24 million equivalent and raised only $50 mil-
lion under IFC arrangements (Annex 11). The expected EIB resources did not
come forth because of protracted negotiations between Turkey and the EEC on
a new Financial Protocol. Loans made by the participating banks in IFC's
syndications have mostly maturities of only five to seven years and carry
almost entirely floating interest rates. The risk inherent in borrowing at a
floating interest rate and relending at a fixed rate was considered and found
to be low. 1/ The historically unsuccessful efforts to arrange for larger and
longer-term borrowings from foreign commercial sources for TSKB attest to the
difficulties involved. In 1975 and 1976, TSKB undertook serious steps on its
own to enter the international capital market and approached 22 commercial
banks in the Western world, six of which eventually participated in the IFC
syndications. TSKB's resource mobilization efforts were hampered by the
overall shortage of long-term finance in the international capital markets,
the fact that most major banks involved in Eurocurrency lending had either
filled up their quotas for Turkey or felt uneasy about Turkey's extensive
short-term borrowings, and the competition from commercial banks in raising
outside resources in the form of convertible deposits (para 2.12).
6.03      To make full use of its medium-term market funds, TSKB has been
blending them since 1975 with long-term funds from IBRD, KfW and EIB, which
are used to finance the later maturities of sub-loans. An analysis of TSKB's
commitments in the first ten months of 1976 shows the following blending
pattern: (i) 70% long- and 30% medium-term funds for new projects in all
regions of Turkey, (ii) 88% long- and 12% medium-term resources for new
projects in Eastern Anatolia, and (iii) 22% long- and 78% medium-term funds
for expansion projects, whose cash generation usually builds up faster.  On
the average the blending pattern showed a breakdown of 59% long- and 41%
medium-term funds.
6.04      Domestic Resources.  From mid-1974 to mid-1976, the share of Govern-
ment funding dropped from one-half of TSKB's domestic resources to one third.
During this period, TSKB floated bonds of TL 50 million in 1974 and TL 200
million in 1975, and increased the paid-up share capital in the first half of
1976 by TL 87.1 million. Nevertheless, total resources mobilized during 1975
and 1976 fell short of forecast levels (Annex 11). Due to the ceiling on the
lending rate (14%) and the high cost of floating lira bonds (over 18%), TSKB
could tap the domestic bond market only at a negative spread of 4.3% 2/.  In
1975 and 1976, projects financed by TSKB received parallel financing from
1/   Given LIBOR rates and TSKB's maximum on-lending rates during the past
five years, only once a small negative spread (0.5%) would have occurred
for a short period in mid-1974.
2/   Commercial banks do not face this disadvantage as they can rely on
lower cost deposits (see para 2.09).

Turkish commercial banks of about TL 1 billion, substantially more than ex-
pected; commercial banks were enticed by the high quality of appraisal reports
TSKB could make available to them.
Quality of Portfolio
6.05      Growth of Portfolio.  As of June 30, 1976, TSKB's outstanding loan
portfolio amounted to TL 4,506 million ($276 million equivalent), consisting
of lira loans of TL 618 million and foreign currency loans of TL 3,888 mil-
lion, or 14% and 86% of the total loan portfolio, respectively. The equity
portfolio amounted to TL 299 million. During the period from January 1974 to
June 30, 1976, local currency loans increased by 15%, foreign currency loans
by 82% and equity investments by 91%.
6.06      Loans in Arrears.  Annex 12 shows the arrears situation for the
period January 1973-June 30, 1976. TSKB's principal and interest arrears over
three months as a percentage of portfolio have declined from 2.7% at the end
of 1973 to 1.8% at the end of June 1976, while the outstanding amount of prin-
cipal affected by arrears remained at 9.9%. Actual losses incurred by TSKB
have been negligible. In 1974-76, only one loan amounting to TL 100,000 was
written off. During the same period, 12 loans were re-scheduled, involving a
total amount of TL 55.7 million. In 1975, TSKB changed its policy on provi-
sions. At the end of each year, the provisions will be increased to a level
corresponding to 1% of the loans to projects in operation and 1-1/2% of the
loans to projects under construction. TSKB will continue its practice of
reviewing thoroughly the portfolio and making additional provisions for
doubtful loans. Provisions for possible losses on loans amounted to TL 51.2
million on June 30, 1976, compared with TL 22.2 million on December 31, 1974.
Under the new policy, as in the past, the provisions would be more than
adequate to cover possible losses.
6.07      Equity Investments.  In spite of TSKB's heavy emphasis on invest-
ments in the LDR's, which comprise a large fraction of its total equity place-
ments, the overall record of such equity investments is relatively good, con-
sidering normal business risks and the usual difficulties faced in the LDR's.
Of the 53 companies in which TSKB has made equity investments as of June 30,
1976, 12 were operating profitably, 28 were under construction, 10 were operat-
ing at a loss and 3 were in the process of liquidation (Annex 13). Provisions,
amounting to TL 3.2 million, are adequate to cover possible losses. TSKB's
yield on its dividend-earning investments was 21.5%, while the overall yield
on the entire equity portfolio was 16.4%. This yield is acceptable, given the
large proportion of projects in the implementation stage. The average market
value of TSKB's equity portfolio as of June 30, 1976 amounted to 172% of book
value. With the fast expansion of TSKB's equity investments in the LDRs, the
rotation of its equity holdings has slowed down, thereby reducing its reinvest-
ment capability and impact on the development of the capital market.

first six months of 1976 are shown in Annexes 14 and 15.



- 15 -
6.09      Income Statements - Profitability.  Since 1974, the growth of TSKB's
net profit (after tax and provisions) has slowed down, mainly because of the
negative interest spread on resources raised in the domestic bond market (para
6.04). Net profit as a percentage of average net worth dropped from 20.7%
in 1973 to 17.2% in 1975. Earnings in the first half of 1976 were at the 1975
level. As a percentage of average total assets, administrative expenses in-
creased from 1.4% in 1973 to 1.6% in 1975, reflecting TSKB's intensified
development efforts. TSKB's dividend rate remained at 15% with the pay-out
ratio hovering around 40% in 1974 and 1975. The dividend yield on TSKB's
shares was 11% in 1975 compared with 10% in 1974. This is still low but of
no real consequence to TSKB's ability to broaden its equity base.
6.10      Balance Sheets - Financial Position.  The growth of TSKB's total
assets slowed down to 13.5% in 1974 due to longer draw-down periods for both
foreign currency and lira operations; but it picked up again subsequently.
The rate of increase exceeded 25% in 1975 and the first half of 1976 (on an
annual basis). As of June 30, 1976, TSKB's total assets were TL 5.5 billion
($337 million equivalent), comprising: loan portfolio 81%, equity portfolio
5% and liquid funds 7%. There is room for improving TSKB's management of
liquid funds, even though the floating of its bond issues cannot be completely
timed with the draw-down of funds by its borrowers. TSKB's long-term borrow-
ings and bond guarantees as of June 30, 1976, amounted to 8.8 times net worth.
The debt/equity ratio, as defined in the last Loan Agreement with the Bank,
was 5.5:1 at June 30, 1976, against the maximum limit of 6:1 (para 7.16).
VII. PROSPECTS
The Environment
7.01      Prospects for continued high economic growth remain good.  The
Fourth Plan (1978-82) reportedly will be ready in late 1977. The Plan is
expected to continue emphasizing rapid modernization and industrialization
within a system of mixed economy. Domestic resource mobilization and ex-
ternal resource availability are likely to be the main constraining factors.
Industrial growth however, would continue to provide a major impetus to the
growth of the economy. Manufacturing investment in the private sector, which
during 1971-75 grew at an impressive annual average of 17% in real terms,
would continue to rise at about the same rate.
Projected Operations
7.02      A summary of projected operations for the period 1977-81 is pre-
sented in Annex 16. Over this period, the growth rate of TSKB's foreign
exchange and lira commitments is expected to average 17% a year in current
prices, which is conservative compared to the 30% growth attained during
1972-76. The forecast expansion of operations is also likely to be less than
the expected growth cf manufacturing investment in the private sector (para
7.01), implying that TSKB's share in financing Turkish industry would drop



- 16 -
below the current 10% and reflecting the gradual development of more diversi-
fied sources of finance in Turkey. TSKB's concentration in the LDRs, possible
competition from DESIYAB (para 2.13) and commercial banks (para 2.09), and
limited resource availability will be major constraining factors in maintain-
ing the high growth in TSKB's operations attained in the past.
7.03      Pattern of Operations.  TSKB will continue its policy of assisting
in the development of the LDRs; its regional development program is outlined
in paras. 8.02 and 8.03. In addition, TSKB will expand its program of pro-
moting SMLI projects (paras 8.04-8.06). As to the sectoral distribution of
future operations TSKB's project pipeline and promotional work suggest that
textiles, food, chemicals and metal products will continue to be the largest
sub-sectors benefitting from its financing. The proportion of TSKB's loans
and equity investments in the financial structure of individual sub-projects
is likely to follow the pattern experienced in the past.
7.04      Foreign Exchange.  Foreign exchange commitments over 1977-81 are
forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 20%. For the period
1/77-6/79 projected foreign exchange commitments total US$334 million. TSKB
is already processing a pipeline of 70 projects, requiring foreign exchange
financing of some $90 million. In addition, TSKB's current research and pro-
motion program includes another 23 projects with a foreign exchange require-
ment of about $30 million. This outlook at the beginning of 1977 indicates
that TSKB's commitment projections are likely to be met, if not exceeded over
the period 1977-79.
7.05      The maturity profile of TSKB's foreign exchange loans is shown in
Annex 8, page 4. Most loans have maturities of nine to ten years, including
a grace period of about two years. This pattern is expected to continue.
With the increased reliance on medium-term resources raised in the inter-
national capital market (para 7.08), TSKB will have to continue in the
1977-79 period to blend such funds with long-term resources from IBRD, KfW,
EIB and other sources.
7.06      Domestic Currency.  TSKB's projected growth of domestic currency
operations, averaging 12% per annum over the period 1977-81, is conservative.
For the period 1/77-6/79, commitments for lira loans and investments are
expected to total TL 952 million and TL 565 million respectively. TSKB will
exceed the projected magnitude of lira operations if it succeeds in obtain-
ing new Government funding (para 7.12). As in the past two years TSKB's
operations will finance about three times more foreign exchange than lira
expenditures. But beyond 1978, projected lira commitments begin to decline
in relation to foreign exchange loans, and by 1981, the ratio becomes 1:4,
reflecting TSKB's limited possibilities in raising domestic resources under
the present interest rate structure (para 6.04). As in the past, local
currency loans will have a term of mostly 5-7 years, in line with the maturi-
ties of lira resources raised through the issue of bonds. The relatively
short term of lira loans does not cause any liquidity problems to TSKB's
clients, because longer term investments in domestic currency are financed
predominantly with the sponsors' own funds and the balance by commercial banks
in the form of revolving medium-term credits.

TSKB's Resource Mobilization Plan
7.07      To finance forecast operations (on commitment basis) in 1977, 1978
and the first half of 1979, TSKB will need about $334 million in foreign
exchange and TL 1.5 billion in local currency. Taking into account the un-
committed foreign exchange and lira balances at the end of 1976 and self-
generated funds, TSKB will have to raise $277 1/ million foreign exchange and
TL 766 million during the period from various sources. The resource mobiliza-
tion targets appear realistic, assuming no major adverse developments in the
country's economic situation (para 8.08).
7.08      Foreign Exchange.  As of the end of 1976, the uncommitted balance
of TSKB's foreign exchange resources amounted to $57 million, of which about
one-fourth had a 5-year maturity. These resources are expected to be fully
committed by mid-1977. During the first half of 1977 and the following two-
year period when the proposed Bank loan is to be committed, TSKB's total
needs for fresh foreign exchange resources would amount to $277 million. IFC
proposes a loan of $50 million to TSKB out of which $10 million would be for
IFC's own account and the balance is intended to be placed with participants.
This transaction is expected to be completed some time in mid-1977. KfW has
made a loan of about $13 million in January 1977 and is expected to make
further loans of $25 million before mid-1979. Negotiations for a $10 million
export credit line from the French Government were concluded in April 1977. 2/
An EIB loan of $18 million is expected in the first half of 1979. The pro-
posed Bank loan of $74 million is expected to meet approximately one-fourth
of TSKB's total needs for fresh foreign exchange resources during the period
under consideration. The remaining requirements, after accounting for the
resources detailed above, total close to $90 million; they will have to be
raised by TSKB in the international capital market, including export credits
and Arab sources without IFC's assistance. The bulk of these funds are
expected to have a term of only six years or less, including grace period.
Annex 21 summarizes TSKB's expected long-term and medium-term resources as
well as projected commitments for the period January 1977 to June 1979. Annex
22 shows that the average blending requirements are for 50% long-term and 50%
medium-term funds.
7.09      The resource mobilization plan outlined above will require major
efforts by TSKB to tap foreign exchange sources on its own. To explore the
resource mobilization opportunities in the Arab World, TSKB representatives
visited 21 institutions in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1976 and are
expected to visit Kuwait again in late May, 1977. These visits served to
establish first contacts with Arab lenders. TSKB plans to follow up with a
resource mobilization campaign in the very near future and encouraging con-
tacts have already been made with the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank and the Kuwait
1/   This accounts for an uncommitted balance at the beginning of the period
of $57 million.
2/   In addition, TSKB is in the process of negotiating a $8 million co-
financing arrangement with ECGD/Barclays Bank.



- 18 -
Fund.  TSKB is likely to continue to face difficulties, such as:  (i) the re-
quirement of a Government guarantee for repayment, which most national donor
agencies and investment institutions in the Middle East insist upon; (ii) the
likelihood that the Government itself will borrow heavily in the international
capital markets to finance the foreign exchange requirements of a larger number
of state projects during the next Five-Year Plan (1978-82); and (iii) pre-
emption of the market through the convertible lira deposit scheme which pro-
vides foreign investors with attractive yields for short-term deposits (para
2.12). Nevertheless, there appear to be good chances for TSKB to raise some
of the required resources in the Middle East. An understanding was reached
during negotiations that TSKB would make its best efforts to raise in the
international capital markets prior to June 30, 1978, at least $50 million
at terms sufficiently long to allow relending without blending with long-term
aid funds. Assuming that this target will be met, TSKB would have mobilized
the equivalent of $240 million over the period 1977 - mid-1979, or about 80%
of their total estimated needs - a reasonable target given the relative un-
certainty of projections.
7.10      Domestic Currency.  The uncommitted balance of local funds avail-
able as of the end of 1976 was TL 210 million. In 1977 and 1978 and the first
half of 1979, TSKB plans share capital increases totalling TL 310 million and
sell TL 131 million of equity. investments. It will also need to float bonds
amounting to TL 325 million to fill the resource gap in local currency in 1977
and 1978. An understanding was reached with TSKB that it will increase its
share capital and tap the domestic bond market to the extent indicated. The
remaining lira requirements will be met through TSKB's internal cash genera-
tion.
7.11      To maintain a balanced financial structure, TSKB will continue to
issue bonds in increasing amounts after 1978 and to raise its share capital.
It also intends to make use of the Central Bank's rediscount facilities as
soon as possible. By 1979, TSKB could expect to raise TL 100-150 million a
year from this source. Under this scheme limited to TSKB's lira lending, the
last five maturities of its non-repeater sub-loans are eligible for redis-
counting at 13%. TSKB is building up a stock of projects for approval by the
Central Bank, to serve as a standby facility. In late 1976, an amount of TL
33 million was eligible for rediscounting. An understanding was reached with
TSKB that it will make use of the Central Bank's rediscount facilities as soon
as the amounts, eligible for rediscount, have become large enough to warrant
their investment. Amounts to be received from the Central Bank would be in
addition to the lira resources projected to be mobilized during 1977 and
1978.
7.12      During past years, TSKB had asked the Government to make TL funds
available to it out of long-term EIB, KfW and USAID loans repaid by the
original beneficiaries to the Turkish Government but not yet due for repay-
ment to these institutions. No agreement could be reached on such local
counterpart funds, because the Turkish Government insisted that TSKB assume
the foreign exchange risk. However, with the Government's recent decision to
assume the foreign exchange risk on the principal of foreign borrowings, a
major obstacle in tapping revolving foreign aid funds has been removed. TSKB
has approached the Government again, and if encouraged, will follow up with a
formal application. TSKB's management of the recently established Investment



- 19 -
Finance Corporation (para 2.10) should help provide local currency in the
form of equity to many TSKB projects, as investment opportunities in the LDRs
are almost exclusively identified by TSKB. Finally, no significant change is
expected in the co-financing pattern with commercial banks which presently
supplement TSKB's lira funding at an average ratio of about 2 (commercial
banks): 1 (TSKB). 1/
Projected Financial Situation
7.13      Projected Profitability.  Annex 17 shows TSKB's projected income
statements for 1976-81. Assumptions for the projections are listed in
Annex 20. TSKB's profits after tax and provisions are expected to rise
from TL 114.1 million in 1976 to TL 196.7 million (or by 72%) in 1979 and TL
267.7 million (or by 36%) in 1981. However, the rate of return on average net
worth is projected to decline from 20.6% in 1976 to 18% in 1979 and to 16.1%
in 1981. This reflects the expected decline of TSKB's overall spread from
about 4% in 1976 to 3.5% in 1977 and to about 2.5% in 1981 due to the increas-
ing share of higher cost market funds in TSKB's resources (para 7.14). The
declining profitability, though undesirable, is no cause for concern because
TSKB's financial position still remains satisfactory (the interest coverage
would be 1.2 in 1981). Administrative expenses as a percentage of average
total assets are expected to remain at about 1.6% toward the end of the
projection period, still allowing for required staff increases. The dividend
pay-out ratio will range between 47% and 61%. This is higher than the his-
torical rate of about 40% because of the increase in the dividend payment
from 15% to 18% starting in 1977. The upward adjustment of the dividend
rate should facilitate TSKB's efforts to raise equity capital.
7.14      Impact of Euro-currency Borrowings on TSKB's Profitability.  About
half of the foreign borrowings during the period 1977-1979 are expected to
come from commercial sources, which are likely to carry a floating interest
rate. With the prospect of raising an increasing proportion of resources
in the Euro-currency market, TSKB's profitability is becoming more sensitive
to major variations of the LIBOR rate than in the past. Though the current
LIBOR rate is low, the projections shown in Annex 17 have assumed, as the best
available estimate for the period covered, effective costs of Euro-currency
borrowings of 10.5% for the IFC syndication and 13% for additional borrowings
from the international capital markets, subject to withholding tax. Thus, if
borrowing costs remain below these levels, profitability will improve. If,
however, a major upsurge of the total effective cost were to take place, it is
clear, following a sensitivity analysis, that TSKB's spread may fall substan-
tially below 2.5% towards the end of the projection period. It is felt,
however, that, if such a situation were to happen, Turkish authorities would
have to take the international financial situation into account in determining
the maximum lending rate for TSKB and other banks, thus enabling them to
maintain a sufficient interest spread.
1/   None of the potential resources discussed in para. 7.12 has been included
in TSKB's projections, as they cannot be quantified.



- 20 -
7.15      Financial Position.  TSKB's projected balance sheets for 1976-81
are given in Annex 18. TSKB's total assets would increase from TL 6.1 billion
at the end of 1976 to TL 17.0 billion at the end of 1981. TSKB's total port-
folio is projected to increase from TL 5.2 billion in 1976 (85% of total
assets) to TL 15.5 billion in 1981 (91% of total assets). Long-term debt will
grow from TL 5.1 billion in 1976 to TL 14.2 billion in 1981. Reserves and
provisions for possible losses are projected to grow rapidly, from TL 377
million at the end of 1976 to TL 967 million at the end of 1981. Provisions,
ranging from 6.3% to 6.9% of TSKB's outstanding portfolio and guarantees, are
adequate.
7.16      Debt/Equity Ratio.  TSKB's debt/equity ratio, as defined in the
last Loan Agreement, reached the maximum limit of 6:1 at the end of 1976.
Even accounting for continued infusions of share capital, 1/ the ever in-
creasing volume of lending in keeping with development aims necessitates
an increase of the maximum debt TSBK can contract. On the occasion of IFC's
last loan syndication to TSKB in Spring 1976, IFC and the participants agreed
to a debt/equity limit of 8.5:1, using the Bank definition of debt and equity.
Given the maturity of the institution and the soundness of its portfolio,
this limit should allow TSKB to maintain its commercial creditworthiness in
spite of the increasing share of debt carrying floating interest rates (para
7.14), while giving it sufficient leeway to extend its borrowing base, as
needed. An increase of its debt limit as defined in the last Loan Agreement,
from 6:1 to 8.5:1 is therefore justified and recommended.
7.17      Projected cash flow statements for the second half of 1976 and the
period 1977-81 are presented in Annex 19. The debt service coverage will
decline slightly over the next five years, from 1.26 in 1977 to 1.16 in 1981,
due to increasing repayment of the subordinated loan which the Government
granted to TSKB in 1968. Similarly, the interest coverage is forecast to
show a slight decline, from 1.26 in 1977 to 1.17 in 1981, as a result of
TSKB's reduced spread. Both ratios remain satisfactory.
VIII. OBJECTIVES, JUSTIFICATION AND FEATURES OF PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Objectives and Justification
8.01      The objectives of the proposed loan aim at encouraging TSKB:  (i)
to continue and maintain its regional development efforts emphasizing resource
1/   After the recent share capital increase has been fully paid up by the
end of 1977, TSKB plans further increases of another 150% to TL 1,064
million by 1981.

allocation to the LDRs; (ii) to substantially increase the amount and propor-
tion of its lending to small- to medium-sized labor-intensive industries; 1/
(iii) to further reinforce its role in the non-financial aspects of development
banking (technical assistance services) and (iv) to increase and diversify its
resource mobilization at home and abroad (in this endeavor TSKB's main objec-
tive is to mobilize foreign exchange resources of sufficient long-term nature
to blend them with medium-term market funds and thus to become more independent
from non-commercial lenders). As TSKB consented to these objectives during
negotiations, the proposed loan is adequately justified.
8.02      Regional Development.  Despite the difficulties and heavy burden on
its staff, TSKB is determined to continue its promotional drive in the LDRs
with the same vigor as in the past two years. To this end, it is considering
strengthening the existing branch offices or opening new ones. SPO is cur-
rently revising its excessively intricate 1974 classification of regions
according to stage of development. The results of this exercise will not be
available before 1978. For the proposed loan, a simplified classification and
regional allocation formula is suggested. It sets out targets for TSKB's
total operations in Eastern Anatolia and Central Anatolia (with the exception
of a few developed provinces in the latter) and establishes a ceiling on
operations in the eight most developed provinces, located mainly in Western
Anatolia (Annex 23). The following table indicates targets for the allocation
of TSKB's total resources 2/ during 1977 and 1978 among regions and provinces.
It also shows TSKB's allocation of resources on approval basis since 1973:
1/   This employment creation feature is not designed to meet urban poverty
(UPP) or small scale industry (SSI) criteria, because TSKB is not the
appropriate institution in Turkey to use for such purposes. However,
we expect that an ex post analysis of the impact of the proposed loan
will show that TSKB will have financed a number of sub-projects which
in fact do meet the UPP and SSI criteria as applied to Turkey, and
that this loan will have helped meet the need for TSKB to focus more
on smaller and less capital intensive operations.
2/   Because TSKB has to blend its long-term resources with medium-term
market funds to allow sub-loans adequate maturities, it is safe to
assume that the regional allocation of the proceeds from the pro-
posed loan will follow more or less the pattern of total resource
allocation.

/1   The categories A, B and C are described in Annex 23.
8.03      During negotiations an understanding was reached with TSKB on the
above regional targets. Clearly the most important objective is to ensure
that TSKB will continue to provide maximum assistance to the less developed
areas. Directing at least 40% of its total resources to this area, TSKB will
maintain its developmental role in this respect. This is indeed an ambitious
goal which will call on further and very substantial efforts from TSKB to
promote, appraise and assist projects in the LDRs. The ceiling on investments
in the most developed provinces, on the other hand, acknowledges that TSKB
should carefully limit its assistance to these advanced provinces so as to
maintain its role in LDRs and the rest of Turkey. Demand in the eight most
developed provinces for TSKB's long-term financing is expected to exceed its
resources by far. This should enable TSKB to continue to give priority to
particularly deserving investments.
8.04      Small- to Medium-Sized Labor-Intensive Projects (SMLI).   An indus-
trial sector mission mounted by the Bank in mid-1976 focussed on the needs
and potential for the development of labor-intensive industry. In assessing
TSKB's role in financing industrial enterprises at the lower end of the size
scale 1/ it concluded that TSKB should identify, promote and finance industrial
enterprises in the intermediate range of 10-100 workers, employing labor-
intensive technology. TSKB's preliminary research suggests that such activi-
ties can be found mostly in Turkey's sub-contracting sector, linked to the
automotive, electrical equipment, durable consumer goods and capital goods
(machinery) industries. TSKB is currently studying the technical assistance
needs of smaller sized, labor-intensive industrial enterprises through field
surveys.
1/   The findings of the industrial sector mission are incorporated in the
Bank report "Export-Oriented Industries and Small-Scale Industries in
Turkey", March 24, 1977 (Yellow Cover).



- 23 -
8.05      Because of the lack of sufficient market data, it is difficult at
this stage to quantify the potential for TSKB's SMLI business during the next
two years. However, in order to cause TSKB to direct its full attention to
seeking SMLI business, an understanding was reached with TSKB that it would
double the average 1975-1976 level of foreign exchange and TL approvals of
SMLI projects. The following table shows TSKB's SMLI market for 1977 and
1978, assuming that it would be able to double its assistance of the target
group in 1977 and 1978:
SMLI Target Group
Definition
Fixed assets per project (in 1975 prices)          below $2.3 million
Cost per job (in 1975 prices)                      below $17,000
1977/78 SMLI financing (approvals)                         Market
Foreign exchange operations                            $30 million
TL operations                                          TL 500 million
SMLI financing as % of total operations                      20%
8.06      The market target includes both foreign exchange and TL operations.
Because of the necessity to blend long-term Bank and KfW funds (the latter
being earmarked for the financing of medium-sized projects defined as having
total fixed assets under $5 million), with shorter-term funds raised in the
international capital market, only part of the foreign exchange requirements
of SMLI projects can be financed with the proceeds from the proposed Bank
loan. Taking these factors into account, an allocation of $15 million of the
proposed Bank loan is an appropriate amount to earmark for SMLI projects. The
target for local funds is TL 500 million.
8.07      Technical Assistance.  Through the proposed loan the Bank will
encourage TSKB to further reinforce its non-financial assistance to client
firms (para 3.01) as well as Government planning agencies (para 3.06). The
need for TSKB's promotional support in fields like project identification,
technical and management advice, secondment of interim executives to client
firms and research on industrial and financial policy issues will grow in
line with its assumption of wider developmental responsibilities under the
proposed loan. Part of the costs of research, this implies, will be financed
under the proposed loan through replenishment of a promotional fund, estab-
lished under an earlier loan (Annex 6, page 8). The fund finances consulting
services contracted by TSKB in fields requiring specific expertise. In the
past two years TSKB's Research Department has completed 20 industrial sub-
sector studies. The 1977 program includes the following sub-sectors: elec-
trical equipment, prefaVricated construction elements, construction m4terials
other than cement, iron and steel, die casting, packaging materials and labor-
intensive sub-contracting in various fields.



- 24 -
8.08      Resource Mobilization.  For lira mobilization, an understanding was
reached during negotiations that (i) during 1977 and 1978 TSKB will float
bonds totalling TL 325 million (para 7.10), (ii) it will raise its share
capital by June 30, 1979 by an aggregate amount of TL 310 million (para 7.10),
and (iii) it will make use of the Central Bank's rediscount facilities as soon
as practicable (para 7.11). As regards foreign exchange, TSKB's entry into
the international capital markets continues to be a prime objective. However,
the question as to whether TSKB will succeed fully in its endeavors depends to
some extent on circumstances beyond its control (para 6.02). Nevertheless,
the Bank feels that TSKB's standing, in spite of difficulties, is sufficient
to bring it in closer relationship with international lenders. In recent
months TSKB made every effort to obtain a loan from the Libyan Arab Foreign
Bank operating in Turkey through the recently established Arab-Turkish Bank,
and to tap the Kuwaiti market. It is expected that these attempts will bear
fruit in the second half of 1977. An understanding was reached with TSKB that
by June 30, 1978 it will raise at least $50 million of longer term funds in
the international capital markets, including the Eurocurrency Market (para
7.10).
Features
8.09      Projects to be financed under the proposed loan would have the
following loan features and project criteria.
8.10      Bank Funds to Finance SMLI Operations.  Out of the proceeds of the
loan, an amount of $15 million will be reserved to finance SMLI projects with
maximum fixed assets and cost per job ratios of $2.3 million and $17,000,
respectively (paras 8.05 and 8.06).
8.11      Economic Rates of Return (ERR).  TSKB will compute the ERR for proj-
ects with total fixed assets above $2 million. The ERR of projects financed
by TSKB shall normally be at least 15%. For projects whose ERR falls in the
range of 10%-15% a special justification is required. TSKB will inform the
Bank of such cases.
8.12      Amortization Schedule.  As with the majority of Bank loans to DFCs,
the proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule, which would
conform substantially to the aggregate amortization schedules of the sub-loans
made by TSKB to its borrowers. In order to allow TSKB to blend long-term with
medium-term funds at the sub-project level, the terms of the proposed loan
to TSKB would provide for a grace period of up to 4.5 years with a maximum
repayment period (including grace) of 15 years.
8.13      Free Limit.  TSKB's continued good record of operations justifies
a free limit of $3 million. This would permit the Bank to review about 12-15
projects over the two year commitment period of the loan. In addition, TSKB
will periodically report on its performance in meeting the objectives of the
proposed loan; TSKB will specifically submit individual and aggregate data
on SMLI sub-projects.



- 25 -
8.14      Replenishment of Special Promotional Fund.  This Fund, established
under a prior Bank loan, has enabled TSKB to finance its promotional work,
which is vital for the support of the LDRs. It will be replenished by
allocating a portion of the gross spread under the proposed loan (1 percent-
age point). A projection of commitments for promotional expenditures and
of revenues accruing to this Fund is presented in Annex 6 (page 8).
8.15      Since its creation, in 1973, the Special Promotion Fund has been
a major instrument to allow TSKB to strengthen its development program espe-
cially in the promotion and assistance of projects in less developed regions.
As shown in Annex 6, TSKB has applied the resources of the Fund to the study
of a wide sample of sub-sectors. Thanks to the studies and research so fi-
nanced, TSKB has been able to identify investment opportunities in LDRs
which are now receiving TSKB's financial and technical assistance. Given
on one hand the Bank's position that TSKB's spread should be limited to 2.5%
p.a. on Bank funds and, on the other hand, TSKB's needs to undertake a major
economic and promotional effort as the necessary condition to build up its
lending program in LDRs and now to increase its impact on SMLI, the continua-
tion of the Special Promotion Fund under the proposed loan appears fully
justified. As in the past, TSKB will continue to inform the Bank of the
detailed use it intends to make of this facility.
8.16      Spread on Bank Loan.  The net spread of 2.5% currently in effect
under the existing loan will also apply to the proposed loan. The balance
between the gross spread, (5.8%) and the 2.5% net spread to TSKB, augmented
by the allocation of a portion of the gross spread to finance promotional
expenditures (1 percentage point) (para 8.14), will be paid to the Government
as guarantee fee (2.3 percentage points). 1/
8.17      Provision to Finance Promotion Expenditures in Foreign Exchange.
Out of the proceeds of the proposed loan an amount of $500,000 would be made
available to TSKB in the form of a sub-loan to finance foreign exchange ex-
penditures related to its research and promotion program. Such a facility
would enable TSKB to speed up its payments to foreign consultants on whose
services it will rely to an increasing extent in the preparation of the
planned studies on labor-intensive industrial technology and export markets.
The balance of the Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of sub-
projects.
IX. THE PROPOSED IFC LOAN
9.01      In addition to its equity investment in TSKB (presently 6% of
subscribed capital), IFC has assisted TSKB in the past with three loans,
totaling $60 million, out of which $45 million was placed with partici-
pants. With the present syndication IFC seeks to introduce TSKB to a wider
I/   This fee is related to the Government's repayment guarantee for the
proposed loan. Fees payable to the Government for the assumption
of the foreign exchange risk have to be borne by TSKB's sub-borrowers
(para 2.15).



- 26 -
circle of foreign financial institutions to encourage greater independence
for TSKB in its future fund raising efforts. It is proposed that IFC make
a loan of $50 million to TSKB, of which $10 million would be for IFC's
own account and the balance be placed with participants. The interest rate
on the loan portion for IFC's own account ("A" Loan) would be 10-1/4% per
annum and the interest rate for the participants' portion ("B" Loan) would
be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for 6 months' deposits
plus a margin. The "A" Loan would be repaid in about 9 years and the "B"
Loan in about 5 years including grace periods.
9.02      IFC's strategy of raising a substantial amount of loan funds through
participation of private banks ties in with one of the three main objectives
of the IBRD loan, which is to increase and diversify TSKB's resource mobiliza-
tion in the capital markets at home and abroad. Whereas TSKB should be able
to raise on its own loans from other official lenders, export agencies and
some specific Middle Eastern sources, it needs in its present stage IFC's
assistance in approaching the Eurodollar markets for substantial amounts.
9.03      Contacts with major international banks and other sources have con-
firmed that special efforts will have to be made to place an amount of $40
million with such institutions at the present time. These banks are generally
reluctant to increase their Turkish exposure in view of the country's economic
situation, and the amounts raised in the past by Turkey in the foreign capital
markets. TSKB itself, however, is considered by them as a high quality bor-
rower. An international bank (Citibank/Citicorp International Bank Ltd.)
has been asked by TSKB in close consultation with IFC to assist in finding
participants in the IFC loan on a floating rate basis. The major involvement
of an important international bank, such as Citibank, appears to be essential
in finding and attracting co-participants for raising $40 million in the
international capital markets. It enables IFC to extend its own marketing
abilities by utilizing the extensive resources and contacts of a private
financial institution. It will also help TSKB to strengthen its relations
with the international capital market, and thereby prepare TSKB for the time
when it will have to borrow on its own strength in the market.
9.04      Citibank, which holds a $10 million participation in the third IFC
loan to TSKB, has over a long time shown a strong interest in establishing
close relationships with TSKB. At present, Citibank is in the process of
forming a syndicate of banks which together with Citibank would subscribe $30
million in the "B" Loan and, market conditions permitting, preferably $40
million. IFC's "A" Loan, which in any event would be limited to $10 million,
is subject to raising an amount of at least $30 million through participations.
The terms of the "B" Loan will be finalized as the syndication progresses. At
the moment banks are not willing to lend at a longer term than five years to
Turkish private borrowers. The interest rate of the "B" Loan is expected to
be about 2% above LIBOR and the front-end (participation) fee at about 1-1/2%
of the amount of the "B" Loan which, in total, is in line with the cost of
funds provided under the convertible lira deposit scheme. Turkey has recently
revised the interest rate for convertible lira deposits and permits its com-
mercial banks now to pay 2-1/4% above LIBOR for 5-year deposits.

X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During negotiations the following agreements and understandings
were reached on major issues:
(a) Of its total resources, TSKB will allocate in 1977 and 1978
(i) at least 40% to the LDRs, and (ii) not more than 25% to
the eight most developed provinces, and (iii) the balance to
the remaining semi-developed regions (paras 8.02-8.03).
(b) TSKB will allocate for lending to, or investments, in SMLI
projects in 1977 and 1978 at least (i) $30 million equivalent
in foreign exchange (including Bank funds totalling at least
$15 million) and (ii) TL 500 million in domestic currency
(paras 8.05-8.06 and 8.10).
(c) By June 30, 1978, TSKB will raise in the international capital
markets at least $50 million equivalent of sufficient long-
term to allow relending such resources without blending them
with long-term aid funds (para 8.08).
(d) TSKB will mobilize domestic resources of at least: (i) TL 325
million through the issue of bonds by December 31, 1978 and
(ii) TL 310 million through the increase of its paid-in share
capital by June 30, 1979. In addition TSKB will make use of
the Central Bank's rediscount facilities, when practicable
(para 8.08).
10.02     In addition, during negotiations the Bank and TSKB agreed on the
following features of the proposed loan:
(e) Minimum economic rate of return of TSKB-financed sub-projects
(para 8.11).
(f) Amortization schedule for the proposed loan (para 8.12).
(g) Free limit (para 8.13).
(h) Spread on the proposed loan (para 8.16).
(i) Replenishment of the Special Promotion Fund (para 8.14).
(j) Provision to finance promotion expenditures in foreign
exchange (para 8.17).
(k) Increase of TSKB's debt/equity ratio from 6:1 to 8.5:1 (para 7.16).



- 28 -
10.03     In view of the above agreements and understandings, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of $74 million to TSKB under the aforementioned terms
and conditions.
10.04     The project is also suitable for IFC to make a loan of $50 million
to TSKB under terms and conditions outlined in Chapter IX.

Incentives to Industry and Investment Legislation
A.  Incentives to InAustry
1. Exemption From Customs Duties:
According to GoverrimeDt Decree 6/12585, dated October 28, 1969.
investments which satisfy the conditions given below are exempted from all cus-
toms duties. The conditions are:
- The investment should enable the production of goods which
would be competitive in world markets.
- The investment should be set up with a capacity comparable
to capacities in developed countries.
- The investment should introduce new production technology.
2. Customs Tax Deferment:
The taxes that are deferred are the customs tax, production tax on
imports, municipality share on customs and quay duty. Stamp duty is not deferred.
According to the 1976 General Promotion Table, the taxes are paid in minimum 3,
maximum 5 yearly installments varying according to the sector. If a sector is
eligible for both customs duty exemption and customs tax deferment the final
choice would be made by the Ministry of Industry and Technology.
3. Income and Corporation Tax Allowance on Investments:
The basic rebate is equal to 30% of the equity capital. It increases
to 40% for agricultural projects and 50% for investments in underdeveloped areas
listed in the Annual Program of the Development Plan. (According to the Income
and Corporation Tax Laws, accrued income and corporation taxes are not paid in
the first 5 years of the company's operations until the total accrued tax amount
reaches 30%-50%--according to the type of operation--of the equity capital.)
4. Medium-Term Investment Loan and Interest Subsidy:
According to (overment Decree 7/5822, dated March 1, 1973, the
commercial banks will extend from their own resources medium-term loans for the
duration of 5 years, at an interest rate of 14%. In this case borrowers in
priority sectors are eligible for a Government interest subsidy at a rate of 6%
from the Selective Credit Fund. The rate of interest subsidy for projects in
underdeveloped areas is 7%.
The banks may apply to the Central Bank for discount. For export-
oriented investment projects, ship-building and ship-yeard projects, the maximum
rate of interest is 10.5%, if the credit is extended from Central Bank resources.
In this case the interest subsidy is 4.5% in general, and 5.5% for projects in
underdeveloped areas.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
5. Private Foreign Credit:
In the 1975 Annual Program authorization of private foreign credit is
listed as an incentive in the General Promotion Table.
According to Decree 7/5399, published in The Official Gazette, dated
January 3, 1974, the Ministry of Finance will authorize private foreign credit.
Only the sectors which are listed in the Annual Program are permitted to benefit
from this incentive. The minimum term is 2 years and the rate of interest may
not be more than 2-/l above the interest rate applicable in the Euro-Market at
the time the credit is secured.
According to a memorandum of the Ministrv of Finance, published_
in The Official Gazette, dated May 5, 1976, industrialists will be exempted from
the foreign exchange risk on the principal amount of the private foreign credit,
provided that they pay to a Special Fund of the Central Bank 1% flat and 1% per
annum on the outstanding balance.
6. Exemption from Construction Tax:
According to Article 67 of the Law No. 1318, published in The Official
Gazette of August 10, 1970, the construction tax does not apply to the construc-
tion of industrial plants. This is a general incentive; it is therefore not
listed as an incentive in the General Promotion Table.
B. Investment Legislation
1. Laws
In addition to the Constitution and general laws of the country, such as
the Commercial Code, Tax Laws, Banking Laws and the Code of Obligations, the follow-
ing basic laws are applicable to IFC investments in Turkey:
(a) Foreign Investment Encouragement Law No. 6224 (administered by the
Ministry of Commerce).
(b)  Decree No. 17 regarding the protection of the value of Turkish
currency (administered by the Ministry of Finance).
2. Approval and Registration
Each foreign investment in the form of equity must receive the prior
approval of the State Planning Organization, followed by a decree of the Council
of Ministers issued under Law No. 6224.
Each foreign investment in the form of a loan requires the prior
approval of the Ministry of Finance to the terms and conditions of the loan,
under the provisions of Decree No. 17.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
3. Conditions for Eligibility
To be considered by the State Planning Organization and the Council
of Ministers an application under Law No. 6224 must be in respect of an invest-
ment which will:
(a) tend to promote the economic development of the country;
(b) operate in a field of activity open to Turkish private
enterprise; and
(c) entail no monopoly or special privilege.
In order to give its approval to a foreign loan, the Ministry of Finance
will take into consideration all the terms and conditions of the loan, including
its rate of interest and duration, the field of activities of the borrower and the
effects of the loan on the promotion of the economic development of the country.
4. Repatriation
Provided that the requisite approval has been obtained for an equity
investment under Law No. 6224, or for an investment by way of loan under Decree
No. 17, the Ministry of Finance is authorized to provide a transfer guarantee for
the repatriation of principal, interest and commitment charges on loans.

TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
Statement of Policies and Governing Principles
To achieve the objectives set forth in its statutes, TSKB has
adopted certain policy resolutions which have been amended several times
since 1950, and most recently in April 1977. The main elements of TSKB's
statements of policy and additional governing principles are as follows:
Economic and Social Criteria
The projects supported by TSKB should benefit the Turkish economy
with special emphasis placed on: (a) attainment of the production targets
of Turkish Development Plans; (b) contribution to the competitiveness and
export targets of Turkish industry; (c) positive influence on the balance of
payments; (d) improvement of productivity and product quality; (e) balanced
regional distribution of investments; (g) improved income distribution.
Criteria for Project Development and Allocation of Resources
TSKB will provide extensive services, ranging from basic research
and project identification to promotion of and assistance in implementation
of projects. TSKB shall also assist in arranging co-financing. To qualify
for TSKB's financial assistance sponsoring enterprises and their projects
have to be financially sound. TSKB will operate within the following con-
straints to limit the risk: (a) not more than 15% of TSKB's equity and
quasi-equity (subordinated Government loan) may be committed to any single
project; (b) not more than 5% of TSKB's equity and quasi-equity may be
committed to any equity investment; (c) not more than 25% of the subscribed
capital of any given company may be purchased by TSKB (if TSKB acts as an
underwriter, the limit is'raised to 50%); (d) total equity investments may
not exceed TSKB's paid-in share capital and reserves.
Regional Allocation Criteria and Promotion of Smaller,
Labor-Intensive Projects
With a policy resolution, adopted by TSKB's Board in April 1977,
TSKB (a) updated its regional development policy and set allocational
targets for 1977 and 1978, (b) committed itself to a policy of assisting
smaller, labor-intensive projects including the setting of financial targets
for the same period, (c) reinforced its commitment to research and project
promotion, and (d) assigned a high priority to the promotion of Turkish
export industries. The targets set under (a) and (b) are described in the
appraisal report in paras 8.02-8.03 and 8.05-8.06, respectively.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Additional Governing Principles
Additional directives in use are the following: (a) TSKB's maximum
financial assistance to any single project does not exceed 45% of its finan-
cial requirements; (b) the minimum amount for any single loan is US$50,000
in foreign exchange and TL 200,000 in local currency; (c) TSKB's foreign
exchange risk is always borne by the borrower (or recently the Government),
never by TSKB; (d) the term of foreign exchange loans varies between seven
and thirteen years, including two to three years grace period, with concentra-
tion on loans with a maturity of nine to ten years including grace period.
Local currency loans usually have a term of five to seven years including two
years grace period with concentration on loans with a maturity of seven years
including two years grace period; (e) TSKB does not relend for longer maturi-
ties than it borrows, and when necessary on project grounds, blends medium-
term with long-term funds (implying two or more amortization schedules per
project).

Special Promotion Fund
Background
Under Loan 873-TU, the Bank had agreed that TSKB would use 25% of the
gross spread on that loan (about 1.2 percentage points) to finance project
promotion expenditures.  Since the Fund was first put to use in 1974, such
expenditures have risen sharply. For 1977 promotion expenditures are expected
to reach a level of about TL 10 1/ million, the subsequent increase being about
15% annually in current prices. As the Promotion Fund financed under this
arrangement will be depleted in the near future, it will be replenished through
allocation of 1 percentage point of the gross spread of the proposed loan. Below
the projected promotion expenditures are compared with expected revenues under
the previous and proposed arrangements:

1982           2.8         12.0           14.8           20.1               (2.6)
1983           1.8         11.2           13.0           23.1              (12.7)
1984           1.0          9.9           10.9           26.6              (28.4)

Conclusion
Based solely on revenue accruing to the Special Promotion Fund under
the provision related to Loan 873-TU, a deficit will build up after 1978. The
proposed replenishment of the Fund, equivalent to 1 percentage point of the gross
spread on tile new loan will extend the availability of promotional funos until
1982. The continued expansion of TSKB's promotional role in areas as regional
development, assistance to smaller, labor-intensive projects and export promotion
justify   the proposed additional funding of promotional expenditures.
1/ TSKB's sector study program for 1977. shown in Annex 6, pages 1-3, would account
for about two-thirds of the projected promotional expenditures,and project
related promotion for the balance.

Summary of Discussion of Characteristics of Operations 1/
1.        Sectoral Distribution.  TSKB's lending operations on approval basis
during the past three and a half years (1973-June 1976) have been well diver-
sified. Textiles, food, chemicals and metal products continued to be the
largest beneficiaries of TSKB's financing. Compared with the previous four
years, TSKB's lending to textile firms has decreased from 34% to 23%, while
involvement in chemicals dropped from 14% to 18%. On the other hand, finan-
cing of the food processing sector has doubled, reaching 16%, and that of
metal products remained unchanged at 7%. Financing of electrical machinery,
non-metallic minerals and cement has increasd substantially, each accounting
for more than 5% of the TSKB's total loans during the period. Eighteen other
industrial categories each received less than 5% of TSKB's total financing.
2.        Size of Loans.   The average size of TSKB's loans has increased from
TL 12 million in 1973 to TL 19 million in the first six months of 1976. In
1973, 18% of TSKB's loans were below TL 5 million; this ratio decreased to 4%
in the first six months of 1976 as a result of inflation, and advanced tech-
nology of assisted projects. Piecemeal financing for replacing worn-out parts
or smaller machinery and equipment has been reduced to minimum because of
Government foreign exchange allocations for such procurement.
3.        Loan Maturities.  Local currency loans made in 1975 and 1976 have a
term of no more than seven years, including grace period. Almost all foreign
currency loans have maturities of eight to eleven years. Since TSKB has been
able to obtain some medium-term foreign currency loans from the international
markets, it has used the proceeds of the last Bank loan (1078-TU) to blend
with such market funds. For this purpose the Bank has agreed on an extension
of the grace period of up to five years, thus enabling sub-borrowers to ser-
vice medium-term debt first. The mechanics and implications of blending
resources of different maturities are discussed in Annex 22.
4.        New Versus Expansion Projects.  As a result of TSKB's new regional
development policy, the portion of TSKB's resources allocated to new companies
has increased sharply from about 10% in 1973 to an average of 56% in 1975 and
the first ten months of 1976.
1/   The geographical distribution of TSKB's loans and investments is
discussed in paras 3.01 to 3.02 of the report and further detailed
in Annex 8 Table 1.

Labor Intensity of TSKB-Financed Projects
1.        In connection with the proposed loan, TSKB undertook an in-depth
empirical study of the correlation between project size and labor-intensity
based on: (i) projects financed since 1973 and (ii) projects already in
operation (financed for the most part before 1973). The conclusions are
summarized below:
2.        Fixed assets of projects financed by TSKB ranged from about
$500,000 to $50 million. Due to the prevalence of medium sized projects
and occasionally of very large projects, the average project size was large,
$3.8 million and $4.4 million in 1975 and 1976, respectively. The relation-
ship between size and employment was analyzed 1/ through regression analysis.
No clear correlation between these two variables was found. This was con-
firmed by subjecting the relevant data on projects in operation to the same
test. Labor intensity varied significantly between and within industrial
subsectors. Smaller sized projects were sometimes rather capital intensive
and large projects labor intensive (e.g. assembly operations). On the aver-
age, projects approved by TSKB in 1975 1/ and those included in the sample
survey of ongoing projects showed investment cost per job ratios in the
$20,000-$23,000 range (1975 prices).
3.        A different pattern emerged, when the projects analyzed were classi-
fied in wider size categories: projects with fixed assets of less than TL 35
million ($2.3 million equivalent) had only about half the average cost per
job than larger projects (though a few projects did not conform to this pat-
tern). These findings suggested that in the context of Turkish modern indus-
try, small- to medium sized labor-intensive industrial projects (SMLI) could
be defined as those with maximum fixed assets per project of $2.3 million
(TL 35 million equivalent) and maximum cost per job ratios of $17,000. TSKB's
past financing of SMLI projects is discussed in the report.
1/   Only new projects were included in this analysis because the employment
effect of modernization or replacement investments is low and would
lead to statistical distortions.

Performance Under Last Bank Loan and Recommendations of
Operations Evaluation Department
I. Performance Under Last Bank Loan
In connection with the last Loan (1078-TU), an informal understanding
was reached with TSKB that over the period 1975 and 1976 it would (i) intensify
its assistance to the LDRs and (ii) step up its efforts to raise resources at
home and abroad. The respective targets and TSKB's performance are summarized
below:
T A R G E T                       P E R F O R M A N C E
(1975 and 1976)                       (1975 and 1976)
1. Assistance to LDRs
Allocation of at least 50% of
total resources to LDRs. 1/              53%          58%
Allocation of at least 50% of                           70%
the Bank loan to LDRs. 11                       (cumulative as of 9/15/76)
2. Foreign Exchange Resource Mobilization
Raising of $125 million from               $50 million under IFC
non-traditional sources.                    arrangements.
3. Domestic Resource Mobilization
Raising of TL 660 million                  TL 483 million through:
through bond issues and
share capital increase.                   (a)  bond issues of TL 100
million in 1975 2/
and TL 190 million in
1976 and
(b) share capital increase of
TL 193 million 3/.
Co-financing with commercial
banks totalling TL 440 million.           About TL 1 billion in the
period of Jan. 1975 to
Sept. 15, 1976
TSKB lived up to expectations in assisting the LDRs. However, it raised
only 40% of the funds to be secured from the international capital markets. As
regards domestic currency resources, it raised about three-fourth of the amount
to be provided through floating of bonds and increase of the share capital, but
substantially exceeded the co-financing target. The difficulties encountered
by TSKB in raising resources abroad and domestically are described in paras
6.02 and 6.04 of the report.
1/ As defined by the State Planning Organization.
2/ Excluding a bond issue of TL 100 million in 1975 relating to earlier commitments
under a previous Bank loan.
3/  The subscribed sharp capital increase is TL 193.3 million exclusive of stock
dividends of TT, 38.6 million.  Thereof an amount of TL 135.4 million has
been paid in as of December 31, 1976.



ANNEX 11

II. Recommendations of Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
1.        OED's most recent project performance audit report on TSKB, dated
February 11, 1977, reviews TSKB's performance under Loans 713-TU and 873-TU
and covers the period early 1971 to mid-1975. Specific objectives were set
for TSKB primarily under the latter Bank loan. They included institutional
efforts in the area of promotional work to assist projects in the LDRs and
diversification of sources of funds. The report concludes that on the whole
TSKB has made sincere efforts to reach these objectives and has achieved
considerable progress, particularly in developing project promotion capabili-
ties. Two topics given particular emphasis in the project performance audit
report were: (i) the Bank's successful efforts in enhancing TSKB's promotional
role by earmarking a part of the spread on Loan 873-TU for the financing of
promotional expenditures; and (ii) the difficulties TSKB has been facing in
raising resources through the floating of bonds in the domestic market.
2.        Promotion Fund.  During negotiations of the proposed loan to TSKB the
need for a replenishment of the Promotion Fund was examined in depth. A medium-term
projection of commitments for promotional expenditures and of revenues accruing to
this Fund under Loan 873-TU justifies the recommended earmarking of 1 percentage
point of the gross spread of the proposed loan for the financing of promotional
expenditures (see Annex 6, page 8). If the Promotion Fund were not replenished
under the new loan, a deficit would occur after 1978, increasing rapidly in
subsequent years as a result of diminishing revenues (in line with repayments of
Loan 873-TU) and increasing promotional expenditures. The proposed replenishment
of 1 percentage point of the gross spread on the proposed loan would postpone the
depletion of the Promotion Fund until 1982.
3.        Domestic Resource Mobilization.  Interest rates in Turkey are controlled
by the Government. The maximum interest rate TSKB can charge to its borrowers--
14% at present--permits an adequate margin to TSKB on its foreign currency loan
operations. As has been mentioned in the appraisal report (para 6.04), the 14%
ceiling on the lending rate is, however, lower than TSKB's cost of raising lira
resources through the floating of bonds. Mobilizing large amounts of domestic
resources at a loss will depress TSKB's overall profitability at a time when it
is vigorously trying to tap the international capital market, which presupposes
reasonable profit expectations to support TSKB's credit worthiness. On the other
hand, restricting domestic resource mobilization to a level where the negative
spread involved does not have too severe an impact on its overall profitability,
will not allow TSKB to supplement its foreign exchange loans with adequate domestic
currency financing.
4.        The Bank has been having a dialogue with the Government on the structure
of interest rates in Turkey, in relation to both TSKB's situation and the whole
financial sector. In 1976 the Government appointed a committee to examine the
financial sector and it is hoped that as a result of on-going studies Turkey's
interest rate structure will be rationalized.

Typical Blending Example
1.   Approach and Assumptions
In blending medium-term foreign exchange funds with long-term for-
eign exchange funds, TSKB always takes into full consideration the ability
of its sub-borrowers to generate cash for servicing their loans. Normally,
expansion projects and projects located in more industrialized regions can
tolerate a higher share of medium-term funds than n ew projects and projects
located in less developed areas. Since the terms and conditions of TSKB's
foreign exchange sub-loans have to be completely matched with the maturities
of TSKB's borrowings, separate amortization schedules for funds of different
durations have to be used for each sub-loan. In general, by adjusting the
ratio of medium-term to long-term funds, TSKB can tailor a project's debt
burden to its expected cash flow.
Medium-term funds raised by TSKB in the international capital
market are repayable according to the level principal payment (LPP) method,
whereas long-term funds from aid sources are based on the level total pay-
ment (LTP) method. The same respective methods have to be used in working
out the repayment schedules for sub-loans. The example below reflects a
blending of 50% long-term and 50% medium-term funds. Long-term funds would
be repaid in 10 years including a grace period of 5 years, while short-term
funds have a term of 6 years including a grace period of 2 years. TSKB's
new resources to be raised in the next several years would have such maturity
patterns.
2.   Conclusion
The hypothetical debt service of a sub-loan would be as shown below,
assuming the sub-borrower will receive 100 units of medium-term funds and 100
units of long-term funds. It is clear that the burden of servicing the loan
will be very heavy during years 3 to 6. This is the period usually when the
company is only approaching normal capacity utilization. A higher component
of medium-term funds in the sub-loan would prove to be too heavy a burden for
the sub-borrower to bear. Therefore, on the average, TSKB would need at
least 50% long-term funds to mix with its medium-term funds, so as to work
out repayment schedules for sub-loans which are realistic and adequate for
its sub-borrowers.

TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
Classification of Developed Versus Less Developed Regions
Under Proposed Loan
1.        With the official SPO classification being revised and a new one
not being available before 1978 TSKB, supported by SPO, has suggested to
update and simplify the present obsolete and overly intricate SPO classifica-
tion for the purpose of the proposed loan.
2.        The following classification, which meets the Bank's concurrence,
allows--in broad terms--a comparison with the present SPO classification.
As can be seen from the map of Turkey in the Annex, most less developed areas
are in Eastern Anatolia and part of Central Anatolia (excluding Ankara, Adana
and Icel). There are some underdeveloped areas also in the West, and vice
versa, some provinces considered developed in Central and Eastern Anatolia,
but roughly speaking, the indicated classification further detailed below,
appears to be a close proxy to the SPO definition:
A.   Most-Developed Provinces
1.   Istanbul Province, North West Anatolia
2.   Sakarya Province, North  West Anatolia
3.   Kocaeli Province, North  West Anatolia
4.   Bursa Province, N orth  West Anatolia
5.   Izmir Province, South West Anatolia
6.   Adana Province, Central Anatolia
7.   Ankara Province, Central Anatolia
8.   Icel Province, Central Anatolia
B.   Less Developed Areas
1.   Central Anatolia excluding Adana, Ankara and
Icel Provinces
2.   Entire Eastern Anatolia Region
C.   Semi-Developed Areas
Residual areas, mostly in Western and Central Anatolia
