VUELTA GRANDE GAS RECYCLING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Government of Bolivia and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos (YPFB), the national oil company, have requeated an IDA credit of
US$15.0 million to heip finance the Vuelta Grande Gas Recycling Project. The
Project fits into the strategy developed under the Gas and Oil Engineering
Project (Credit S-25-BO) and would increase Bolivia's production and exports
of hydrocarbons.
1.2      The proposed project would help develop the Vuelta Grande gas con-
densate field which would supply about one quarter of Bolivia's requirements
of petroleum products. In April 1986 depressed prices of US$10 per barrel of
crude oil, peak production of Vuelta Grande would be valued at about US$35
million per year. Under the proposed project, YPFB would acquire technology
to develop other gas condensate fields in Bolivia.
I I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overall Energy Position
Resources
2.1      Bolivia is a net energy exporter and relative to its needs has a
large energy resource base. Proven natural gas reserves in 1985 were about
4.1 trillion cubic feet (TCF), equivalent to over 40 years of production at
the present level. Prover reserves of liquid hydrocarbons (crude oil and con-
densates) are limited by comparison, amounting to about 154 million barrels,
equivalent to about 17 years of present production. Ultimate reserves are
likely to be significantly larger, particularly for natural gas, since nearly
half of the national territory has hydrocarbon potential but is only partially
explored. Bolivia has abundant hydroelectric potential of which 287 MW have
been developed.  Reserves of coal and peat are small and their use is limited
to localized residential consumption. Fuelwood resources are considerable
with forests covering about half of the country, but mainly in the scarcely
populated tropical lowlands. There are indications of geothermal resources in
the western and central Cordilleras (although rather distant from consumption
centers) and the first three exploration wells are to he drilled with
assistance from Italy and UNDP. There is limited potential for solar energy
in the Altiplano and wind energy in the Chaco, virtually unutilized at
present.



Production and Consumption
2.2      In 1984 net primary energy production reached 4.4 million tons of oil
equivalent (toe), of which natural gas accounted for 48.2%, crude oil and
condensate for 24.7, fuelwood for 20.7%, hydropower for 4.1% and agricultural
wastes (bagasse) for 2.3%. Gross power generation amounted to 1,646 GWh,
72.3% from hydro and 27.7% from thermal. 82% of the net output of natural gas
was exported to Argentina. Energy consumption is low at 0.4 toe per capita
per annum (Argentina 1.8, Brazil 0.95, Peru 0.6); end-use breakdown is as
follows: residential, commercial and government 53.9%, transport 26.5%,
mining and manufacturing 19.6%.
Government Institutions
2.3      The Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons (Ministerio de Energia e
Hidrocarburos, MEH) is the Government institution respolsible for the energy
sector. MEH supervises the natioral oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) and the private operators (paras. 2.10) as well as
the power utilities, i.e. the Government-owned Empresa Nacional de
Electricidad (ENDE) and the private Bolivian Power Company. MEH also is
responsible for renewable energy (except for wood and charcoal which are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture) and for energy planning.
Electricity tariffs and petroleum product prices are decided upon by MEH,
normally after consultation in Cabinet.
Energy Assessment
2.4      The Bank carried out an energy assessment of Bolivia in 1982/83
(Report 4213-BO "Bolivia: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector", April
1983). The energy assessment recommended:
gi) efforts to identify new markets for Bolivia's natural gas;
(ii) action to address the fuelwootd shortage in the Altiplano;
(iii)  measures to avert the threat of an oil deficit including projects to
increase supply through development of already discovered condensate
fields and enhanced oil recovery, and investments to substitute gas
for oil;
(iv)  postponement of hydropower projects in favor of gas turbines;
(v) energy demand management measures, including increasing petroleum
product prices to international levels and adjusting power tariffs to
allow ENDE to earn the 9% rate of return required in the Electricity
Code;
(vi)  review of petroleum sector policy, including Hydrocarbons Law, to
attract more private sector participation;
(vii)  reversing the loss of YPFB's professional staff through review of
corporate and personnel policies, including a reform of the salary
structure; and
(viii)  strengthening the capability of Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons
to formulate energy policies and coordinate sector activities.
Despite the qerious economic, social and political problems which have
disrupted Government management over the past few years, the Bolivian



- 3 -
authorities have taken steps to address the issues outlined above. Iden-
tification of new gas markets, development of recently discovered condensate
fields and enhanced oil recovery have been top priorities of YPFB and the
Government. No new hydropower projects have been started and Government has
begun to consider measures to address the fuelwood shortage. The new admin-
istration took steps in September 1985 to bring energy prices to levels
encouraging both production and conservation, and more recently asked for Bank
assistance to review the contractual and legal framework for private sector
activities. The Association is assisting Government under financing obtained
from UNDP in the reorganization and streamlining of YPFB and in the review of
petroleum legislation. Under the proposed project, YPFB would carry out a
study to review personnel policies and its salary structure as a basis for
cutting losses of skilled staff. Finally, MEH established an initial planning
group to set up an energy planning department within MEH with assistance from
the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADh; and the European Community (EC)
and is committed to develop a national energy plan by the end of 1.986.
B.       Hydrocarbon Sector
Overview
2.5      Boli-ia's largest energy resource - natural gas - faces limited
domestic and foreign demand. Oil resources, on the other hand, are modest and
production has been declining since 1973, as new discoveries have not kept
pace with depletion. As a result, as domestic domand increased, petroleum
exports declined rapidly and came to a halt in 1983. Under these
circumstances, the Government's objectives have been to increase exploration
for and production of oil by such measures as attracting private oil companies
who have partly compensated for the decline of YPFB's production. The
Government has further been searching for new foreign markets for Bolivia' s
gas, particularly since the present gas export agreement with Argentina is
scheduled to terminate in 1992, and for additional domestic uses of gas by
substituting for petroleum fuels that could be exported. The main potential
market for Bolivia's gas is Brazil. With Brazil's cooperation, basic
engineering design has been completed in 1982 fcr a possible gas pipeline from
Bolivia's Santa Cruz region to the large market in Brazil's Sao Paulo region,
but no decision has been taken to proceed further as Brazil is still studying
how to develop this market and how to best supply it, i.e. from domestic gas
fields, Bolivia or Argentina. The Government also has been promoting energy
conservation through recent pricing measures.
Hydrocarbon Exploration
2.6      Bolivia covers about one million km2 of which 41% are sedimentary
basins. Although three of these basins have the pre-requisites for petroleum
generation -- the Beni, the Santa Cruz-Chaco basin, and the Altiplano -- oil
or gas have so far been found only in the Santa Cruz-Chaco basin. Petroleum
exploration in Bolivia started in 1918, carried out mostly by large inter-
national companies, and led to the first discovery in 1927 in Camiri. A total
of 336 exploration wells were drilled in Bolivia through 1984 with a discovery
rate per exploration well of 1.3 million barrels of oil and condensate and
17.2 billion cubic feet of gas (176 wells were drilled from 1969 to 1985;
para. 3.1).



- 4 -
2.7      YPPB made in March 1982 the first oil discoveries in many years; one
in Humberto Suarez and another in Yapacani. In 1983, YPFB discovered a small
oil field close to Santa Cruz and in 1985 drilled an oil discovery well in the
Cascabel prospect which remains to be appraised. These recent discoveries
offer favorable prospects for additional oil production over the next 3-5
years of tne order of about several thousand barrels daily (BD) but in the
long term, unless new fields are fouind, they will only slow down the decline
in liquids production resulting from the fact that many of Bolivia's fields
are past their peak. To stimulate exploration, Government, with Bank Group
assistance, is reviewing the le al framework for private sector activities and
intends to soon promote areas for exploration by private sector companies.
The Bank Group is also assisting YPFB to establish the feasibility of
promoting development of recent discoveries. This would be financed under a
PPF approved in March 1986 (para. 2.33). Estimated reserves and production
projections are given for oil in Annex 1 and for gas in Annex 2.  Bolivia's
oil and gas fields are shown on Map IBRD No 14429R4.   A total of 130,326 in2
have been contracted for exploration, 66% to YPFB and the rest to private
sector companies.
Production
2.8      Background.  Bolivia is more gas than oil-prone, and the largest
liquids producer is a gas condensate field. The sector developed rapidly in
the 1960s and oil and condensate output continued to rise until it peaked in
1973 at 47,400 BD and declined steadily to 25,500 SD by 1985 as a result of
the depletion of the various fields and because no new fields came on stream
due to a lack of investments reflecting the impact of the foreign exchange
shortage. The 1985 production of 25,500 BD includes 4,000 BD of LPG from gas
production. Oil exports, which reached 32,500 BD in 1973, were reduced to
spot sales of naphtha and gasoline in 1980 and ceased altogether soon there-
after. The 1985 price adjustments (para 2.23) caused a small liquids surplus,
which is exported. The decline in oil production highlights the need to
increase efforts in exploration and development, which requires a larger role
for the private sector. At present, about 75% of the total liquids are
produced from condensate, mostly by stripping gas of its liquid content at the
surface. The dry gas is then sold or reinjected to maintain reservoir
pressure and for storage for future sale when a market is developed. Gross
gas production in 1985 reached 450 MMCFD and about 165 MMCFD was reinjected.
In 1985, YPFB accounted for about 72% of Bolivia's oil (Annex 1) and 65% of
its gas (Annex 2).
2.9      Hydrocarbon Law and Private Sector Role.  In order to encourage
petroleum exploration to offset the continuous decrease in reserves, the
Government is reviewing the 1972 petroleum law and the contractual framework
for oil operations to attract foreign oil companies to provide risk investment
in association with YPFB. At Government request, the Association is assisting
in this review. The law sets the principle of State sovereignty over
petroleum resources and assigns all direct responsibilities to YPFB which may
enter into operation contracts with private oil companies to carry out
exploration and production activities. Contracts are of the production
sharing type and may not exceed 30 years, including up to 7 years
exploration. The contractor receives in case of discovery 40% to 50% of



- 5 -
production, and is guaranteed the right to retain foreign income from sales of
hydrocarbons and to convert local income into foreign currency. However, MEH
authorizes exports of hydrocarbons only after internal demand has been
satisfied. Taxes are paid by YPFB. The price paid to the private sector by
YPFB is pegged to the Government Selling Price of Arab Light crude, the most
widely used benchmark for oil .rade.  Since early 1986, the private companies
have been selling their share of produced liquids on the world market at
prevailing international prices, after recent pricing measures led to a small
oil surplus which is exported (paras. 2.22-2.26). For gas, the private
contractors are paid the same price as YPFB, i.e. UTS$3.70 per MCF, less a
transportation charge to YABOG, depending on the distance from the field to
the border. This gas price of US$3.70/MCF is equivalent to about US$20 per
barrel of fuel oil which is above April 1986 world market prices, reflecting
the fact that export prices are negotiated for one-year periods and that
payment is partly in countertrade.
2.10     Besides YPFB, .wo private groups presently produce oil in Bolivia and
a third is exploring: Occidental Petroleum Corporation (US) and/the Tesoro
Bolivia Group (consisting of Tesoro Bolivia, Canadian Superior - and Zapata
Exploration) sell all their oil and gas output to YPFB. Shell acquired an
exploration permit in 1982 and is exploring the Beni basin. Recently, Shell
has applied co the Government to relinquish 50% of their present acreage which
is about one million acres, and to acquire certain other areas in the Beni
region. The share of the private sector in Bolivia's gas and oil sales has
been growing between 1979 to 1985 from 11% to 28% for crude oil and from 25%
to 35% for natural gas (para. 2.19).
2.11     In 1978 YPFB agreed with the private operators that they would supply
86.5 MMCFD of the total 220 MMCFD of gas exported to Argentina as an incentive
for the private operators to bring on stream the gas fields of Tita and La
Vertiente, which produce large volumes of gas along with the liquids.
Following interruption of payments for gas delivered to Argentina in 1982 and
subsequent foreign exchange shortages in both countries, Bolivia began in turn
to fall behind in its payments for 1982 and 1983 gas deliveries (para. 2.16)
from Tesoro and Occidental. Bolivia made some payments to the oil companies,
and in order to further reduce the government's arrears to them, permitted
them to export condensate and to purchase oil field equipment from Argentina
under the bilateral countertrade agreement for compensationi of Bolivia's gas
exports to Argentina. Tesoro and Occidental continued to produce and meet
commitments for exports and the domestic market. In December 1985, Government
agreed with the private operators on a schedule of payments including payments
in kind to amortize the overdues for gas received which at one point had
reached a peak of about US$100 million. Talks are being scheduled between the
private sector and the Government to review progress in implementing this
agreement. Tesoro is considering the development of several prospects in the
Chaco with financial assistance from IFC. Several other international oil
companies recently have expressed interest in becoming active in Bolivia.
Because a more active private sector would be important for Bolivia to sustain
I/ Acquired in 1985 by Mobil Oil Corporation.



exploration and development in the hydrocarbon sector, assurances were
obtained that the annual consultations between Government and the Association
on YPFB's investment program (para. 3.23) would also focus on measures to
promote private sector activity in exploration and development (Section 3.05,
Draft Project Agreement). The Government has accepted to modify legislation
to include joint ventures in development operations. This would be an added
incentive for companies to be involved in exploration. Key to increased
private sector interest in Bolivia have been first, the positive open-door
policy of Government towards the private sector, and second, the re-appearance
of a liquids surplus which is exported by the private companies.
Domestic Demand
2.12     Domestic demand for petroleum products in 1985 was about 23,600 BD.
Demand grew during 1974-78 at an average 11% p.a., but at only 3.5% p.a. in
1979-80 and has stagnated since then, even declining somewhat in 1984 and
1985. On'"- LPG demand continues to grow, substituting for kerosene in the
process.     petroleum products consumption, gasoline now accounts for 34%;
diesel n    LPG 22Z: fuel oil 8%; kerosene 8%; and jet fuel 7%.
2.13     Projected increases in domestic petroleum consumption would largely
depend on the strength of the economic recovery in Bolivia following several
years of severe recession. Since there are major uncertainties as to when a
recovery will take place and how strong it will be, it is presently anti-
cipated that a modest recovery might begin in 1987 at a rate of 3% and that
the income elasticity of demand for petroleum products would decrease from the
2.0 recorded in the 1970's to 1.5 as a result of moving domestic petroleum
prices to international levels and the stronger incentives to encourage energy
conservation. The Government's pricing policy has already reduced unautho-
rized exports of hydrocarbons thereby cutting apparent demand in 1986 below
1985 levels (para 2.24). Finally, increasing supply of natural gas and
improved infrastructure for its transportation (para 2.14) should help bring
about the substitution of a total of about 2,000 BD of petroleum products by
1990. Under these assumptions, projected domestic demand for petroleum
products by around 1990 would be about 23,000 BD (excluding gas), reflecting
increased substitution of gas for petroleum products.
2.14     Domestic consumption of natural gas is still small despite recently
high relative growth rates (para. 2.19) and in 1985 was about 30 MMCFD (not
including YPFB's internal consumption), but the scheduled completion of the
IDB financed gas pipeline from Santa Cruz to Oruro and La Paz in 1987 will
open new markets and stimulate industrial consumption of natural gas and
replace industrial petroleum fuels, mainly diesel and fuel oil. Gross gas
production is largely determined by the required liquids output and excess gas
is then reinjected (Annex 2).
Hydrocarbon Exports and Imports
2.15     The composition of hydrocarbon exports has sh.ifted in the past ten
years from crude oil to natural gas. Exports of crude oil stopped in 1980 and
of gas?Oine and naphtha (mainly to Brazil and Chile) stopped in early
1983. -   Exports to Argentina in 1985 accounted for 99% of Bolivia's hydro-



-7-
carbon export sales revenues and for about 60% of Bolivia's total exports.
Petroleum product imports are small, consisting mainly of lubrizants and
aviation gasoline. Bolivia, moreover, lacks adequate infrastructure for the
expanded imports, which in the absence of this project, would become necessary
(para. 2.21).
2.16     Gas exports flow to the Argentine border in a gas pipeline financed
with a 1971 Bank loan (635-BO) and complementary credits under an "enclave
project" arrangement. Gas del Estado of Argentina established a Lenders Trust
and a trust account bearing the proceeds of the gas export sales. The
proceeds were first partly applied to the compensation for the nationalization
of the former Gulf Oil Company fields in July 1979 (para. 3.1). After this
compensation was completed, the proceeds were mainly used for debt service on
the Bank and related loans and operational requirements of YPFB's gas pipeline
company (YABOG) and its Santa Cruz Division. The pipeline project was
completed ahead of schedule and below initial cost estimates. Bolivia began
exporting 150 MMCFD of natural gas to Argentina in 1972 under a 20-year take-
or-pay contract and has been operating without incident. The volume was
increased in 1980 to 220 MMCFD. Gas export revenues exceed original
expectations and export prices increased from US$0.28/MCF in 1972 to
US$4.23/MCF in 1985. Due to the fall of petroleum prices in early 1986, the
gas export price was reduced in May 1986 to US$3.70/MCF. The Lenders Trust
Agreement worked well for 10 years until 1982 when Argentina developed severe
foreign exchange problems and Gas del Estado began to fall behind on its
payments for Bolivian gas, although interest and principal payments for debt
service to the Trust Fund were always met. In 1984, the Governments of
Bolivia and Argentina agreed to settle the arrears for the 1982 and 1983 gas
deliveries during 1984 through payments both in cash and in kind and
simultaneously to reduce Bolivia's arrears to Argentina on the latter's past
trade and other Government credits. Argentina's arrears for gas delivered in
1982-84 were fully settled by early 1985.
2.17     YPFB's plans include the aforemetitioned construction of a gas pipe-
line to Brazil with a final capacity of 400 MMCFD which could start operations
in the early 1990's. Basic engineering for the pipeline has been completed,
but the two countries have yet to conclude a gas sales agreement and project
implementation arrangements, mainly because Brazil has not yet decided from
which sources to supply the Sao Paulo market (para. 2.5). In addition, the
recent drop in oil prices has affected the economics of the proposed line.
Therefore, the project has not been included in the demand and financial
projections. The Bolivian Government is now attempting to reactivate this
project, however.
2/   Unauthorized product exports continued due to higher prices in
neighboring countries but domestic price adjustments in October 1985 stopped
these product movements and led to the reappearance of a small surplus which
is exported.

2.18     Since 1979 YPFB has exported LPC to Brazil via the Santa Cruz-Corumba
railroad under a long term sales agreement which is 3cheduled to be extended
this year. The sales contract calls for LPG (35% propane, 65% butane)
deliveries of 18,000 metric tons per year (tpy) but Petrobras has purchased
larger quantities, taking at times all the LPG production that YPFB could
export. In 1983, Petrobras imported 37,000 tons of LPG from Bolivia, but
trade has declined since because of decreasing surpluses of LPG in Bolivia.
LPG prices FOB Corumba per ton increased from US$155 in 1976 to US$255 in
October 1985. Petrobras has requested to renegotiate this price because of
the fall in international prices in early 1986. In February 1984, the Covern-
ments of Bolivia and Brazil agreed to increase LPG sales up to 100,000 tpy,
but growing domestic demand in Bolivia and delays in the development of gas
fields are expected to keep exports below that level. However, increases in
exportable surpluses of LPG are expected as a result of the proposed project
and by mid-1987 YPFB would submit proposals to the Association for improving
LPG transport facilities to export additional LPG volumes to Brazil.

2.20     As shown abore, oil production peaked in 1973 and declined there-
after, while domestic sales kept increasing through 1980. As a result,
crude oil exports declined sharply and came to a halt in 1980. For natural
gas, local consumption is still small, despite high relative growth rates.
2.21     The projection for 1990 assumes that much of the projected increase
in demand for hydrocarbons would be met by natural gas following the expan-
sion of the internal gas pipeline system. The supply projection for 1990
reflects the additional production from Vuelta Grande which would help make
Bolivia a net exporter of liquids, as well as the Escondido field (peaking
at 3450 BD in 1990). In addition, it is projected that private sector
production from new fields currently under exploration in the Chaco will
reach 4000 BD by 1992. The projected private sector investments are needed
to prevent Bolivia from becoming a net oil importer by the late 1980s. In
the long term, unless substantial new oil and condensate fields are found
and developed, Bolivia would become a net importer of petroleum products in
the 1990s (Annexes 1 and 2). This possibility has become a major concern of
the Government, which intends to continue to attract private oil companies
into oil exploration and development.
Petroleum Pricing
2.22     Internal petroleum prices declined to uneconomic levels throughout
the early 1980s because of the Government's failure to make sufficiently
often the price adjustments required to keep abreast of soaring inflation.
These prices fell in the case of natural gas and ketisene below production
costs and by the end of 1983 were about US$17.60 for the composite barrel at
the official rate (which was overvalued) and only about US$4.40 at the
parallel rate (or about 14% of international prices). The pricing situation
had become damaging to the Bolivian economy because it encouraged unofficial
exports of petroleum products (estimated in 1984/85 at between 1,000 and
3,000 BD or 4% and 13% of apparent domestic consumption) and discouraged
energy conservation and fuel substitution measures in Bolivia. It also
weakened YPFB's financial position and reduced both the incentive and the
funds available for hydrocarbon exploration which contributed first to a
decline in exploration and then to a fall in reserves and production. All
this accelerated the depletion of a resource that Bolivia needs to ensure in
greater quantities if it is to avoid having to import in the near future.
2.23     During 1984 and early 1985, the Government announced several new
packages of economic measures, including substantial increases in petroleum
product prices, in order to discourage unaathorized exports, and give
appropriate incentives for energy conservation. But high domestic inflation
rates eroded these measures quickly. Only a package of more stern economic
measures by the new administration in September 1985 finally brought rapid
inflation and devaluation under control and established prices in US$ terms
at a level sending appropriate production and conservation signals to
both consumers and producers. The table below shows Bolivian domestic
petroleum prices in recent years:

2.25       Following the increases mentioned earlier and the decline in world
market prices, the weighted average of petroleum product prices in Bolivia is
now well above international prices. This eliminates incentives for unautho-
rized exports to neighboring countries and strengthens efforts in energy

conservation and production. As a result, an exportable surplus has re-
appeared and the private companies export their entire production share from
the fields they operate. Thereby, YPFB and Government have more than met the
main condition of the earlier Vuelta Grande operation, originally considered
in 1981 for Bank lending (para. 4.5), which was to move in steps over a period
of several years until meeting international price levels.
2.26     Pricing Agreements.  The composite barrel is now priced at about
US$36.6. Assurances were obtained that Government will maintain average
petroleum prices at least at international levels in US$ terms. Annual
consultations would be held between the Association, YPFB and the Government
to review relations between Bolivian and international prices (Section 3.05
Draft Credit Agreement).
Economic Impact of the Hydrocarbon Sector
2.27     The hydrocarbon sector is of considerable importance to the overall
economy, contributing about 22% to GDP and generating about 20% of fiscal
(central and local Governments) revenue. Hydrocarbon exports (mainly gas) of
some US$380 million in 1984 provided about 60% of exports of goods and non-
factor services. Its importance in the future will depend on attracting the
private sector to explore for and produce petroleum and on maintaining gas
exports after the expiration of the existing contract in 1992 with Argentina
by expanding the gas market to Brazil. Should plans materialize to implement
the 400 MMCFD gas export pipeline to Brazil (para. 2.17), in the next decade,
it could generate substantial foreign exchange earnings of about $400-500
million p.a. (in early 1986 prices). The petroleum sector is an important
source of budget resources and taxes collected from and through YPFB exceed
the combined total of customs duties and other taxes.
Sectoral Strategy
2.28     Gas Development.  Along with the goal of the Government to increase
natural gas exports, an immediate aim is to increase domestic production of
liquids in order to maintain oil self-sufficiency. It plans to increase the
production of hydrocarbons by giving priority to investments for development
of gas condensate fields and enhanced recovery and oil exploration, with much
greater emphasis on private sector participation.
2.29     Because of the gasiferous nature of Bolivia's reservoirs, any
increase in crude production is likely to be accompanied by a corresponding
increase in the production of natural gas. The identification of new gas
export markets is therefore a major objective of the Government both to
generate foreign exchange and to increase liquids production. This is
particularly important since the export agreement with Argentina is scheduled
to expire in 1992 (para 2.16) which would severely reduce YPFB's and Bolivia's
export revenues. Regional efforts to promote cooperation with neighboring
countries in gas projects have therefore become a top priority of the Govern-
ment and are supported by services financed under the PPF (para. 2.33).
2.30     On the demand side, Government aims at controlling petroleum products
demand growth, by improving pricing policies and launching a program of



- 13 -
substituting LPG and natural gas for kerosene, diesel and fuel oil in energy
intensive industries such as metal smelting and cement production.
2.31     Tesoro/IFC Discussion.  Of the two private oil companies operating
and producing hydrocarbons in Bolivia, Occidental and Tesoro, Tesoro is
currently discussing with the International Finance Corporation the financing
of development projects in several oil/gas fields which have been discovered
recently in their area in the Chaco Boliviano.
2.32     Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC).  As part of an emergency credit
to Bolivia under the Reconstruction Import Credit, YPFB has been assigned
$11 million which would be used to purchase spare parts, equipment (e.g.
pumps, compressors, boosters), and materials (e.g. tubulars, packers) needed
to (i) increase the current production from the various oil fields to allow
YPFB to meet the internal needs for hydrocarbon fuels, while contractors
could export their production; and (ii) ensure continued operation and main-
tenance of pipelines, gas processing plants and refineries. Generally, the
inventoeies of spare parts are below the critical level needed to operate
efficiently and safely. The inability of YPFB to refurbish installed oil-
field equipment or to purchase spare parts would cause an acceleration in the
decline of oil production. Lack of spare parts has forced YPFB to use worn
out parts to service and maintain equipment. The use of non-standard spares
(manufactured in YPFB's own machine shops because of unavailability due to
obsolescence) and the continued use of obsolete equipment are causing high
operational costs and constrain YPFB's capacity to increase output.
2.33     Prospects of Future Oil Production.  In January 1986, the Government
of Bolivia requested a US$500,000 advance under the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) which was approved in March 1986 to help finance consultants
for the preparation of a proposed Hydrocarbon Development and Technical
Assistance Project. This work is expected to provide the basis for policy
dialogue between the Association and national authorities, as well as the
framework for much of our future lending in the sector. The PPF will finance
studies for: (i) investments to increase domestic hydrocarbons production;
(ii) sector strategy; (iii) private investment promotion; (iv) YPFB's
rehabilitation and restructuring; and (v) identification and negotiation of
gas export arrangements. Investments to increase domestic fuel production
would include feasibility studies for development of the Escondido, San Roque,
and Cascabel gas/oil fields. Escondido and San Roque are retrograde gas
condensate fields similar to Vuelta Grande. Depending on the results of the
reservoir engineering studies, they could be considered for future promotion
for joint ventures between YPFB and the private sector, which could be linked
to efforts to strengthen exploration promotion.
Role of the Bank Group
2.34     The Association has long been supporting the Government's efforts in
the energy sector. The Bank Group power sector activities have consisted of
four operations with ENDE (Credits 61-BO, 148-BO, and 433-80, and Loan 1238-
BO) to support its generation and transmission system and one operation
(Credit 62-BO) with Bolivian Power Company. In the petroleum sector, a 1971
loan (635-B0) of US$23.25 million to Compania Yacibol Bogoc Transportadores



- 14 -
(YABOC), 31 a subsidiary of YPFB (para. 3.2), financed the construction of the
530 km gas pipeline from Santa Cruz to the Argentine border (para. 2.16). The
1980 Gas and Oil Engineering Project financed by a US$16 million Credit (S-25-
BO) discovered 1.6 TCF of recoverable gas reserves, implemented secondary oil
recovery in Monteagudo and delineated the Vuelta Grande field which will be
developed under the proposed project.
2.35     The support of the Bank Group under the proposed project is very
important to Bolivia because the country has had no access to the inter-
national capital market since suspension of its standby arrangement with the
IMF in May 1981. Bolivia has been unable since then to interest commercial
banks to finance the highly attractive Vuelta Grande project and without IDA
support P2livia would not be able to carry it out according to the engineering
design. -   An important objective of IDA support under the proposed project
is to help improve Bolivia's balance-of-payments and the country's credit-
worthiness in order to reopen the possibility of commercial lending to
Bolivia, including that for the petroleum sector. Output of the proposed
project would be valued at about 6% of Bolivia's current exports.
2.36     The proposed Project would also help transfer to Bolivia state-of-
the-art technology in gas recycling. The proposed project would finance
YPFB's first turbo expander, which is a modern, highly efficient equipment for
the recovery of gas condensate and LPG and this technology could be applied to
other prospects.
2.37     The dialogue between the Government and the Bank Group has also been
focussing or. important policy issues, in particular pricing, and the
Government has already substantially increased domestic prices to levels now
above international levels. More recently, Government has requested Bank
assistance in reorganizirng YPFB and reviewing the country's petroleum
legislation and contractual framework (para 3.9). The objectives of these
efforts would be to (i) make the sector more efficient and increose
exploration and production and hence fiscal and export revenues; (ii) attract
additional private companies to Bolivia's oil sector; and (iii) consolidate
YPFB's activities by focusing on appropriate areas of activity and spin off
operations like product marketing and distribution to the private sector.
This beginning policy dialogue would be strengthened by the proposed project.
2.38     The Bank Group has been encouraging Bolivia to attract more private
companies to bring know how and risk capital into the petroleum industry. To
help maintain a favorable climate in the sector, the Association assisted in
3/   Of which as of April 30, 1986, US$16.33 million had been repaid and
US$6.92 million were still outstanding. Project Performance Audit Report No.
593 was issued December 3, 1974.
4/   Without IDA support, the looming shortage of petroleum products would
force YPFB probably to implemert the project as best they could using
equipment salvaged from other fields thereby running considerable risks for
the plant and the reservoir, including loss of process guarantee.

1970 in arranging and implementing a compensation agreement between Government
and Gulf, following the latter's nationalization (paras. 2.16, 3.1). Under
the Gas and Oil Engineering Project, Government and YPFB agreed that the
private sector would supply part of the gas to be delivered to Brazil under
the planned pipeline (para. 2.17).  The Bank Group's continued ;nvolvement in
the sector through the proposed project would represent a stabilizing factor
in the relations between Government and the oil companies. The latter support
the proposed Project because it would improve Bolivia's economic position and
increase domestic petroleum supply to the point that the private sector could
continue to export petroleum.
2.39     The Association has also been playing a regional role by encouraging
Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil to increase regional cooperation in hydrocarbons
as it originally did through the Bolivia/Argentina Gas Pipeline Project. More
recently, the Association helped supervise prefeasibility studies and basic
engineering for the Bolivian portion of the planned Santa Cruz-Sao Paulo gas
pipeline (para 2.17). In the longer term, this role of the Association could
become even more important with increasing scope for sizeable gas trade among
the countries of the Southern Cone and the Association is already assisting
Argentina and Brazil in development of the gas sector.

III. THE PROJECT EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Organization and Management
Background and Scope of Activities
3.1      YPFB was incorporated in December 1936 as a state iil company to take
over the nationalized Bolivian assets of Standard Oil of New Jersey, Inc. (now
Exxon). On September 19, 1969, the Bolivian subsidiary of Gulf Oil Cor-
poration was nationalized (Gulf was compensated) and YPFB assumed the admin-
istration of all its assets. YPFB is responsible for hydrocarbon exploration,
production, transportation, pipeline construction and operation, refining and
distribution as well as imports and exports. YPFB has been engaging in
operations contracts with foreign oi± companies. YPFB is experienced in all
phases of the oil industry from exploration to drilling, production and
refining.
3.2      In conjunction with the Gas Pipeline Project financed by the Bank,
IDB and NYSCRF (New York State Common Retirement Fund), YPFB established in
1971 as a department the Santa Cruz Division which operates the ex-Gulf fields
of Colpa, Caranda, Rio Grande, and a fully owned subsidary, YABOG, which
operates the Santa Cruz-Argentina gas pipeline (para. 2.16). In October 1985,
Government decided to reorganize YPFB to (a) make its operations more effi-
cient, (b) limit the scope for Bolivia's national oil company's activities,
(c) expand the role of the private sector in both upstream and downstream
operations, and (d) ultimately increase production of and revenues from
petroleum. At the request of Government, the Association is assisting in this
effort (para 3.9).
Organization and Staffing
3.3      YPFB's Chairman of the Board is the President of the company.  In
addition, the Representative of the Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons, the
Ministries of Planning, Finance, and Defense, YPFB's General Manager, and a
delegate of YPFB's workforce are represented on the Board. All Board members,
except YPFB's labor representative, are appointed by the President of Bolivia.
3.4      The General Manager of YPFB is the chief executive officer.  Below
him is an Assistant General Manager who supervises three departments:
Exploration, Production (production and development in all YPFB fields except
the ex-Gulf properties) and Industrial. (refining and pipelines, except for the
gas pipeline to Argentina). Marketing, Finance, General Services, Materials,
and Contract Negotiations report directly to the General Manager of YPFB, as
well as YPFB's Santa Cruz Division and YABOG.
3.5      As of April 30, 1985, the staff numbered about 8,299 (which was
relatively high for YPFB's production level), of whom 525 were professionals,
including 380 engineers and geologists. As of February 28, 1986, thi.s had
been reduced to 7,640 and the new administration is determined to further
reduce overstaffing in YPFB. YPFB's personnel grew at an average annual rate
of about 10% between 1979 and 1985, but YPFB at the same time lost many of its



- 17 -
most experienced engineers and geologists. Several department heads have been
removed in the last several years for political reasons, while others have
left to work either for private oil companies in Bolivia or in neighboring
countries as devaluations of the Bolivian peso eroded their salaries. In
order to redress the loss of skilled technical staff, it is necessary for YPFB
to maintain salaries of the experienced engineers and geologists at levels
competitive with those offered for these specialists within and outside
Bolivia. It is also required that political interference in YPFB's personnel
management be reduced to strengthen its character as a commercial corpo-
ration. Therefore, a study to devise measures to achieve staff policy
improvements would be carried out and completed by December 31, 1986; the
study's recommendations would be discussed with the Association and the
Government would submit a plan of action by March 31, 1987 (Section 3.04,
Draft Project Agreenent) to implement measures by June 30, 1987 to stop the
continuing drain from YPFB of experienced engineers and geologists and to
increase efficiency and effectiveness at management and professional levels.
Accounting, Auditing and Insurance
3.6      YPFB's budgeting and accounting system is adequate and complies with
standard industry practices. YPFB has a computerized system to monitor income
and expenditures in each of its main profit and cost centers. The accounts
and material coding systems are good and the accounting and materials depart-
ment staff make good use of these systems. YPFB's decentralized units, YABOG
and the Santa Cruz Division, maintain separate accounting and control depart-
ments. Their accounting procedures were inherited from Gulf and are effi-
cient. YABOG and Santa Cruz Division submit monthly financial reports to
YPFB's headquarters and their yearly budgets are approved by their Executive
Committee which is composed of the manager of the unit, the head of YPFB
Planning Department, and the YPFB General Manager.
3.7      YPFB's Internal Audit Unit is composed of 22 protessionals and
reports directly to the General Manager. A confidential plan of action is
approved by the General Manager at the beginning of the year, and one or two
auditing visits yearly, in accordance with the relative importance of the
cost/profit centers, are scheduled. The Unit audits all departments and
cost/profit centers in YPFB except the Materials Department which has its own
internal auditor. Overall, YPFB's internal auditing practices are satis-
factory, but they should be improvpd by incorporating the regular auditing of
the Materials Department, which YPFB has agreed to do (Section 4.02, Draft
Project Agreement). YPFB's external auditing is currently done by Telleria,
Ormachea & Troche, independent auditors associated with Deloitte Haskins &
Sells. During negotiations, YPFB agreed to submit to the Association, not
later than four months after the end of each fiscal year, its audited
financial statements and the audited Project Accounts, prepared by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association (Section 4.01, Draft Project
Agreement).
3.8      YPFB carries adequate comprehensive insurance on its major facilities
and equipment in operation against all major hazards. Insurance against
hazards of acquisition, transportation, and delivery of goods is regularly



- 18 -
arranged. In early 1986, the Bank began assisting YPFB in reviewing its
insurance arrangements with a view to reduce insurance costs.
YPFB Restructuring
3.9      The new Bolivian Government pursues the policy to reduce the role of
the public sector in the economy and to increase that of private enterprises,
and to make the public sector companies more efficient. With YPFB being the
most important public sector company in Bolivia, the Government requested
early Bank Group assistance in reviewing its operations, investment program
and scope of activities to focus YPFB more clearly and to make it more
efficient. A diagnostic review of YPFB's organization with alternative models
to reorganize the company was carried out by A.D. Little in November 1985
followed up by a more comprehensive study by Booz-Allen, currently underway.
This work is financed by UNDP with the Bank Group as Executing Agency. The
PPF (para 2.33) would include financing of the implementation of reor-
ganization measures prepared on the basis of the A.D. Little and Booz Allen
studies. YPFB would by June 30, 1987 prepare a reorganization plan for review
and discussion with the Association by September 30, 1987 (Section 3.14, Draft
Project Agreement).
B. Financial Performance
Past Financial Performance
3.10     Although YPFB's financial statements indicate satisfactory per-
formance and position, the high-inflation environment and the lack of a
clearly defined policy of reevaluation of assets affect the assessment ow
assets and liabilities, in particular long-term. YPFB's liquidity position
has been affected by a severe shortage of foreign exchange (while local
currency is available) and difficulties in collecting its receivables from gas
exports to Argentina, which, in principle, would all be payable in foreign
exchange but are settled partly in kind (para 2.16). YPFB's income statements
are sho7 in Annex 7 and its balance sheets in Annex 8 and are highlighted
below: -
5/   1985 figures are preliminary.

3.11      YPFB's financial results are dominated by its gas exports to
Argentina which increased from 40.6% of total revenues in 1979 to 72.2% in
1984. The increase in gas exports to Argentina from US$105.0 million in 1979
to US$249.1 maillion in 1985 was the driving force behind the growth in
revenues from US$258.7 million in 1979 to US$528.6 million by 1985 and in
after tax profits from US$11 million in 1979 to US$109.0 million in 1985.
Domestic sales have fluctuated considerably in US$ terms because domestic
adjustments in petroleum product prices lagged behind the pace of inflation
and devaluation resulting in low domestic prices while exports are priced at
international levels. YPFB's net income as a percentage of total sales
increased from 4.3% in 1979 to 20.6% in 1985. YPFB pays a royalty of 11% on
the value of gross production of oil and gas to the local provinces where
hydrocarbons are produced, and an aaditional 19% gross production tax to the
Federal Government.
3.12      On the basis of its audited firdncial statements and at the official
exchange rates, YPFB's situation appears good, but several caveats should be
noted when interpreting those statements: (i) there is no automatic monetary
correction adjusting debt, payables and receivables denominated in local
currency, (ii) overvalued local currency rates have overstated local costs and
revenues, (iii) proceeds from gas exports were only partially received in
foreign exchange, but mostly in local currency at the official (overvalued)



- 20 -
exchange rate. YPFB's condition as measured by the debt-equity and quick
ratios has improved over the past few years due to the decline in capital
investments and in borrowing. Key features of the 1981-84 period were low
domestic prices and delayed collections from Argentina. The increase in
accounts receivable in 1982 and 1983 results from delays in payient by
Argentina for gas exports and is offset by increases in accounts payable as
YPFB was unable to pay the foreign oil companies for oil and gas delivered, as
well as contractors and suppliers for technical services and imported
materials. YPFB has been adversely affected by a shortage of foreign exchange
following delayed payments by Argentina for gas exports (para. 2.16), cur-
tailing YPFB's imports for its investments and operations. The implementation
of the December 1985 agreement between Government and the oil companies is
beginning to reduce the excessive receivables and payables shown for the end
of 1983 to normal levels. The increase in fixed assets reflects YPFB's 1979-
1983 investment program described below.
Investment Program
3.13     A summary of YPFB's 1979-1983 investment program of on average US$88
million p.a. is given below:
rPFB's 1979-1983 Investments
USS Million      X
Exploration                      81           18
Detlopment                       69           16
Refineries                      202           46
Pipelines and Distribution       88           20
Total                       440          100
3.14     The program was dominated by a large and ambitious refineries
expansion program which led to some overcapacity. Investments in exploration
accounted for 18% of the program, development for 16% and pipelines for about
20%. The investment program was financed gy internal cash generation (about
31%) and the remainder by loans from IDB, - the World Bank Group
(US$17 million) and other foreign banks.
3.15     The economic difficulties affecting Bolivia, including the emerging
shortage of petroleum products and the lack of access to international credit
6/   From 1969-1979, IDB made 5 loans to Bolivia's petroleum sector for a
total of US$86.95 million equivalent, with the largest (US$46.5 million) for
the expansion of the Cochabamba refinery. These were followed in 1982 by a
US$134 million IDB loan for a Hydrocarbons Exploration and Production Project
and by a US$97 million loan to help finance the Santa Cruz-La Paz gas
vipeline.

forced Government and YPFB to reevaluate its investment strategy in the mid-
1980's. By March 1985, an emergency investment program was prepared, con-
centrating on measures to quickly increase production of liquids. In addition,
Lwo projects carried out with IDB financing are considered of high priority.
However, this indicative 1985-88 investment program may be altered con-
siderably as Bolivia's and YPFB's situations change. The investment program
presented below is based on the situation before the oil price drop in early
1986. Present Bank Group assistance to YPFB and Bolivia in petroleum matters
aims inter-alia at preparing a well balanced investment program reflecting the
country's needs and constraints. This review will reflect price and market
changes experienced in early 1986. Finally, in December 1985 Tesoro and YPFB
agreed to swap Tesoro's Escondido prospect for YPFB's blocks 18 and 20. This
swap will require a further revision of YPFB's and Tesoro's investment
programs. The discussion below reflects the situation before that swap.
3.16     Because of Bolivia's severe financial constraints, the indicative
program focuses on development for a total of US$212.1 million over the next 4
years, including about 60% in foreign exchange. SLrategically, the new
Government has decided to increase the role of the private sector, including
in petroleum, while limiting that of public enterprises. While YPFB's
indicative investment program is still under review, YPFB's focus is to be on
the lower risk areas (including secondary recovery) and infrastructure.
Regarding development, 79.2% of the budget (US$168 million) is earmarked for
gas fields and 20.8% of the budget (US$44 million) for oil fields. Gas field
investments include US$58.5 million for the remaining investments in the
proposed Vuelta Grande Project, US$29.6 million for Santa Cruz, US$20 million
for Escondido, US$22.4 million for the Boomerang Hills fields of Yapacani, H.
Suarez, Palometas and Santa Rosa. Production from those fields is expected to
come on stream in the late 1980s replacing production from older fields and
helping maintain adequate domestic petroleum supply. The development budget
also includes US$37.6 million for the proposed gas recycling project in San
Roque, a project similar to Vuelta Grande and under consideration for
bilateral assistance. Investments totalling US$10.4 million are planned to
maintain production in the Rio Grande gas field. The budget for oil field
developments includes US$29.0 million for investments in the La Pena field,
$4.2 for Cascabel and US$10.8 million for Humberto Suarez, three small oil
fields discovered during gas exploration in the Boomerang Hills. US$9.3
million are allocated for secondary recovery projects in Monteagudo and Camiri
and US$31.1 million for production maintenance in aging fields such as Rio
Grande.
3.17     The only investments in exploration would be related to the imple-
mentation of the IDB financed Hydrocarbons Exploration and Production Project
(US$133.9 million). In addition, YPFB plans to invest US$104.7 million in
pipelines, mainly the completion of the IDB financed Altiplano gas pipeline.
Investments in distribution (US$20.0 million) would include mainly a LPG
bottling plant planned -with bilateral assistance from Denmark. A large share
of YPFB's investment program would be implemented using Argentine equipment
delivered in exchange for YPFB's gas exports. The planned YPFB investment
program is shown below (US$ million):

A large part of investment requirements would be provided by Argentina
(US$121.5 million) as payment for gas delivered by YPFB.  This plus cash
generated by YPFB from other operations would account for 43% of financing
required. For its borrowing, YPFB would mainly rely on IDB (48%). IDA
financing would consist of the proposed project plus the YPFB component under
the Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC). There would be some bilateral
financing, mainly from Denmark.

3.19     Bolivia would rely on private sector activity to finance exploration
in the Beni (Shell) and expLoration and development in the Chaco (Tesoro and
Occidental). ln addition, several other oil companies have expressed interest
in taking up exploration licenses in Bolivia. However, the recent social and
economic condition has led the private sector to adopt a cautious attitude.
Therefore, while projects interesting the private sector are known, their
scheduling and implementation would depend upon reaching agreement with the
new administration and the summary of petroleum sector investments shows
tentative estimates for the private sector. Government has recently requested
IDA assistance in preparing a petroleum exploration promotion program intended
to attract additional oil companies into exploring for oil and developing oil
discoveries in Bolivia.

3.20     Private sector efforts are expected to concentrate on (i) exploration
and development of several large structures containing or believed to contain
condensate fields in the Chaco, where possible reserves are estimated at
around 50 million barrels of oil and more than 4 TCF of gas and the remaining
exploration and development cost is likely to be in the range of several
hundred million US$; (ii) appraisal and development of proven gas prospects in
the Chaco with possible reserves of more than 200 BCF and costs estimated to
exceed US$50 million, provided a market can 'e identified; (iii) continued
exploration in the Beni basin where seismic surveys have been completed and
deep drilling could start; and (iv) beginning of new exploration activities by
additional oil companies under new licenses.
3.21     The main constraints for private sector activity that need to be
addressed before any new sizeable investments are made are (i) improvement in
the investment climate which has seen much uncertainty, because of disruption
and strikes under the previous administration but which is improving under the
new Government; (ii) on-time settlement of invoices for gas delivered by the
private oil companies which in the last several years had been a problem
(para 2.16); and (iii) on-time settlement for oil delivered by the private
sector. In addition, investments in gas projects would require identification



- 24 -
of a market. The confidence of the p,:ivate sector in Bolivia is recovering,
and the private sector expects that the Bank Group presence under the proposed
project would help improve the investment climate. Bolivia has also been
cooperating with Argentina to settle outstanding claims for gas delivered by
the private sector by entering into countertrade deals. Through export of oil
field equipment and such items as aluminum ingots, Argentina has helped the
Bolivian Government to settle its claims to t!ie private sector, for gas
delivered through YPFB, totalling about US$40 million and the December 1985
agreement involves another US$40 million deal of this kind, possibly followed
later by others. Another difficulty for the private sector had been the
collection of receipts from oil sales to YPFB, which often occurred late and
at distorted exchange rates. Problems in this respect were solved by the new
Government as a result of pricing measures (para. 2.22-2.26), which improved
the demand-supply balance so much that the private sector now exports its
entire share from liquids production and thus collects revenues directly on
the world market and at world market prices, as well as their interest in
regularizing their relations with the private firms. With satisfactory
progress toward solving the remaining questions, the private sector might
invest about US$380 million or about 43% of the sector's requiremonts.
3.22     A comparison of the structure of private and public investment shows
that private sector investments wouLd be concentrated in the riskier areas of
the petroleum industry, i.e. exploration and development. As is usual for an
oil company, exploration and development would also dominate YPFB's investment
program, but a large part (32.3%) would be allocated to infrastructure such as
pipelines and distribution facilities, production maintenance as well as
secondary recovery; and YPFB's exploration and development efforts would be
mainly directed at gas prospects.
3.23     In conclusion, YPFB's investment program of US$511.1 million or
US$127.8 million per year is higher than in the past 5 years reflecting the
severe recession and budget constraints during that time. The reduced
investment program reflects YPFB's commitment to (i) develop existing fields
to prevent the tight demand-supply balance from deteriorating further; (ii)
open new domestic markets for Bolivia's natural gas, (iii) increase
productivity of old fields through enhanced recovery methods, and (iv) con-
tinue exploration efforts to stem the decline of reserves. The investment
program, its priorities and funding proposals are currently under review with
Bank Group assistance at the Government's request to help define YPFB's
appropriate role in Bolivia's economy (para. 3.9). Future investment programs
would be presented for review and comment by the Association before October 31
each year (Section 3.05, Draft Project Agreement). Any borrowing outside the
discussed annual investment program exceeding US$10 million equivalent would
require specific IDA Agreement (Section 3.06(c), Draft Project Agreement).
Financial Projections
3.24     YPFB faces several constraints which have to be addressed with the
support of the Government in order for YPFB to remain a financially viable
corporation. In the short and medium term, YPFB is affected by Bolivia's
general difficulties which translate into strikes and resistance to price
adjustments. However, the new Government has taken a firm stand on pricing;



- 25 -
YPFB's management has been able to keep labor problems under control and
Bolivia's economic situation appears to begin to stabilize. In 1985/86,
Government took unusual action to stabilize Bolivia's economy and relied
heavily on YPFB to implement its economic program. To curb domestic demand
and spending, YPFB's cash resources (US$67.7 million equivalent at
December 31, 1985) can only be disbursed in line with agreed operational and
investment requirements. In addition, the Government's current economic
stabilization plan requires YPFB to prepay taxes equalling 72.8% of domestic
and 69.6% of export sales and superseding the previous production taxes.
These measures are of a temporary nature, until the overall tax reform package
just approved by the Congress begins to generate new revenues, thereby
removing the need to rely mainly on YPFB for financial contributions. As a
result of these stabilization measures, YPFB's financial situation in 1986 is
very tight but following implementation of the IMF program is expected to
normalize beginning in 1987. In the longer term, YPFB and Bolivia face the
probable reduction of gas export revenues from Argentina by 1992 which would
substantially reduce export earnings, unless new markets can be identified.
Because of the uncertainties as to what will happen thereafter (extension of
agreement with Argentina, export agreement instead with Brazil or no new gas
export agreement, but direct exports of liquids instead) the projections do
not extend beyond 1992. If no new gas market can be identified, the likely
severe loss of revenues might jeopardize YPFB's financial condition,
reflecting the urgency for YPFB to address that issue. The projections assume
that Government will pursue the agreed pricing policies, and that YPFB would
maintain its operating performance. Although much progress has been made to
redress Bolivia's main economic problems, such as high inflation rates, delays
in adjusting domestic prices and the transfer of export earnings at official
(often highly ov'svalued) exchange rates which have affected YPFB's liquidity
in the past, a rather conservative approach has been taken in the financial
projections to guard against recurrence of such problems in the future, by
discounting future income (Annex 5, para. 4). Projected income statements,
funds flow and balance sheets are given in Annexes 7-9 and assumptions used in
preparing the projections in Annex 5. Selected financial indicators along
with key ratios are presented in the table below (in US$ million equivalent):
1985   1986  1987   1988   1989  1991   1992

Debt/Equity Ratio    16/84  18/82  22/78  24/76  23/77  20/80  19/81
3.25     YPFB's financial condition is projected to improve, mainly as a
result of the Government's intention to keep domestic petroleum product prices
at or above international levels. As a result, income from domestic sales
would increase from about US$146.3 million in 1983 or 28% of total income to
about US$326.2 million by 1990 or 52% of total revenue. As a result of its
strong earnings position, and under present tax regulations YPFB would be able
to pay substantial dividends to the Government. Through 1992 annual cash
generation is expected to exceed US$140 million per year, debt service



- 26 -
coverage ratios to exceed 2 for every year, the current ratio to remain above
2 and the quick ratio above 1.1. The debt/equity ratio is expected to
increase slightly reflecting borrowing under the proposed project as well as
IDB loans for the domestic gas pipeline and petroleum exploration, but would
remain comfortably low and would not exceed 30/70. Beyond 1992, YPFB may face
a substantial drop in export revenues under the gas sales agreement with
Argentina unless new markets can be identified by that time. Otherwise YPFB's
revenues could be reduced by about half and profits and cash generation
severely cut. However, even if no new gas market could be identified, YPFB
could export natural gas liquids which are now transported to Argentina in the
gas stream (149,285 tons in 1985) and have presently a value of about US$20
million per year.
3.26     The 1985-88 fundsflow summarized below shows that net income over
this period is expected to total about 56.7% of YPFB's ongoing investment
program. Projected debt service would total about US$118.6 million and net
increase in working capital and other assets US$228.7 million:

3.27     The proposed credit would represent some 2.9% of YPFB's 1985-88
investments and about 5.2% of YPFB's borrowing of US$289.2 million over that
period. The financing plan (para 3.18) includes US$187 million in remaining
disbursements under 2 IDB loans as well as US$60 million from another possible
IDB loan and US$14.2 million in bilateral credits. An annual review of YPFB's
financing plan would be held in conjunction with the investment program review
(Section 3.05, Draft Project Agreement).
Financial Covenants
3.28     In order to ensure YPFB's sound financial position in the coming
years the following financial covenants were agreed upon with the Government
and YPFB during negotiations:
(a) YPFB shall maintain at all times a (i) minimum quick ratio of
1.1 (current assets excluding inventories divided by current
liabilities); (ii) debt service coverage of at least 2.0 cash



- 27 -
generation divided by debt service; and (iii) debt equity ratio
of no more than 40:60 (long-term debt divided by long-term debt
plus equity) (Sections 3.06, 3.07, 3.08 Draft Project
Agreement);
(b) Government would maintain average petroleum prices for the main
products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oil and
LPG) at least at international levels and annual consultations
would be held between the Association, YPEB and the Government
to review the relationship between the Bolivian price levels and
international prices (Section 3.05 Draft Credit Agreement);
(c) By October 31 of each year the investment program for the
following year would be reviewed jointly by YPFB, Covernment and
the Association, including the proposed financing plan. Any
borrowing outside the discussed annual investment program
exceeding US$10 million equivalent would require specific TDA
agreement (Sections 3.05, 3.06 (c) Draft Project Agreement).

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.1      The main objective of the proposed project would be to help Bolivia
complete the Vuelta Grande field to maintain adequate domestic petroleum con-
sumption levels and some exports of LPG. Vuelta Grande is the field with
Bolivia's largest reserves of liquid hydrocarbons. It accounts for 43.7 MMBbl
out of Bolivia's total of 154.4 MMBbl of proven reserves of liquid hydro-
carbons. Annual production would peak at about 2 million barrels of con-
densate and 84,000 tons of LPG, two readily marketable products, worth about
US$35 million in April 1986 prices of US$10 per barrel of crude. Exports of
LPG would help ease Bolivia's foreign exchange problems. Because Vuelta
Grande is the only important foreign exchange generating project likely to
come on stream in the medium term, and because project preparation is well
advanced so that it could be implemented in about 2 years, Government is
keenly interested in seeing it carried out as soon as possible. Under the
proposed project YPFB would acquire technology to develop other retrograde gas
condensate fields in Bolivia in the future, such as San Roque and Escondido.
The project will also bring a significant contribution to the overall
financial situation of YPFB by increasing annual sales revenue by an average
of 4.3% from 1985 to 1993. The contribution to net income will be 9.0% over
the same period.
Project Description
4.2      The technical description of the main project components is given in
Annex 3 and summarized below.  The mair component entails the drilling of 6
wells (2 production and 4 injection),- the installation of a gas processing
and injection plant, laying of gathering and injection lines, connections to
the main oil pipeline. In a retrograde gas field like Vuelta Grande, all
liquid hydrocarbons exist in gas form in the reservoir and if reservoir
pressure were to drop with progressing production below dew point, condensates
would separate from the gas, become immobile in the reservoir and no longer
produceable with conventional methods. In order to maintain production of
condensates from such fields, it is critical to keep the reservoir pressure at
appropriate levels. In the proposed project, this is done by recycling dry
gas into the reservoir. Reservoir conditions are suitable to recycle gas over
a twenty year period, thus allowing recovery of more than 23 million barrels
of condensates and nearly 1 million tons of LPG (11 million barrels equiv-
alent) over the life of the project. After the recoverable liquids have been
extracted, the reservoir would then enter a 10 year blow down period, when gas
would be produced at the rate of 120 MMCFD (without re-injection) and shipped
for exports or domestic demand. Production forecasts and a project process
flow chart are appended to Annex 3.
7/   In addition to the 15 wells already drilled (para. 4.4).



- 29 -
4.3      The wells in the field produce a mixture of water, liquid hydro-
carbons and gas. The well output is separated into gas and liquids after
discarding the water at the gas processing plant, the dry gas is then
reinjected back into the formation and the liquid hydrocarbons are separated
into LPC and condensates. The gas processing plant would have a design
capacity to recycle 90 MMCFD and early indications of a review of the
reservoir model after more than 24 months of pilot operations are that the
field could well sustain this output level. Ultimate recoverable gas reserves
are estimated at 0.8 TCF. In terms of energy equivalent, natural gas accounts
for about 80% of the recoverable reserves in Vuelta Crande, condensate 13% and
LPC 7%.
Status of Project Preparation
4.4      The Vuelta Grande project has been prepared by YPFB with financial
assistance from the Association. The field was discovered in 1978 and YPFB
has drilled fifteen wells since, including ten producers, three injectors and
two dry holes. Project preparation is well advanced, basic and detailed
engineering completed and a pilot plant is operating successfully. Intercomp
(USA) prepared a preliminary reservoir engineering study and later a more
detailed reservoir simulation study. Basic and detailed engineering of the
gas recycling and LPG plants were prepared in 1983 by Trentham Corporation
(USA), financed under a US$1 million PPF advance approved in March 1981, to be
refinanced under the proposed credit. In June 1983, YPFB inaugurated a pilot
plant which is now cecycling 24 MMCFD of gas from 4 wells and producing 1,200
BD of condensate. After start-up of the proposed project, the pilot plant
would be disassembled and its components used in other YPFB projects. The
operating results data to date increase confidence in the project.
4.5      The proposed project was originally appraised in November 1980 and
negotiated in February 1981, but was deferred because of the deterioration in
Bolivia's external finances leading to the suspension of the stand-by arrange-
ment with the IMF. The project was reappraised in March 1985 and updated in
early 1986 after economic measures had brought petroleum prices to satis-
factory levels and improved substantially the outlook for the Bolivian
economy.
Project Implementation
4.6      The project would be implemented by YPFB with the assistance of
Trentham Corporation who prepared equipment specifications, tender documents
and will supervise assembly and construction of the plant. A Project Unit has
been created to coordinate execution and start-up of the project. The unit is
headed by a Project Coordinator who reports to the Production Manager.
Qualifications and experience of the Project Coordinator and the Unit's
geologists, engineers and accountant shall continue to be satisfactory to the
Association. YPFB would consult with the Association before removing any
member of the unit during project implementation. Because of YPFB's tight
financial situation, YPFB would establish a Project Account to ensure
continued flow of funds to meet local expenses of suppliers and contractors.
The Account would initially be funded with US$1 million equivalent, equal to
about 3 months disbursements for local costs and replenished every 60 days and



- 30 -
at all other times a minimum balance of US$250,000 would be maintained in the
Account. This would be supplemented by a Special Account in the amount of
US$2.0 million, to be financed from the proceeds of tne proposed Credit, which
would help reduce the interval during which YPFB would finance expenditures
for the project from its own resources. The accounc would be opened in the
Central Bank for payment of goods and services contracted under the project.
4.7      YPFB has successfully been drilling wells "on force account" through-
out Bolivia since the 1930's. Apart from the 10 YPFB rigs, there are two
private drilling companies operating a total of 6 rigs. YPFB has ongoing
contracts for the following services required in drilling operations with
service companies: logging -nd perforating with electrical wire line;
cementing, acidizing, testing and pumping serv.ce; down hole packers and
completion equipment as well as "slick line" wire line services; mud
engineering and logging services, as well as supply of mud materials and
chemicals; and tubular inspection services. These well services would be
financed under the proposed loan for two production wells. YPFB has
sufficient provisions for the materials needed to drill the remaining wells.
4.8      Project implementation has already begun and coTnpletion is expected
by Decccmber 1988. Annex 4 shows the proposed implementation schedule. This
schedule is prepared on the basis of technical evaluation by consultants,
recent YPFB performance and similar projects in Bolivia.
Project Cost Estimate
4.9      Total financing required is estimated at US$94.4 million equivalent
including physical and price contingencies and interest during construction.
The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$66.9 million, or 71% of
total financing. The cost estimate includes already incurred investments by
YPFB totalling US$46.6 million, including US$39.5 million (exploration and
field development) and US$7.1 million in the gas plant which leaves about
US$47.8 million still to be financed. Because of the high inflation rates in
Bolivia, the project cost estimate is only expressed in US$. Estimated
project costs are summarized below.

in Bolivia. The project would be exempt from import duties and taxes. Phys-
ical contingencies have been estimated at 10%. Costs are expressed in US$ of
December 1985. Price escalation has been calculated on the basis of 7.2Z in
1986, 6.8% in 1987 and 1988 and 7.0% in 1989 for foreign costs. It is assumed
that the difference between US$ and local inflation rates would be reflected
by variances in the US$/b$ exchange rate.

Mainly gas exports to Argentina.
Under the remaining expenditures, a large part of YPFB's share of foreign
exchange expenditures would be derived from proceeds from gas exports to
Argentina which are paid partly in cash and partly in countertrade.
4.12     Total Project.  IDA funds will cover 15.9% of total estimated
requirements, 22.6% of the foreign exchange component. YPFB would finance all
of the local cost component. The Association would finance the remaining
foreign exchange component of the gas plant (in addition to items supplied by
Argentina), plus related engineering services. YPFB also has already incurred
the foreign exchange cost of exploration and field development, plus the
foreign cost of drilling the remaining wells. YPFB will import some items
under the existing bilateral agreement with Argentina, which is paying Bolivia
for recent gas imports partly by delivering oil field equipment, drilling
materials and gas plant supplies available in Argentina.
4.13     Remaining Expenditures.  ID.A would finance 31.3% of remaining
expenditures, mostly in the gas plant, plus some related engineering
services. YPFB would finance the balance.
4.14     Onlending Terms.  The Credit would be on-lent from Government to YPFB
at a rate of 9.5% (i.e. about 10% above regular Bank lending rate) with 3
years grace and repayment over 9 years. The subloan would be denominated in
US$ and YPFB would bear the foreign exchange risk. Signature of a subloan
agreement between Government and YPFB acceptable to the Association would be a
condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01 (b) Draft Credit Agreement).

4.16     All items to be procured under the proposed project would be subject
to Bank procurement guidelines. All conditions and procedures for the
procurement of all goods, works and consultant's services for the proposed
project will be laid out in a procurement manual which shall be consistent
with Bank/IDA guidelines. Goods, works or consultants' services to be
procured for the project shall be exempt for taxes, duties and similar
charges. The Project Unit shall, with the assistance of consultants when
appropriate, draft all bidding documents, tender bid documents and receive
bids. A procurement committee shall open and evaluate bids, and award the
contract to the lowest evaluated bidder. The committee shall consist of
representatives of Ministry of Energy, Central Bank, a member of the Project
Unit and the General Manager of YPFB. These guidelines would be issued in a
Government decree which would be a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01
(c) Draft Credit Agreement).
4.17     About 61% of the items proposed for IDA financing will be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB). Items to cost more than
US$250,000 CIF will require prior IDA approval; this is expected to account
for 36% of the credit amount. Packages costing less than the threshold value
will be subject to random post review by the Association. Bid invitation and
evaluation will be the responsibility of YPFB with assistance from consultants
as required. Qualified local suppliers will be allowed to participate in ICB
for goods with a 15% (or the import duty rate if lower) preference margin.



- 34 -
4.18     The Association will continue to finance the services of the existing
engineering consultants until the completion of their contract which was
awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.19     About US$5.5 million worth of goods and services (8% of foreign
exchange component) will be procured through limited international bidding
(LIB). Well services related to two production and four injection wells such
as electrical logging, cementing, and well testing which are estimated to cost
US$2.4 million are offered only by a small number of companies. YPFB plans to
use three existing Solar Centaur compressors in the Vuelta Grande gas plant
and their modification is estimated to cost US$2.0 million. Procurement of
materials that are of highly-specialized nature and which are in limited
international supply (such as high pressure and high temperature valves and
control equipment) is estimated to cost US$1.1 million in aggregate. Indi-
vidual bid packages for these specialized goods are estimated to cost less
than US$250,000. Because of YPFB's decision to implement the proposed project
as quickly as possible, in the interest of ensuring adequate supplies up to
US$2.2 million worth of contracts would be advance contracted.
4.20     The disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 11 and summarized below:
Fiscal Year                    1987       1988      Total
Expenditures (US$ million)      9.1        5.9        15.0
in %                           60.7       39.3       100.0
Disbursements would be made against 100% of foreign expenditures for gas
processing plant and for engineering and consulting services. Disbursements
would be made against normal documentation. Contracts valued not exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent would be made against statements of expenditures (SOE).
Supporting documentation would not be sent to IDA but retained in YPFB offices
for review by periodic IDA missions.
4.21     The standard disbursement profile for energy projects financed by the
Bank Group shows that disbursements have taken 6 years, with 85% disbursed
after 4 years. The profile projected for the proposed project is faster
reflecting the fact that the remaining construction period is about one year
as well as advance contracting of US$2.2 million and PPF repayment of US$1
million. The disbursement profile has room for delays in construction and in
implementation of other components and is therefore considered realistic.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1988. The closing
date would be June 30, 1989.
Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
4.22     The Project Unit (para. 4.6) would keep separate project accounts and
records. These accounts, the SOE's and the Special Account (para 4.6) would
be audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Association. These reports
would be furnished to IDA not later than four months after the end of early
fiscal year. YPFB will submit progress reports within 45 days after the end
of each quarter, and submit a report after project completion no later than
six months after the closing date of the credit.

V. PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS
Simmary
5.1      Because project implementation is far advanced and because the field
has been operating with a pilot plant for several years, the project risks
involved are smaller than they normally would be. On the other hand, benefits
are high, particularly if the sunk cost of investments already incurred is
taken into account. Therefore, the rate of return tests have been carried out
in two different scenarios, first, on a full cost basis, to reflect all costs
incurred to produce the benefits shown in this analysis. Second, on a sunk
cost basis, to reflect the rate of return of the proposed project (i.e. the
additional expenditure) at the time a decision is made on financ:ng the
balance of the expenditures required to complete the project. The sunk cost
alternative excludes past investments in engineering, exploration and develop-
ment of approximately US$46.6 million and only incorporates additional invest-
ment costs estimated at US$47.8 million. The full cost case includes both.
The key variable in the sensitivity analysis is the price of oil which is now
at a low level. The analysis concludes that even further adverse developments
in the price of oil (sey down to US$5 per barrel of crude) would still leave
the proposed project with a satisfactory rate of return if the analysis is
done on a sunk cost basis (ERR 20% and FRR 13%). The proposed project would
have important benefits for Bolivia's balance of payments (accounting for the
equivalent of about 6% of current exports or about 11% of Bolivia's debt
service) and for the stabilization and improvement of YPFB's finances (para
4.1).
Rate of Return Calculation
5.2      Financial Rate of Return.  Operating costs are estimated at US$3.9
million per year at recycling of 90 MMCFD. Over the 20 year project life,
production is projected to total 23.2 million barrels of condensate and
ll.5 million barrels of LPG. The calculation does not include gas exports
vhich could start in the twenty first year. The we'll head price for con-
densate has been taken at US$12 per barrel (compared to a present retail price
of US$36.6 per composite barrel) and is assumed to stay constant in real terms
in view of the Government's commitment to keep petroleum product prices at
least at international levels. This price of US$12 per barrel of condensate
is composed of an estimated world market price of US$10 per barrel of crude,
plus the premium of condensate over crude of US$2 per barrel. LPG exports
have been priced at US$12.6 per barrel. Petroleum product prices are expected
to remain constant in real terms. Based on these assumptions, the proposed
project would yield a financial rate of return of 14% (full cost) and 44%
(sunk cost). Annex 12 shows the results of the full cost analysis with the
detailed cost and benefit streams. Unless otherwise stated below, the above
assumptions have also been applied to the economic analysis.



- 36 -
5.3      Economic Rate of Return.  The barrel of condensate is valued at
US$20 (CIF), because Bolivia without the proposed project would become a net-
importer of liquid petroleum products. The estimated surcharge over the US$12
used in the financial analysis (para 5.2) for bringing condensate from the
world market to Bolivia is probably in the range of US$6-9 per barrel but
Bolivia at present does not have the physical infrastructure for obtaining
petroleum imports that would be needed to sustain the projected consumption
level. There are three possible import routes: the pipeline to Arica, Chile
and the rail links to Argentina and Brazil. The first route could not be
taken unless pumping stations are added to the line to push products across
the Andes. The rail link to Brazil has a capacity of about 700 barrels a day
or less than 3 percent of the present consumption. The rail link to Argentina
would require extension of port facilities and strengthening of railway since
the replacement of volumes produced at Vuelta Grande would require a large
number of additional railway tank cars and locomotives.
5.4      Domestic LPG sales have been priced at US$20.6/3bl (CIF) equivalent
in the economic analysis to reflect the present world market price of about
US$12.6 plus the cost of shipping, handling and insurance. No shadow price
for labor has been used since the project only uses skilled personnel. Total
taxes and duties are 30% of sales revenues. A depletion allowance has been
determined by estimating the cost of exploration wells needed to discover the
energy depleted based on historical ratios of gas and oil found per average
exploration well in Bolivia. Based on these assumptions the proposed project
would yield an economic rate of return of 21% on a full cost basis and 60% on
a sunk cost basis. Annex 13 show the results of the anal;sis with the
detailed cost and benefit streams over the life of the project.
5.5      Sensitivity Tests.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test
the impact on the rates of return of changes in key variables. The economic
rates of return are most sensitive to variations in prices, but even at the
low international petroleum prices in April 1986 the rates of return are
satisfactory, because project implementation was quite advanced. Therefore,
variations in capital cost are no longer a major factor. Taking into con-
sideration the sunk cost of expenditures already incurred, the project would
yield financial and economic rates of return of 44% and 60% respectively.
Finally, one sensitivity test was carried out to explore at which level of
international petroleum prices and taking into account the sunk cost the
proposed project would still be justified. This worst case test shows that
even at a level of US$5 per barrel of crude in the world market the proposed
project would still yield satisfactory financial and economic rates of return
of 13% and 20% respectively. The results of the analysis are shown in Annexes
16 and 17 and are illustrated graphically in Annexes 14 and 15. They are
summarized in the following table:

Prices down 15%           9.9      33.0          6.5       27.1
Environmental Considerations and Safety
5.6      No major environmental damage or adverse effects are expected to
result from implementation of the project. YPFB has a good safety record and
its pollution and fire prevention practices are standard for the petroleum
industry. The Vuelta Grande Gas Processing Plant has been designed as if it
were to be installed in the United States and in accordance with all safety
and environmental regulations and standards applicable to this type of
facility. Over 100 gas processing plants of similar design are in operation
in the United States. YPFB has extensive experience (25 years) in operating
gas processing plants since most of oilfields are retrograde gas condensate
reservoirs where similar plants are installed to extract liquid
hydrocarbons. Vuelta Grande where the gas plant will be installed is located
in Chaco area of Bolivia which is unpopulated and very far away from any city.
Project Risks
5.7      The technical risks associated with the proposed project are those
inherent in the petroleum industry. The drilling done to date and the
operation of the pilot plant since June 1983 establish a high degree of
confidence in the recoverable reserve estimates but reservoir behavior can
never be fully predicted. This project is considered to offer a high
probability of success at low risk.
5.8      Besides the technical risks, there are project risks stemming from
Bolivia's overall political, social and economic situation which in case-of
severe deterioration could affect the implementation schedule and benefits of
the proposed project. While Government is committed to carry out its economic
stabilization and reform program, there is a risk that the Government cannot
keep the program on track and that the benefits of the proposed credit would
not fully materialize. To show soon positive effects of an economic reactiv-
ation, Government is arranging for an external funding package that would
allow for modest economic growth. The Government's efforts in this field are
supported by the Bank Group, particularly the Reconstruction Import Credit
(RIC) (para. 2.32).
5.9      The political and social risks are tempered by the fact that support
for Vuelta Grande is not controversial. To date, all Bolivian Governments,
whatever their political orientation, have pushed for implementation of the
proposed project. The relatively short remaining implementation period also



- 38 -
reduces the risks to the project which would be most vulnerable during con-
struction. In the longer term, to safeguard the full benefits of the proposed
project to YPFB and Bolivia, Government will have to maintain a reasonable
pricing policy and increase efforts to keep competent managerial and
professional staff.

VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements
6.1      Agreement was reached that the Government would:
(i)   maintain petroleum product prices at international levels and
hold annual consultations with the Association to review
relations between Bolivian and international prices (para. 2.23);
(ii)   hold annual consultations with the Association on measures
designed to promote activity in exploration and development,
including by the private sector (para. 2.6);
(iii)   prepare by June 30, 1987 a plan for the reorganization of YPFB
for review and discussion with the Association by September 30,
1987 (para 3.9); and
6.2      Agreement was reached that YPFB would:
(i)   annually review with the Association its capital investment
program and related financing sources no later than 60 days
before the start of each fiscal year (para. 3.23); any borrowing
outside the program exceeding US$10 million equivalent would
require specific IDA agreement;
(ii)   keep the Project Unit adequately staffed and consult  with the
Associatioa prior to replacing certain key technical staff (para.
4.6);
(iii)   include the Materials Department in the regular audits of the
internal auditing group (para. 3.07);
(iv)   have its accounts audited by independent auditors and would
submit to the Association not later than four months after the
end of each fiscal year audited financial statements and project
accounts (para. 3.07);
(v)   maintain at all times a minimum quick ratio of 1.1 a minimum debt
service coverage of 2.0; and a maximum debt-equity ratio of 40:60
(para. 3.8);
(vi)   would carry out a study of its staff structure to be completed by
December 31, 1986; recommendations would be implemented after
consultations with the Association by June 30, 1987 (para. 3.5);
and



- 40 -
(vii)   establish a project account to ensure continuing availability of
domestic funds for project expenses, in conjunction with a US$2.0
miLLion Special Account to be financed by the Credit.
6.3      Signature of a subloan agreement between Government and YPFB
acceptable to the Association would be a condition of effectivenes of the
proposed credit (para. 4.14). A further condition of effectiveness would be
that the Government decree outlining guidelines for procurement under the
project had been issued (para. 4.16).
Recommendation
6.4      With the agreements reached on the items outlined above, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for a IDA credit of US$15.0 million to the
Government. The credit would be on-lent to YPFB at an interest rate of 9.5%
on the subloan amount outstanding, for 12 years, including 3 years grace (para
4.14).

Development of the Vuelta Grande Retrograde Gas Condensate Field
Geology and Reserves
1.        The Vuelta Grande retrograde gas condensate field is located in
Chuquisaca province between other producing field such as Porvenir in the
North (operated by Occidental) and La Vertiente in the south (operated by
Tesoro). Vuelta Grande was discovered by drilling well VGR X-I IN 1978.
.
2.        The field is a north-south trending anticline.  The structure is
also cut by a north-south trending fault (La Vertiente) on the east flank.
This fault apparently forms one of the sealing reservoir mechanisms. The
structure consists of two main sandstone reservoirs, Tapecua formation
(cretaceous) and Cangapi formation (triassic) with a common gas water
contact. Both reservoirs are separated by a shale barrier.
3.        In a retrograde gas condensate reservoir all liquid hydrocarbons
exist in gas form under the original reservoir pressure and temperature
conditions. In this type of reservoir, as the production proceeds the
reservoir pressure starts to decline. When the reservoir pressure drops below
the dew point pressure, the liquid hydrocarbons (condensates) which originally
exist in gas form start to separate and condense on the pore surfaces of the
reservoir rock where they become immobile resulting in considerable loss of
recoverable hydrocarbon liquids. In order to maintain production of
condensates from such fields, it is therefore critical to keep the reservoir
pressure above dew point pressure. In the proposed project, this will be done
by reinjection of dry gas into the reservoir.
4.        The gas processing plant will first strip the liquid hydrocarbons
(C5+, Pentane +) from the produced gas stream by a condensate flash
separator. The gas will pass from the condensate flash separator through a
second stage separator and debutanizer vessel where the LPG, Propane C3 and
Butane C4 will be extracted. The dry gas coming out of the debutanizer vessel
(consisting of Methane Cl and Ethane C2) will then be repressurized through
the compressors ant) will be reinjected into the reservoir for pressure
maintenance until a market develops for gas sales (see Appendix 1). LPG and
liquid hydrocarbons (condensates) meanwhile will be shipped for sales. The
reservoir conditions are suitable to recycle gas over a twenty year period.
Production forecast for the 20 year recycling period is given in Appendix 2.

Field Development
5.        When the field is fully developed, it will have twelve production
wells (seven wells dual completion and five wells single completion) and seven
injection wells (five wells dual completion and two wells single
completion). Up to December 31, 1985, ten production and three injection
wells have been drilled and completed. Five of these production wells are
dual completions to produce from both Tapecua and Cangapi formations, and five
wells single completions in Tapecua. The three injection wells drilled so far
are all dual completions. The proposed project includes drilling of the
remaining six wells (two production and four injection wells, construction of
gas processing plant, reinjection plant, product storage tanks, and liquid and
gas transfer pipelines).

YPFB
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
I.  General
1.       The financial projections are based on:
(i)    YPFB's 1979-84 audited accounts;
(ii)   YPFB's November 1985 financial forecast; and
(iii)  the staff's best judgement on future production levels.  The
forecast is in US$. International inflation (in US$) is
according to the following schedule.
1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993
7.2%    6.8%    6.8%    7.0%    7.1%    4.0%    4.0%    4.0%
II. Income Statements
1.       The demand projections are based on YPFB's forecast.  It was assumed
that the Santa Cruz-Altiplano gas pipeline will permit a 2,000 Bbl/d
substitution of gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil from 1990 onwards.
2.       Revenues, are based on the following assumptions:
(i)     the export prices of crude oil would remain constant at
US$10.00 per barrel;
(ii)    the export price per Bbl equivalent of LPC is US$12.6.
3.       Prices were taken at their actual ievels, but to allow for past
discrepancies between the pace of domestic inflation and the readjustment of
petroleum prices only 85% of revenues has been included in the r.ojections.
This provision could also buffer against the possible foreign exchange spread
between the official and the parallel market or against unforeseen tax
increases.
4.       Production Expenses are based on YPFB's 1984 budget escalated by
inflation, and production fluctuations.
5.       Refining Expenses are based on YPFB's 1984 budget escalated by
inflation, and variation of total refinery runs.
6.       Transport and Administration Expenses are based on YPFB's 1984 budget
escalated by inflation.
7.       Distribution Expenses are based on YPFB's 1984 budget escalated by
inflation, and variation in domestic sale volumes.

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3
8.       Purchases from Operators are based on a price of US$10.00/bbl for
crude and US$3.70/MCF for gas, which are assumed to remain constant. YPFB
purchases 45% uf the operators crude production and purchases the gas
production for export up to 100 MMCFD.
9.       Rovalties and Other Taxes.  YPFB pays a 11% royalty tax on oil and
gas to the regional authorities and a 19Z production tax to the federal
government, as follows:
Product Tax                           Price
Crude 11% Royalty                     US$10.00/bbl
Crude 19Z Production                  US$10.00/bbl
Natural Gas 11  Royalty              US$3.7/MCF
Natural Gas 19X Production            US$3.7/MCF
10.      Prepaid Taxes.  YPFB will be required to make an advance payment on
royalties and taxes due in 1987. The amount due in 1986 is 42.8% of Domestic
sales revenues and 39.6% of Exports. This prepaid amount will be credited to
YPFB against taxes and royalties do be paid in 1987.
11.      Depreciation Expenses  YPFB calculates depreciation according to
schedules approved by Presidential Decree summarized below:
(a) Exploration Costs Including Dry Holes are fully depreciated in
the year they occur;
(b) Producing Wells are depreciated according to the depletion of
reserves;
(c) Drilling Equipment is depreciated during a period of five years,
the annual depreciation being calculated on the number of hours
of use;
(d) Other Machinery and Equipment is depreciated over ten years, the
annual depreciation being calculated on the numbers of hours of
use;
(e) Other investments are written off using straight line
depreciation according to the following schedule:
Annual Depreciation Dereciation Period
(Percent)              (Years)
Refineries, Lubrication Plants,
LPG Plants                                     5                       20

Water, Steam)                                  6.67                     15
Pipelines                                        5                        20
Gasoline Station Equipment                      20                        5
Buildings and Structures                         4                        25
Intangible Assets                                9.1                      11

ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3
For forecast purposes depreciation was assumed to be 6% of the years
average gross assets plus exploration expenses, which are fully
depreciated the year they occur.
12.      Non Operating Income consists of YPFB's earnings of its investments
in YABOG, a wholly owned subsidiary.
13.      Dividends were estimated taking into account both, the net income of
the respective year and the required covenants.
III. Balance Sheets
14.      Cash is based on average historical requiremepts of 2 weeks of
Operating Cost.
15.      Short-term Investments consist of the cash exceeding YPFB's minimum
cash requirements, in order to maintain a current ratio of 2.0. Under
directives of Government's current economic stabilization plan, YPFB is
required to manage its cash requirements in a government held custody account.
16.      Accounts Receivable declined from 235 days of sales equivalent in
1983 to 190 in 1984, and 1985, and are expected to decline to 158 in 1986 and
130 from 1987 onwards.
17.      Inventories were increased from 1983 onwards proportionately to
production, and the annual inflation.
18.      Plant and Equipment (Fixed Assets) are based on the investment
program.
19.      Other Assets comprise investments in various Bolivian enterprises,
and intangible as'ets and interest capitalized.
20.      Accounts Payable are mostly an account for purchases from operators
and operating expenses excluding royalties and taxes. They were 115 days in
1984 and 145 in 1985 and are expected to rise to 192 in 1986 and then decline
to 145 in 1987 and 88 from 1988 onwards.
22.      Taxes Payable are assumed to be 100 days of annual taxes and
royalties from 1986 onwards.
