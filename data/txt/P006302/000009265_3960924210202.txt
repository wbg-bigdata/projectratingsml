PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1656-BR)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report covers tbe Northeast Water Supply
and Sewerage Project (Loan 1656-BR) for US$100.0 million, which was approved
on January 30, 1979. Loan funds were fully disbursed in May 1986.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Latin America and
Caribbean Projects Department based upon documents in the Bank's regional
files as well as documents in the Borrower's (Banco Nacional da HabitaSao -
BNH) and executing agencies' files, and on information provided by staff of
the Borrower and the three executing agencies.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1656-BR)
HIGHLIGHTS
This project was the first semi-sectoral loan carried out through
Banco Nacional da Habitacao (BNH) in support of Government actions directed
towards economic growth and development in Northeast Brazil (para. 1.01).
The project provided for the financing of investment programs to increace
the water and sewerage service levels in the capital cities of the three
states involved in the project, initiate and/or expand systems in many other
large cities and to extend water supply services to about 240 small
communities not previously served. Additional objectives were to improve
the financial position of the executing agencies, i.e., the State Sanitation
Companies (SWCs), and to develop experience in order to replicate such
projects in future operations in Brazil (paras. 2.04 and 2.05).
The goal of providing increased service levels of water supply was
surpassed through implementation of the physical components, and more than
75% attained in sewerage (para. 1.02). In addition, about 234 small
communities were provided with potable water supply systems for the first
time. The cost of combined services to the urban poor was maintained at
about 50% of the maximum limit envisioned for affordability (para. 6.03).
Delays were encountered in project execution primarily because the
Borrower's project selection criteria differed from those contained in the
Loan Agreement, and because the executing agencies initially had doubts as
to whether to use the Bank procurement guidelines or to continue to use the
existing national and state procurement regulations (para. 3.02). This
situation was rectified by making all loan conditions uniform at the end of
1981. Uniformity was particularly important in terms of criteria for
acceptability of sub-projects for Bank financing, and making the Borrower
responsible for adherence to Bank procurement guidelines (para. 3.03).



- v -
The goal of financial improvement of the executing agencies was
progressing well through 1982, despite the increasing level of inflation
(para. 4.05). However, beginning in 1983, Inflation became progressively
more severe, and that, together with Government credit control efforts and
the natute of a severe and prolonged drought followed by damaging floods,
reversed the trend so that by 1985, the executing agencies' financial
siguations were precarious. During this latter period, the Bank institated a
Special Action program providing the Borrower with needed financial
assistance to catry o-lt the project (paras. 3.08 and 3.12).
Finally, the loan was successful in replicating this type of
project since the Southern States Water Supply and Sewerage Project, Loan
1823-BR, was-approved the following year for three additional states in
southern Brazil.

BRAZIL
LOAN 1656-BR
NORTHEAST WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. TNTRODUCTION
1.01         This retort covers the Northeast Water Supply and Sewerage
Project, Loan 1656-BR.  The loan amount of USS100.0 mCllion was the first
semi-sectoral loan in Rrazil since It covered investments in the states of
Bahia, Pernambuco and Ceara.   The objectives of this loan were to:  (a)
improve the health and environmental conditions of the population in the
three states of the Northeast, the poorest region in Brazil, by increasing
water supply service to an additional 2.3 million people and sewerage ser-
vice to an additional 1.2 million people; (b) assist in making institu-
tional improvements to the executing agencies; anid (c) to provide for
financlal viability of the three state executing agencies within the
Borrower's National Sanitation Plan (PLANASA).
Main Conclusions
1.02      The quant'tative goal of serving water to an additional 2.3 mil-
lion people was surpassed, by serving an additional 3.8 million, of which
0.5 million were in 234 communities of less than 5,000 population. Sewer-
age service was expanded by 125% over 1978 levels by connecting an addi-
tional 0.9 million people, or 752 of the project obJective.  The physical
systems, with some modifications, were implemented satisfactorily, and good
progress has been made in the metering program which is expected to be fin-
ished by 1987. The institutional strengthening objectives were met.
1.03      The obJective of financial viability was partially achieved.  The
National Tariff Law, enacted In May 1978, and Its regulations, were both
drafted by the Borrower, Banco Nacional da Habitacao (BNf), and the Bank's
comments were solicited by BNH. The Loan Agreement was eventually modified
to accept the principles of the National Tariff Law. Some small improve-
ment to the financial condition of the State Water Companies (SWCs)
occurred during 1979-82, and through 1985, tariff increases exceeded the
National Consumer Price Institute index. However, that index was less than
the increase in operating costs, and, by 1985, revenues at two of the three
SWC8 were not covering operating costs.
Sector Service Levels and Objectives
1.04       It was estimated in 1975 that about 65%-70X of Brazil's urbar
population had access to potable water supply through house connections,
and about 25%-30X of the urban population was connected to a sewage dis-
posal system.l/ The project states were substantially below the national

level with water supply estimated at 30%-63% and sewage at 5.-8% at the
time of appraisal.  The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) noted that even those
levels were misleading because water rationing existed in all of the capi-
tal cities. Government policy was to expand water supply service to 85% of
the urban population and sewage to 50% of the urban population by 1990.
Institutional Arrangements
1.05        Sectoral development policy was attributed to the Ministry of
Interior, but was carried out by the Borrower through its PLANASA program,
which contained guidelines for project design and economic evaluation of
proposed investments. Under the PLANASA program, BNH made financing avail-
able to each state that agreed to adhere to it.   That program required
establishment of a State Water and Sewerage Company (SWC) that would plan
and carry out investments on a statewide basis for all municipalities, pro-
vided the municipalities turned over the operation of their facilities to
the SWC.  In addition, the state was to establish a state water and sewer-
age fund (Fundo de Agua e Esgoto - FAR) to which the State would channel
its annual budgetary contribution to sanitation projects. The SWC was also
required to provide BNH annually with a five-year investment program for
BNH's review. BNH had entered into a contract with the Pan-American Health
Organization (PAHO)2/ in 1974 to carry out a technical assistance program
of institutional development, standardization of information systems and a
national chart of accounts which all SWCs vwre to use.  BNH had also con-
tracted with the National Association of Sanitary Engineers (ABES) to
develop and implement a national training program to train the personnel
necessary to operate the expanded water and sewerage systems envisioned
under PLANASA.
Borrower
1.06         The Borrower, BNH, was established in 1964, and though it
reported to the Ministry of Interior, it was administratively and finan-
cially independent of the Ministry._/ BNH's lending activities were prin-
cipally housing, urban development and sanitation, and its excess funds
were invested in National Treasury obligations.
1.07      The Water and Sewerage Sector Operating Department (Carteira de
Operacoes de Saneamento - COSAN) is responsible for implementing the
PLANASA prograr, and is one of BNH's seven operating departments.  Due to
the heavy volimue of work, COSAN began delegating part of its responsibili-
ties to BNH's 26 regional offices in 1976 and completed this delegation In
1980.   These regional units were designated as SOSAN's (Sub-Gerencia de
Operacoes de Saneamento), and were responsible for monitoring BNH loan
agreements with the SWCs (and the State Governments), approving disburse-
ments, monitoring the performance of the state FAE funds and reviewing the
2/ The Bank began financing part of this during the execution of Loan
1823-BR.
3/ In 1985, BNH was transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development and
the Environment, and in November 1986, BNH was abolished, and merged
with Caixa Economica Federal.

performance of the SWC in the state in which the regional BNH office was
located.4/
1.08       The principal source of BNH funds at the tlme of appraisal was
the Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Servico (FGTS), an emplover payroll tax
levied on all non-government employees.   Slnce 1982, loan principal pay-
ments, indexed to the National Treasury Bond for monetary correctlon, have
surpassed the FGTS (net of withdrawals) as a source. BNH normally invests
its surplus funds in national treasury bonds, receives interest and mone-
tary correction from those bonds, and has other minor sources of funds such
as foreign loans and sales of land.  Nearly all of BNH's activities are
computerized, and reliable, including its accounting and annual four-year
investment program.   Its financial statements follow generally accepted
accounting principles and are audited annually by external auditors.  Its
investment program requires approval of its Ministry, and the Monetary
Council.
Executing Agencies
1.09       There were three executing agencies, one for each state in the
lending program.  In the state of Bahia, it was Empresa Baiana de Aguas e
Saneamento,  S.A.  (EMBASA);  In  the  state  of  Pernambuco,  Companhia
Pernambucana de Saneamento (COMPESA); and in the state of Ceara, Companhia
de Agua e Esgoto do Ceara (CAGECE).   The three companies were formed in
1974 through merger of water authorities in the state capitals, with those
serving several other municipalities. At appraisal in 1978, the three com-
panies' operations consisted of the following:

All companies were owned primarily by their state governments, had similar
organizational structures, developed by PAHO, and were managed by a six-
member Board of Dlrectors appointed by the state governor for a four-year
period (para. 5.03). Each board member, except the President, is the head
of one of the five functional departments of the company.

staff, although the existing managements were considered satisfactory.,
Production metering was non-existent, and only 31% on average of customer
connections were metered.
1.11      The billing and collection systems were considered satisfactory,
and, partially due to a digorously applied cut-off system for non-payment
of accounts, outstanding receivables represented slightly less than three
months billing. The SWCs' financial statements were prepared in accordance
with BNH's standard chart of accounts. All three were audited by qualified
external auditors.                  I
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin, Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01       Beginning with the first loan to BNH (Kinas Gerais Water Supply
and Sewerage Project - Loan 1009-BR), the Bank's intention was to gradually
develop a basis for sectoral lending. Loan 1656-BR, covering three states,
was the first multi-state loan and was the fourth operation with BNH*6/
The project was first mentioned in a lending program mission during April
1975.  Subsequent Bank missions in July 1977 and November 1977 developed
knowledge of the investment plans of the three SWCs, and worked closely
with BNH in determining the investment components, training programs and
studies to be incorporated in the proposed loan. Appraisal was carried out
in March 1978, and was based upon the degree of sub-project preparation
status at each of the three companies, and their perceived capacity to
implement projects.
2.02      The Bank's primary preoccupation was with the terms of the finan-
cial covenants for the three SWCs.  Brazil had enacted a National Tariff
Law in May 1978, shortly after appraisal, but the regulation of this law
was not published until November 1978, concurrent with loan negotiations.
2.03           Negotiations  took place November  6 through  19,  1978 in
Washington. The Brazilian delegation consisted of representatives of BNH,
the Federal Government and representatives of the three states involved.
The maJlor issue at negotiations was the Bank's insistence on preestablish-
ment of annual rates of return for each SWC while the Brazi'ian delegation
was authorized only to negotiate the contents of the regulations of the
National Tariff Law (published November 16, 1978).  The regulations pro-
vided for gradual achievement of financial viability during the period
1979-83, but without specifying interim target positions.  The Law speci-
fied 1983 as the year in which water and sewerage service revenues were to
fully cover all operating, administrative, commercial and financial costs,
annual revalued depreciation and full debt service. Negotiations were sub-
stantially completed in Washington, except for the specific rate-of-return
issue during November 1978; negotiations were continued in Brazilia during
December 1978.   By January 16, 1979, it was agreed by both parties to
6/ The three previous operations consisted of two loans for water supply
and sewerage projects in the state of Minas Gerais (Loans 1009-BR and
1309-BR) and one for sewage in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area (Loan
1525-BR), two of Brazil's wealthiest states.

include the Bank's annual rate-of-return targets in a side letter for the
years 1979-82, while Incorporating in the Loan Agreement the requirement to
meet the National Tariff Law regulations.
Principal Objectives
2.04       The fundamental objective of the project was to support Govern-
ment activities to promote economic and social development in northeastern
Brazil through provision of infrastructure to increase water services to an
additional 2.3 million people, and sewerage to an additional 1.2 million
people.   Strengthening operational efficiency through planned programs of
production and consumiption metering, and improvement of each SWC's institu'
tional capacity and financial position were other important ob1ectives of
the project for which specific programs were developed. And, an additional
objective was to broaden the base of Bank experience with the Borrower for
eventual development of sectoral lending.
Project Description
2.05      The project consisted of a package of investments for each state,
which contained programs for expansion of water supply and sewerage in each
capital city (or metropolitan region), water supply expansion projects in
about 53 medium and large cities outside the metropolitan area of the capi-
tal, and for implementation of about 240 small community water supply sys-
tems. The investments in the capital cities were considered to be the pri-
ority first phase features of long-term investment programs to either elim-
inate existing rationing or to expand services to large unserved areas of
the capitals, whereas the investment horizon of the other cities, large and
small, was for 10-15 years.
Conditions and Covenants
2.06        The Loan Agreement concentrated on four basic areas:  (a) the
percentage of disbursement from the Loan account available to the Borrower
under the various BNH financing programs that were available to the SWCs;
(b) the methodology to determine SWC compliance with the financial rate-
of-return covenant; (c) the establishment of the level below which BNH
could approve sub-projects (with Bank ex-post review) for disbursement
acceptability; and (d) the establishment of criteria and methodology for
the design, eligibility for Bank loan acceptance and execution of all sub-
projects which was contained in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement.
2.07       In addition to the broad issues mentioned above, the SWCs were
required, by dated covenants, to:  (a) carry out studies of metering poli-
cies and water and sewerage tariffs; (b) prepare and furnish to the Bank
financial recovery plans; (c) correct existing deficiencies in initial
asset registration and implement the BNH uniform chart of accounts; and (d)
take the necessary action to ensure that their internal audit offices were
adequately staffed  and under  competent management.   And,  one company,
EMBASA, was required to carry out alternative technological solutions for
sewage collection and disposal.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01        Loan 1656-BR was approved on January 30, 1979, and was signed
February 8, 1979.  There were no special conditions of effectiveness, and
the loan was declared effective on July 10, 1979, two months later than the
original target date.
3.02      Start-up was delayed for reasons primarily related to BNH's lack
of participation in the project preparation process.  Two specific areas of
contention were the Bank's procurement requirements, and the proliferation
of criteria for sub-project selection and approval which were different for
each of the then existing four loans made to BNH.  Procurement guidelines
had not been issued by BNH since national and state regulations existed,
and differed from the Bank's guidelines, particularly with respect to
international competitive bidding.   BNH did request the SWCs to use the
Bank guidelines, but was either unwilling or unable to enforce full compli-
ance.  The sub-project selection ald approval criteria, Schedule 4 to the
Loan Agreement, was not clearly understood by the SWCs and did not conform
to existing BNH project preparation guidelines which the SWC8 had to follow
in order to get PLANASA financing.
3.03      These primary issues, and other lesser problems, inter alia, BNI
supervision of SWCs under Bank loans, the content and frequency of project
progress reporting, and the level of BNH project approval authority gener-
ated lengthy correspondence between the Bank and BNR.  The basic turning
point in Bank/BNH relationships took place during the 1980 project prepara-
tion of the Multi-State Water Supply and Sewerage I (Loan 1970-BR), in
which BNH fully participated. Subsequently, in April 1981, the first sub-
projects (thirteen) were approved for participation in the Loan 1656-BR,
and in late December 1981, the follorwing major modifications were made to
the Loan Agreement (and to all existing loan agreements with BNH):   (a)
BNH, rather than the Bank, was made responsible for all procurement mon-
itoring; (b) Bank ex-ante review of each sub-project was increased from
US$2.0 million each to US$ 8.0 million each; (c) project selection criteria
was changed from an internal financial rate of return to that of marginal
cost.  The above three events rapidly accelerated sub-project acceptance,
and relieved the Bank of the nearly impossible task of ex-ante procurement
review.
3.04      Several sub-projects for other medium to large cities were modi-
fied to conform to the requlrements of BNH regulations 01/82 and 02/82,
which the Bank had reviewed and accepted.   Regulation 01/82 basically
required the project design to utilize the least-cost solution, and 02/82
essentially provided for uniform economic evaluation using the marginal
cost concept for prioritization of sub-projects. Of particular benefit was
02/82, which effectively reduced project design horizon from the previous
norm of 20 years to 8-10 years, and thus substantially reduced nearly all
first-stage investment costs.



-7-
Implementation Schedule
3.05         At appraisal, implementation schedules were prepared for the
investments anticipated in the three capital cities.  Delays of two years
can be attributed to the start-up delays. The system in Fortaleza was com-
pleted in 1982, rather than in 1980.  In Salvador, the basic systems were
completed with two to three years' delay, except for the new treatment
plant (not financed by the Bank), which is expected to go on line in
January 1987.  In Recife, the replacement of old pipes and network exten-
sion is only expected to be completed by about 1990, a delay mostly
caused by financing problems resulting from the economic crisis during
1982-84.   All remaining sub-prolects  for small  communities  and  cities
outside the capital area were defined for implementation scheduling as
investment packages.   These packages were delayed, on average by 2 to 3
years due to the aforementioned start-up and financial problems.
Procurement
3.06       All procurement for Bank-financed goods and services was handled
directly by the executing agencies.   Bank staff reviewed all procurement
for ICB (ex ante) and LCB (ex poste) through 1981; from 1982 onward, BNH
was made responsible for procurement, and Bank staff review was selectively
ex poste, except when ICB exceeded BNH's authorization limit. As antici-
pated during appraisal, all civil works and equipment contracts were
awarded to local firms, many of which were joint ventures with foreign
firms. Although all three SWCs have foreign firms on their approved list
of interested bidders, none of the three ever received a foreign bid.
Prior to 1982, when BNH took over the Bank's procurement review functions,
some delays occurred due to the time lost submitting documentation for Bank
review. Since 1982, delays due to procurement have been minimal.
Reporting
3.07      The timing, content and quality of progress reporting was a ser-
ious problem until the loan revisions of late 1981.   From 1979 through
1981, the only progress reports were those prepared by Bank supervision
missions.   Various attempts were made to establish the report content by
utilizing elxisting reports prepared by the SWCs for BNH's review; in 1982
agreed formats and frequencies were established, and reporting problems
were substantially reduced.   Annual audit reports, prepared by external
auditors, were received by the Bank for the SWCs and the Borrower.
Project Costs
3.08       Project costs are detailed by SWC in Annex 2, and are summarized
for the total project below:

The only significant difference between appraisal estimates and actual US
dollar costs is the shifting of resources from sewerage to water supply
investments, and is the basic reason why the project actually provided
water supply to 0.5 million more people than estimated at appraisal, and
sewerage service to 0.3 million less than estimated at appraisal.   This
shifting was the result of two interrelated factors.  The first was that
unit construction cost increases greatly exceeded the monetary correction
that the Government applied to its Bonds, and thus to the BNH standard cur-
rency unit, the UPC.  The second was that the project area suffered from
prolonged droughts (1980-83), and severe flooding in 1984, both of which
natural phenomena affected the states' revenues, and thus their capacity to
provide the desired level of counterpart investment funds. And, though of
minor importance (1% of the total project cost) "Supplemental Funding" was
initiated in 1983 as part of the Bank's Special Action Program, and could
not have been foreseen at appraisal.  Thus, there was a continuous reas-
sessment of priorities during the implementation period, and water supply
was deemed the more essential service for available investment funds.
.3.09     The very substantial increase in the actual UPC cost of the proj-
ect of 110% over appraisal estimates is because the monetary correction to
the UPC did not reflect the real inflation in construction costs (para.
4.10).
Financing and Disbursements
3.10        Project financing was hampered by three main constraints, all
related to the severe inflation and financial crisis that occurred during
the project period.   The  first was that although  substantial tariff
increases were granted, the basic 1978 tariffs were very low, and at no
time were the SWCs able to meet their full operating and investment (debt
service) costs. This resulted in the diversion of state capital contribu-
tions, which could have been used for discretionary investments into opera-
tional and debt matters.  Second, the severe economic crisis and unusual
natural occurrences during 1982-84 affected the Borrower and the State Gov-
ernment's capabilities to maintain the earlier investment levels. BNH was
seriously affected by the recession in that its primary source of funds,
the FGTS (rara. 1.08) was reduced and the beneficiaries of FGTS deposits
made heavy withdrawals.   In addition, non-payment of mortgages severely
affected BNH's available funding. The State Government's funding capabili-
ties were also reduced by the recession as well as by drought and flooding
during this same period. And third, in early 1983, the Federal Government
issued Resolution 831 which, amongst other things, put credit expansion
ceilings on state banks.  This credit restriction slowed down new invest-
ment in the sector, since all BNH financing was guaranteed by the state
bank of the recipient SVC. The resolution was lifted in mid-1984, and six
to eight months later when contracting had been reinitiated, investments
were resumed.
3.11       Disbursements under' the loan suffered an overall delay of about
three years from appraisal estimates (Annex 11).   Start-up delays were
partly responsible. In addition, although BNH had continuously requested a
special account (revolving fund), it was not Bank policy to create such
accounts until July 1983 by which date 45% of the loan was disbursed. This
resulted in delays of 8-12 weeks between the time of BNH disbursement to



- 10 -
the SWC, and the Bank's reimbursement to BNH.   Due to rapid devaluation
during rhe waiting period, the dollar reimbursement was always less than
the "dollar equivalent" of BNH's disbursement.7/.
3.12      Due to Brazil's severe economic situation, the Bank initiated its
Special Action program in early 1983, whlch culminated in three positive
actions.   The first was the introduction of the above-mentioned Special
Account.   The second was to increase loan disbursement percentages for a
specified time period, which effectively recovered some of the lost pur-
chasing power of earlier BNH investment funding. And the third was to add
to existing credit lines eligible for loan disbursements and additional BNH
credit lines for supplementing state FAE funds.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.13       Performance by contracto:s and suppliers was satisfactory over-
all. However, immediately followi:g the implementation of BNH resolutions
01/82 and 02/82 (para. 3.06), all sub-projects that had been designed, but
not financed by BNH, had to be redesigned to conform to these new resolu-
tions, which created temporary consternation with consultants.   This was
resolved in short order, and no further difficulties were evident. Rela-
tionships between contractors and the SWCs were professional and satisfac-
tory.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01        Detailed operating data from appraisal forecasts and reported
actuals are contained in Annexes 3, 4 and 5.  The reported actuals are,
except for the number of connections, calculated rather than measured data,
because macro-metering of water production facilities is still to be com-
pleted, consumption metering ranges from 17% in CAGECE to 65% in EMBASA and
all companies bill a "minimum quantity consumed" for unmetered connections,
which forms part of their reported water volume sold.
4.02      Nonetheless, certain conclusions can be drawn from data provided
by the SWCs and BNH. In all three companies, the quantity of water connec-
tions exceed4d the appraisal forecast in 1985 from 6% to 36%, which sup-
ports the earlier conclusion that the project more than met the goal of
increased service to the population.  A second positive note is that the
number of employees per 1,000 connections steadily decreased at CAGECE from
9.7 in 1978 to 5.4 in 1985 (-44%), and at COMPESA from 6.5 in 1978 to 5.5
in 1985 (-15.4X) while increasing at EMBASA only by 1% from 7.3 in 1978 to
7.4 in 1985.   This reduction is particularly important in view of the very
substantial increase in the quantity of new and expanded systems, spread
over a wide geographic area, which were inaugurated during project imple-
mentation.
7/ During Bank FY81, when disbursements initiated, through Bank FY83, when
the Special Account was established, quarterly devaluation ranged from
a low of 8.4% to a high of 65.3%, averaging 21.7% for the period.



- 11 -
4.03        All three companies 4re implementing various segments of BNH's
program of Operational Control, which is designed to improve employee effi-
ciency through training programs, and programs to reduce unaccounted-for
water. Even though production and consumption is not fully metered, opera-
tional data indicates progress in reducIng unaccounted-for water. BNH does
not approve financing for additional water production In any system until
the requesting company has implemented this efficiency program.   BNH has
stated that in some cases the financing requests have been withdrawn due to
the positive results of the program.
Financial Performance
4.04       The Loan Agreement financial covenant, Section 5.07, originally
required specific annual target rates of return to bring the SWCs up to a
level of financial self-sufficiency through operational revenues by 1983.
This covenant was "waived" f,or the year 1980 provided that tariff increases
of up to 45% were adopted by October 1, 1980 (Bank letter dated April 23,
1980), which was more than achieved.  And finally, in 1981, the covenant
was revised with 1980 results as a base.  1981 tariffs were to be adjusted
for 1/3 the difference between 1980-83.   During 1982, tariffs were to be
adjusted by 2/3 of that difference.  The National Tariff Law in 1983 and
thereafter, provided that tariffs were to cover total operating and admin-
istrative costs, depreciation and full debt service.
4.05      Regular and fairly substantial tariff increases were granted dur-
ing all years of project implementation (Annex 12).   In fact, positive
rates-of-return, though not equal to the original side letters, were
achieved in 1980-83 at both COMPESA and EMBASA. During the period 1979-85,
tariff adjustments exceeded inflation as measured by the National Consumer
Price Index.  However, except in the case of CAGECE, the average cost/m3
sold substantially exceeded the average revenue/m3 sold.   The excess is
primarily attributable to two cost elements:   power, about 20% of total
cost, and personnel, about 65% of total cost.  The increase in power costs
reflect the increase in world oil prices whereas the personnel cost
increase results from management's inability to restrict average labor
costs.   At CAGECE,  the  increase  in the average  cost of power/m3 was
slightly less than the average revenue/m3 sold due to the large volume
increase in the Fortaleza system with only a minor increase in power con-
sumption (basically, a gravity system), and combined state and management
pressures kept down the growth in labor costs/m3 sold.
4.06      Clearly, then, the SWCs' financial positions did not comply with
the financial covenants, even when considering the debt assumptions by the
state governments and the debt moratoriums.
4.07       The SWCs did maintain good surveillance over their collections.
All three companies have updated their customer registers, maintained a
strict shut-off program, and, as a result, have no more than 2 1/2 months'
billings outstanding at any year-end, except in the case of EMBASA. EMBASA
has a substantial difference between the receivables carried in their
financial statements, and the lesser amount carried as outstanding in their
Commercial Department collection records, estimated at from 152-25% of
their gross 1985 accounts receivable.  Although the EMBASA situation was
noted in their 1984 and 1985 external audit reports, action had not been
taken to correct this very substantial deficiency.



- 12 -
4.08       BNH also suffered from the effects of inflation during the proj-
ect implementation period. Its standard monetary unit, the UPC, was effec-
tively "devalued" through the application of an index whicb did not reflect
real inflation, as attested to by the reduction in value of US$14.68 at
appraisal to US$5.87 in December 1985.  The first effect was in the fourth
quarter of 1979 when the UPC value became about US$11.00, and the second
was during the first half of 1983 when it was reduced to about US$6.50.
Thus, BNH's "lending capacity' was effectively reduced since construction
costs maintained parity with the US dollar.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The institutional goals with respect to improvements at the SWCs
were generally met, except for the metering programs. As previously noted,
BNH had contracted PAHO to diagnose and recommend necessary improvements to
the organization of each company.  PAHO was instrumental in assisting BNH
in implementing its uniform chart of accounts at the SWCs.   PAHO also
recommended complete revisions to the SWCs' customer registers; and
assisted the SWCs in implementing this revision, although COMPESA only fin-
ished theirs in 1986.  PAHO also provided assistance to the SWC8 in the
conversion of their manual accounting, billing and collection procedures to
computerized systems.
5.02       ABES was instrumental in upgrading the quality of technical and
professional staff through training programs under contract to BNH.  The
SWCs and BNH considered the two Bank-EDI sponsored setinars (1984 and 1986)
on investment planning and project design to have been very useful.  And
last, but not least, the BNH Operational Control Program has been benefi-
cial in assisting the SWCs to improve their efficiency in all operational
areas.
5.03      The major constraint to maintaining continuity in the SWCs is the
practice of changing all operating directors each time that a new state
administration takes office. In some instances, the new directors are com-
pany employees with long experience in their fields.  More often though,
the President and operating directors are political appointees from outside
the company, which often disrupts the continuity of ongoing programs as
well as revising Investment goals.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The internal financial rate of return (IFRR) was calculated for
three capital cities at appraisal, but was not recalculated during comple-
tion because the data required, such as isolating Bank-financed investment
from other ongoing investment programs as well as the allocation of operat-
ing costs and sales volumes between programs, was not readily available.
6.02      Nevertheless, the investments made under the project can be con-
sidered justified on the basis that expansion of service level goals were
exceeded (water) and largely met (sewerage).   The proJect provided water
supply to an additional 3.8 million people in areas where 52% of the



- 13 -
working population earn less than 2 minimum salaries 8/, and 85% earn less
than 3 minimum salaries.   Thus, a substantial portion of the urban and
small community poor can be considered as having had potable water supply
connected to their homes, and the goal of serving an additional 2.3 million
people was surpassed.   In sewerage, the investments achieved 752 of the
appraisal goal by serving an additional 0.9 million people.
6.03        With regard to affordability for the urban poor, the appraisal
report noted that under the National Tariff Lawi the cost of service to the
first level of domestic' users should not exceed 5% of one minimum monthly
salary for water supply, and should not exceed 7% for water and sewerage
combined.   The maximum combined actual charges are substantially less than
the guidelines permit, and the maximum in any given year only reached 59% of
the allowed maximum as shown below:
Tariffs as a % of 1 minimum salary

COMPESA         3.3            2.9           2.4           7.0
EMBASA          3.8            4.1           3.4           7.0
It can be concluded that the charge for water and sewerage services com-
bined is well within the affordable range. All SWCs affirmed that the vast
majority of the people billqd for the minimum quantity, as shown above, pay
regularly with little or no collection problems.
VII.  BANK PERFORMANCE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01       The Bank's goals of helping Brazil to expand water and sewerage
service levels were either surpassed (water) or largely attained (sewer-
age), and did provide social infrastructure in a severely underdeveloped
area of Brazil, which was consistent with the Government's development pri-
orities.    Institutional  improvements  at  the  executing  agencies  were
attained primarily through ongoing Borrower's programs.
7.02      The Borrower's and the executing agencies' relationships with the
Bank were cordial throughout the project implementation period. The loan
was a step towards gaining the full committment and cooperation of the
Borrower. BNH's full committment to Bank loans began with the preparation
of Loan 1970-BR Multi-State Water and Sewerage I when BNH participated in
project preparation and appraisal, and which loan laid the basis for making
all loan covenants uniform in existing loans to BNH.  The uniform condi-
tions, transfer of procurement review responsibility to BNH and the
8/  Using 1980 census data.



- 14 -
increased levels of BNH investment approval were major factors in improving
the BNH/Bank cooperation.
7.03          Another major accomplishment which took place during Loan
1656-BR's implementation period was the change in BNR's instructions to the
executing agencies regatding project design and preparation.   Bank staff
had been Uiscussing the concepts of selecting the least-cost alternative as
the basis for the most economic project design criterion, as well as the
use of the concept of marginal cost in evaluating the prioritization of
projects for an investment program.   These concepts were formulated in
BNH's regulations 01/82 and 02/82, and, in part, result from efforts put
forth in this loan as well as preceding and subsequent loans.  BN1  and the
executing agencies welcomed these joint concepts since they were instru-
mental In reducing the investment costs of individual water supply sub-
projects by shortening the time-horizon of the investment, and served to
reduce political Interference In the investment selection process to a min-
imum.
7.04       Finally, although it is difficult to assess the direct contribu-
tion of this loan, the Bank has subsequently achieved its original desire
of participating in sectoral loans with the Borrower,, and has successfully
transferred to the Borrower substantial responsibilities for loan prepara-
tion, procurement review and supervision of project implementation.
