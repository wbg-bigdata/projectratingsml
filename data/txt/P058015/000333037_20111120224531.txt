                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
This Restructuring Paper seeks approval for the partial cancellation of the project
financing for the Second Agricultural Post-privatization Assistance Project (APPAP II),
cancellation of the Price Risk Management subcomponent from the Agricultural Risk
Management component, and making the corresponding changes to the Performance
Monitoring Framework. It is proposed to cancel a total US$8,474,500 from the
undisbursed balance of US$8,563,515.66 of the US$15,409,275 IBRD loan. The project
is less than three months from its Closing Date of December 31, 2011 and full
disbursement of the original project amount during the remaining period of the project is
deemed unfeasible.



PROJECT STATUS
APPAP II was approved by the Board on December 13, 2004 and became effective on
February 28, 2006. The project’s revised closing date is December 31, 2011 and will not
be affected by this restructuring.

Project’s Development Objective. APPAP-II’s principal objective is to enhance the
access to commercial financial services by farmers and small/medium size rural
enterprises. The project has five components: (i) Rural Financial Advisory Services, (ii)
Agricultural Risk Management, (iii) Rural Outreach by the Mainstream Financial
Institutions, (iv) Rural Micro Finance Development, and (v) Project Management.

The original project amount (excluding contributions from beneficiaries and co-financing
by participating financial institutions) was US$71.4 million of which US$35 million (or
49%) was provided by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), and US$36.4 million (51%) is from the Republic of Kazakhstan (hereinafter
referred to as Borrower). Upon the Government’s request, in October 2010 part of the
loan in amount of US$19,590,725 was cancelled. The cancellation was agreed between
the Bank and the Borrower in view of the slow disbursements, the low likelihood of full
disbursement of the project funds, and the need for the Bank to optimize its loan
portfolio. The PDO was not revised as a result of the partial cancellation. However, to
ensure consistency between the PAD and the Supplemental Letter on Performance
Monitoring Indicators for the two affected components, these indicators were revised,
added or dropped, as necessary.


                                           4
The remaining loan amount of US$15.4 million finances a credit line in the amount of
US$15.0 million and US$0.4 million for microfinance activities. To date, overall
disbursements under the project amount to UZS$6.845 million, including US$6.436
million under Component 3 and US$0.409 million under Component 4.

The project has achieved good results in provision of the technical assistance: (i) under
Component 1, 660 rural financial advisors have been trained and provide services to rural
entrepreneurs; (ii) under Component 3, about 800 staff of the PFIs and other financial
intermediaries have been trained in ‘Investment Lending and Leasing in Agriculture’ and
‘Structured Finance in Agriculture’; and (iii) under Component 4, 300 microfinance
specialists from over 100 MFIs have been trained in various microfinance-related
subjects, and four MFIs have qualified for participation in the implementation of the
microfinance credit line as a result of the TA extended to them.

However, implementation of the credit lines under components 3 and 4 experienced
delays from the beginning of the project implementation due to various factors (as
explained in the previous Restructuring Paper). After the restructuring of the credit line
and partial cancellation in October 2010, disbursement under the credit lines improved
slightly for Component 3. Unfortunately, notwithstanding all the efforts made, the pace
of disbursement fell significantly short of expectations due to the fact that after the
financial crisis of 2008 many interested banks could not meet eligibility criteria for
participation and were excluded. To date, only US$6.44 million have been disbursed
under the credit line through the participating commercial banks. Given the short time
before the project closes, it is not expected that any new disbursements would be made
under the credit line, thus the MOF has requested a cancellation of the entire amount
available for the credit line under the Component 3 of the project.

As for component 4, after providing an advance for the micro-credit line in the amount of
US$409,169.92, there was no demand for the funds, and the full amount was returned to
the special account on December 28, 2010. Ratings for progress with both
implementation and achievement of PDO are Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the credit
lines failure and will remain so until project closure.

Financial Management Status. The project has no significant financial management
issues. The project audit report for 2010 with an unqualified (clean) opinion has been
received. It has been reviewed by the Bank’s FMS and deemed satisfactory.


PROPOSED CHANGES
1)     Partial Cancellation of the Project Funds. It is proposed to cancel US$8,474,500
from category “Sub-loans and lease financing under Part C.2 of the project?, as requested
by the Borrower in the letter, dated September 7, 2011. The Borrower also sent a letter,
dated August 27, 2011 requesting cancellation of US$ 409,169.92 from category “Micro
sub-loans under Part D.2 of the project?. Unfortunately, the cancellation of this amount
cannot be done as the US$409,169.92 refunded by the Borrower to the DA, as mentioned
above, were not refunded to the loan account. The current undisbursed balance under

                                            5
category 2 is US$0.08, which does not allow for processing of the amount requested by
the Borrower.

2)      Dropping of the Price Risk Management subcomponent from the Agricultural
Risk Management component – Amendment to Loan Agreement. Implementing Agency
(Ministry of Agriculture) informed the Bank that, as a result of the Government’s
decision, dealing with commodity price risk management issues has been removed from
the responsibilities of the MOA. Consequently, this subcomponent is proposed to be
cancelled in order to increase the financing for the production risk management sub-
component, importance of which has significantly increased over the last few years. As a
result of this change, the Loan Agreement will need to be amended to delete paragraph
B.2 of Schedule 2. The Agricultural Risk Management component is fully financed from
the government budget, thus does not require a reallocation on the Bank’s side.

3)      Changes to the Indicators of the Three Components Affected by the Partial
Cancellation and Cancellation of the Sub-component. The Borrower suggested
amending project monitoring indicators in its letter dated August 23, 2011. In accordance
with the letter and to reflect the impact of the proposed partial cancellation on the results
and indicators of the three affected components the team prepared a new results
framework and monitoring table attached in the Annex 1 to this Paper. The draft revised
Supplemental Letter on Performance Monitoring Indicators is attached as an Annex to the
Letter to the Borrower on Partial Cancellation and Amendment to the Loan Agreement
and Supplemental Letter No. 2.

However, no revisions are proposed to the Project Development Objective (PDO) as a
result of this restructuring. This cancellation only affects one of the project activities, i.e.,
the credit line. The other project components and activities, which have been
implemented successfully (in particular, the rural finance advisory service, training of
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) in agricultural investment lending, capacity
building of microfinance institutions to design and deliver new financial products for
rural areas, as well as the proposed improvements to the country’s crop insurance
program), have all contributed towards achieving the PDO. In addition, the one PFI –
Eurasian Bank, which has remained qualified under the credit line since 2009 – has
disbursed more than 70 sub-loans to rural borrowers, thus contributing towards enhancing
the access to finance in rural areas.

The final Project Costs table (taking into account consequent cancellation of the co-
financing from the Republican Budget) will look as follows:

Project Development Objective (PDO): APPAP II’s principal objective is to enhance the access to commercial financial services by farmers and small/medium size rural enterprises. APPAP II will
build on APPAP I achievements by: (a) building capacity for viable rural businesses though strengthening and expanding the rural advisory services program; (b) supporting agricultural risk
management initiatives; (c) facilitating the development and implementation of new financial instruments by commercial banks and leasing companies for deepening rural financial outreach; and (d)
supporting sustainable rural micro-finance schemes for providing financial services to rural micro entrepreneurs that are currently excluded from the formal banking sector.
